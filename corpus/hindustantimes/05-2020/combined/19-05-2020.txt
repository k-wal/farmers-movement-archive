19-05-2020||News||The government slipped in not focusing on demand||Now that the details about the release of the Rs 20 lakh crore package are complete, several questions arise. While the government claims this is 10% of the GDP, the exact proportion of the stimulus, the impact of announcements on vulnerable sections of the population and sectors in distress, and whether the package is sufficient to revive the economy, merits critical scrutiny.Broken down, the direct, visible and quantifiable fiscal injection may hover at Rs 4 lakh crore, barely 2% of GDP, if that. The government’s figures accept that 50% of the Rs 20 lakh crore figure amounts to monetary support, including loan facilitation and enhanced incentives to lend.How much will farmers, migrant workers and daily wage workers get in their bank accounts, notwithstanding the food distribution and loan moratorium? What is the nature of fiscal incentives, tax reductions and statutory dues waiver to individuals and enterprises? Can micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) expect an interest waiver to boost revenue?These questions gain relevance because while real fiscal incentives, when given, will ease some burden, it is unlikely that they will alleviate the setbacks in consumption patterns which will take relatively longer to recuperate. The fundamental problem in the economy today is the lack of consumption and demand. People need money to use.The majority of the schemes must, therefore, be linked with direct consumption of goods and services. But the inherent dangers — savings and leakages — must be avoided. All incentives must be employment- and fixed-cost-oriented. Millions of people are expected to be jobless and putting them back to work and supporting them in the interim is critical.For this, we need equitable distribution and verification of the delivery to the intended class . Income-based distribution has to take place by payment of funds into the Jan Dhan accounts. In this, paying progressively higher stimulus to lower income groups is crucial. The Marxian creed “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” is apt at such times.But this has not been done. Instead, the government has come up with a set of measures. Let us examine these. The efficacy of collateral-free loans of up to Rs 3 lakh crore or government guarantees is questionable when it comes to those units which are reeling under debt. They will remain liabilities in the books, liable to be repaid, and can, thus, hardly be termed as part of the fiscal stimulus.The payment of pending wages during the lockdown period is a huge concern. The chancellor of the exchequer in the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak, announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme for workers, which amounted to paying 70% of their wages for about a fourth of workers. Irrespective of the scale, the concept requires urgent implementation in India.Another set of announcements amounts to tweaking old policy or to amending it for the medium or even long-term, by when it may well be too late. All this appears to do nothing for sectoral victims, waiting anxiously for direct injections. This includes airlines, the hospitality sector, and daily wage earners. In contrast, the United States announced a multi-billion dollar package for the airline sector and Singapore did the same for the tourism sector. No corporate tax/income-tax (I-T) holidays or even interest waiver is on the cards here. Reducing tax deducted at source (TDS) by 25% is not even cosmetic, without a corresponding cut in the rates of I-T. The government’s well-intentioned policy of procurement below Rs 200 crore without global tendering, as part of a nationalist self-reliant India, may raise legal eyebrows as being violative of the World Trade Organization norms and may have a deleterious effect in attracting reciprocal foreign direct investment. There can no longer be an indecisiveness regarding the fiscal deficit. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, should be amended to permit a 2% violation and, if necessary, money should be printed for genuine fiscal injections to targeted sectoral victims. These are not normal times and fiscal prudence is not a principle cast in stone. Flexibility and innovation proportionate to the danger are needed. War is not won by stereotyped, textbook responses, and Covid-19 is no less than a war.In India, there is always a huge risk of leakages and misappropriation. Apart from targeted mechanisms such as direct benefit transfer and Aadhaar, special task forces comprising private sector, lawmakers, economists, accountants and investigators must police disbursal through State schemes. The courts will have to remain vigilant, even though as instruments of last resort, beset as they are with inherent delays endemic to the system.Cooperative federalism during pandemic emergencies must be reconfigured. How much support state governments receive in the form of fiscal support, notwithstanding their political affiliations, requires political collaboration and maturity which seems to be lacking at the present time. While everybody realises that all cannot be done at once, taking big, clear and concrete steps in the right direction is the way forward. The government’s motto — sabka saath, sabka vikas — needs to be tied to the former prime minister of Britain, Lloyd George’s famous admonishment: “Don’t be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated. You can’t cross a chasm in two small jumps.”Avishkar Singhvi is an advocate in the Supreme Court.The views expressed are personal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-government-slipped-in-not-focusing-on-demand/story-jjeSaSYmK3M7WDPJCe05jK.html

The directions by the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice S S Shinde were prompted after social activists Sucheta Dalal and Anjali Damania filed public interest litigation through senior advocate Mihir Desai complaining of black marketing and hoarding of N95 masks in the city and state. The N95 masks have been recommended for safeguarding against the coronavirus. The petitioners complained that due to the shortage of the masks, frontline workers involved in combating the spread of the virus were unable to get them and hence hoarding and black marketing of the same should be prevented. The petitioners suggested that a ceiling on the rate of the masks should be introduced to achieve the same. After hearing the submissions the bench directed additional solicitor general Anil Singh to take instructions on whether the centre was planning to introduce a ceiling on the rate of the masks and inform the court of the same and posted the matter for hearing on May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-centre-whether-it-will-introduce-cap-on-rates-of-n95-masks/story-VkAtmxjLh4fCZ3yQVK592I.html

19-05-2020||Mumbai||Reopen offices, private businesses in phases, Pawar tells Maharashtra govt||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar is in favour of reopening the state’s economy and on Tuesday requested chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray to look into the possibility of allowing shops, offices and other private establishments to open in phases in Maharashtra. Pawar has asked the government to take appropriate steps to start road transport services and create policies to attract investment and industries in the state.Pawar made these suggestions at a meeting held between Thackeray and the NCP chief at the former mayoral bungalow at Dadar, allotted for the proposed memorial of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray.Senior ministers of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government also held a meeting to discuss the draft guidelines for lockdown 4.0, following which they were issued.Thackeray has leaned in favour of caution and decided against lifting restrictions in red zones. The state has, however, limited the areas in red zones to cities instead of entire districts.In a series of tweets posted after the meeting, Pawar said, “To bring the economy back on track, lockdown restrictions need to be eased further. Please see how we can allow the functioning of shops, offices, and other private establishments in phases.”In another tweet, he mentioned, “The public transport system is completely stopped in the state. We will have to take steps to start road transport services gradually and also have a time-bound program ready to restore flights and train services.”Pawar further suggested that an action plan should accommodate local unemployed youths in the industrial sector as a large number of migrant workers have returned to their respective states.The former chief minister also advocated for a new policy with incentive schemes to attract more investment and industries. He said that the directives issued by the state government for the operation of industries seem insufficient and suggested that the focus should be on bringing back those workers from Maharashtra and other states who have returned to their villages as it has become difficult for the industries to start their operations. “This has also created an opportunity for the local unemployed youths of the state. An action plan should be made to accommodate them in the industrial sector,” he proposed.The NCP chief also called for discussions with industrialists and experts to increase import-export business and water transport as activities.Pawar said the government needs to build confidence among the people that the situation is improving. For that, he suggested that ministers and officers should start attending their offices on a regular basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reopen-offices-private-businesses-in-phases-pawar-tells-maharashtra-govt/story-6SSIAX5wWOEusgwqAhJIuO.html
19-05-2020||Mumbai||City dentist can resume practice with certain restrictions||The Union health ministry has issued new guidelines that allow dentists in the city to resume their practice with certain restrictions.As per the guidelines, patients in containment zones may seek ambulance services to travel to dental facilities. In red zones, only emergency dental procedures can be performed. Clinics in orange and green zones can provide dental consults. Dental clinics must have good ventilation. Ceiling fans should be avoided. Patients should inform clinics in case of any symptoms of Covid-19. The Centre has also advised dentists to start taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure.Due to the risks involved, over 35,000 dentists Maharashtra had shut their clinics. “We have to look into people’s mouths which is the main source of infection spread. As almost 80% of patients are asymptomatic, we may end up infecting ourselves. The aerosols [clumps of small particles floating in the air] produced during treatment can infect other patients,” said Dr Avinash Joshi, an orthodontist from Bandra.Dr Vivek Pakhmode, dean of Government Dental College, said they have not received the new guidelines. “We are ready to start selective treatment procedures with precautionary measures. Once we get the guidelines, we will start the service,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-dentist-can-resume-practice-with-certain-restrictions/story-FqnpoLh84FPcfnUM10KbKL.html

With the continuing nationwide lockdown, the daily wagers were stranded in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand and were left without any work.The migrants, who were working at construction sites in the neighbouring state, said they left Uttarkashi for their respective home towns on bicycles and reached Moradabad on Monday morning, where they were intercepted by the police.Some of these workers, identified as Ashok, Raman, Rajesh, Rajan Sahani, among others, were sent to a shelter home located in the area by the Moradabad police who found them cycling at 6 am on the highway near zero point in Mundha Pandey.Besides the usual hardships during the journey, they were frequently stopped by police, and some cops at a check-post near Bijnor district reportedly misbehaved with them. “We somehow managed to survive in our workplace. Then left with nothing at all we decided to leave for home on bicycles. We had to pedal for around 380 km and it took us three days to reach Moradabad. We are now totally exhausted and request the authorities to assist us in reaching our homes,” said Rajesh, one of the migrants. Amit Anand, SP city, Moradabad said, “Several migrants were arriving at our district border daily. We are providing them assistance, especially those on foot or bicycles. The migrants are being sent to shelter homes in the nearby areas where they are undergoing screening, and given food. We will ensure that they reach their destinations. For the purpose, UPSRTC buses have also been arranged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/migrant-workers-pedal-380-km-for-three-days-to-reach-moradabad/story-cdhlIcSGPpLB6TCRg321CL.html
19-05-2020||Chandigarh||Partap Bajwa seeks probe into liquor smuggling, revenue loss||Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Tuesday demanded a probe by a central agency into the rampant liquor smuggling and loss of excise revenue in Punjab.In a series of tweets, Bajwa said the liquor mafia was growing in the state and it was time to allow a central agency or a sitting judge who is independent of the government of Punjab to investigate this immediately. The Rajya Sabha MP said the provisional accounts of the state government showed that the excise department missed its revenue targets in the last three years of the Congress government and by a larger amount each year.“These losses must have arisen due to the illegal smuggling of liquor across state boundaries by distilleries to evade excise taxes with the help of dept officials,” he tweeted, referring to cases registered under the Excise Act during the curfew period.The Rajya Sabha MP said the legacy of the Congress government in the state must not be that of failing to rein in the liquor mafia and the government-contractor nexus. “Given that the govt’s own accounts showcase revenue targets being missed, how is it that you have publicly declared that this is not true? Will you please explain to the people of Punjab by what you meant by that statement?” he asked chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/partap-bajwa-seeks-probe-into-liquor-smuggling-revenue-loss/story-sVxJgiCepyqKibBFSOyMfL.html

19-05-2020||Chandigarh||4,000 litre raw liquor seized from Akali leader’s tubewell storehouse in Patiala||Nearly 4,000 litre extra-neutral alcohol (ENA), a raw material used for making liquor, was seized from a storehouse at the tubewell of a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader at Pabri village in Patiala district on Monday night.Darshan Singh, who remained SAD’s block samiti member from 2013 to 2018, was arrested after the recovery, police officials said.Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mandeep Singh Sidhu said, “Acting on a tip off, a police team raided the tubewell storehouse and found neutral ethanol that was kept in 20 drums.”An excise department official was also called to the spot, the SSP said, adding that a case was registered in this regard and an investigation was on. “Of the seized ENA, nearly 7,000 litre liquor can be made. The accused has been in illicit liquor business for the last five years,” an official said.The excise and taxation department has started investigation into pilferage of ENA, which is used by the mafia to make illicit liquor. “We have taken the accused on remand and will probe from where he procured ENA. Directions have been issued to all DSPs and station house officers (SHOs) that they will be held personally liable if anyone was found selling illicit liquor in their area,” said the SSP. Congress MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur said that recovery of raw liquor material shows that SAD leaders are involved in liquor trade in the area. “A bottling plant found by police was also being run by some BJP leaders whom I will expose in the coming days. The role of excise officials should also be probed as liquor is being smuggled on a large scale through the Punjab-Haryana border,” he said. Admitting that sarpanch Amrik Singh, who was booked in the bottling plant case, was close to him, Jalalpur claimed to have no knowledge of his illegal activities. Earlier, the SAD had demanded a probe against local Congress leaders in the bottling plant case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/4-000-litre-raw-liquor-seized-from-akali-leader-s-tubewell-storehouse-in-patiala/story-a1c8JWsVXwvomKwZbMTEbO.html

19-05-2020||Chandigarh||Detail plan on building low-rental houses for the poor: HC to Punjab, Haryana, UT||The high court on Tuesday directed the Punjab, Haryana governments and the Chandigarh administration to give details on their plan to construct low-rental houses for labourers and slum dwellers as part of the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus to help thousands of migrants hit by Covid-19.“The states are bound to provide low-rental housing and food to women and children living in colonies in view of Article 21 of the Constitution that provides for protection and life with dignity to every citizen. Now the states have to take a decision on implementing the Centre’s decision so that crime rate does not increase,” the bench of justice Ritu Bahri said during the resumed hearing of a pending case wherein the court is monitoring social and economic welfare schemes for children and women in the two states and the union territory.The bench underlined that despite the lockdown and restrictive functioning of courts, the matter is being taken up in view of central government’s decision. The details have been sought by May 28.The Chandigarh administration had told the court that that it had 5,500 families living in various ‘kutcha’ colonies in Sector-25, Maloya, Palsora etc.It also informed the court that land for construction of houses has been identified and the file is pending with the Centre.The bench directed the central government’s counsel to apprise it on next date of hearing as to why file is not being cleared, especially in the wake of recent decision. It was pointed out that the cost of land is very high in Chandigarh. The court, however, opined that the cost of the land cannot be made a basis for construction of houses of labourers and slum dwellers keeping in view the present situation. “Now, the UT administration should take a decision on implementing the Centre’s decision,” the bench observed.Besides, the respondents were directed to provide details of the budget sanctioned for the same and how the funds will be used.They were also told to list out the steps taken to provide uniform to safai karamcharis collecting garbage and mid-day meal to women and children in colonies where there is no anganwari. The court also suggested that the states consider buying of vegetables from farmers and distribute the same labourers/slum dwellers by roping in non-governmental organisations (NGOs).The UT administration was also told to apprise the court of the wages paid to these safai karmacharis. It has also to detail the process of giving ration to the labourers in colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/detail-plan-on-building-low-rental-houses-for-the-poor-hc-to-punjab-haryana-ut/story-2V9Y39EhuH1ZIHmxDhE0JK.html
19-05-2020||Chandigarh||Indian Coffee House: Even in Covid times, a story that’s brewing||In the last two months, Covid-19 has totally changed the way we live, work and think. Social distancing has become a new norm, the mask a new accessory. But one thing Covid could not change is the loyal clientele of Sector 17’s iconic Indian Coffee House, who have been devoted fans for more than five decades.With further relaxation in the fourth-phase of lockdown, allowing eateries to open their kitchens for home deliveries or take-away from Tuesday, more than 100 of the café’s old customers strolled over to the Sector 17 market complex to enjoy their hot coffee. The only difference now is that for the first time, since ICH opened in Chandigarh (first in Sector 22 in 1964, later shifted to Sector 17 in April 1970), the brew was served in disposal glasses and for takeaway only. “I visited Indian Coffee House for the first time in 1974 as a teenager, and since then it is an integral part of my life. My friends and I enjoyed our last coffee here on the evening of March 21, and at that time we were the only ones. Since then, we have eagerly awaited the day we would enjoy our cup of coffee again,” says Dr Rajesh Dhir, 59, head of department of ENT at the Sector 16 government hospital.On Tuesday, after almost two months, the regular group of six came together for their round of coffee, he says, adding that three of them got their own cups while the rest took their coffee in disposal glasses.“For the last two months, on account of professional commitments, I have had a hectic schedule, like every other health service personnel, in the battle against the virus. But Indian Coffee House’s coffee has rejuvenated me. It’s (referring to ICH coffee) the only addiction I have,” added Dr Dhir, who is also the president of Indian Medical Association’s Chandigarh chapter. Ramesh Dutt, manager at ICH, Sector 17, is all smiles. “Today more than 100 of our regular customers came for coffee. But in view of the UT’s guidelines, we couldn’t invite our decades old customers inside and had to serve them in disposable cups for takeaway,” says Dutt.Apart from hot coffee, there were orders for other food, too, at ICH. “Our Tuesday sale was about ₹5000, but before lockdown, our average daily sale was around ₹60,000 to ₹70,000. We are hoping for better sales in coming days. Even during this health crisis our customers have shown faith in us, so we have to go out of our way to serve them,” says Dutt.The four-year-old Sector-36 ICH branch also opened on Tuesday for takeaway and most customers ordered coffee, as per Arjun Singh, manager at the branch. Set up in May 1964, the café has hosted top dignitaries such as former prime minister Chandra Shekhar, deputy prime minister Devi Lal and hordes of Bollywood stars. The Indian Coffee House is a one-of-a-kind eatery. It is perhaps the only chain in the country where employees themselves are the employers. After the All India Coffee Board decided to shut down its branches of Coffee Houses across the country in 1957, it retrenched its class four workers.The ‘redundant’ workers, under the guidance of AK Gopalan, then All India Coffee Board Labour Union leader, and Member of Parliament Subhadra Joshi, formed their own co-operative societies which came to be known as ‘Indian Coffee Workers Co-operative Society’. Soon, the co-operative society started its own branches of Indian Coffee House in several states. The first one came into being in Delhi on October 27, 1957, while the Chandigarh branch in Sector 17 opened in May 1964.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/indian-coffee-house-even-in-covid-times-a-story-that-s-brewing/story-YGDZ4g4V56lyWF8MlOMnXP.html

He asked the Badals why were they maintaining a silence when the established marketing system of Punjab and Haryana was being abolished under the slogan of ‘one market and one nation’, allowing private players gaining entry into Punjab’s mandis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/modi-govt-destabilising-agri-sector-in-punjab-says-mann/story-JElkJX5RW1PvVStWoK6eTL.html

The body has been sent for an autopsy.According to the police, the child’s family reported the incident around 1.45pm.“A team rushed to the spot but by then the family had already brought down the body. Around 1.30pm, the boy had been playing in the house while the mother had gone to relieve herself and the father was out. They suspect that he stood on a storage box and threw his scarf around an iron bar jutting out of the roof to create a makeshift swing and accidentally suffocated himself,” Prabhar Dikshit, station house officer, Site 5 police station, said.When the mother came back, she raised an alarm but the boy had died by then, the police said.They don’t suspect any foul play so far. The parents are daily wage earners from Madhya Pradesh.In another incident, a 29-year-old woman allegedly took her own life on Tuesday morning in her home, which is under the jurisdiction of the Phase 3 police.“Her husband is a vegetable vendor who had left the house early in the morning while the woman was home alone with their seven-year-old son. She sent him to a neighbour’s house around 9am. Her husband found her body around 1.30 pm, after which he informed us. She must have taken her life in that time,” Amit Kumar Singh, station house officer, Phase 3 police station, said.He said that the family has denied any financial or emotional trouble and the reason behind her death is still unknown as the police have not recovered a suicide note yet. The body has been sent for an autopsy after which it will be returned to the family.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations.

19-05-2020||City||Haryana: Huge influx of migrants at shelter homes worries authorities||Desperate to reach their native towns, thousands of migrant workers are arriving regularly at the temporary shelter homes set up by the state government at the district headquarters.But the huge influx is giving sleepless nights to the officials responsible to make arrangements of food, shelter, registration and medical examination of the migrants. To ensure that social distancing is practiced at the relief camps, the government has now put schoolteachers on the registration duty.As per figures provided by the state government, around 1.7 lakh migrants have already boarded various buses and ‘Shramik Special’ trains to their home states at the expense of Haryana government. 75,600 migrant labourers have been sent to Uttar Pradesh; 37,866 to Bihar; 19,982 to Madhya Pradesh; 14,940 to Uttarakhand and 1,210 to Jammu and Kashmir. Still, most of the shelter homes in northern districts of Yamunanagar, Karnal, Panipat and Ambala are packed to capacity. “The number of migrant labourers has multiplied in past couple of days and we are finding it difficult to make arrangements for them as hundreds of them are reaching us daily. We have over 4,000 migrants, while 3,500 have already been sent to their home states,” said a government schoolteacher deputed at the community centre in Karnal’s Kambopura.From the industrial city of Panipat, more than 15,000 migrant laborers have been sent back to their native places and thousands are still waiting for their turn. The district administration has at least 1.25 lakh registered migrant labourers.From Yamunanagar, where two incidents of use of force on migrants have been reported since the lockdown came into effect, over 14,028 migrant labourers have already been sent back. The waiting list there is still above 12,000. They have taken shelter at nine relief camps. The local administration has over 60,000 registered migrant workers. On Tuesday, many migrant labourers from Bihar even held a protest and blocked Jagadhri-Paonta Sahib national highway, accusing the authorities of not making efforts to send them back to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-huge-influx-of-migrants-at-shelter-homes-worries-authorities/story-ELsA8dIRDY5znngVpJ49rI.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi Covid count up by 500 in a day, death toll rises by six||A day after crossing 10,000 cases, Delhi reported 500 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections on Tuesday, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. The new cases, the highest single-day spike so far, took the city’s tally to 10,554.Delhi has mirrored the national trend of an acceleration in number of cases over the past two weeks, although the number of deaths remains low, especially when seen in the context of the number of cases. Six deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported in the capital on Tuesday, taking the toll of the viral infection in the city to 166, putting Delhi’s mortality rate (the number of deaths expressed as a percentage of cases) at around 1.6%, much lower than the national average of 3.07%.Delhi has reported an increase in the number of deaths since May 12, when the three-member death audit committee started sifting through a backlog of reported fatalities to confirm whether they had been caused by Covid-19. After a discrepancy was noticed between the number of fatalities reported by city hospitals and the number of deaths in the health bulletin, the chief secretary directed all designated Covid-19 hospitals to send in their death reports each day by 5pm to ensure timely and accurate reporting .Of the 166 deaths that have been recorded so far, at least 52% are patients who are aged 60 years or older. Almost 85% of those who died had some co-morbidity such as diabetes, hypertension, heart or kidney disease.With 500 cases a day, Delhi is now living out the second scenario taken into account by a five-member committee of doctors formed in March for advising the chief minister on Covid-19.The committee suggested measures such as making space for Covid-19 patients in government and private hospitals and taking over hotels and shelter homes to isolate people who test positive; it also suggested how many ventilators the city would need when the tally reaches 100 cases a day, 500 cases a day and 1,000 cases a day.“Delhi is reasonably well prepared for around 1,000 cases a day for about 15 days at a stretch. Even if we assume, that for every 500 cases, 10 - 12 will need ventilators we have enough in the city and the actual numbers are lower,” said Dr SK Sarin, head of the five-member committee.Of the 5,638 people still living with the infection in Delhi, 1,779 with severe symptoms are admitted to designated Covid-19 hospitals. Of these, 158 people are in intensive care units with 16 on ventilators. Currently, Delhi has 306 ventilators in the government sector and another 800 in the private sector. The Delhi government is planning to buy another 500 ventilators.“This (lower number of people on ventilators) shows that the severity of the infection is less. There could be two possible reasons -- the age of people infected and the strain of the virus. If mostly young people in Delhi have been infected, the disease is likely to be less severe. Also, the strain of the virus could be such that it does not cause severe infection. If we talk of Maharashtra and Gujarat where the severity of infection seems to be higher, they might have the same strain of the virus circulating and they are geographically closer too. However, we still do not have the demographic data or enough sequencing data to pinpoint the cause,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-covid-count-up-by-500-in-a-day-death-toll-rises-by-six/story-YRisM5Gf3YcjCxZiAR7hUO.html

A police team had retrieved the unidentified body and sent it for autopsy.No identify card was found with the man suspected to be around 40 years of age. Police officials believe that the body had come floating from some other place. As such, the district, state and national crime records bureaus have been informed in case of any missing person reports.Police officials privy to the case said, according to the procedure, when dealing with an unidentified body, the cremation was carried out 72 hours after the body was found while the autopsy report had come on May 12.“The cause of death was due to drowning. However, there were some injury marks on the head of the man. A consultation was carried out with the doctors, the reports for which came yesterday. Prima facie, it seems that the man may have been murdered and then thrown in the canal. The autopsy also revealed that the body was already decomposing when it was found, suggesting that it had been in the water for at least three to four day before being discovered,” said a police official.Taking suo motu cognisance of the matter, a case of murder (section 302) has been registered at the Bisrakh police station. “We have filed a murder case while efforts are on to identify the man. Due legal action is being taken,” said Harish Chandra, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Zone-2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-s-body-found-in-hindon-canal-cops-suspect-murder/story-gu5LCFeSb8HcoIhgZWGlEP.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Markets warm up to business, few opened on Day 1||Markets reopened in Delhi on Tuesday, more than 50 days after a lockdown imposed in March-end to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Though the lockdown continues till May 31, the Delhi government announced a raft of relaxations on Monday on the back of Union government’s guidelines, marking the second phase of a gradual exit from the restrictions.As per the rules laid out by the AAP government, markets in Delhi will be opened on the odd-even foumula -- even-numbered shops open on even numbered days and odd-numbered shops on odd dates, much like the odd-even road rationing scheme. However, most of the markets remained deserted on Tuesday with only 30%-35% of the odd-numbered shops supposed to open having their shutters up. Brajesh Goyal, national convener, Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI), said, “Only around 30%-35% of the odd-numbered shops opened today. It was the first day and even owners were busy cleaning and disinfecting their shops. Also, customers are not too confident about coming out. Trade will, however, pick up in a few days.”Many shopkeepers were also seen painting circles before their shops to ensure social distancing by prospective customers. Some of them were also marking numbers on their shops since they will now have to follow the odd-even formula. In some markets, there was confusion regarding shop numbers, since two-three establishments exist on one property. While Chandni Chowk main road market had decided to remain shut till May 31, other Old Delhi markets such as Chawri Bazar, shops in bylanes (katras) such as Khari Baoli and cloth market opened on Tuesday. Traders had a meeting with the local SHO to discuss how to mark the shops with the same numbers and exercise social distancing, as the units are too small and are located in narrow alleys. At Lajpat Nagar central market, where at least 40% of the odd-numbered shops had opened, the tehbazari stalls did slightly better than the showrooms with a few customers pouring in.Sanjay Tripathi, who runs one such stall of women’s clothing, said, “We were just setting up the display when the first customer dropped in at around 12.30 pm. People are just buying one or two utility items and nothing more. But at least we are open now and the sales may pick up later,” said Tripathi.With Eid-ul Fitr to be celebrated on May 25, shopkeepers hoped to get more customers in the coming week. Suresh Mehta, the owner of an apparel store in Lajpat Nagar, said they were just cleaning up and shut shop after that, as they did not expect any sales on day one. “Maybe in the coming days with Eid and weddings planned around this time, there could be some sale. But it will take months to return to normal,” said Mehta.Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, traders association Lajpat Nagar, said, “Most of the shops at the market opened only post-lunch for cleaning and setting up things in order and closed by 6pm. Many customers did not know if the markets had opened or not. It will take at least a week for the footfall to increase in the market.”At most markets, only a few shops had thermal guns for screening while the others just depended on hand sanitisers and spray to let customers in.Abha Gupta, who had stepped out to buy clothes and other essentials for her newborn, had to wait outside a shop in Lajpat Nagar, as not more than 2-3 customers were being allowed inside the shops. “We would have avoided coming out at all, but we needed some stuff for our two-month-old. With even e-commerce sites being closed, we had to come out. Nobody is stepping out unless there is an urgent requirement,” said Gupta.Till 3 pm, Rakesh Gupta, a sports store owner at Sarojini Nagar had not had a single customer. “We have been sitting idle. Most of the odd-numbered shops have not opened. The customers were anyways fewer because of the government quarters being demolished for redevelopment and then there is little transport available,” he said. Ashok Randhawa, president of the Sarojini Nagar mini-market association, said that shops in the main market were open while some of those in the mini market and Babu market were asked to shut down by the police and district authorities. “We have decided to remain shut till May 31 now. We had a meeting with the police and officials of the district administration. They said that since the shops are too small and the area is congested, there should not be any encroachment, else the shops will be sealed. We will again have a meeting with them to discuss the measures,” said Randhawa.Traders also said that the government should no longer call this phase as lockdown, as it creates a doubt in the mind of the customers and prevents them from stepping out. Besides, shopowners in Connaught Place said that even as they maintain social distancing and sanitisation norms inside the shops, the police and local authorities must ensure the same in the corridors where a lot of hawkers set up kiosks and are expected to return soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/markets-warm-up-to-business-few-opened-on-day-1/story-ohEZdSUSYTW0yqwN6fpU4N.html

The two had been admitted to the Sharda Hospital since May 16, after a private lab in Gurugram confirmed them positive for the coronavirus disease.The two tested negative after the Gautam Budh Nagar health department tested them later. “I was admitted to the isolation ward, and treatment had started as well. I had no symptoms when I was admitted. My wife, mother and two children were also put under institutional quarantine at the Galgotias hostel in Greater Noida. All of us were under extreme stress after I was found positive. On Tuesday, I was informed that I am negative and was discharged from the hospital. My family was allowed to go back home as well,” said Mahesh, who works as a security supervisor at the Vivo site.“Around 18 of us at the construction site were tested for Covid-19 by our employers. Two of us turned out to be positive as per the reports of a private lab in Gurugram. For over three days, I was in the isolation ward with other positive patients. I hope I didn’t contract any infection from the isolation ward. I will keep myself under home quarantine for 14 days to ensure the safety of my family,” the Dankaur resident said.The district administration is sending a show cause notice to the lab that tested the two. Gautam Budh Nagar officials said the lab isn’t accredited with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“We are going to serve a show cause notice to the Gurugram lab. These people have been discharged after they turned out to be negative. Appropriate action will be initiated against the lab,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.The district also reported three new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking Gautam Budh Nagar’s tally to 289. The patients include a 24-year-old woman and her 33-year-old husband, who works with Zee Media. So far, around 31 persons from the Zee Media office in Sector 16A have tested positive for the disease.A 33-year-old man from Sector 8 also tested positive on Tuesday. At least 55 people have tested Covid-19 positive from the slums of sectors 8, 9, and 10 so far. Currently, over 100 persons from the JJ Colony cluster are under institutional quarantine. A nine-month-old baby was also admitted at the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute in Sector 30, after a private lab test showed the child positive for Covid-19. The health department is waiting for fresh reports before adding the child to the list of Covid-19 patients.Containment zone area revisedThe state government has issued new guidelines for containment zones in the district, reducing the total area of each such zone. As per the new orders, in an urban space, an area of 250 metres, including the respective society, will be sealed if a positive case is reported. An area of 500 metres and a buffer area of 250 metres will be sealed for the containment work from areas where more than one case is reported.In rural areas, the respective area of the village where the case has been reported will be sealed. If more than one case is reported, the entire village and nearby localities will be contained.The health department is in the process of preparing the final list of the containment zones in the district as per the new guidelines. “As per the new guidelines related to the containment zones will bring a lot of areas out of the containment zone category as the area which is sealed has been reduced,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar.Currently, there are 35 containment zones in the district. Officials said they expect the number of such zones to increase, but the overall area covered to be lower, following the new guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-vivo-site-workers-discharged-after-false-positive-report-by-pvt-ggm-lab/story-dE0CXT0mUn0bbofl6NkXYJ.html

19-05-2020||City||Migrants left stranded as Gzb admin shifts registration facilities for special trains outside city limits||Ghaziabad: A day after thousands of migrant workers thronged the Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground to register themselves for Shramik special trains and flouted social distancing norms, the Ghaziabad administration on Tuesday shut down the facility and shifted it to a college campus in Modinagar, which is about 30 kilometres from Ghanta Ghar.Similarly, the Kavi Nagar facility has been shifted to Morta near Delhi-Meerut Road, which is about 10 kilometres away from Kavi Nagar. Now, both the new facilities are outside city limits.The Ghanta Ghar and Kavi Nagar facilities till Monday were used for preparing documentation and medical screening of migrant workers who wanted to board trains bound for cities in Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, respectively. On Tuesday, the migrants who wished to travel to UP cities were found getting their documentation done at Morta, while those trying to board trains to Bihar were required to get formalities completed at Modinagar.“The documentation work for trains to cities in UP is being done at Morta, while that for trains to Bihar is taking place at Modinagar. We are trying to send migrant workers lodged in shelter homes to their home towns on a priority basis. Those having trains today are being taken to Ghaziabad railway station by UP Roadways buses. The migrants who have registered online will also be sent later on,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.On Tuesday, six trains, three each to cities in UP and Bihar, were scheduled to leave from Ghaziabad railway station.As the administration shut the two facilities in the city areas, the police were seen picking up some migrant workers from roads and shifting them to shelter homes by buses and even trucks.The incident of some migrants boarding trucks was witnessed on NH-9 under the jurisdiction of Indirapuram police station area. The station house officer of Indirapuram was recently suspended and explanation of area’s circle officer was sought by the state officials after 16 workers had boarded a vehicle in an unauthorised manner from Indirpauram and the vehicle met accident in Auraiya in which 24 persons were killed. A set of 16 survivors who boarded the vehicle from Ghaziabad told the officials that they had boarded the vehicle in Indirapuram area.“We are keeping a strict watch on movement of migrant workers. They are not allowed to travel afoot or by unsafe transport like trucks. We will get it inquired if migrants were made to board trucks from the highway by the police on Tuesday,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer of Indirapuram.As the train documentation facilities were shifted out of city limits, many migrant workers walking on roads were left with no choice but to walk long distances in scorching heat to reach Morta and Modinagar to get formalities completed to board trains.“We started walking yesterday from Khanpur Japti village in Loni and reached Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground, but cops drove us away. Then we reached Kavi Nagar Ramlila Ground and found it shut. We are a group of about 20 people who are daily wagers and wish to reach Jharkhand or to any city in Bihar where trains can carry us,” said Badru, a native of Godda in Jharkhand.Like Badru, Mamta Devi also arrived at a shelter home near Delhi-Meerut Road from Ghookhna in order to get a train or bus to her home town in Vaishali district of Bihar. “My husband had gone to our home town to take care of our ailing elder daughter. I, along with my two minor daughters, were holed up in Ghaziabad for about two months due to the lockdown. On Tuesday, I finally decided to move out but there is no information about trains or buses,” she said.Pradeep Babu, who works at a factory in Noida’s Sector 8, reached Morta on Tuesday along with his wife, sister and a minor child. But the family had to return empty handed after failing to get boarding passes for any trains travelling to their home town near Hathras.“We started walking on foot and reached Lal Kuan on May 18. The police then sent us to Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground but no train was available. At 10.30pm, we were taken by a bus to Morta shelter home. Tuesday morning we could not find any train or bus, so we moved out and went to Lal Kuan. From there, the police again picked us up and we again arrived back to Morta,” Babu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-left-stranded-as-gzb-admin-shifts-registration-facilities-for-special-trains-outside-city-limits/story-iecLgUyJyrR8sivuqvLIlL.html

The festival of Eid-ul-Fitr is expected to be celebrated on May 25.The community had never faced such a situation during Ramzan in the past but a redeeming feature of the COVID-19 induced lockdown is that it has enabled women members of families to offer prayers at home along with men, BIA Chairman Md Yahia said.He said, “Remember that your wife, daughter, sister can offer prayers along with you. Isn’t that a welcome development?” The BIA chief also urged every Muslim to pray for a coronavirus-free world for mankind.A spokesman of the Nakhoda Masjid, one of the prominent mosques of Kolkata, also said there will not be any gathering for prayer on the day of Eid and everyone has been asked to pray from home together with family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/offer-eid-namaz-at-home-with-family-bengal-imams-body-asks-muslims/story-U3qwVn8uvxxJSfOcno6dlN.html
19-05-2020||Noida||Landlord assaults cops for helping tenant being evicted, arrested||A 40-year-old landlord allegedly assaulted a head constable and a constable on Tuesday afternoon for helping a migrant worker who he was reportedly evicting from his house in Chotpur village, police said. A case has been lodged in the matter and the suspect has been arrested.According to police officers, the Behlolpur police post’s PRV received a call by one Ravindra who said he was being forcibly evicted by his landlord in Chotpur.“After getting the call, two police personnel went to the spot. It seems that the man, who works as a daily wager, was being evicted from his house as he could not pay the rent anymore. He was sharing the accommodation with others who had already left the city a few days ago, and Ravindra was left behind alone,” a police officer said.When the police personnel tried to intervene on Ravindra’s behalf, the landlord, identified as Banwari Lal Gupta, allegedly attacked them with an iron rod. “The rod struck the head constable Brajpal’s hand. When he tried to stop Gupta, the suspect used a knife to attack him slashing his stomach. The constable, Lakshman, tried to hold the suspect but was also attacked by Gupta with the knife in his stomach. The two policemen then managed to hold off Gupta after which they informed the Phase 3 police station,” said deputy commissioner of police (zone 2) Harish Chandra. The police said the suspect was then arrested from the spot while the weapon was also seized. He was booked under sections 333 (voluntarily causes grievous hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 307 (attempt to murder), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of the national disaster management act, epidemic act, and arms act.The injured police personnel were taken to a private hospital where they are said to be stable and out of danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/landlord-assaults-cops-for-helping-tenant-being-evicted-arrested/story-KbtbaO4dpJn6UXLWXiAopK.html
19-05-2020||Noida||Over 150 guest houses closed in GB Nagar during lockdown||Over 150 paying guest(PG) houses in Gautam Budh Nagar have been forced to pull down their shutters amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown announced on March 24 to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). According to an estimate by owners of PG accommodations, closure of these guest houses has led to a loss of ₹100 crore during the period of the lockdown—which has now been extended till May 31.Vishesh Tyagi, president of Noida paying guest houses’ association said that over two lakh people living in these accommodations have left them. “Most of the PG houses don’t have any occupants now. Our problems started right before the Holi vacations started. Students of different colleges and employees working in different companies in the district, who had gone to their home towns didn’t come back again. The remaining lot started packing their bags after the Janta curfew on March 22. Most of them didn’t inform the guest house owners and left their respective abodes quite discreetly,” he said. Tyagi further said most of the paying guest houses are running from rented private buildings. “We are at the receiving end from both sides. The government has issued the orders for not charging rent for the lockdown period, but our landowners have been continuously pressurising us to pay the rents of their buildings even when we are not generating any income right now. This has forced almost 90% of the owners have handed over the paying guest houses to the landlords,” he said.Echoing similar views, Rajeev Kumar, who runs a PG in Sector 62, said most of the students, who accounted for most of the occupants at these accommodations, are not accepting calls anymore. “We are still in dark about whether these students will return or not. And even if they return, how can we force them to live in our guest houses again? We are still paying the electricity bills, internet charges, and salaries of the security personnel. According to an assessment by some of the owners, big and small PGs in Gautam Budh Nagar have suffered a loss of over ₹100 crore during the lockdown period,” he added. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-150-guest-houses-closed-in-gb-nagar-during-lockdown/story-0JDa0fGfSWhsEfDxHawqrN.html
19-05-2020||City||Blame game goes on as Congress- sponsored buses for migrants yet to reach Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: As the political blame game between the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh and the Congress continued over the latter’s proposal to provide 1,000 buses to ferry migrant workers, transport department officials in Ghaziabad said no buses have arrived till late Tuesday evening.Rajiv Tyagi, spokesperson for the All India Congress Committee (AICC), said the buses were parked at Uncha Nagla border near Agra. He said the fleet includes private buses and some from Rajasthan Roadways. “The buses have still not been given clearance to enter UP. The delay is due to laxity of the BJP’s state government and they seem to be worried about Priyanka Gandhi’s (Congress’ general secretary) initiative of sending buses for helping migrant workers. She had been trying to get trains to UP for workers and then she decided to send buses,” Tyagi said.Under the proposal, 500 buses were scheduled to arrive in Ghaziabad and Noida by 5pm on Tuesday. However, the buses did not arrive till Tuesday night. Local Congress leaders who had gathered at Sahibabad depot also waited for hours for the buses to arrive but returned when not a single bus reached Sahibabad. Transport department officials waiting at Sahibabad depot and Indirapuram said they will take some time to check papers of the vehicles and declaring them fit to ply. “There is no information till Tuesday night and our officials waited at Ramlila Ground in Indirapuram and Sahibabad depot of the UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC). We have decided against the bus operations from Kaushambi depot as it may attract a large influx of migrant workers from across the Delhi border. A similar situation had prevailed in the last week of March when thousands of workers had arrived at Anand Vihar,” said RR Soni, regional transport officer.“Once the buses arrive, we will have to check their permits whether they are roadways buses or having All India permits. The guidelines say that there has to be an agreement between two states for plying of vehicles. We will also have to check for fitness, insurance and other documentation before the buses can be sent for operations. Sanitisation of buses can be done at local level by our agencies,” he said.Reacting to the Congress’ allegations, the BJP blamed the Congress for indulging in politics over the issue of migrant workers.“The Congress party has been insensitive towards the migrant workers. When UP government seeks list of buses they take hours and days to send it. When we receive the list, the vehicle numbers are of bike, ambulances, etc. The Congress leaders are just indulging in politics and trying to hide their inaction in the states where they have governments. Help is extended unconditionally,” said Chandra Mohan, spokesperson of the UP BJP.All through the day on Tuesday, both sides exchanged a number of letters over the buses that the Congress proposed to provide in order to send stranded migrant workers home.The Congress had on Saturday requested the state government for permission to run 1000 buses from Ghaziabad and Noida in order to carry stranded migrant workers to their home towns. The state government accepted the Congress’ proposal on Monday and informed the party the same afternoon, asking for a list of buses at the earliest.Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary, in a letter to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi’s private secretary, asked the Congress to provide 500 buses to the district magistrate, Ghaziabad, at Kaushambi and Sahibabad bus stops by 12pm. In addition, provide 500 buses to the district magistrate, Gautam Buddha Nagar, at Expomart. Earlier, the state government had asked the Congress to send all the buses to Lucknow first, to which the party did not agree. The Congress had provide a list of the vehicles through an email to the state government. On Tuesday, UP government spokesman and minister for MSMEs Sidharth Nath Singh accused the Congress of providing a ‘fake’ list to the state government. Singh said preliminary inquiry into the Congress list had shown that the list carried registration numbers of three-wheelers. The Congress, however, denied the charges. “After we sent the list of the UP government, the UP officials late night and asked us to send list of fitness certificates of the buses. We question when they use buses in rallies, no fitness certificate is asked. All this shows that they do not want the buses to come to UP,” Congress spokesperson Tyagi said.Meanwhile additional chief secretary Awasthi on Tuesday said that the UP chief minister has directed for 100% utilisation of UPSRTC buses for ferrying migrant workers.“Apart from UPSRTC buses, the CM has also directed that private buses can also be acquired for ferrying migrant workers. We have no shortage of buses and trains in UP. We have about 656 trains which have come so far and permission for 258 more has been given,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/blame-game-goes-on-as-congress-sponsored-buses-for-migrants-yet-to-reach-ghaziabad/story-ui7vCEkhS2x7nsboPIp1jN.html
19-05-2020||Noida||Factories open, but migrants worker pick seeing family first over work||Eagerly waiting in the queue for his turn to take a seat a bus leaving from Noida’s Botanical Garden to Dadri railway station, Abu Hasan said he forgot the hardships he had endured in the lockdown as soon as he received a text message confirming his seat on a train leaving for Bihar. Hasan is enthralled that he will be able to celebrate Eid with his kids. A resident of Saharsa district in Bihar, Hasan worked at a garment export house in Noida with his friends Sarfaraz and Mujib, also from Saharsa, who are joining him in the trip. Despite resuming operations, the export house could not hold them back and keep them in the city where they lived in a shared rented room.“I am a tailor at an export house that has now started working and our owner had called us a few days ago to resume work, but I going home and celebrating Eid with my family rather than joining work. Lockdown had tested us, starved us, and staying indoors for so long had started to mess with my head, and I really need to see my children. My family had been calling me for days and after my registration was confirmed I just want to go home. I don’t know when will I return,” Abu Hasan said.With little money and access to food thousands of migrants stuck in the city since March 25 when the lockdown started have been longing to go home. Despite the markets reopening and factories resuming operations again, they do not want to give up on the opportunity of being with their families.Balancing a large bag on his head Sarfaraz said, “All my mother wants is for me to come back home. I also don’t want to stay in the city anymore. We have all our lives to earn, but family comes first,” as he showed a text message he received from the UP government portal confirmed his seat in a Bihar bound train.Asked how would does he plan to come back after Eid, Sarfaraz said, “If they will arrange a train like this, then I will return otherwise, I will only return whenever things get normal. I am in no hurry to return here”.Shashi Bhushan Yadav, Brijendra Yadav, and Ram Vilas Yadav, three brothers from East Champaran district in Bihar who worked at a mobile factory in Greater Noida, were among many others who were leaving the city despite factories opening again.“All we want to see now is our home. Our supervisor had called us a few days ago and asked us to return to work, but we prefer to go home. We had stayed indoors for far too long,” said Shashi Bhushan.Anju Kumari, who is also from Champaran, Bihar worked as domestic help in Noida while her husband worked at a food processing factory, had the same story to share.“No one cared for us all during the lockdown.We had to stand in long queues for meals, received no ration nor any support from the people we worked for. My family and I had to endure a lot. Now even after my husband’s factory has opened, I would rather go back home and staying with family for some time at least,” said Anju.According to the experts, while staying indoors for long does affects people emotionally often leading to frustration or restlessness, migrant workers are being affected by more than just that. Experts say that the behaviour of ‘going back to the roots’ is expected from people especially after staying indoors for a long time and being having lost social security.“We have to understand that humans are social animals and the concept of social distancing is not our natural behaviour. We are wired for needing an identity and some social security. People have been locked indoors as they lost their social security, regular food, earnings, savings. So now they are in a state of shock: they came to the cities to work, and yet they had to go through so much. At this time going back home or family, which means going back to the roots is something they need to stay emotionally well,” said Dr Nand Kumar, professor, psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. For the past three days, thousands of migrants from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh have been coming to the Botanical Garden Metro Station from where special buses ferry them to the camps set near Dadri and Dankaur railway stations. After screening at the camps, the migrants board the special trains arranged by the district administration. According to officials, about 84,000 migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh registered on the portal—jansunwai.up.nic.in —alone to go back home.“Between 8.30 am to 11am, over 1,800 migrants had been sent to camps at Dadri and Dankaur, and this will continue till 8.30pm in the night. Total 40 buses are playing the people to the camps,” Pramod Kumar, Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) official, supervising the process said.According to the administration, total of eight Sharmik Special trains left the city on Tuesday.“We are calling each migrant worker a day before the journey to avoid the excessive crowd at stations. Today eight trains were scheduled, three for Uttar Pradesh and five for Bihar,” Rakesh Chauham, district information officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/factories-open-but-migrants-worker-pick-seeing-family-first-over-work/story-4zl1WlDuY2QVjQ6EGGTI3H.html

19-05-2020||City||Lockdown 4.0: Several societies in Ggm start allowing visitors’ entry||Gurugram: After a gap of nearly two months, several resident welfare associations (RWAs) in the city have started permitting entry of visitors to their respective societies and residential colonies. However, visitors will have to go through thermal screening, the RWAs said. The move comes after the state government eased restrictions in the Lockdown 4.0 that came into force from Monday. Ever since the nationwide lockdown was enforced to combat the Covid-19 spread by the Centre on March 25, RWAs across the city had prohibited the entry of visitors. On Tuesday, the RWA of Mapsko Casabella in Sector 82 issued a notice to residents stating that they can allow entry of visitors into the condominium.“Barring entry to the society’s clubhouse, visitors will have similar rights as any other resident. At the entrance to the society, guards will check the temperature of a visitor with the help of thermal scanner machines and subsequently allow them entry if they do not have a high temperature,” said Dharamveer Singh, president of Mapsko Casabella RWA. The RWA of Belvedere Towers in Cyber City since Monday has also permitted entry of visitors albeit on a case-to-case basis depending on the urgency. “There is a checklist before we allow entry of any relative into the society. Residents have to first inform the RWA in advance via email the reason they want their relative to visit them, and also list the duration they will visit them till. The RWA would then check whether the reason cited is genuine or not and subsequently allow them entry,” said Vinod Giri, president of Belvedere Towers RWA.In plotted colonies of DLF Phase 1 and Phase 2, the local RWA has allowed entry of visitors but for a limited time period.“Visitors are not allowed to stay overnight and can visit or stay between 7am-7pm. At all entry and exit points to the two colonies, guards have been provided with thermal scanners. In addition, guards have been directed to ask visitors the reason for their entry into the colony. If only their answers are found to be satisfactory, would they be allowed inside,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of DLF Qutub Enclave RWA. At Sare Homes, a gated society in Sector 92, the RWA has now reserved a separate area just outside the society where residents can meet their relatives for a few hours. “We have an office space located just outside the boundary wall of the society which had been lying idle ever since the lockdown was enforced. We have now allowed residents to meet their relatives there. It is a covered space with cabins and a hall which will be disinfected after visitors leave the area. Prior to allowing a visitor, we will check all safety measures such as recording their temperature, ensuring their hands are sanitised and that they are wearing mask,” said Praveen Malik, president of Sare Homes RWA.The district administration said that the RWAs can allow visitors’ entry if they want. VS Kundu, additional chief secretary and nodal officer for Covid-19 preparations in Gurugram, said, “Visitors are allowed, but it’s up to the society to make a standard operating procedure (SOP) for thermal scanning or allowing people who are asymptomatic. From the government’s side, there is no bar on personal visits. However, large social gatherings and events cannot be organised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-4-0-several-societies-in-ggm-start-allowing-visitors-entry/story-QPveAu9OZFtT8Ka3BI1XxO.html
19-05-2020||City||First train to north-east from Haryana to leave this week||Gurugram: The Haryana government is arranging the first shramik special train to ferry migrants to Guwahati in Assam later this week. The train is scheduled to leave Gurugram railway station between May 22 and May 24, according to officials aware of the matter.Dalbir Duggal, nodal officer for the repatriation of migrants to the north-east, said, “The date of the train is still tentative. We urge those seeking to travel on this train to register on Haryana’s online portal for migrants. We will arrange special buses to bring migrants from other districts to Gurugram, where they will be screened for symptoms of Covid-19 before being allowed to board the train.” Punung Kipa, an Assamese migrant who has been stuck in Gurugram since the lockdown began in late March, said many like him were hoping to catch the train to Guwahati this week. “There are hundreds of us from the north-east who have been waiting for a way back. We initially tried to walk to Delhi, but the border has been shut so we are stuck here. We want to go back home,” Kipa said.Multiple migrants from northeastern states other than Assam also said they will be attempting to make the journey via the special train later this week. Guyjom Ingo, from Arunachal Pradesh, said, “We will go to Guwahati and then see what arrangements are being made for further travel. It will do even if we are able to get a train to West Bengal. We just want to get close to home.”Between May 21 and May 26, 38 special trains are expected to leave Haryana for Assam, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar. According to information shared by the Directorate of Information and Public Relations, over 188,000 migrants have been transported to their home states via special trains and buses, as of May 19 morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/first-train-to-north-east-from-haryana-to-leave-this-week/story-ac3C7fwnVENeicyORyx9hO.html
19-05-2020||Gurugram||Containment zone perimeter reduced to one kilometre||The district health department, along with the district administration, has decided to reduce the perimeter of containment zones to 1 kilometre from 3 kilometres. A containment one includes lanes where cases have been reported. Gurugram district currently has 37 containment zones.Dr MP Singh, the nodal officer for containment zones, said, “Marking a 3km radius from the epicentre of the infection as a containment zone and a 7km radius as the buffer zone in different areas would cover half the city as the number of containment zones are increasing, following the surge in cases. Therefore, we have decided that the perimeter of the containment zone will be reduced to 1km for proper surveillance and to keep a check on people’s movement.”The administration can define the boundary of a containment zone, as per the guidelines issued by the union ministry of home affairs while imposing lockdown norms. Also, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday said that except containment zones, the remaining areas will be classified as orange zones where activities will resume. “The boundary of the containment zone in a residential area could be a mohalla or any lane in a congested area where a case has been reported. It makes contact tracing, testing people with Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) easier. Even house-to-house surveillance becomes specific,” Singh said.In containment zones within red and orange zones, maximum precautions are required including strict perimeter control, to ensure that there is no movement of population in or out of these zones except for medical emergencies or supply of essential goods and services. However, as reported by HT earlier this week, there has been a lack of vigilance in the containment zones. As per the health department guidelines, until now, a containment zone covered a radius of 3km and the adjoining buffer zone covered a radius of 7m from the epicentre of the case(s). However, health officials now say that defining the perimeter of a containment zone will depend on the risk assessment of the area. It can be revised.NEW COVID-19 CASESThe district health department on Tuesday confirmed nine Covid-19 cases have been reported from the city. Three persons from Sector 10A, two from Ravi Nagar and one each from Daulatabad, Sirhaul, Palam Vihar and Shivaji Park. The number of infected persons has reached 220, of which 118 have been discharged while 102 are admitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/containment-zone-perimeter-reduced-to-one-kilometre/story-OOHApTbt5bIE0RU5mqhpOO.html

19-05-2020||Gurugram||Haryana Roadways seeks to restart 12 interstate routes, five of them from Gurugram||The Haryana government has written to the transport departments of at least six states and two union territories, seeking their consent to start interstate bus services on 12 select routes. Five of these routes will begin in Gurugram while one will begin in Faridabad, according to official communications seen by Hindustan Times. From Gurugram, routes to Aligarh and Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, Jaipur in Rajasthan and Chandigarh, are set to become operational as soon as a go-ahead is received from the recipient states. Similarly, one route from Faridabad to Aligarh is also slated to resume. Anu Sheokhand, Haryana Roadways’ general manager in Gurugram, said, “Gurugram is one of Haryana’s busiest transit hubs; its passenger volume is almost the same as Sonepat, which is the busiest hub in the state. I cannot comment on why certain routes have been chosen, but Gurugram is a strategic location as far as interstate travel is concerned, given its proximity to arterial highways and state borders.”However, a senior official of the Haryana Roadways, based in Gurugram, said, “As per the MHA order, the mutual consent of states is required for interstate travel. We want to start buses from Gurugram to MP, UP and Rajasthan as we receive a lot of migrants from these areas. The availability of commercial buses will help them to either leave the state or come back to work, with industries being allowed to start operations again.”The official, seeking anonymity, stated that these commercial buses would accept only online bookings, to ensure social distancing between conductors and passengers. “The frequency of the buses will also be low. Just one or two buses per day, with early departure. Passengers will be thermal screened multiple times on the journey, particularly at state borders,” the official said, adding that all passengers would need to secure e-passes for interstate travel to avail the bus service. This move, to resume bus travel to various states, comes on the heels of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s announcement on Monday that interstate bus travel to and from Haryana will resume soon. A letter to this effect was written by the principal secretary (transport), Haryana, to the governments of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, UP, MP, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Chandigarh on Monday.The other routes which have been slated for resumption include Delhi-Panchkula, Ambala-Shimla, Ambala-Dehradun, Hisar-Ajmer, Panipat-Bareilly, and Karnal-Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-roadways-seeks-to-restart-12-interstate-routes-five-of-them-from-gurugram/story-g3RNZxtQApSQpfTvPPbOfK.html

19-05-2020||Delhi||Two cops impart lessons to five children in Greater Kailash||Five children aged between three and nine years in south Delhi’s Greater Kailash, who, during the initial days of the lockdown, didn’t even have access to food, are now able to count, recite rhymes and draw pictures, thanks to two police personnel who took it upon themselves to impart lessons to them every evening for six weeks. Overcoming their initial reluctance to the initiative, the parents of the children also attended a few classes and have gained competence in counting numbers, said Atul Kumar Thakur, the deputy commissioner of police (south). A desperate situation brought the children and their parents in contact with the police. “On April 10, we received a call from a family that did not have food to eat. When head constable Tara Chand and constable Neelam Toppo visited them with food, they found two families, with five children in all, facing difficulties,” Thakur said. One of the couples, with two sons aged six and five years, used to work as labourers, while the other family, with three daughters aged between three and nine years, were dependent on a sole breadwinner, who worked as a gardener. “While eating the food we had brought, one of the girls kept asking when schools would reopen. They seemed like they were missing school, so I asked if they wanted to study during the lockdown,” said constable Toppo. While the gardener’s two daughters had been attending school prior to the lockdown, his three-year-old girl was yet to be enrolled. The labourers’ two sons, meanwhile, had never been enrolled in schools. The two police personnel decided to hold hour-long classes for them every day. “I have a seven-year-old son and a daughter, who is a toddler. I knew exactly what these children needed to be taught,” said Toppo. Toppo and Chand used an open space near their huts, set up on the premises of an old building, for the classes. “The nine-year-old girl needed a separate curriculum since she was already attending school. The others were put together and taught basic subjects,” said head constable Chand. One of the children, Gudiya, said that she learnt alphabets, rhymes, tables, names of body parts and numbers in the last six weeks. “I can recite Ba Ba Black Sheep and Twinkle Twinkle little star, but I like colourit and sketching the most,” said Gudiya.When the senior police officers at the police station and the district got to know of the initiative, they arranged the necessary stationery items for the classes. “When we interacted with their parents, we got to know that one of them didn’t even know how to count. Even to use their phones, they would seek others’ help. We convinced them to attend the classes on numbers,” said Chand. The two officials said they are hopeful that the parents would benefit from having learnt to count. “Last Thursday, I got to know that the two boys and their parents left in a truck for their home in Jhansi. I hope our classes have made them better equipped to deal with this difficult time,” said Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-cops-impart-lessons-to-five-children-in-greater-kailash/story-C64ueRpzQQyXQufH7a10pL.html

The police have also recovered a motorcycle and the weapons used in the crime.While police have not revealed details of the other three persons arrested, investigators said Rajinder had hired contract killers for Rs 50,000 to murder Girish and his father Joginderpal Manocha, 60.“Four men have been arrested. Several things remain to be verified. Further details will be disclosed after proper verification,” said Gurbinder Singh, assistant commissioner of police (ACP, North).Armed assailants had shot at the father-son duo at their house in Janta Colony on Rahon Road on May 13.While Girish succumbed after a bullet went through his back and pierced the heart, his father suffered two bullet injuries, one in the neck and another in the shoulder. He remains admitted at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, but is stated to be stable.Monetary dispute between the families seemed to have led to the crime, said a police official, privy to the investigation. There was a dispute of Rs 36 lakh between the two brothers. Joginderpal had already given a house in Chhawni Mohalla and a car to his brother Rajinder to settle the matter, the official added.A case under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act was registered following the attack at the Basti Jodhewal police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-held-for-shooting-mobile-shop-owner-dead-in-ludhiana/story-IHzlQ3So6RGiZSMSjhyyxL.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Man impersonating cop addresses senior incorrectly, gets caught||‘Janab’, ‘Saheb’ or ‘Sahib’—Delhi Police personnel commonly address their superiors thus. But when a 42-year-old man, who claimed to be a constable in the police force, instead addressed an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) as ‘Babuji’ while asking him to remove the barricades in his vehicle’s way, the officer was immediately suspicious.The man turned out to be an impersonator when the officer checked his ID card and found that even after apparently serving for almost 29 years, the cardholder was still a constable. Also, the man did not appear to be old enough to be a veteran on the force. As the officer and three other policemen questioned him—what was his belt number? the reason his promotion was delayed? could he recite some policing codes?—the man surrendered and confessed to impersonating a constable, a senior police officer said.“We arrested the man, one Virender Kumar from Haryana’s Rohtak, and booked him for impersonation, cheating and fraud. We seized the fake police ID card too,” deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra said.DCP Mishra said that Kumar was caught at Nizampur-Bamnoli border police post in outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala around 2am on Friday, when the Santro car he was travelling in with another man was stopped for checking.As the four police personnel stopped the car, the man on the front passenger’s seat identified himself as Constable Virender Kumar and directed them to remove the barricades, saying he was chasing a vehicle some criminals were fleeing in. He showed them his police ID card and constantly addressed the ASI as “Babuji”.“The policemen became suspicious as ‘Babuji’ wasn’t the word they used to address senior officers. They checked his ID card and found that the personnel identification system (PIS) number mentioned on it actually belonged to an assistant sub-inspector posted in the police control room unit,” a police officer privy to the incident said.They arrested the impersonator and, during the interrogation, he revealed that he had been using the fake police ID card for the past six-seven months to get smooth passage at border checkpoints. “We are trying to find out if he used the fake ID card for any illegal activities,” the officer said.The police said the man driving the Santro car told them that Kumar wanted to go on a long drive during the lockdown. Kumar had asked him to drive him to Delhi in his car, saying his police ID card would help him cross the border without being stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-impersonating-cop-addresses-senior-incorrectly-gets-caught/story-g5goBqUygqPw87yMJN9ewO.html

19-05-2020||Delhi||HC asks for police response on Shahrukh Pathan’s bail plea||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought the response of the city police on a plea by Shahrukh Pathan, one of the persons accused in the north-east Delhi riots case who had brandished a gun at a police constable, after he moved the court seeking bail.Justice Prateek Jalan directed the Investigating Officer (IO) to file a status report on the plea by Pathan, wherein he sought interim bail from the court to look after his ailing father in Uttar Pradesh. Twenty-three-year-old Pathan was arrested on March 3 from UP’s Shamli district.The court also asked the IO to verify all the medical reports of the Pathan’s father after his counsel, Asghar Khan, contended that he needed to be with his father as he would be undergoing knee surgery. Pathan had moved the High Court challenging a decision of the trial court, which denied him bail on May 9.The trial court, while dismissing the plea, had stated that the fundamental right to protest against the government policies could not extend to disturbing public order. The court had also noted that in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, no surgeries, except essential surgeries, are being conducted.The city police had registered a case against Pathan under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act. According to the FIR, on February 24, several people gathered illegally and raised slogans against the Anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The alleged members of the unlawful assembly had bottles, pistols and stones.In the meanwhile, Pathan fired 3-4 shots at the people around. The complainant, head constable Deepak Dahiya, requested him (Pathan) not to fire. However, Pathan fired at the head of the constable with the intention to kill. The constable ducked and saved himself. When he tried to stop Pathan, he again fired into the crowd, the complaint stated.The Delhi Police had filed the first charge sheet over the February rioting in north-east Delhi, naming three men including Pathan, the man who was pictured pointing a pistol at a policeman in the Maujpur neighbourhood.The 350-page charge sheet was filed in the Karkardooma court against Pathan, and two others who were arrested by the crime branch’s Narcotics Cell, a senior police officer said, adding that the three remain in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-asks-for-police-response-on-shahrukh-pathan-s-bail-plea/story-qyc5rNsa5FGRJUH6T6g5lN.html

19-05-2020||Delhi||Jail authorities refute prisoner’s phone smuggling allegations in viral clip||A video clip of a prisoner in Tihar jail accusing officials of smuggling cellphones has been widely circulated on social media platforms. The jail administration Tuesday refuted the allegations and said that the prisoner was being questioned after his link to a recent case of phone smuggling within the prison came to light earlier this month. Though Hindustan Times could not independently verify the authenticity of the video, jail officers identified the man in the video as that of their prisoner, currently lodged in Jail Number 1. In the four-minute-long video, the prisoner is seen with three cellphones. He accuses jail officials of being involved in smuggling phones within the prison. He requests people to share the video widely so that he is not punished or killed inside the prison. It is unclear who first uploaded the video to social media. Jail officials suspect the prisoner must have sent the video through WhatsApp to his friends so it could be circulated widely on social media. Refuting the allegations of phone smuggling, the prison’s director-general Sandeep Goel said, “He recorded this video to pressurise jail staff and to serve his vested interests. We will take action against him for this (using cellphones inside the prison).”Using a cellphone is prohibited inside a prison. All prisoners have the option of using the prison’s landline phone to talk to their relatives or friends. The officer said that the prisoner, as he claims in the video, is indeed an inmate of Jail 1. “He is a habitual criminal with cases of robbery and other offences against him. He has been in and out of jail several times. Some time ago, an alert member of the jail staff had foiled an attempt of some persons to smuggle phones into jail by throwing them over the wall. The CCTV camera footage had revealed that this prisoner was involved. We are taking action as per the jail manual against him.”Jail officers also said that the allegations against them were baseless and that during a search, they found one phone in his possession. “We are trying to recover the other phones too,” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jail-authorities-refute-prisoner-s-phone-smuggling-allegations-in-viral-clip/story-uMsjN86nizXS08ZcROvH6K.html

A case of causing hurt and criminal intimidation was registered against the man at the Hauz Khas police station, the DCP said. “We arrested the builder,” the officer said. Deepak, the woman’s husband, said the builder was forcing them to go back home for the last few days. “He did not clear our dues of April. We thought we should leave and we booked a ticket on a Shramik train to Bihar. Today (Tuesday) police took us to a screening centre in Chhattarpur where we got to know the train will drop us at a place 400 km away from our home. We requested the police not to send us on that train. They dropped us back to the construction site by afternoon,” he said.The woman alleged a payment of Rs 9,500 was pending with the builder, police said. Deepak said when the builder got to know they were back, he threatened them. “My wife was sleeping. He kicked and abused her. He got a brick to attack her. We told him we will leave in the next few days in a a train for Punia. He did not listen,” he said.Manohar Batra, the builder, denied the allegations. Speaking on the phone from the police station, he said, “I did not assault or kick anyone. I had helped the family throughout the lockdown. I had given them Rs 15,000 on Monday and asked them to leave for their village. They promised they will leave. Today they went to the screening centre and came back to the construction site. Because of this, my other labourers refused to work, fearing their safety. The workers were scared because the family could have got infected the coronavirus there,” he said.Batra said, “The family used to pick up a fight with every other person at the site. We offered them to shift to our another site in Kotla but they refused. They are being misguided by some people in the neighbourhood,” he said.Sonali Vaid, a public health expert who had tweeted about the incident, said the family had informed her. “I got in touch with the family since they live in the neighbourhood. The builder was harassing them during the lockdown by not paying their dues. And today this happened.

19-05-2020||Lucknow||UP will pay for train travel of its migrant workers: Yogi to states||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked various state governments not to charge any money from UP migrant workers for their train travels to UP. “UP government would bring them home and will bear the cost of their train travels,” he said and asked the officers concerned to arrange trains from all the states from where UP migrants wish to return. Given the numerous road accidents involving vehicles carrying migrant workers, Yogi said, “Police and transport department must coordinate well between themselves to curb the accidents.”The chief minister said this on Tuesday at the daily lockdown review meeting with the Covid-19 containment team--the Team-11. Yogi at the meeting said so far the state government had fetched 16 lakh migrant workers back to the state. A total of 8.52 lakh migrant workers have come on 656 special trains from different states. “In next two days, 258 more special trains--the Shramik Express--will arrive with migrant workers from other states taking the total number of Shramik Express to UP to 914. And the state roadways have readied 12,000 buses for dropping the migrant workers to their home districts. Apart from these, 200 buses have been kept on standby by each district administration in the state that is 15,000 buses are on standby. So far as many as 16 lakh migrant workers have returned to UP safely.”He instructed the officials to follow proper protocol with migrant workers’ health screening, testing of those with symptoms, quarantine and home quarantine. He also asked for installation of CCTV cameras at quarantine centres and community kitchens. “Also arrange pulse oxymeters at the quarantine centres to check the level of oxygen in the blood,” he said. For jobs for migrant workers, Yogi asked the officers concerned to increase the number of MNREGS (rural employment scheme) projects. The chief minister said that each district would have at least one Covid-19 testing lab and said that only ICMR approved labs would do Covid-19 tests and action should be taken against any such lab that is found doing Covid-19 testing without ICMR approval.The state medical health minister Suresh Khanna, the state health minister Jai Pratap Singh, the minister of state for health Atul Garg and all the officers concerned in Team-11 were present at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-will-pay-for-train-travel-of-its-migrant-workers-yogi-to-states/story-JyAOfMbc8yoYBIUar0cu3K.html

19-05-2020||City||Overburdened Kalwa hospital medical staff demand transport facility||The nursing and medical staff of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa, Thane, stopped work for half an hour on Tuesday, demanding rescheduling of duty timings and providing transport to those nurses who come from far. The hospital, a major civic-run hospital in the city, is grappling with staff shortage, overburdened employees and lack of facilities.On Tuesday, around 50 nurses and medical staff cornered the dean of the hospital, claiming that favourable treatment is meted to some staffers while others are made to work for 12 to 15 hours wearing PPE kits. The dean, Pratibha Sawant, who has joined recently, was unavailable for comment despite repeated efforts to contact her.A nurse, who is working in the hospital for over two decades, said, “The nurses come from Ambernath, Vangani, Badlapur, Asangaon, Kalyan-Dombivli and Thane. When the pandemic started, our seniors decided that the nurses from Kalyan Dombivli and beyond will be given only morning duty. Those from Thane and nearby areas will get afternoon and night duty. However, those nurses coming from other cities do not have transport facility and reach work late. Most nurses on night shift have to work for more hours.”She said there is no bus provision for nurses from the city. “Last week, I was on afternoon duty and the nurse on night duty had not arrived so my senior asked me to do double duty. It is not easy to work for 20 hours wearing PPE suit. Most of us are overworked. Those, who test positive for Covid, are not given proper medical aid. We are not guided about changes in government guidelines,” she added.Another nurse said transport service and equal division of work are their main demands. “There is lot of favouritism in allotting duties. All nurses should be given the same amount of work. TMC is ready to provide facilities but the hospital management should communicate properly with them.”An official from the health department said, “The dean held a meeting with the nurses and the officials. We have provided them bus service and have asked them for the schedule of each shift so we can operate the buses accordingly. The issue of shift schedule will also be resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/overburdened-kalwa-hospital-medical-staff-demand-transport-facility/story-WCBFRqXgmjv3TN5rVZpENN.html

19-05-2020||Lucknow||Autorickshaw, car numbers in Congress list of buses for migrants, says UP govt; party protests||The Uttar Pradesh government Tuesday said the list of 1,000 buses offered by the Congress to ferry migrant workers contained registration numbers of autorickshaws and cars, triggering a protest by the opposition party at the state’s border. The Congress rejected the UP government claim, challenging it to conduct a “physical verification” of the buses. The state government said 297 of the buses on the list lacked either a fitness certificate or valid insurance papers. As the war of words escalated, UP Congress Chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and other party workers reached the Agra border, where they argued with policemen and staged a dharna. Lallu was seen being carried away from the protest site to a car, with four policemen holding his arms and legs. A UP Congress spokesperson said he was taken to a police station in Agra. According to the Congress, most of its buses are massed at the Rajasthan-Uttar Pradesh border, awaiting permission to cross over into the state’s Agra district. In a tweet in the evening, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi urged the Yogi Adityanath government should at least let the 879 buses “found fit” by it to enter the state. “UP government has crossed the limit,” she said, accusing it of creating hurdles in an effort to help migrant workers stranded due to the coronavirus lockdown. She said if the Yogi Adityanath government wishes it can put “BJP banners” on the buses. Former Congress MP Pramod Tiwari also threatened to sue the UP government for defamation. Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad accused the Congress of running a “bus scam”. “The Congress has got trapped in its own net of deceit,” he tweeted in Hindi. The row erupted on May 16 when Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra offered to provide 1,000 buses for migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh, stranded in other states because of the coronavirus lockdown. The Congress initially claimed that the state’s BJP government was ignoring the offer with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath refusing even to give an appointment to a party delegation. Even while accusing the Congress of playing politics over the plight of migrant workers, the UP government on Monday formally accepted the offer. It asked the Congress to submit a list of the buses and their drivers and conductors. In an email received by Priyanka Gandhi’s private secretary at 11.40 pm Monday, the Uttar Pradesh government asked the opposition party to send the buses to Lucknow by 10 am on Tuesday. The aide wrote back to the UP government, saying that sending empty buses to Lucknow was “inhuman” and the “product of an anti-poor mindset” when thousands of workers are gathered at UP’s borders. UP’s Additional Chief Secretary (Home & Information) Awanish Awasthi then responded to the Congress letter, agreeing to take charge of the buses at the Delhi-UP border itself. He suggested that 500 buses should be stationed at the Kaushambi and Sahibabad bus stands in Ghaziabad, just across the border from Delhi. The remaining 500 should be sent to Noida. Awasthi said directions have been issued to the Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar district magistrates to make use of the buses immediately after checking the permits, fitness, insurance and driving licences of the crew. But the row reignited hours later when the UP government said the Congress list of 1,000 buses contained registration number of other vehicles. “In the list of buses provided by the Congress, there are motorcycles, three-wheelers, an ambulance and private cars,” said Mrityunjay Kumar, media advisor to the chief minister, listing out the registration numbers. UP Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh challenged the claim. “There are 1,000 buses. If the UP Government has any doubts about them, they can conduct a physical verification of the vehicles at the state’s border,” he said. In another letter in the afternoon, Priyanka Gandhi’s private secretary said the buses cannot be brought to Noida and Ghaziabad as the government has not given permission for them to enter Uttar Pradesh from Rajasthan. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya compared the episode “scams” during the Congress terms at the centre. “The ‘bus ghotaala’ (bus scam) now is the latest addition to the Bofors, 2G, Coalgate and Commonwealth Games,” he tweeted in Hindi. “The Congress is making fun of labourers by providing details of autorickshaws and motorcycles in the name of buses. Misleading people by telling lies is in the DNA of the Congress party,” he said. Another deputy chief minister, Dinesh Sharma, accused the Congress of using migrant workers as “pawns”. He asked why the Congress couldn’t send the buses through the government in Rajasthan, where it is in power. “The Congress is trying to malign the image of the UP government, and it must rectify its behavior,” he said. In Delhi, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused the chief minister of being insensitive. “Kindly put a stop on cheap politics and not be insensitive and inhumane towards the plight of migrants. Kindly allow buses to ply migrants home and help them instead of embroiling them in cheap and petty politics,” Surjewala told reporters through a video conference. Another spokesperson Surpriya Shrinate alleged that regional transport officers (RTOs) are now threatening owners of the buses made available for the Congress exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/autorickshaw-car-numbers-in-congress-list-of-buses-for-migrants-says-up-govt-party-protests/story-TJZQwaqBE8Yjc6DID2cneN.html

They had fled Pakistan during the Partition from Sialkot and settled in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts.Valmiki community leader Gharu Bhatti said the new domicile law has brought an end to their slavery by the successive Kashmir-centric regimes.“We were brought here in 1957 from Gurdaspur and Amritsar on the assurance of the then Prime Minister of J&K Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed that we would be given permanent resident status and other privileges. But for 62 years, we worked as sweepers, irrespective of our educational qualifications,” said Bhatti.Eklavya, another Valmiki community member, who has done a master’s course in political science and does menial jobs, hoped for a new dawn of equality and level playing field to all.“Now, children of our community can become public servants and get other government jobs. For 62 years, we worked as sweepers in municipal committees, but now the worst kind of slavery has come to an end,” he added.Terming the amendments in the domicile law as a red letter day for the internally displaced Kashmiri Pandit (KP) community, All Parties Migrants Coordination Committee (APMCC) expressed immense pleasure and thanked PM Modi, the home minister, J&K Lieutenant Governor and all those associated with the back channel engagements to make this happen.APMCC chairman Vinod Pandit said, “It is a historic decision for the displaced people of J&K as now KPs who left the valley May 14, 1944 onwards will be eligible for a domicile certificate,” said Pandit.APMCC national spokesperson King C Bharati said, “This step is a real healing touch to the displaced Hindu population of J&K.”Similarly, over 5,000 families from PoJK settled in other parts of the country have hailed the Centre’s decision.“With this move, PM Modi and HM Amit Shah have rekindled a ray of hope and sense of belongingness among this community, which had remained ignored by the earlier regimes since Independence,” said Rajiv Chuni, chairman of SOS International, an apex organisation of PoJK displaced persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-domicile-law-will-liberate-us-from-worst-ever-slavery-say-neglected-strata-of-j-k/story-MXG3W5FRiCfM0OVM2tfa3K.html

The court was hearing the bail plea of Parminder Kumar Mehmi, father of Amol Mehmi, who allegedly dragged Jalandhar police ASI, Mulak Raj on the car bonnet on May 2 during curfew in the state. Amol, the main accused already granted the bail by the court in the case on May 13. The court directed the ASI Surjit Singh (who brought the police file to the court) to file his reply on the next date of hearing on May 21 as to why necessary legal proceedings under Indian penal code and other law should not be initiated against him.The court said ASI Surjit Singh’s arrogance and intemperate behaviour was highly reprehensible which was not expected from the member of a disciplined force like the police.“It also shows that he has no regard for the rule of law and he considered that he as well as the police are law unto themselves,” the judge said. The court also directed the commissioner of police, Jalandhar, Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, to depute a responsible police official not below the rank of superintendent of police to assist the court in the case, as a lower rank official like ASI Surjit Singh does not know how to behave in the court.Besides, the court also directed the area assistant commissioner of police (ACP) concerned to produce the entire CCTV footage of alleged place of the scuffle in the court at the next hearing to effectively arrive at the conclusions for deciding the bail plea.Police had registered the case against the father-son duo under 307 (attempt to murder) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act at division number 6 police station in Jalandhar on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-have-right-to-beat-accused-says-punjab-cop-gets-court-notice/story-79lUnaF3IeUNoxSfSXwYtM.html
19-05-2020||City||HC tells cops to verify emails sent to Apeejay School branches||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has directed the Cyber Crime Cell of the city police to file a report detailing their views on the genuineness of the emails sent to two branches of Apeejay School from the Directorate of Education to hike the fees after the latter had alleged that communications were forged.Justice Rajiv Shakdher also directed the school authorities to not charge any amount besides the tuition fees while also directing them to pay salaries of staff and teachers at rates prevailing earlier.“The Cyber Crime Cell, Delhi Police will file a report before this Court with regard to their view as to the genuineness of the e-mails referred to hereinabove i.e. e-mails dated 12.12.2019, 16.12.2019 and 25.02.2020,” the judge said in its order dated May 18.The court’s order comes while hearing a plea from the school management challenging the Directorate of Education’s (DoE) April 22 finding, that the two institutions had illegally hiked fees and compelled parents to pay that along with arrears, and its recommendation to lodge an FIR against the management and seal the premises.Reacting to the order, the school authorities said, “The High Court has once again found merits in our argument against these malafide intentions and ordered no coercive action thus no FIR will be registered. The DOE has not responded to our repeated pleas to appoint an independent investigator for these baseless and malicious accusations and the court has now given directions for the same”.“The court has accepted and upheld our request to charge old the fees, pro tem, until the investigation is complete in a few weeks. We have complete faith in the law and look forward to the investigator bringing out the truth. Apeejay schools carry the 50+ years of education legacy and have been historically known for its values and promotion of education as a social cause. We will take all legal actions against those who threaten the future of our students and tarnish the good name of our parents and teachers especially at a time when society needs to be united in support of each other. Our values prevent us from bowing down to extortion and corruption at any level,” a statement issued by the school authorities said. In its plea filed through advocate Sanjeev Ralli, the school authorities had contended that the petitioners were unaware of the decision of the DoE seeking permission to initiate criminal proceedings against them and hence could not have used it in the earlier cases contested in the high court.He also contended that the emails in question were sent by the Deputy Director, DOE and/or his office to the school authorities.Appearing for the DoE, its additional standing counsel, Gautam Narayan told the court that the emails were forged and not sent by the concerned department.The court issued notice to the Delhi government, the police and the DoE on the plea and asked the school management or officials to join the police investigation while directing that no coercive action would be taken against them till the next date of hearing.The counsel for the school assured the court that it would collect only the tuition fees on the rate that were applicable in the financial year 2017-2018. The matter would be now heard on June 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-tells-cops-to-verify-emails-sent-to-apeejay-school-branches/story-OGJzTG4fr5x5LISreMa6yN.html
19-05-2020||Pune||NCL develops face masks capable of filtering out 99% bacteria||With face masks becoming mandatory for the next few months amid the ongoing pandemic, a group of scientists at CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) has designed face masks which, they say, can filter out up to 99 per cent bacteria. The mask is called ‘Biopolymer Nanocoated Medical Grade Mask’ and production of these will start in next few days.A team lead by Dr Syed Dastager, Dr Mahesh Dharne and Dr Shubhangi Umbarkar used CSIR-NCL’s patented bacterial nanocellulose technology along with nano coating. “The cotton cloth coated in a solution of bacterial cellulose and nano material completely prevented the penetration of bacterial growth, indicating promise as a material for face mask filter. We prepared prototype face masks using spun-bound polypropylene medical grade cloth to evaluate bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), particulate filter efficiency (PFE), breathability, flammability, and splash resistance tests.” said Dr Dharne. CSIR-NCL has licensed the biopolymer nanocoated technology to Pune-based MSME SETLAB INDIA. SETLAB plans to start production in next few days with 5,000 mask per day and will gradually reach the target of one lakh masks per day.“The South India Textile Research Association (SITRA), Coimbatore, a government approved certifying nodal agency for medical textiles conducted these tests on CSIR-NCL’s sample face masks for confirming the quality. The bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) is 99.9% according to the ASTM (formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials) standard using aerosols of human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin. The particulate filter efficiency (PFE), another quality indicator for face masks, showed a high value of 92.63%, indicating high restriction of hazardous particulates,” said Dr Shubhangi UmbarkarThe face mask qualified the tests for splash resistance to measure prevention against splashes of blood and body fluids. The pressure differential indicated easy breathability through the facemask as medical grade and is of Class-1 material in the flammability test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ncl-develops-face-masks-capable-of-filtering-out-99-bacteria/story-AfnKn05olldL3v2wj9WZUK.html

19-05-2020||Mumbai||FIR filed against Ghatkopar residents for protesting against quarantine centre||Around 150 people from Ghatkopar gathered outside a Covid care facility to protest against a hostel being converted into a quarantine centre, on Monday night. The civic body has decided to file a complaint against these people for opposing government work.The civic body and local MLA planned to set up an extended facility of 30 beds for Covid-19 patients of Hindu Sabha Hospital at Shri Virji Ladhabhai KDO Jain Vidyarthi Gruha at Cama Lane. However, the local residents opposed the plan on the grounds that it will compromise their safety.“The local corporator and MLA were visiting the hostel next to our building, which is why we stepped down to seek clarity on it. None of us was consulted or informed about the plan. There was no plan to protest,” said a local resident.The resident added that they requested the authorities to choose another location for the centre or provide them with sanitisation options to keep them secured.However, the assistant commissioner of the ward said that the facility has already been set-up, which will be managed by hospital staff.“We are in a situation where we need more and more centres to look after the increasing number of Covid patients. If everyone keeps opposing centres like that, how will we work? When the crowd didn’t listen to us, I asked the senior police officer to file an FIR against them,” said Ajit Kumar Ambi, assistant municipal commissioner.According to details provided by the police, the fifth and sixth floor of the hostel is being made into the quarantine centre.“The gathering of nearby residents occurred at around 8.30pm on Monday night when the civic authorities, local politicians and police were inspecting the area, the residents opposed it. They gathered below the society complex and violated social distancing norms,” said a police official.A case has been registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 188 (defying public servant’s duly promulgated orders) and provisions of the National Disaster Management Act against 40 to 50 unknown residents living in the vicinity of the hostel. Earlier, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) plans to set up a quarantine facility at Wankhede stadium met with opposition from local residents, and Marine Drive Residents’ Association wrote a letter in this regard to Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta. Follow which, the civic body on Sunday decided to cancel the plan to turn the stadium into quarantine facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fir-filed-against-ghatkopar-residents-for-protesting-against-quarantine-centre/story-B8l5p2JRW82kwjnz4SvMeL.html

Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) is finding out if there has been a change in the ink used for the stamp.“We had earlier received complaints from residents that the ink is leading to skin irritation. We had started marking the finger but we will probe into the quality of ink,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner.After a man tested positive in a housing complex near Birla College, all residents were home quarantined. The housing society has 48 flats and more than 150 residents.“Around 12.30pm on Monday, the KDMC officials took a survey and stamped the hands of every tenant. By 9am on Tuesday, the ink had faded and in some instances there was no sign of ink. It did even last for 24 hours, let alone 28 days of quarantine,” said Sanket Juwatkar, 28, a resident.Meanwhile, KDMC officials have been asking everyone to stay at home and follow lockdown rules.“For the past two months, we have been asking everyone who has been quarantined, to stay indoors. All essentials such as grocery are being provided through home delivery. People can step out only for emergency. But, people have been violating norms and this is the reason we still need to stamp those in quarantine,” said Suryavanshi..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/quarantine-stamp-easily-fades-away-kalyan-residents/story-ugulUusE7ieg0724wZ6yaK.html
19-05-2020||Mumbai||HC refuses to interfere in decision of high power committee on releasing prisoners on bail||The Bombay high court on Tuesday refused to interfere in the March 25 decision of the high power committee set up to decide on releasing prisoners on temporary bail and parole based on the directions of the Supreme Court to decongest jails to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The HC has directed one of the four petitioners who had challenged the classification of prisoners by the HPC to file a fresh petition which would include the outcome of a May 11 representation by the petitioner before the HPC.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde while hearing the petitions filed by four persons, incarcerated for various crimes under special enactments sought setting aside the March 25 decision of the HPC to not extend the benefit of interim bail or parole to persons booked under special acts. The petitioners had claimed that as the decision of HPC was discriminatory it should be set aside and persons punished or awaiting trial for crimes under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act (MPID), Unlawful Activist Prevention Act (UAPA) and Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) should also be given interim bail or parole.In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, on March 23 the Supreme Court had issued directives to decongest jails and directed state HPCs to decide on which prisoners or undertrials could be released. On Tuesday, when the four petitions came up for hearing the court was informed by senior advocate Satish Talekar that on May 11 the HPC while hearing a representation had refused to budge from its March 25 decision to not allow persons booked under special acts to be given interim bail or parole. Talekar said that even though some of the crimes under the special acts had a punishment in the form of paying a minimal fine, the accused were being denied interim bail/parole. The bench, however, said that it was not inclined to interfere with the HPC decision and disposed of the petition with a liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh petition by including May 11 decision of the HPC.Similarly in the petition filed by Humayun Merchant, an aide of former don Iqbal Mirchi through advocate Dr Sujay Kantawala, the court was informed that Merchant was booked under the PMLA Act. He had filed bail applications in both the sessions court and high court and had also challenged the March 25 decision of the HPC in the high court. After hearing the submissions the court held that he could not pursue a similar cause in different courts and dismissed his petition with the liberty to pursue bail proceedings in one of the courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-interfere-in-decision-of-high-power-committee-on-releasing-prisoners-on-bail/story-h2mtKfB7mY0EbkU7ur53iP.html
19-05-2020||Mumbai||Cancel final year college exams, state education dept writes to UGC||After receiving several queries from final year university students and parents about the exams scheduled in July 2020, the state minister for higher and technical education, Uday Samant on Tuesday announced that he has written to the University Grants Commission (UGC) to cancel the exams.In a letter addressed to the UGC, Samant has highlighted that due to the current situation of increasing Covid-19 cases, it will be impossible for the state government to conduct examinations for lakhs of students soon.This move comes less than ten days after Samant announced that all university students except final year students will be promoted to the next academic year, whereas final year students will have to appear for exams in July.“The lockdown has been extended for the fourth time in Maharashtra and there is an increase in the daily count of Covid cases. In such a situation, we cannot put health and lives of eight-10 lakh young students at risk by conducting examinations,” said Uday Samant in a Facebook live session on Tuesday evening. He added that the state government took this decision keeping in mind the safety of students. “Cabinet minister Aditya Thackeray has also previously highlighted this issue and a member of Yuva Sena has already approached the UGC with similar concerns. We hope the UGC understands our predicament,” said Samant.He added that the state government will wait for a couple of days to hear from the commission. Meanwhile, senior ministers and education officials along with heads of state universities will meet to discuss the plan of action. “By promoting all students, we assure the UGC that promotion will be based on a viable gradation formula and by ensuring that no student is at a loss,” said Samant.He further highlighted that while final year exams could be avoided, for the time being, it will be difficult to cancel entrance exams for professional courses. “We plan to conduct the common entrance test (CET) over a period of days in July. All social distancing norms will be followed, ensuring the safety of all 5.24 lakh registered students. We will also give students the option of choosing an exam centre closer home to avoid travel,” said Samant. He added that a call on this will be taken in the future in case the lockdown situation doesn’t change.He further stated that a meeting of top education officials will take place over the next two days to decide on the future course of action for the state education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cancel-final-year-college-exams-state-education-dept-writes-to-ugc/story-Fuhfn85WQTKq4OGhD5sICI.html

Last night I got the message about opening the shop for cleaning purposes, and accordingly, I have opened and am now cleaning it. I hope that our business restarts soon. We are taking safety precautions to start business,” said Mhaske.Haribhau Chillal, another shop owner who runs a leather-bag and belt shop on Satara road said, “It had become very difficult to survive during the lockdown. Savings were drying up and we desperately wanted to open our shop. Finally today, we have opened the shop, cleaned the goods and as per government instructions, we will now keep it open for customers. All the necessary safety precautions are being taken. We give sanitiser to every customer and also wear masks and gloves in the shop.”About the decision to open shops in Pune district, Fatechand Ranka, president of Pune Vyapari Mahasangh, said, “Our earlier appeal to members was to keep shops closed till May 17, but after a meeting with members via Zoom it was decided to open shops from Tuesday. Initially all the shop owners can do cleaning, checking of stocks and sanitisation. They should also strictly follow the guidelines given by the state government and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).”“There are many things with which shop owners have to deal with — salaries, electricity bills, and maintenance. Coronavirus is going to remain for a while, but if we keep the shops closed for more time it is going to adversely affect business. So this decision has been taken by the association,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shops-reopen-with-precautions-as-top-priority/story-clpNzK9HPa5cWygdVIG5JK.html

He is the oldest surviving terrorist in J&K and carries an award of around ₹50 lakh on his head that was announced by the police and National Investigating Agency,” said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity.He added that though security forces have intensified operations to nab the dreaded terrorist, difficult terrain and lack of technical intelligence were the two major factors that eluded forces of success all these years.“He has been active in Jammu and Kashmir since 1992 and Pakistani handlers glorify him while recruiting Kashmiri youth,” the official said.The officer divulged that even if their “sources” or “assets” get to know about Saroori, the unavailability of transport plays a spoilsport.The officer, who was recently shifted to Kashmir, recalled that Saroori had three associates-- Riyaz aka Hazari, Mudassir and a Gujjar boy Talib with whom he moved around in that area, more specifically in Rennie area.Saroori had been active in Kishtwar, Doda, Ramban and Bhaderwah areas before turning dormant.However, he reactivated his terror activities and was the mastermind behind the killing of BJP state secretary, Anil Parihar and his brother, Ajit Parihar in Kishtwar town in November 2018 followed by the killing of RSS functionary Chandrakant Sharma and his bodyguard in April 2019.As per the NIA chargesheet, Saroori had planned and executed the killing of Parihar brothers to create a divide in communally sensitive Kishtwar town.In October 2018, ₹30 lakh bounty was announced on Jehangir Saroori by the Jammu and Kashmir police for any information leading to his capture. The Kishtwar police had also put up ‘wanted dead or alive’ posters in the region for Saroori and his associates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-eliminating-hizb-ied-expert-oldest-surviving-terrorist-jehangir-saroori-on-radar-of-security-forces/story-hCOsVZtwCt9eDJBddr7qxO.html

The government’s submission was filed in response to a petition by four Bandra residents, challenging an April 9 order of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), identifying three inter-connected Muslim cemeteries in Bandra (West) as approved sites for burial of Covid-19 victims.“The transmission cannot happen unless people in the locality come in direct contact with the dead body brought for burial or cremation,” said the statement, adding, “Direct contact of people staying in the locality with the dead body is impossible as it is wrapped in plastic by hospital staff before being handed over to the relatives.”The statement goes on to explain that the burial is done in strict compliance with directives issued by the government and the health department of BMC.BMC has also filed an affidavit supporting the stand taken by the government. Its affidavit stated that the WHO guidelines on bodies of Covid-19 patients stipulate that except in cases of haemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola) and cholera, dead bodies are generally not infectious. “Only the lungs of patients with pandemic influenza, if handled improperly during an autopsy, can be infectious. Other than the above, cadavers do not transmit the disease,” reads the statement.The four petitioners said that the three inter-connected Muslim cemeteries are at the heart of Bandra (West) and are surrounded by heavily populated residential areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/burial-of-covid-19-victims-not-likely-to-spread-virus-state-to-hc/story-cn4g3VroVZjmbpk1eV33GO.html

19-05-2020||Lucknow||Old video lands Ravi Kishan in row, he says it’s a conspiracy||At a time when lakhs of migrant workers are returning home on foot, trucks, buses and trains, political opponents have referred to an old video of Gorakhpur MP and actor Ravi Kishan to brand him as anti- labour and anti-poor.Alleging a conspiracy, the MP has said the video dates back to 2017 and added that his remarks were misconstrued. In the video shot inside a moving car, the actor is apparently heard rebuking fellow party workers for getting him to travel in an overcrowded car and forcing him ‘to smell the odour emanating from sweat’. “Paseena itna mahakta hai na. Ab kya kaha jaye. (Sweat gives off an odour. What can one say!),” the actor is heard saying as he shouts at the person filming the video, asking him to turn off the camera.It’s not clear from the video if Ravi Kishan was referring to the sweat of migrant labourers. Nevertheless, the opposition parties have linked his statement to migrant workers, branding him as anti-labourer and anti-poor. “Ravi Kishan is an actor who lives in luxury. He dislikes the sweat of poor migrants who play an important role in building India,” Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Prahlad Yadav said.Reacting to the controversy, Congress district general secretary Anwar Hussain said, “Honourable MP, it’s disheartening that you are mocking blood and sweat of labourers, who form the base of the Indian economy.” Ravi Kishan had won the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat in 2019, defeating his nearest rival Rambhual Nishad of the Samajwadi Party by a margin of over three lakh votes. Following criticism on the social media, Ravi Kishan gave a clarification and posted a video from Mumbai.“Nowadays, a video against me is going viral under a conspiracy by opposition people who are frustrated with the good work of the BJP government. The video is old, dates back to the 2017 UP election,” the MP said, hitting back at his opponents for misconstruing his statement.” “They don’t understand Bhojpuri well. By ‘mahak’, I meant fragrance, not odour. People who know Ravi Kishan knows how much I respect the poor and what I have done for them. I myself reached this place after a lot of struggle and thus know the value of the sweat of labour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/old-video-lands-ravi-kishan-in-row-he-says-it-s-a-conspiracy/story-kR1DUUPRXRPOUWuvRv9EDO.html

19-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Stopped from cycling home, migrants wait for hours in buses||Migrant workers returning home via Lucknow had to wait for hours in buses to continue their journey further, as per the fresh exercise started by the Uttar Pradesh government.The district administration on the direction of the state government continued its exercise to move migrants on buses from the state capital’s Dr Shakuntala Mishra National Rehabilitation University. Migrants entering the district borders on bicycles and on foot were stopped at various places and moved to the temporary transit centre at the rehab university.Due to lack of coordination among officials, the migrant workers claimed they were forced to wait for long. At a toll booth on Lucknow Agra Expressway, a group of migrant workers travelling on cycles were made to wait for over five hours before being shifted to the rehab University.“We were made to wait inside the bus parked in open. It became too hot inside the bus but we were asked to remain inside,” said Bhole Ram Verma, a migrant worker returning from Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan to Basti in eastern UP. Migrants faced similar problems on Faizabad, Kanpur and Sulatanpur road.Officials said delay in moving migrant workers to their destinations was because buses wait to fill up migrants travelling on the same route. “We are trying to move migrants from Faizabad road as soon as possible. The system will be further streamlined in coming days,” additional district magistrate (Trans Gomti) Vishwa Bhushan Mishra said. “For their safety at various entry points in the state capital we are stopping migrants who are arriving on foot or seen travelling by bicycles or trucks,” he said. Officials claimed nearly 20 buses were deployed to move 1200 migrants from Faizabad road to rehab university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-stopped-from-cycling-home-migrants-wait-for-hours-in-buses/story-2ACgGBmsVnCYT7eXmZGX5K.html
19-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Migrants burning their feet, hole in pocket to reach their homes||In the grip of poverty due to the lockdown, thousands of migrant labourers are on the road, returning to their respective homes either by bicycles, hitch-hiking or walking. This is happening because the hapless migrants, stuck in various states, have lost their jobs and also hope to get them back in the prevailing circumstances. They are so desperate to reach home that many of them started their journey on foot while some exhausted their savings and a few borrowed to book a truck or other vehicles. Despite the government’s efforts to arrange vehicles to transport them, the labourers can be seen moving on the road. “Who wants to step out in such scorching heat. The government says ‘jahan ho vahin raho’ (stay where you are) but how can one live without food and money,” asked one Dinesh Kumar Gupta, who was on his way to Siddharthnagar district. He was stopped by police at Khurramnagar crossing on Sitapur road and assured that his travel arrangements would be made. All vehicles at Kamta crossing in Lucknow are east-bound. Buses, trucks auto-rickshaws, motorbikes and bicycles are all carrying them home. Gorakhpur, Basti, Kushinagar, Gonda—all east UP districts—are their destinations. Some have to travel further to Patna, Madhubani and Darbhanga in Bihar. A few have to go beyond till West Bengal.Sitting in a cramped auto-rickshaw one Sukumi Bano was looking for water. Bano worked as a housemaid in a high rise complex in South Delhi. Her employers gave her some money last month but refused to help further. With no hope of joining work, she decided to return to her village in Madhubani with four other housemaids in the auto-rickshaw owned by her husband. “The the journey is very hard but we had no other option. I don’t know what will happen to us. All I can think of now is home,” she said.One construction worker Lallan Prasad, 55, of Bihar’s Motihari district said he had gone to Jammu on March 5. “I stayed without food for four days after I exhausted all my savings. I borrowed some money from a contractor and reached Delhi and got a private bus that will drop me at Gorakhpur. I paid Rs 1000 for the journey,” said Prasad.Gopal Singh is among the 10 persons who are on their way to Bihar’s Darbhanga district. He is annoyed with the Bihar government. “They left us to die,” alleged Gopal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-migrants-burning-their-feet-hole-in-pocket-to-reach-their-homes/story-qhOqIiAvHDGR1A4bs06tyM.html

Nevertheless, they made it back in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic.It was six years ago that Brij Kishore left his home village Gichauli in Jhansi district in 2014 on getting a job in a tiles factory in Bahadurgarh.He worked hard to establish himself in the distant town. Thereafter, he took two rooms on rent in Shakti Nagar locality there to shift his wife and three children. The children got admission in a local school and his wife worked as a domestic help in the colony nearby to make ends meet. Besides, he managed to send some money to his parents in the village. For some years, the family was content with urban life. Then, the Covid-19 pandemic jolted everyone out of their comfort zone. After the nationwide lockdown came into force on March 25, the factory owner closed the unit and told the labourers to wait till the government relaxed the restrictions. Brij Kishore’s wife Chunni was also asked not to visit households for domestic work. The family purchased food grains and other edible items with their meagre savings.After the second lockdown came into force, the landlord started putting pressure on him to pay rent or vacate the rooms. By this time, the factory owner had shifted to Delhi. There was no sign of the factory re-opening as the administration tightened the lockdown as the coronavirus spread in Bahadurgarh, Brij Kishore said.Their patience started wearing thin, when the government announced the third phase of the lockdown. Again, there was no sign of the factory reopening. Their savings diminished fast and hunger was palpable. On May 4, the family decided to leave for their native village. “I spoke to a truck driver who was transporting wheat from Haryana and Punjab to Uttar Pradesh. He told us he will charge Rs 2,000 per person. After I pleaded with him, he reduced the amount to Rs 1,500 per person,” Brij Kishore said.“To arrange the money, I sold our utensils, gas cylinder, TV set and other items to the landlord. We also sold the grain and flour to local labourers. I handed over Rs 7,500 to the truck driver on May 7. He told me to accompany him to Sangrur in Punjab to transport goods. My family was told to wait on the highway. For three days, my wife and children waited on the highway,” he said.“After picking up the family on the fourth day on May 11, our journey to Jhansi started. The truck driver gave us some food and water. We managed to make space between the grain bags. Policemen stopped the truck on the Rajasthan-Madhya Pradesh border. But after much pleading, they permitted us to continue the journey,” he recalled.Near Morena in Madhya Pradesh, a tractor trolley hit the truck in which Brij Kishore and his family were travelling. They sustained minor injuries, but police personnel gave them first aid and food. They were permitted to continue the journey. Near the Jhansi border, police again stopped the truck as a bus carrying migrants was hit by another truck. Around half-a-dozen injured migrants were taken to hospital in an ambulance.Finally, the truck driver dropped Brij Kishore and his family near the Jhansi border on Sunday morning. The Ahirwar family walked 10 kilometres to reach a police post on the border. From there, they were taken to a quarantine centre established in a school near Babina. “I lost my job, savings and escaped accidents, but managed to return to my native place with my family,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/i-lost-my-job-escaped-accidents-but-made-it-back/story-SEzxX4jTwVH8W15fOV0q7J.html

It is our responsibility to follow discipline and control the coronavirus disease. Masks, hand sanitisers and social distancing are important. I pray to god to keep you and your family healthy. If we stay disciplined, God will help us,” Kejriwal said on Twitter in Hindi. आज से कुछ आर्थिक गतिविधियाँ शुरू हो रही हैं। हमारी बहुत बड़ी ज़िम्मेदारी है कि पूरे अनुशासन से रहें और करोना को कंट्रोल में रखें। मास्क, सोशल डिस्टन्सिंग और हैंड सैनिटायज़रआप और आपका परिवार स्वस्थ रहें- ऐसी प्रभु से प्रार्थना है।हम अनुशासन से रहेंगे, तो प्रभु हमारी रक्षा करेंगेThe Delhi government threw open all public transport, except metro trains, and allowed people to shop at pretty much any marketplace (malls are still closed) as long as they are not over the age of 65, and the markets are not in Noida or Gurugram (crossing the borders will still require a pass) in latest guidelines issued on Monday.This comes after 55 days of a lockdown imposed in March-end to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease Covid-19. The lockdown continues till May 31, but Monday’s announcement by the state, coming on the back of Sunday’s by the Union home ministry, marks the second phase of a gradual exit from it.On Monday, Kejriwal allowed auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws with one passenger in every vehicle; green-lighted the resumption of all industries with staggered timings; and said all government and private offices would be open in the city-state where life has come to a standstill due to unprecedented restrictions on movement and activities.“The coronavirus is here to stay. We need to live our lives with corona now. And the lockdown cannot be permanent. So far we have used the lockdown period to prepare ourselves — hospital beds, ventilators, PPE (personal protective equipment), testing kits, etc…Now is the time to revive the economy,” Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing.All relaxations announced by Kejriwal will be applicable across Delhi, except in containment zones which will allow the movement of essential personnel alone and have stricter perimeter control. At present, Delhi has 73 containment zones, which can broadly be defined as the epicentre of an infection.On Monday night, Delhi’s coronavirus dashboard stood at 10,054 cases - of which 5,409 are active - and 160 deaths.

19-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Villages with less than 15% losses to get 24-hr supply, says Energy minister||The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to provide round the clock electricity to rural areas, where aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses are below 15%. Villagers and village panchayats will be asked to join hands in reducing the losses.Energy minister Shrikant Sharma made this announcement at a meeting held at Shakti Bhawan on Monday.He directed the officials to gear up accordingly. Sources, however, said that presently there was hardly any village which qualified the criteria. “We are already providing uninterrupted power to cities. Now, the government wants to supply 24-hour power to villages where the AT&C losses will be less than 15%,” he said while directing officials to change the depilated overhead electricity lines of such villages on a priority basis. This, the minister said, needed public participation and appealed to village panchayats and villagers to cooperate with the government in reducing line losses to make their village self-reliant in terms of power supply giving an impetus to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘self-reliance’ campaign.The minister said the government had decided to give uninterrupted power supply to villages considering the fact that the state government was facilitating setting up of village industries under its one-district, one product scheme for self-job creation.He asked the UPPCL to make preparations for giving 24-hour power to deserving villages. He stressed on the need for substation-wise review of schemes and revenue recovery so that each sub-station could become a self-reliant unit in itself.

Father of a Class 3 student Dhiraj Kumar said, “My daughter goes to a private school located near Bypass. The school asked me to pay Rs 14,650 which includes Rs 9000 for term fee, Rs.2,400 for bus fee and Rs 3,250 for tuition fee in April. Now I am again getting reminders for depositing May-June fees.”Kumar said, “Despite the DM’s order, the school has asked to pay term fee and transportation fee. It seems that the private schools have gone beyond the government’s jurisdiction.” He also alleged that the school has hiked tuition fee by 12.92 % and transportation fee by 14.58% than the previous year.Another parent Avinash Singh said, “The school has asked me to pay more than Rs. 40,000 which includes Rs.14,000 under annual fee, Rs. 5000 as security deposit along with Rs 1600 as transportation charge.”Some of the schools have asked parents to pay three-month instalment without any relaxation.In April, Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi had issued an order instructing all the private schools not to pressurise parents for depositing three months’ fee at a time in the wake of coronavirus lockdown. However, the order stated that schools facilitating online classes may request for one-month tuition fee but they cannot exert pressure on parents.The private schools have their own alibi to collect fees normally. “Why private schools be restrained, if government schools are allowed to collect fees?” asked Shamael Ahmad, national president of Private Schools and Children Welfare Association, arguing that the schools have to bear recurring operational costs such as rent and electricity bills even if they are closed. Ahmad also complained that government utilises resources of private schools including their buses during election. But when it comes to offer them relief packages or relaxation, government steps back.On Sunday, regional deputy director of Education Surendra Kumar Sinha informed that showcause letter had been issued to 28 schools so far. He said, “A total of 28 private schools have been served show-cause notice on violation of Bihar Private School (Fee Regulation) Act 2019. They have been commissioned to reply attached with fee structure of current and last academic year. Of total, 12 schools have replied so far. Some of them have asked time period until lockdown lifts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/private-schools-pressurise-parents-for-fees-allege-parents-in-patna/story-hlpHmJOPsxdiQGiUX74JPJ.html

Harkarandeep tied the knot with Bhavdeep Kaur at Sarabha Nagar gurdwara on Sunday and only 25-30 family members were invited to the event. With a focus of social distancing, special seating arrangement was done at durbar hall of the gurdwara and hand sanitisers and masks were kept at the entrance. Citing big fat weddings as the main reason behind farmers getting into a debt trap, Congress MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid said the residents, especially the farmers, should avoid organising big fat weddings and instead opt for the simpler ones as advocated by Sikh gurus. “Bhavdeep’s father Jatinderpal Singh is a retired PCS officer. He also insisted that we should go for a simple wedding ceremony rather than organising an extravagant event,” the Congress legislator said.‘DO AWAY WITH WASTAGE OF FOOD’The MLA also said, “It was our wish to organise the wedding in a traditional way even if there was no lockdown as my own wedding took place in a very simple manner. Also, we had decided that nothing would be accepted as dowry as we need to abolish this menace from the society.”The groom, Harkarandeep, said, “A lot of food is wasted in big fat weddings, but by organising my wedding ceremony in a traditional way, we tried to avoid the wastage of food and money that can be used for other purposes in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-lockdown-cong-mla-s-son-has-a-low-key-gurdwara-wedding/story-ZcJefxcOe9JBavtgPZz5nN.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi man beats wife to death over dispute||A man beat his 32-year-old wife to death with a rolling pin in front of their four children in East Delhi’s Harsh Vihar on Sunday afternoon after a domestic quarrel, police said Monday.The suspect, Aftaab, 35, fled after the murder. The four children, between the ages of three and eight, sat with the body for nearly five hours before one of them walked over to their grandmother’s home some lanes away and informed her.The weapon was found next to body. Aftaab worked odd jobs. “His first wife had left him a few years ago. Their two children lived with him,” said Ved Prakash Surya, DCP (north-east).About a year ago, Aftaab married Sayema, whose husband had died in a road accident. “Sayema had got lakhs as compensation after her husband’s death,” said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity.But they would allegedly fight often. “Aftaab suspected Sayema of having an affair. He would keep asking for money. If she refused, he would use the alleged affair as excuse to beat her.”Around 8 am on Sunday, the couple quarrelled again. “He wanted money for alcohol but she refused. So he accused her of having an affair and began beating her up,” the officer said.He then picked up the rolling pin from the kitchen and beat her. “Once she fell unconscious, Aftaab banged her head against the wall, picked up some money and escaped,” said the officer.The four children tried to intervene, but were allegedly pushed away. “They stayed with the woman’s body from 8am to 1pm. When she didn’t respond, one of them walked to their grandmother’s home and called her,” the officer said. A case has been registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-beats-wife-to-death-over-dispute/story-YfpwazmROWz4VRUGPiJwyL.html
19-05-2020||City||Back to work, auto drivers in Ludhiana openly flout distancing norms||Back to work after almost two months of curfew on Monday, autorickshaw drivers in Ludhiana were seen openly flouting social distancing norms and plying more than the permissible limit of passengers. According to the guidelines issued by the administration, only two passengers can travel in an auto-rickshaw at a time apart from the driver but most autos were seen plying over six passengers in a go.Not just that, many were openly fleecing passengers. For a ride from the bus stand to the railway station, autos were charging almost Rs 100.‘NOT PROFITABLE’Most drivers said that if they ply only two passengers at a time, they won’t be able save enough for incurring fuel and other expenses. Prabhat Chander, 43, an auto rickshaw driver from Haibowal Kalan, said on normal days he earns around Rs 1,200 by working from 7am to 10pm. “Out of this, I am able to save only Rs 400 daily after deducting all the expenses. Today, I have just earned Rs 60 by ferrying three passengers in two trips since morning out of which, I will be able to save just Rs 20.” He added, “As school, colleges, interstate bus service, regular passenger train service have not started, the number of persons who want to board three-wheeler was less today. “In the coming days, the availability of passengers will increase but as we are allowed to carry only two passengers at a time, I will have to make 30 trips in a day to earn same amount which I used to earn on normal days by carrying five to six passengers at a time in 10-12 trips,” he said while adding that the fuel expenses will increase and there will be less savings.Chander has been driving a three-wheeler for the past 16 years and has never taken a break from his work. “We three-wheeler drivers work on Sundays also. Since March 22, when the curfew was announced, I have had no earnings in hand, no ration in the house. It had become difficult for me to meet the demands of my family. I am thankful to the social workers who served us food during these tough times,” he said.Chander added that today when he learnt that auto-rickshaws are allowed to run, he prayed to the god and thanked him before resuming his work. “Although, I am earning less today but I am happy that I am at least earning something,” he said.Ranjit, vice-president of the Ludhiana three-wheeler auto rickshaw union, said that they have handed over a memorandum to the office of deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal requesting him to increase the passenger fare for auto-rickshaws as carrying two passengers at a time with old fare will not work for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/back-to-work-auto-drivers-in-ludhiana-openly-flout-distancing-norms/story-uDgbqv28JbAdJR0o3aZwNM.html

He said police needed to be tough and must challan those without masks. At a video conference to take stock of the covid-19 situation, the CM added inter-state movement would be allowed only on special and Shramik trains, at least till May 31 and buses, within the state, will be allowed in a phased manner. Additional chief secretary home Satish Chandra said in line with the Centre acceding to the state’s request to do away with colour coding, the state will now have only containment and non-containment zones.Referring to the entry of migrants, NRIs and others via flights and special trains, the CM reiterated his directions for adherence to quarantine rules. So far, 60,000 Punjabis had registered for return to the state, he said, adding that 20,000 NRIs were also expected to return.Amarinder added that while Punjab was willingly sending back people, including migrants, from other states, spending Rs 7.5 lakh per train, other states were not responding in kind, but were asking his government to arrange for ferrying Punjabis back. He also added that while more trains were needed for Bihar; it was not willing to take in people at this stage as its quarantine facilities were full.Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said his department was collating data of migrants based on registrations made for travel, in line with the Centre’s directions on ration distribution.On testing, the meeting was informed that the state would be able to scale up the number from 1,400 to 4,650 per day in the state’s three labs itself.

19-05-2020||City||Fascination for guns set to backfire on Moose Wala||Until some weeks ago, he was a blue-eyed boy of Punjab Police, with the state top cop even retweeting his song. But now Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala, 26, who has been grabbing eyeballs ever since he shot into limelight, finds himself on the wrong side of the law.Hailing from Moosa, a remote village in Mansa, Moose Wala has emerged as king of controversies, especially for promoting violence and gun culture in his songs. In February, Moose Wala and singer Mankirat Aulakh were booked for allegedly promoting gun culture and violence via their song ‘Panj golian’ (five bullets).Shubdeep Singh Sidhu, aka Moosewala, completed his electrical engineering from Punjab and moved to Canada on study visa in 2016. A year later, he released his first track ‘So High’ that was followed by two back-to-back albums. The man clearly has fascination for guns --- be it his songs or his official YouTube channel logo that depicts ‘a man dressed in black with a covered face and carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. Laced with Canada’s style and culture, most of his songs have thumping beats and deep bass. He tries to give a rural touch to the songs with his lyrics.Moose Wala’s die-hard fans say he has never promoted drugs, alcohol and vulgarity in his videos, unlike many of his contemporaries.Apart from his gun-promoting numbers, Moosewala has been locked in war of words on social media with other fellow singers, including Karan Aujla.The singer’s brush with controversies continued in 2019 when he angered the Sikh community while making a reference to Bhai Bhago, an18th century Sikh warrior, in the song “Jatti Jeoney Morh Di Bandook”. In March 2020, Moose Wala tendered an apology before the Akal Takht.Moose Wala found favour with Punjab Police after his song on preacher Baldev Singh of Pathlawa village in SBS Nagar. Baldev was the first coronavirus victim in Punjab. The song was shared by DGP Dinkar Gupta on his official Twitter account. Later, both DGP and Moosewala faced backlash from netizens for defaming Baldev Singh following which Gupta removed the song link. Moose Wala also backed Punjab Police’s #MainBhiHarjeetSingh campaign.Last month, Mansa SSP Narinder Bhargav took Moose Wala along with him to give a birthday surprise for a corona warrior. A video of some cops teaching the controversial singer how to fire a gun using their service weapons went viral following which a case was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fascination-for-guns-set-to-backfire-on-moose-wala/story-6WOps6YcRdAKixO0CbgMQL.html
19-05-2020||City||‘From parallel to commercial theatre, Ratnakar Matkari excelled in every sphere, made a mark’||Ratnakar was my absolute contemporary. He was one of the most important writers in theatre and cinema. Right from the parallel theatre movement to the commercial theatre, he excelled in everything and made a mark. He was one of the writers who was awarded both— the Sangeet Natak Akademi for his plays and the Sahitya Akademi Child Literary Award, which was a rare achievement. I feel he rightly deserved it. It made him a tall figure in the world of literature.We were in touch as our exploits in the parallel theatre movement were happening simultaneously. Not many are aware that both of us worked in Bank of India at the same time. I vividly remember an incident related to an inter-bank drama competition. It used to be a vibrant activity during the 70s and 80s. I was working at the head office in Mumbai when the manager at the last minute had requested me to do something for the competition. I was in a dilemma and the only person I thought of was Ratnakar. I went to his branch and told him there was a challenge that I couldn’t take on single-handedly. We sat down together and chose one of his short stories and came up with a production. Ratnakar, his wife Pratibha and I rehearsed over the weekend, and acted in the play, which was highly appreciated. This was even before Pratibha went to the National School of Drama. Our careers and activities have been going hand-in-hand for many decades. The last time I met him was around two years ago, when I came to Mumbai. My wife, Sandhya, and I went to his house at Dadar.

19-05-2020||Mumbai||After 5 days, couple gets blood donor in Mumbai to save unborn child||Fear of contracting Covid-19 is keeping people from donating blood, which in turn is leading to critical medical situations and a shortage in blood banks, particularly of negative blood groups. The family of an unborn child, who has been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder and urgently needs intrauterine blood transfusion, had to wait for five days until they found a donor on Monday.Suwarna Pawar, who is seven months pregnant, was admitted to Wadia Maternity Hospital in Parel last week. The foetus has been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder, is anaemic and to survive, requires intrauterine blood transfusion (a procedure by which blood transfusion is done through the umbilical cord). Pawar has A- (negative) blood, but the foetus needs O- blood.“I brought my wife to the hospital on Wednesday and since then we have been trying to find a donor. On Saturday, a person donated his blood, but due to some medical issues, doctors couldn’t use the blood,” said Pawar’s husband, Dadasaheb.Wadia Maternity Hospital didn’t have O- blood and were unable to arrange for the blood despite contacting their registered O- blood donors. “We have over 100 registered O- blood donors but none of them are agreeing to come to the hospital to donate blood because of the fear of contracting Covid-19. We are helpless,” said a doctor from Wadia Maternity Hospital.Finally, on Monday, Wadia Maternity Hospital told the Pawars that if the transfusion could not be arranged within 24 hours, the foetus would develop further complications.Following the intervention of this reporter, 39-year-old O- donor Prashant Sawant from Tilak Nagar agreed to donate the blood. With the help of a friend who drove Sawant to the hospital, Sawant was able to donate his blood.“It was my duty to save the life of the child who hasn’t even seen the light of the day. Just like the Covid-19 pandemic, we are also facing another health crisis — shortage of blood. There is no supplement for blood so people need to come forward to donate blood,” said Sawant, who works in an IT company.The hospital is expected to perform the intrauterine transfusion today.Two more O- donors have also been arranged through SBTC and the Twitter handle of Blood Donors India (@BloodDonorsIn).Previously, HT had inquired with major blood banks like King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Tata Memorial Hospital and Sir JJ Mahanagar Raktapedhi, but none of them had O- blood. According to the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC), only one unit of O- blood was available at Rajawadi Hospital and 44 units of O- blood components were available at different blood banks. However, these are not suitable for intrauterine transfusion since they are not freshly donated.“For intrauterine transfusion, we need freshly donated blood which can’t be more than five days old. All the blood components that are available, are quite old,” said a blood medical officer from Wadia Maternity Hospital, where two major surgeries had to be stalled due to unavailability of O- and A- blood. “Currently, we a crisis in [the supply of] A-, AB- AB+ and O-. We have taken enough precautionary measures to prevent any possible transmission of Covid during donation,” said Dr Thorat. In Mumbai, there is not one whole unit of A- blood in any blood bank and there are only 14 units of blood component of A- in the city. As HT had reported on Monday, fear of contracting Covid-19 has led to a 60% fall in blood donation in the city. Almost 80% of the blood banks in Mumbai have no supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-5-days-couple-gets-blood-donor-in-mumbai-to-save-unborn-child/story-qs5biEyWIlI8aB3RqMdFkP.html

While the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has identified 20 Muslim cemeteries where Covid-19 victims may be buried, no Christian cemeteries have been listed.With Christian cemeteries not accepting bodies of Covid-19 victims, families are being forced to abandon funeral customs. After the 61-year-old passed away on Sunday, her family spent agonising hours trying to get directions from the hospital, the municipal corporation and the police that would let her be buried. Ultimately, her body was cremated on Sunday night.“According to the Bible, it is said that we are born out of dust and we go back to dust. When we aren’t given an option to bury the body, it hurts our sentiments. We were literally left with no option but to let the body be put in electric crematorium along with the coffin,” said Noah Christian, a relative of the Covid-19 victim.Activist Cyril Dara said that in the last week, he had heard of three other Christians who had succumbed to Covid-19 and had to be cremated. “When there are provisions for burial of other communities, why not for our community members? In countries like USA, Italy, Iran and many other countries, respectful burial is been given,” said Dara.Last month, BMC allowed burials within city limits, provided the ground is large enough to ensure there is no threat of transmission to residents. “When we were discussing the issue, we had called representatives of Christian and Parsi communities. They had assured us that they will look into the practice on a case to case basis. If there is a demand, we can provide for a burial space for Christians,” said a senior official from BMC.Explaining the 20 Muslim cemeteries where Covid-19 victims may be buried, he said, “Among Muslims, there are lot of sects and each of them have different burial grounds. A demand had come in from them to allot space in cemeteries which were large,” said the official. He added that since the Christian community was “scattered,” there wasn’t a particular area that was allotted.Father Nigel Barett, spokesperson of the Archdiocese of Bombay, which has around five lakh members, said “When it comes to burials [of Covid-19 victims], the respective family needs to take permission from BMC, and they will allot a space for burials to take place. We are not the authority here to take a call on this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/burials-at-christian-cemeteries-not-being-permitted-in-mumbai-say-kin-of-covid-19-patients/story-M3U22rMygJKgnPpCWJTaGI.html

According to members of bar associations who attended the meeting, the administration was firm in its decision that till the Covid-19 pandemic continues, physical hearings cannot be held. In light of the onset of monsoon and denial of physical hearings, the member said that the court administration observed that it should first work out the modalities of commencing court work in a phase-wise manner. The meeting was attended by the additional solicitor general, advocate general, and representatives of various bar associations. According to another member of a bar association who was in attendance, the meeting centered around two major issues – having physical hearings in the HC and physical hearing in courts other than the HC. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni apprised the attendees about the demarcation of red, orange and green zones by the government depending on the existence of infected cases, and said that a decision regarding physical hearings would be possible only after the state government updated the list later in the evening. The member further said that the meeting also discussed improving the quality of video conferencing wherein it was suggested to permit call conferencing if video conferencing quality was not good. However, the administrative judges did not show any inclination towards this idea. A request was also made to increase the number of days when the court worked and the number of judges assigned to hear cases on these days. According to the bar association member, the administrative judges said that in the current pandemic situation, allowing physical hearings would not be possible but a decision on permitting the same in courts in green zones, and other issues, would be taken only after there was clarity from the government. The decision is likely to be announced on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-not-keen-to-resume-physical-court-till-coronavirus-outbreak-continues/story-Fg00jcZWOEiSVnzsedFYeP.html
19-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Monorail work back on track amid lockdown||The lockdown period has been utilised by authorities to revamp or complete certain projects. For instance, the Mumbai Monorail has been working to rebuild two trains by the end of the current lockdown period, which will take the total number of its operations to six. According to a statement from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the lockdown period was utilised to procure spare parts, including 18 brake callipers, 98 tyres and 16 bogie shock absorbers, for the two trains.“We are aiming to repair two more trains by May 31 or the week after that. When we restart in phases, we will have six trains and an additional one at standby with a frequency of 15 mins,” a senior official from MMRDA said.The official said that the team is also undertaking civil, electrical and signalling maintenance works during the lockdown period. “We are also undertaking online training for station masters and train operators,” the official said.With the two trains, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) aims to better the frequency to 15 minutes, which currently even extends to 45 minutes at times. The new services will give respire to commuters who have been complaining about the poor frequency of the 19.5-km Chembur-Saat Rasta corridor since it became operational a year back.It is also likely to improve the monorail’s ridership. In March, HT had reported how only around 38 lakh commuters have used the monorail in a year, which is a mere 10% of the estimated ridership of 3.60 crore. MMRDA had stated that it can achieve the desired ridership only when 10 rakes are in operation.MMRC completes 82% tunnelling in cityThe Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) has completed 82% (44.99km) of the tunnelling work for the fully-underground Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) route by May 16.

19-05-2020||Mumbai||Union’s appeal to stay at home had no impact on staff: BEST||There was no impact on the operations of the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) buses despite the call by one of its workers’ union, BEST Sanyukta Kamgar Kruti Samiti (BSKKS), asking staffers to stay home. On Monday morning, the transport undertaking said it operated 1,800 buses – which was more than the services on other lockdown days – to ferry those in the essential services and as well as citizens to hospitals and quarantine centres. The buses were installed with mesh guards on windows and windscreens as a precautionary measure. Manoj Varade, BEST’s public relations officer, said the transport undertaking’s staff as well as those employed with the wet lease buses had reported to duty. “We had ensured that those in the essential duties were not inconvenienced at a time when we are battling the Covid-19 outbreak,” said Varade.The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has also readied 1,200 more buses and 3,000 drivers and conductors on standby. However, as buses are not operational for the general public owing to the lockdown, there is no need to run the additional buses, an official said.However, BSKKS leader Shashank Rao claimed that 90% of the total staffers responded to the ‘stay home’ appeal and did not join duty. “Members of the Shiv Sena union and BEST administration pressurised many staffers to join duty. But most of them refused to do so because they know that our demands are genuine and need to be addressed on an immediate basis,” Rao said.The union said it appealed to staffers to stay home after the administration ignored its demands to ensure staffers’ safety, and provide them with personal protective equipment (PPE), proper quarantine facilities and a medical cover of ₹1 crore for each of its employees and their families.Union members approached several drivers and conductors till late Sunday night, urging them not to join the protest and report for work.Meanwhile, the Tulinj police in Nallasopara seized a BEST bus from Bandra depot after liquor worth ₹30,000 was found from it. The driver has been arrested. According to officials, the driver allegedly purchased the liquor from wine shops at Nallasopara (East) to supply it in Mumbai where liquor shops are shut due to the pandemic. “We are yet to ascertain if the driver is our staffer or from the wet lease department. An action will be taken accordingly,” said Varade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/union-s-appeal-to-stay-at-home-had-no-impact-on-staff-best/story-I5kdCFaNcU760GxHlxvanI.html
19-05-2020||Mumbai||Railways levied ₹50 surcharge on each ticket for migrants: Maharashtra Congress||Mumbai Maharashtra Congress has alleged that the Union railway ministry has levied a surcharge of ₹50 on each ticket for migrants who have been travelling back to their home states from Maharashtra. Calling it “insensitive and inhuman”, the Congress has also dared the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to prove its claim of the central government bearing 85% of the train fare for the migrants or apologise. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant, in a press conference on Monday, presented a letter written by the Railway Board on May 1, which directs the zonal railway offices to levy the surcharge. The letter, signed by the director of passenger marketing, has stated that the superfast charges of ₹30 and additional charges of ₹20 are levied on the tickets issued for the Shramik Special trains. “Levying surcharge on migrants’ tickets over the actual fare is shameful. This is nothing but ‘Corona Tax’ being recovered from the helpless migrants who have been unemployed from the past two months and are running out of money,” Sawant said.He added that BJP leaders’ claim that the central government was bearing 85% of the cost of the railway fare for the migrants was false. “It is a false claim by BJP leaders, including Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil. I dare Patil to prove the claim or apologise before the people of the state,” he said.BJP has however, said that the ruling parties in Maharashtra are misguiding the people. Claiming that he is not aware of any such surcharge being levied, BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, “The Railway Board is charging 15% of the actual cost of running special trains from the state government. The state government and Congress are misleading people that they have been paying the complete fare of the tickets for migrants. While levelling allegations against BJP and the Centre, the Congress should tell the people of Maharashtra why have they been charging ₹14 per km for the special buses run by the state transport corporation during the lockdown when the actual ticket rate fare is much lesser.”A day earlier, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh too, had claimed that the entire cost of the railway fare for the migrants has been borne by the state government. He also said that the state has made an allocation of ₹25 crore for the purpose after the Centre turned down their request of making the trains available free of cost.BJP to start Maharashtra Bachao protest from todayThe Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party has signalled to start a state-wide campaign, ‘Maharashtra Bachao’ against the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government from Tuesday to protest against the administration’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. State party chief Chandrakant Patil and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who held a meeting via audio bridge with senior leaders on Monday, also demanded that the state announce an independent package for daily wage earners to give them relief.BJP leaders will give a statement to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and district collectors to “awaken the state government’’ on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, lakhs of party workers will stand outside their homes with slates and hoardings to protest against the administration’s ineffectual governance, said a communication from the BJP.“The coronavirus pandemic in the state and Mumbai has gone out of hand. Nobody seems to be in charge. Those who want to get admitted are not getting hospital beds. There are several unaddressed issues of migrant labourers, the poor and the farmers,’’ said Fadnavis.He added that while this is not time to do politics, the state government needs to be awakened from its slumber and made to see the woes of its people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/railways-levied-50-surcharge-on-each-ticket-for-migrants-maharashtra-congress/story-64lmtifNqwS3reBJ4yb8fN.html

While some of these schools do not hold classes and only share reading material with students online, there are other schools that have even started conducting unit tests for internal assessment in the absence of any teaching.One of the parents whose kids study in a school in Sector 40, Savita Bansal, said, “My daughter is in Class 9 and it has not even been a week since her school started taking online classes.” “However, the school has now released a schedule for unit tests starting next week. With almost minimal teaching, how do they think students can perform in these exams,” she added.Another parent whose son and daughter study in a school in Sector 44, Akash Kumar, said, “Instead of focusing on imparting learning among students, schools are more concerned about conducting exams. There is hardly any school where the syllabus has been completed.” “Meanwhile, online classes are chaotic for students. Besides, there is hardly any teaching involved,” added Kumar.A student of Class 12, Gagandeep, said, “My school has hardly taken any classes so far. Teachers share powerpoint presentations and graphs with students. In Class 12, with such tricky concepts, how do they expect that we will be able to understand the chapters ourselves?”“That’s not all, each and every chapter is correlated with the previous one. Without understanding the last unit, one cannot move forward,” she said.Many students have started taking private coaching as they have no other option. A student of Class 11, Seema Sharma, said, “I clear my concepts by scrolling various tutorials online and on YouTube. I have also subscribed to private tuitions.”Chandigarh Independent Schools’ Association president HS Mamik said schools and teachers are also learning to adapt to this new mode of teaching and it will take a while for things to settle down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/even-as-teaching-hit-amid-lockdown-chandigarh-schools-begin-unit-tests/story-2hdRRNLZfTbgVWWG1LE95J.html

Over the last few days, Sadique Basha has been attending to requests from people and arranging vehicles for them to visit hospitals. A few days ago, Basha decided to make an autorickshaw available for patients who wished to see a doctor or go to a hospital. He made a small video clip with his contact number and posted it on social media sites offering help in case need. Over the next few days, he got a large number of requests from people. “I realised there were just too many people who had no means to travel due to lockdown. Patients who don’t own a vehicle find it difficult to travel. People cannot walk till they find a bus. Thus we started helping such people,” he said. Seeing the number of people seeking help, Basha got three more cars from his friends who wanted to help him help others during this difficult time. “With this, we now have four vehicles. People who wish to avail the service have to send the details on message because we need to make sure it’s a genuine request. Then, patients are picked up and dropped to and from hospitals. We hope to help more people in the coming days as we know that there are many who need such a service at this hour especially considering that the lockdown is being extended.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/activist-arranges-for-vehicles-to-ferry-patients-to-hospitals/story-7Zj4DN5cEFW1koAIdSxDOM.html

However, low-cost carrier SpiceJet has closed its online bookings till mid-June while online bookings for AirAsia are closed for the coming month. A SpiceJet spokesperson said, “Our international bookings are closed till June 15, 2020.”After checking that online bookings were available for passengers, HT contacted IndiGo, Vistara and GoAir, but they did not comment on their online bookings for national and international travel. DGCA chief Arun Kumar said, “Airlines are doing it at their risk and cost. However, they have to comply with DGCA CAR (civil aviation requirements) on refund, cancellation etc, failing which they will face strict action.”A source from one of the leading airlines said, “The DGCA circular asked airlines to keep bookings closed until further notice. However, it is not possible to keep them closed indefinitely. Hence, majority of the airlines have resumed their online bookings for travels starting June 1, 2020.” Warning travellers, Sudhakara Reddy, president of Air Passengers Association of India (APAI), tweeted, “We understand 6E, SpiceJet, GoAir have started taking bookings for international flights imagining that flights will operate from 1st June. Pl don’t fall for it. Ur money will become a credit shell, instead keep it safe at home. (sic)”“Under the immense pressure of Covid-19 and with no support from the government in terms of direct liquidity infusion for airlines, it is certain that many carriers will seize to exist by the time the aviation sector returns to regular levels. All the airlines are on the brink of breakdown and are looking for ways to manage their cash flows,” said an airline source. “Some cash-strapped airlines have resumed international bookings for the month of June to gather some cash from customers, which shall help them to survive the recovery period. Government and DGCA so far have not given any directives to airlines to begin international bookings. The confidence of passenger and travel agents is shaken due to earlier refunds which are stuck. There is a limit to block funds. Unless the government comes with clear guidelines that in June airlines will fly and in case of cancellations refunds will be given, there will hardly be any taker for these tickets,” said Nishant Patti, co-founder of EaseMyTrip.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-dgca-advisory-some-airlines-resume-online-bookings-for-june/story-BeweLJpWHyWDuZAOMvAbLP.html

The accused has been identified as Gurbachan Singh of the same village. A gas cylinder kept in the labour quarters also exploded, but no casualty was reported from the spot.As per information, those in the labour quarters on the godown premises had gone to work in other unit of the firm. The fire broke out at around 4:30pm and seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot. Sub fire officer (SFO) Maninder Singh said that fire fighters doused the flames in around two-and-half-hours. No casualty was reported at the spot, he said. Jatinder Nagpal, godown owner, said that materials worth lakhs were destroyed in the fire. “The blaze broke out due to burning of wheat straw by the farmer. He had burnt crop residue last year too and we had asked him not to do so, however, this time he intentionally burnt it, leading to the fire in the godown,” said Nagpal.Dehlon police station house officer (SHO) Sukhdev Singh Brar said on the complaint of Jatinder Nagpal, we have booked Gurbachan Singh under Section 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “He is on run. A manhunt has been launched to nab him,” said the SHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmer-booked-after-plastic-godown-catches-fire-due-to-stubble-burning-in-ludhiana/story-QbbX1NOBTahgG3zcFkS0wL.html

According to the new protocol, the entire building need not be sealed and only that particular floor can be sealed as decided by BMC authority. Meanwhile, symptomatic patients who test positive for Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, will be shifted to appropriate health facility, BMC has said in the circular.BMC has also said that in case the floor or building is sealed, the handover will be given to society office bearers for ensuring all help is provided to the affected families. BMC has appealed to not stigmatise those being quarantined.However, the civic body has also said it may seal entire building depending on the situation. Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer of BMC, said, “Sealing of building or floor may be decided based on local situation, area of building/society complex, number of cases, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-changes-covid-19-sealing-rules-may-seal-floor-instead-of-entire-building/story-n1eU5kgox2n5o64K2vF94M.html

Dr Grewal also asked for full implementation of the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Act in Chandigarh and urged the administration to provide wage subsidy to the extent of 50% of minimum wages for all registered workers for a period of three months in manufacturing, handicrafts and services sectors.Focusing on ease of doing business, Manish Gupta, vice chairman, CII Chandigarh, said the administration should extend all renewals/licenses for pollution, fire and labour by another year, waive off fixed electricity charges and property tax by six months, issue notification for allowing mortgage of industrial property under leasehold and general power of attorney, which will encourage banks as well as industry to keep the cash flow going during the Covid-19 pandemic period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/4-000-crore-stimulus-package-needed-to-kick-start-chandigarh-s-economy-cii/story-uJ5qiq0wUkovYpBJxgfMSJ.html

A gunny bag with bricks was also recovered with the body, presumably to ensure the victim drowned, so we have registered a murder case,” said Kuldeep Singh, the investigating officer. Proceedings in the case began after the body was kept in the mortuary for 72 hours for identification. Police estimated the body, which had not been identified and was pulled out of the pond by villagers, to be about eight to 10 days old as it was swollen. Postmortem examination will be done on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/murder-case-registered-3-days-after-woman-s-body-found-tied-to-chair-in-dera-bassi-pond/story-WIIZcRiP5FzchzIsixGSmJ.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Except Metro, all public transport thrown open in Delhi||Delhi residents can hop into public transport — cab services and buses; not the metro yet — and shop at pretty much any marketplace (malls are still closed), as long as they are not over the age of 65, and the markets are not in Noida or Gurugram (crossing the borders will still require a pass), according to the latest guidelines issued by the state government. This comes after 55 days of a lockdown imposed in March-end to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). To be sure, the lockdown continues till May 31, but Monday’s announcement by the state, coming on the back of Sunday’s by the Union home ministry, marks the second phase of a gradual exit from it. On Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal allowed auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws with one passenger in every vehicle; green-lighted the resumption of all industries with staggered timings; and said all government and private offices would be open in the city-state where life has come to a standstill due to unprecedented restrictions on movement and activities.“The coronavirus is here to stay. We need to live our lives with corona now. And the lockdown cannot be permanent. So far we have used the lockdown period to prepare ourselves — hospital beds, ventilators, PPE (personal protective equipment), testing kits, etc…Now is the time to revive the economy,” Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing.Kejriwal did not mention any measure on interstate travel, which the Centre has allowed in its fresh order. Also, barber shops, spas and salons, which too have been permitted, will not open in the national capital immediately. On Monday night, Delhi’s coronavirus dashboard stood at 10,054 cases — of which 5,409 are active — and 160 deaths. Thus far, 4,485 people have recovered from the disease in Delhi. All relaxations announced by Kejriwal will be applicable across Delhi, except in containment zones which will allow the movement of essential personnel alone and have stricter perimeter control. At present, Delhi has 73 containment zones, which can broadly be defined as the epicentre of an infection. Kejriwal said taxis and cab operators, such as Ola and Uber, are allowed to function with each vehicle carrying a maximum of two passengers and a driver. The same rule will be applicable for private cars. Pillion-riding will not be allowed in case of two-wheelers, and carpooling/shared services will be prohibited.Buses will be allowed with a maximum of 20 passengers in each vehicle, and all people boarding them will be screened. “Drivers will be instructed to sanitize the seats after each passenger deboards,” Kejriwal said.“Grameen Sewa vehicles can operate with a maximum of two passengers, maxi cabs with a maximum of five passengers, and rural transport vehicles (smaller buses) with a maximum of 11 passengers,” he said.While Sunday’s federal guidelines permitted interstate movement of passenger vehicles and buses with “mutual consent” of the states and the Union Territories (UTs) involved, confusion prevailed on Monday at Delhi’s borders with Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida) and Gurugram that have been sealed. Authorities in both satellite towns later clarified that stringent restrictions at their borders will continue, and people — except health care personnel — will need passes like before to cross over. In addition to the announcement on public transport, another significant step announced by Kejriwal was the opening of marketplaces and all shops. In line with central guidelines, the chief minister allowed stores in marketplaces to function, but they will have to follow an odd-even rule.Under the standard operating procedure prepared by Delhi, shops will open on alternate days on the basis of shop numbers. This will ensure that half the shops will open on one day, and the other half the next day and so on. However, no such rule will be applicable to shops selling essential items such as medicines, fruits and vegetables, groceries, dairy products, books and stationery. Also, standalone shops and shops in residential areas will be exempt.Kejriwal approved the functioning of industries, albeit with staggered timings, and allowed all government and private offices to begin operations. His government did away with the curbs asking private offices to function with just 33% of their staff from office. But at the same time, he advised firms to encourage employees to work from home to the extent possible.“Industrial firms whose name starts with M/S A to M/S L may function from 7.30 am to 5.30 pm, whereas firms whose registered name starts with M/S M to M/S Z may function from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm,” the Delhi government order issued late on Monday night said.Kejriwal also allowed construction activities, but said workers must be from Delhi. Earlier, the government allowed resumption of work for projects in which labourers were available on site.The chief minister announced that weddings (with a maximum of 50 people in attendance) and funerals (with a maximum of 20 people in attendance) will be allowed in the city, in another move that is in line with the Centre’s guidelines.“Social distancing is a must. Complaints of violation can force us to take strict measures and scale up restrictions…Wearing of masks is also mandatory for individuals when they are outdoors and in workplaces…All workplaces must have provision for sanitizer and hand wash,” he said.Activities and services, which are banned across the country, will continue to be prohibited in Delhi. These include metro services, educational institutes, hotels and bars, shopping malls and theatres, social and political gatherings, and gyms and swimming pools, among others. The restriction on non-essential travel between 7pm and 7am will continue. “Prohibition on outdoor movement of people aged 65 and above, children aged 10 or less, pregnant women and people with health ailments...will continue,” Kejriwal said.Just as the central guidelines, the Delhi government’s order too asked employers to put in their “best efforts” to ensure that the contact-tracing Aarogya Setu app was “installed by employees having compatible mobile phones”. It asked district magistrates to “advise” individuals to install the application, which was previously mandatory for all government and private employees.The order did not specifically mention e-commerce, but central guidelines say e-commerce players are allowed to deliver both essential and non-essential items across the country, barring containment zones. “All other activities will be permitted (industrial/commercial) except those which are specifically prohibited... However, in containment zones, only essential activities shall be allowed,” the order said.Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said the purpose of the lockdown was to flatten the curve. “To think that infections will stop with an indefinite lockdown is wrong. Phased relaxation of the lockdown is necessary now. What we need now is more cooperation from people...,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/except-metro-all-public-transport-thrown-open-in-delhi/story-eEiejPUKRDncIERw0WgVcJ.html
19-05-2020||Chandigarh||Stone pelters again target cops on patrolling duty in Chandigarh’s containment zone||In yet another attack on frontline workers implementing lockdown orders, a police official in a patrolling party was targeted by stone-pelting mobs protesting stay-at-home orders in Dhanas, a containment zone for Covid-19.This is the second such incident in seven days targeting policemen patrolling Kacchi colony in Dhanas. On May 11, constable Anil Kumar was pelted with stones as he tried to stop a few men from leaving the sealed zone. Police said Monday’s incident occurred when head constable Gurdev Singh stopped some people from leaving the area. “Gurdev stopped them from moving out as per prohibitory orders, but the residents, presumably feeling restless and agitated due to the ongoing lockdown, started pelting stones at him,” said a police official familiar with the matter.Investigating officials identified the attackers as Bala, Birju, Chamkila and Dharminder and booked them under section 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty), 353(assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.They are yet to be arrested even as attempts are being made to identify others involved in the offence.An eyewitness in the case, head constable Lakhwinder Singh, said he saw “Bala and Birju provoking others to pelt stones at the police who were asking people not to move out. Gurdev received injuries on his arm and was rushed to Government Multi Speciality Hospital(GMSH-16) for treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stone-pelters-again-target-cops-on-patrolling-duty-in-chandigarh-s-containment-zone/story-Ae5RTgKFiG20msk2v74jgM.html
19-05-2020||City||Migrant workers wait in the scorching heat, sleep on gunny bags, waiting for a chance to go home||Five-year-old year old Ajay Pandey had fallen asleep in the scorching heat outside the Radha Soami Satsang Bhawan in Zirakpur.The space outside the Bhawan was their refuge as Pandey and his family of 10 waited for a train from Mohali Railway Station close by to take them home to Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh.“We have been camping here for the last six days. There are too many people registered for travel by train so we are waiting for our chance,” said Pandey. What mattered was that he was going back to his village and that his parents, Lallan, a factory hand, and Shakuntala, a domestic helper, had not been working since the March-end lockdown to prevent the transmission of Covid-19.“We get food but we have to wait for quite some time for it,” said Pandey.Though people at the Radha Soami Satsang Bhawan had set up a tent for the workers and organised food and water for them, children like Pandey were sleeping on the gunny bags spread out near the roads, using dupattas to cover themselves.During the day many people sat hunched up near some barricades outside the bhawan to protect themselves from the blazing sun.Guddu, who worked in a packaging factory in Dera Bassi and was waiting with his family of five for a train to Bihar and his final destination Chapra, said: “We have given up our rented accommodation and handed over the keys to the landlord, who virtually threw us out for not paying rent.” Mukesh, waiting to go to Lucknow, had been asked by his factory owner to leave. “They had initially paid us wages but we have been out of work for two months now. All the money has been spent, we have nothing left to eat, so the only option is to go home.”Showing his mobile phone, he said, “ I have got registered but have yet to get a ticket, so I will wait.” On options to stay back in Punjab, the workers said some people who had tried to go back to their rented homes were not allowed to enter by the people there. The police had been called. “They will take us to quarantine centre so it is better to stay here and wait,” said Babbu Lal, a construction worker who lived in Baltana and was returning to his home to Sitapur district in Uttar Pradesh.On handling the return of migrants to their homes, Kuldeep Bawa, sub divisional magistrate, Dera Bassi, said, “A very large number of migrants got registered from Dera Bassi subdivision but the number of seats is limited. We cannot send all at once but we are trying to accommodate as many migrants we can. They refuse to move from here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-workers-wait-in-the-scorching-heat-sleep-on-gunny-bags-waiting-for-a-chance-to-go-home/story-RuuFG0HJ78UD0KyCK08atI.html

19-05-2020||Mumbai||HC stays coercive recovery of PF contribution for community health workers from BMC||In a relief for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Bombay high court (HC) last week restrained the provident fund (PF) commissioner from taking any coercive action against the civic body for recovering ₹23.64 crore towards PF contribution for its community health volunteers (CHVs). The liability of the civic body to pay PF contribution for CHVs is under a cloud of strong suspicion, said justice Nitin Sambre while imposing the restraint.The judge was hearing petition filed by BMC, after its appeal against an adjudication order was dismissed last year on June 28. The adjudication authority had held that the CHVs were workmen, as contemplated under the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, and the civic body was liable to pay their PF contribution. The liability was fixed at ₹23.64 crore.It was argued on behalf of BMC that CHVs were not its permanent employees, as no wages are paid to them. It was claimed that only honorarium is paid to them and thus, the PF Act was not applicable CHVs and the orders passed by PF authorities were without jurisdiction.In support of the argument, the civic body pointed out that in a 2006 reference, an industrial court has held that CHVs are not permanent employees of the corporation.The civic body also pointed out that CHVs were initially appointed under a project floated by the central government, which was later taken over by BMC. However, the nature of duties performed by CHVs cannot be termed as one that of employees of the corporation.Justice Sambre also took into consideration the fact that the January 2017 HC orders on petitions filed by some CHVs declaring that they are employees of the civic body had been stayed by the Supreme Court in August 2018.As a consequence, prima facie, liability cannot be fastened on the municipal corporation, said justice Sambre, adding that the Apex court’s conclusion on the status of CHVs as workmen will have direct bearing over the outcome of this petition. HC directed that there shall be no coercive recovery of the PF contribution till the decision of the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-stays-coercive-recovery-of-pf-contribution-for-community-health-workers-from-bmc/story-AXHYDNgXb4f2f8IuOfxccI.html

He said that round-the-clock manning of all the entry points will be done by a joint team of police and excise department.“Mohali has a unique position as it borders Chandigarh and Haryana and is also a part of the tricity. Further, as liquor is comparatively cheaper in UT and Haryana, there is a high possibility that residents buy liquor from these places. Due to this, surveillance of all the entry points to the district is mandatory,” said Dayalan.Formal orders for the same have been issued and additional requirement of force has been communicated to the director general of police, he added.DC further said that the field teams headed by excise Inspectors, halqa patwaris and panchayat secretaries will survey old buildings, marriage palaces, rice-sellers, roadside dhabas, godowns, cold storages and slums, where there is likelihood of storage of illicit liquor. “The lambardars will also be responsible for reporting storage and movement of illicit liquor within and to/from their respective villages. The district head GOG will ensure strict vigil on the same in their areas,” he said. “Further, to check pilferage, distilleries and bottling plants shall be jointly manned by a team of police and excise. Strict watch will also be kept on outward movement of trucks and it will be ensured that they carry the required documents such as bills and e-waybill,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-admin-to-observe-strict-vigil-to-check-sale-of-illicit-liquor/story-CXH4aWuPJu0fKyhwJL5CNJ.html
19-05-2020||Mumbai||No need to declare Uran wetland as conservation reserve, JNPT tells forest dept||The country’s largest container port has informed the Maharashtra forest department that the Belpada area in Uran should not be declared a protected zone. This comes after the mangrove cell, earlier this month, wrote to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) conveying its intention of declaring the area a conservation reserve. However, JNPT’s response on May 15, which was shared by the forest department, states the site was ‘erroneously termed as a wetland’.JNPT’s letter highlighted the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules 2017 do not include river channels, paddy fields, human-made waterbodies, salt pans etc. as wetlands. “In view of the above, it is submitted that the port land appears to be erroneously termed as wetland. It is requested that this land should not be proposed as wetland under Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972,” the letter undersigned by SV Madabhavi, chief manager (port, planning and development), JNPT, read. It further added, “We assure you, utmost care will be taken at the time of development of nearby area in accordance with law.”According to Bombay Natural History Society’s (BNHS) 2019 report on the status of coastal wetlands in Navi Mumbai, the 30-hectare Belpada wetland is situated between two narrow creeks on the east and west sides and surrounded by mangroves. With 30 bird species, including nine migratory bird species, a maximum of 605 individuals can be spotted at the site. There are five near-threatened and five Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 including lesser and greater flamingos, Eurasian spoonbill, Black-winged kite, and Western Marsh harrier. Citing the BNHS report, the mangrove cell had proposed the site as a conservation reserve for three Uran wetlands – Panje, Bhendkhal and Belpada. Cidco is yet to respond to the forest department’s letter on the status of Panje and Bhendkhal. Conservation reserves are demarcated as protected areas in buffer zones of bird migration corridors, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries or reserved and protected forests.Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell), said, “Even though the land is in possession of JNPT, it is still government land. It serves the purpose for everyone if they (JNPT) protect this area as a wetland and ensure no development at the site.”Of the 2,987 hectare of JNPT port land, 1,172 hectare is agricultural land, 1,262 hectare is salt pans, and 553 hectare is government owned. The mangrove cell said Belpada forms a part of the 553-hectare land which falls under the state’s purview.JNPT responded to HT’s query and said that letter was written to clarify BNHS’s report which showed Belpada as a wetland. “We have objected to the same stating that the land is owned by JNPT. We have all the official documents to prove that this is a commercial and agricultural land. We would like to further state that the land in question is not a wetland as has been stated in the BNHS report. Our response has been given to the mangrove cell as per their request for our comments. We remain a socially conscious organisation, committed to the environment, community, stakeholders, employees and the industry,” said a JNPT spokesperson. Mangrove chopping, wetland reclamation in other areas of UranEnvironmentalists have identified mangroves being hacked at Sonari (Sawarkhar village) near Karal junction in Uran across a kilometre-long and 100-foot wide patch. A complaint was filed by Nandkumar Pawar, representing Vanashakti, alleging that the work was being done by JNPT. “These violations continue despite lockdown. Officials carrying out such illegal activities need to be booked,” said Pawar. Members of the Bombay high court-appointed mangrove committee said they have taken cognisance of the complaint. “While we will not be holding any meetings during lockdown via video-conferencing, all complaints are being forwarded to the local district administration for further action,” said a member of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uran-not-a-wetland-no-need-to-mark-it-as-protected-zone-jnpt-tells-forest-dept/story-dMIEeQYalVJQREjjwOuINM.html
19-05-2020||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray takes oath as member of Council||Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday took oath as a member of the legislative Council (MLC) at Vidhan Bhavan. This is the first time that the Sena chief has become a member of the state legislature. He is the second one from the Thackeray family to be inducted in the legislature after his son Aaditya Thackeray.Thackeray was accompanied by his wife Rashmi and son Aaditya at the oath-taking ceremony held in the Central Hall, Vidhan Bhavan. He is one of the nine candidates who were declared elected unopposed to the Council last week for a term of six years.His election to the House was crucial for him to continue as the CM, as he had to fulfil the constitutional requirement of becoming a member of either of the Houses before May 27 – six months from the day he took oath as chief minister.Speaking to reporters outside Vidhan Bhavan, Shiv Sena MP and party secretary Vinayak Raut said, “All Shiv Sainiks are proud that their leader is taking oath as a legislator today. The state has got good leadership [under Thackeray].”After the ceremony, Thackeray, along with wife Rashmi, son Aaditya and chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, went to Raj Bhavan and met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari as a courtesy call.Besides Thackeray, the other new members of the Council – Shiv Sena’s Neelam Gorhe; Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) Shashikant Shinde, Amol Mitkari; Congress’s Rajesh Rathod; and Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Ranjitsinh Mohite Patil, Gopichand Padalkar, Pravin Datke, and Ramesh Karad –also took oath. There were initially a total of 14 candidates in the fray for the nine MLC seats, but later four candidates – two each from the BJP and NCP – withdrew their nomination, while an independent candidate’s nomination was rejected, thus paving way for all remaining candidates to be elected unopposed.The election for the nine seats was pushed back owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, thus bringing political uncertainty over the state. The state cabinet had recommended that Thackeray should be nominated by Maharashtra governor as the MLC polls were deferred to maintain stability of the state government. However, as the governor did not take the decision, Thackeray was prompted to raise the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Later, the MVA constituents and governor Koshyari wrote to the Election Commission to hold the legislative council polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-takes-oath-as-member-of-council/story-d0GzH0DwGcyMItdoB8x1OJ.html

The state has 25,392 active cases, said health officials. The state’s death toll went up to 1,249 after 51 deaths were reported on Monday. Of the deaths, 23 were in Mumbai, eight each in Navi Mumbai and Pune, three in Jalgaon, two each in Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Nagpur and one each in Palghar and Bhiwandi. Also, one patient from Bihar died in Mumbai on Monday. Twenty-one patients were above 60 years of age, while 19 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years and the remaining 11 were below the age of 40 years. Of the deceased, 35 had high-risk co-morbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments, health officials saidMumbai, the worst-hit city in the country, recorded its second-highest one-day spike after Sunday with 1,185 new cases, bringing the count to 21,335. On Sunday, the city had recorded 1,595 cases. The toll of Mumbai is 757.State health minister Rajesh Tope has already indicated that there will be a rise in fresh cases with the peak likely to be by June-end. However, officials said that it may come down after 14 days when the fifth incubation period of the virus will be completed.As the Maharashtra government is set to further relax restrictions in lockdown 4.0, the number of fresh cases in the state has started soaring, indicate the figures. 3 days, the state has recorded 19,561 cases. It means on an average, it is getting around 1,500 fresh cases daily. On Sunday alone, it registered 2,347 cases — the highest single-day spike. The state is experiencing a significant rise since May 6, when it has started getting over 1,000 cases daily. In May (last 18 days) alone, the state has reported as many as 24,588 cases, whereas the total number of cases registered in April was 10,201.Till April-end, the number of new cases was ranging around 500 after which it turned into four digits since May 6.The fresh infections since then are as follows: May 6 - 1,233; May 7 - 1,216, May 8 - 1,089; May 9 -1,165; May 10 - 1,278 cases, May 11 – 1,230; May 12 – 1,026; May 13 – 1,495; May 14 – 1,602, May 15 – 1,576; May 16 – 1,606 and May 17 – 2,347 cases. Besides, on May 10, the state also declared 665 cases respectively, saying that they were registered in the few days prior to that and are being declared as per the Central government’s directive to bring the data at par with the national figures on the ICMR website. The first case of coronavirus in the state was reported on March 9 and it took 30 days for the state to cross the 1,000 mark. For the first 10,000 cases, it took 53 days.Between April 19 and 30, the state was getting around 500 new cases daily. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said, “We will have to wait for another 14-day incubation cycle to complete (by May 31). After this, the rise is likely to come under control and gradually, the decline is expected. However, if it does not happen, then it may lead to community transmission stage.”He also said that the state has not reached the community-transmission stage — where the source of the infection is unknown — as there is no exponential growth in the number of fresh cases.As the cases are rising, the number of recoveries, too, has also jumped to 8,437 as 749 patients recovered on Monday.The doubling rate in the state has improved to 11.1 days from 10 days, said Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department. The state government wants to take the doubling rate to 20 days soon.The state government had also resolved to bring the entire state into the green zone by this month-end, which seems unlikely as, according to the health minister, the peak has not come yet and is likely to come by June-end. “All the predictions about rise in cases in Mumbai and Maharashtra have not come true, but the numbers are rising and the peak is yet to come. Going by the mathematical predictions, actual peak is likely to come by June-end. It means by June-end, the number of cases in Mumbai will increase four times. We are trying to prevent it from coming, but have to be prepared for the worst and hope for the best,” Tope said.So far, 18,678 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 3,66,242 people have been put under home quarantine. On Monday, the state also completed 56 days of lockdown, which was imposed from the midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown was imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was partially lifted on April 20 in areas where there are no cases or are minimal in number. The announcement of more relaxations is likely to come on Tuesday.On Monday, the health department also declared to have conducted 2,82,194 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 2,47,103 people tested negative. State currently has 1,681 active containment zones. A total of 14,041 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 60.47 lakh people.The mortality rate of the state has come down to 3.62% (1,198 deaths) on Sunday, from 7.41% (148 cases) on April 13. However, it continued to be higher than the national mortality rate of 3.15% (3029 deaths) till Sunday, revealed the data of the state medical education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-033-fresh-cases-take-maha-tally-past-35-000/story-8AbdnNxUwRTQlcXOz3lZOP.html

The health department has also sought intervention from resident welfare associations (RWAs) for reporting those showing symptoms such as fever, cough, cold and difficulty in breathing in the neighbourhood. Dr G Dewan, director of health services has written to all RWA presidents, asking them to start neighbourhood vigil. “Neighbours can inform the health department about any person living near by and suffering these symptoms,” he wrote.“We are encouraging people with flu-like symptoms to report to the hospital for screening. These days, fewer patients are reporting to flu clinics and emergency OPDs with flu like symptoms, which is why we had fewer cases in these four days. We have now requested RWAs for vigilance so that no cases goes unnoticed.”The UT health department has also decided to train residents wherein master trainers will teach them the ‘do’s and don’ts’ and protocols pertaining to the virus.The department has also requested councillors of all the wards or areas to disseminate awareness regarding Covid symptoms and to encourage residents to visit GMSH- 16 or GMCH-32 in Chandigarh if they show any symptoms, for which they will be ferried in the health department’s ambulance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/refer-those-with-flu-like-symptoms-to-testing-centres-chandigarh-dispensaries-told/story-BIh2yQ8mydqCxVvFSDXGON.html
19-05-2020||Chandigarh||Bumpy rides for Chandigarh as lockdown delays road repairs||Potholed and damaged city roads are once again drawing attention after Chandigarh administration allowed movement of vehicles in the third phase of the lockdown. Around 60% of recarpeting projects from 2019 are still pending, said officials and the exodus of migrant labour has cast a long shadow on forthcoming recarpeting projects for this year.Speaking about the quality of roads, Kuljinder Singh Sra, general secretary of Sector 33-B resident welfare association (RWA), said the potholes were detrimental to vehicles. Dr Jagpal Singh, president of Sector 35 RWA said that potholes were placing two-wheelers riders at risk, as they are wearing masks which reduce visibility and can lead to accidents.General secretary of Sector 40-C RWA, SK Khosla stressed that recarpeting must be done before monsoon begins in a month, or the work will be delayed till October.Discussing the status of recarpeting, the civic body’s chief engineer Shailender Singh said, “Currently, around 60% of last year’s recarpeting work is still pending which will cost nearly ₹30 crores. It was delayed in winters and then due to the Covid epidemic. First, the pending work must be completed before this year’s recarpeting work is scheduled.”Singh said repairs will likely be affected by mass movement of migrant labourer, many of whom are employed by the building and roads wing of MC’s engineering department. “We have to first check how much manpower we have, since several workers may have left for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar via Shramik trains.” He said the department was awaiting clarity about carrying on road maintenance work in lockdown phase four.Earlier many employees of the engineering department had been deputed with Sector Response Teams (SRT) that checked the functioning of shops and supply of fruits and veggies. However, these SRTs were dissolved by MC commissioner KK Yadav on May 15 and officials are back on regular maintenance duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bumpy-rides-for-chandigarh-as-lockdown-delays-road-repairs/story-tcIw7VhCFEejLETXSLqHnN.html

On Sunday, he got an opportunity to do what he loves the most and completed 21-km.“It was difficult for me to believe that I can run long distance inside the home. It felt wonderful to run in an event after such a long gap,” said Kamdar. As several marathoners have not been able to practise during lockdown, two groups from Thane district organised the indoor one-day marathon on Sunday. A total of 2,197 runners joined the event on social media from across the world. All of them made space inside their house by removing the furniture.Furious Running Culture Foundation (FRCF) and Runners First India, that have been holding indoor marathons regularly, had organised Virtual Event India Indoor Run 2020. Milan Rai, 43, president of FRCF, completed 42km. The Belapur resident said, “The event aimed at lifting spirits of all and showing solidarity to all our corona warriors who have kept us safe.”Manisha Jain, 42, a resident of Parel, completed 10km and said it was a challenge to run indoors.“I heard some of my friends regularly run 21 km inside their homes. So, I too participated and I enjoyed although I had to keep my pace very slow,” said Jain.Prema Rajaram, 38, a resident of Kolkata, completed 21km by running in circles on her terrace and indoors.“I ran 13 km on my terrace and then I completed the remaining 8km inside my house barefoot. I ran from my kitchen to my balcony and back and this taught me that nothing can stop you if you are determined. I am definitely going to run a longer distance next time,” said Rajaram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/runners-lace-up-for-indoor-event/story-6Cu0DsAPJ30OvqkxX72j6H.html
19-05-2020||Chandigarh||Can my child be sent to a shelter? Request from parents leaves Childline staff baffled||They are getting a number of calls from parents seeking expert advice on dealing with behavior issues in children confined indoors for weeks due to the Covid-19 lockdown in Chandigarh, but two requests have left people manning Childline 1098 flummoxed. Two sets of parents have called up enquiring if their children can be sent to shelters.Confirming that the requests had been made, Sangeeta Jund, director Childline 1098, a 24-hour free emergency phone service for children in need of aid and assistance, said two couples had called to say their children were “virtually out of their control”. While one couple was currently being counselled with the child, the other request from the parents of a 16-year-old girl had come as no surprise.The teen had earlier been sent to a shelter because she had run away from home, kept making self-harm threats and refused to give up smoking. Her parents had often sought help from Childline, which responds to the emergency needs of children and also links them to relevant services for their long-term care and rehabilitation.Child moved to shelter“Her mother says they cannot handle the child,” says Jund, adding that the teen has been moved to a home again.Commenting on children without any clinical disease, Dr. Sunil Gupta, MD psychiatrist, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) says, “The situation is exposing the faults in our parenting. As far as parenting is concerned most of the parents try to control their children rather than understand . If we focus on the understanding part we might sort it out in better way.”Of other distress calls coming in, Jund says, “It’s happening probably because of people getting too stressed because of anxieties due to the Covid-19 outbreak. With schools closed and movement restricted, wards are stuck at home. Also, parents are burdened with work pressure as well as other issues.”In most cases, a child who had had a standoff with his or her parents was not admitted to a shelter, Jund said.Minors elope, call for help after restaurant closedThe helpline has been flooded with requests during the lockdown. Staff had to recently rescue two minors who had eloped from home but got stranded in another city and finding no hotel or restaurant open had panicked and called for help.In another case, a student called demanding a smartphone saying his parents had restricted his phone use.A number of poor children too had called saying they had problems accessing online classes because of lack of smartphones. “In this case we told them we do not provide such devices,” Jund adds.“Parenting has become a little bit tougher. Children are staying indoors all the time. This results in behavioural changes and emotional issues. Also, the screen time (spent before TV, with mobile phones) has gone up because of the online classes these days,” says Nitin Goyal, president, The Parents’ Association, Chandigarh.“Parents have to be more supportive and understanding. The golden part of the lockdown is that families are spending more time together,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/can-my-child-be-sent-to-a-shelter-request-from-parents-leaves-childline-staff-baffled/story-IIGaJifTtmEIcbvoQgKNMN.html
19-05-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown 4.0 no different, migrant miseries continue||From walking hundreds of miles on the highways to queuing up government offices, the ordeal of migrant labourers seems to be endless. Agitated migrants continued to visit the office of Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) with a host of complaints even on the first day of lockdown 4.0 on Monday.A group of garment factory employees, who walked all the way from Tajpur Road, were seen arguing with a security of guard at the DC office. Mohd Tazim, of Araria district of Bihar, said that despite having a booking, they were denied to travel on a train to Bihar on May 14.“We were told to get a medical clearance for travelling in bus but were given no information on where to catch a bus to Bihar. We had got a medical screening conducted at the civil hospital with great difficulty. We remained stranding for hours without food and some of us received a cane on the back. We are suffering for obeying the law while many who have bribed the agents and middlemen have reached their destination,” said Tazim.UNEMPLOYMENTS, HUNGER MAKING THEM LEAVEThough shops and factories opened on Monday, many migrants are still keen to go back to their homes as they have been fired from their jobs and have no money to buy essentials, including food. Leena, a woman who along with her husband and two children longs to return to their native village at Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, said, “Our two children are asking for food but we do not have anything left at home. We had last received government ration 10 days ago which has finished. Even if we will receive ration we do not money to refill the cooking gas cylinder.”She said she was not enrolled under the government’s Ujjawala Yojana scheme under which three cylinders are given free of cost. “I am not alone there are many residents, in the area where we live, who are not covered under the scheme and are going through a tough time.” Subash Chandra, a migrant who had been residing with his family in a rented accommodation in Mundian Kalan, said he was returning to his village in Aligarh as he no longer has a job. “I was working in an auto parts manufacturing unit at Phase 5 Focal Point. The factory has opened but the employer has asked me and some more employees to not come to work. It is useless to stay here when there is no work,” he said.As per data on the Punjab helpline portal, as many as 16 lakh migrants have applied to go back to their home states, of which 50% are from Ludhiana.On Monday, around 22,000 migrants left for their native places via trains and buses from Punjab. Of this, 13,000 migrants are from Ludhiana alone. As many as 15 buses carrying migrants left for 10 districts in Uttar Pradesh, including Mathura, Meerut, Saharanpur, Bulandshahar, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Hapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-4-0-no-different-migrant-miseries-continue/story-6nf9B2N8U53lVvcdrqQSVO.html

Shopping malls, cinemas and theatres will also remain shut.Consumption of liquor, paan, gutka or tobacco in public places is not allowed. Shops will ensure minimum six-foot distance among customers and will not allow more than five persons on the premises at a time.CITY IS STILL UNDER RED ZONEChandigarh will continue to be in the red zone till further orders. However, there will be a regular review of the status by the UT health department. Six containment zones as delineated and designated earlier will continue. There will be a regular review of the boundaries of containment zones and other additions/deletions of areas.In the containment zones, only essential activities will be allowed. There will be a strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining supply of essential goods and services.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, said: “We have allowed relaxations as per the central government guidelines. We will also be regularly reviewing the red zone tag for the city. Now the difference between containment and non-containment zones is of primary importance.”REGULATIONS ON PUBLIC GATHERINGS TO STAYWedding-related gatherings are to ensure social distancing, and the maximum number of guests allowed is 50. In funeral-related gatherings, maximum number of attendees can be only 20. In order to implement these measures, the UT order states that the district magistrate will deploy executive magistrates as incident commanders in the respective local jurisdictions.

19-05-2020||Delhi||Migrants arriving in Delhi stranded at Ghazipur||Shafiqul Islam, a migrant labourer, had arrived in Delhi from Jammu on a special train on Saturday. The 26-year-old helplessly wandered around the city for two days in search of a bus to his village near Bihar’s Katihar city. He reached the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border in Ghazipur on Monday, deciding to walk home.Islam had gone to Jammu with a group of 36 migrants in search of work three days before the nationwide lockdown was announced in March. “We could not earn a penny. We exhausted all our savings in the last two months. Some of us had to ask our families to send money. When we got to know that trains are going to Delhi, we decided to book tickets and leave. We arranged for ₹1,300 each for the tickets to come here. Now, we don’t know what to do since buses are not available,” he said.The group has walked for two days continuously, climbing flyovers and bridges, in the scorching heat. “We heard today (Monday) that buses are ferrying people to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar from Ghazipur. We walked for four hours from the inter-state bus terminal (ISBT) to Ghazipur, only to get disappointed further. We are ready to go home on foot, if the police allow us,” he said.Migrant workers arriving in Delhi on trains from other states have been stranded at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border in Ghazipur, as they try to make their way back home to Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bihar.With trains from several states operating only up to Delhi, those who had made reservations on other trains till their home towns are waiting at the railway station, while many, who have run out of money, have decided to walk home.Deepak Kumar, chief public relations officer of the Northern Railways, said, “Those who are arriving in special trains, and are not from Delhi, are arranging for their travel home on their own. We are only facilitating their travel in trains.”A spokesperson for the Delhi government said that the parent states of the migrants should arrange for their transport home, since the Delhi government has “no role” in this process.A senior official in Delhi government’s transport department said, “The Delhi government is not mandated to arrange inter-state transport. We are have already arranged the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses to drop them at the borders. From tomorrow, all our state-run buses will start plying within the city. Also, cabs, autos and para-transit modes will be available. So, things will further smoothen out.”Scores of migrants have been rendered helpless upon reaching the national Capital, in the absence of inter-state transportation facilities. A majority of such migrants present at Delhi-UP border on Monday said they cannot afford to pay hefty fares to travel home.Ram Bahadur, 53, who worked as a welder in Jammu, arrived in Delhi on Monday morning. He has been trying to reach his home town in UP’s Faizabad since April 24 — the day his 28-year-old daughter died. “After trying for a month, I got a ticket confirmation on Saturday. The DTC bus outside the railway station dropped us at the Delhi-Noida border. Where do I go now? I could not see my dead daughter, but I at least want to go home to be with my inconsolable wife. She will die of grief,” said Bahadur.A senior police official said that the majority of the migrant workers gathered at Delhi-UP border in Ghazipur in the last two days had arrived in New Delhi on special trains operated from other states, with their final destinations in Uttar Pradesh. “These people were dropped up to the Ghazipur border in DTC buses. Many even walked up to the border, trying to cross over into UP, but were not allowed by the UP police. As a result, they were stranded here,” said the official.Gangesh (who goes by his first name), 26, a migrant worker from UP’s Unnao said that the state government should not have started the trains before arranging for inter-state buses. He said that his group of five had booked bus tickets to Unnao with a travel agency. “The five of us had paid ₹14,000 together. We had to ask our parents to send money. We were told that the buses will be available here, but when we reached, there was no bus operating. We don’t even have money to buy food. Why doesn’t the government think about people like us before taking these decisions?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/migrants-arriving-in-delhi-stranded-at-ghazipur/story-o900YJo9I1qhFISDKuNUBM.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt allows all construction work to resume in city||The Delhi government’s decision on Monday to allow all construction activity in the city to resume has come as a huge relief to builders and property owners, whose projects have been stuck for over 50 days, as well as lakhs of construction workers who can now get back to work and earn a livelihood.Builders and construction firms in the capital welcomed the decision and said they will start work at the earliest after assessing the market situation. Harvinder Singh, managing director or Gridtech Construction Pvt Ltd, said, “We are ready to start the construction work at our sites. I got calls from my labour contractors who have assured me that they have the manpower ready to start work immediately. We will do a basic assessment and resume work.”Although the Delhi government had allowed some construction work to resume, based on the Union government’s order in the first week of May, it was restricted to projects where labour was available on-site. This meant that only construction work on government projects could start.While construction firms are ready to start work, property owners said shortage of labour may hamper the progress on private projects.Prem Prakash Gupta, a property owner in Kotla Mubarakpur, said his residential project is stuck due to a shortage of hands. “I started the work a few months before the lockdown. I continued to pay the labour for almost two months after the lockdown, as I didn’t want them to go. But last week, more than half of them left for their home towns. The cost of construction material has also increased. ”For labourers, the decision has come a ray of hope after months of struggling to a make ends meet. Narendra, a labour contractor in Rohini, said property owners are not ready to restart work owing to fears of contracting Covid-19. “We have been told to wait. People are reluctant to allow workers inside their houses. It will take some time before our work picks up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-allows-all-construction-work-to-resume-in-city/story-szAznFdGuSXf6JJGm5yVJK.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Firms want to restart work in full swing, but fret over employee safety||With the Delhi government allowing all government and private offices in the city to resume operations with full workforce from Monday, while at the same time urging private establishments to encourage employees to work from home as much as possible, companies are mulling over plans to bring back its staff to offices while ensuring their safety.After chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s address on Monday, announcing relaxations during the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown, which was enforced on March 25 to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), many companies said employee safety and risk mitigation will be their priority in the coming weeks. Some said they might follow the CM’s advice and continue to allow employees to work from home for another two weeks.Many employers said while resuming work in full swing will help companies bounce back from the financial crisis they currently find themselves in, the health of employees was of primary importance. “We welcome the Delhi government’s announcement, but it is a double-edged sword. The number of Covid-19 cases is still on the rise in the city and if even one employee is found Covid-19 positive in our office, then it will collapse our entire system. All factors have to be considered before we call employees back to offices,” Pallavi Dev Burman, talent acquisition head at Star Technology Developers, a tech company in south Delhi’s Nehru Place, said.She said while her company is yet to decide on whether to call employees back to office from this week, the concerns of having to bring about a complete revival of company’s fortunes runs just as deep as the safety of all employees.“Safety is definitely our priority, but even one positive case can lead to added costs as our office premises will be shut completely,” she said.A call centre service, MeetRix Private Limited, based out of Green Park, said since they have nearly 150 employees on their two floors of office space, the number of employees being called in will depend on how close to the workplace these employees reside as well as their work profile. The limited space in office will not allow social distancing, the company executive said.“We understand that the government is yet to restart Metro services, which is the primary mode of transport for most of our employees, many of whom are women. Those living close by and having private vehicles may be called in. It will also depend on whether they are needed urgently in the office or if they manage from home,” Gurpreet Singh Chahal, co-founder MeetRix, saidMany employees were worried that not resuming Metro services in the national capital will limit travel options.“Not everyone can afford to travel in cabs and auto rickshaws daily. There should have been some consideration for people who travel on public transport as well,” Rituraj Ray, who works in a private firm in Vasant Kunj, south Delhi, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/firms-want-to-restart-work-in-full-swing-but-fret-over-employee-safety/story-wzLXEkbr9Up1xgDTZjR1WL.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s transport network back today||Over 50 days after all public modes of transport were taken off the national capital’s roads, as part of the nationwide lockdown from March 25 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Delhi government Monday said it is opening up all modes of transport, except the Metro, to allow free movement of people in the city. This means that Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses and cluster buses, all forms of cabs, autos, electric and cycle rickshaws, gramin sewas and RTVs (small sized buses) will be allowed to operate from Tuesday, in addition to private cars and two-wheelers.While making the announcement during a digital media briefing Monday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said all transport modes will be allowed to operate with restricted passenger intake and adherence to strict social distancing norms. No such movement, except for essential services, will be allowed in the 73 containment zones of Delhi. “Auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws will run, but will be allowed to have only one passenger each. Likewise, taxi and cabs will be allowed to carry a maximum of two passengers. Gramin sewa, eco-friendly sewa and phat-phat sewa will also have a cap of two passengers per vehicle. Maxi cabs will be allowed up to five passengers, an RTVs up to 11 passengers,” Kejriwal said.He added that the drivers will have to sanitise the vehicles after every run. On buses, the chief minister said, only 20 passengers will be allowed at a time and the transport department will ensure social distancing at bus stops. In the case of private four-wheelers, two people in addition to the driver will be allowed, whereas for two-wheelers pillion riders will not be allowed. A senior government official said passes will no longer be required for movement inside the city. Shreya Gadepali, transport expert and south programme lead at the Institute for Transportation and Development (ITDP) ,said besides providing citizens access to services, transport undertakings must also prioritise the health and safety of its staff, who are completely exposed to the disease, on the road and at its facilities. “These efforts will go a long way in building public trust and ensuring that people continue to use public transport. Covid-19 provides Indian cities with an opportunity to transform their public transport services by improving user experience through technology and reforming informal transit services,” she said. 4,000 MARSHALS AT 740 BUS STOPS Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said his department has identified 740 bus queue shelters that see a heavy rush throughout the day. The department will deploy 4,000 marshals at these stops in two shifts to ensure social distancing and to conduct thermal screening of those waiting to board. Senior officials said the department will to procure contactless thermal screening devices within the next three days. Delhi has a total of 6,487 buses, which include 3,746 buses of the DTC and 2,741 cluster buses.“We will be deploying as many as six marshals at busy bus queue shelters such as those at AIIMS, Badarpur and Uttam Nagar terminals. Once a bus has 20 passengers, it will stop only to allow passengers to alight, and only then will new passengers be allowed to board. There will be one passenger per two seats and all will be seated in zigzag pattern. Entry will be through the rear door and exit through the front door,” Gahlot explained. When asked about contactless ticketing, the minister said the One Card will continue to be accepted. But, since many may not have these cards, usual paper tickets will issued as of now. “As a long-term solution, we are already working on a system wherein passes can be issued to passengers. Women will continue to get free rides,” he said. Wearing masks will be mandatory, but downloading the Aarogya Setu app will not be compulsory. The buses will be sanitised after every trip and conductors and drivers will have to undergo mandatory thermal checks before starting each trip. NO CLARITY ON INTERSTATE MOVEMENT The Delhi government order on Monday did not mention specifically about interstate movement of people. The order only stated that interstate and intrastate movement of medical professionals, nurses and paramedical staff, sanitation personnel and ambulances will be allowed, “without any restriction”. It also added that interstate movement of all types of goods and cargo carriers will be allowed.Since the government has allowed government and private offices to open, and industries and construction activities to resume, lack of clarity on interstate movement may pose a difficulty to staff residing in neighbouring cities. The order also did not talk about contract carriage buses, private buses which are extensively used as chartered buses by office-goers.Senior government officials acknowledged that the point was missed in the guidelines issued Monday.“Since there is no mention about contract carriage buses, it is unlikely that private bus operators will resume their services for now. Unless our buses are requisitioned by the government, normal services for office purposes and so on are unlikely to start,” Harish Sabharwal, general secretary of Delhi contract bus association, said.Gahlot said he will soon convene a meeting to resolve the issue.NO SHARED RIDES IN CABSMobile app-based cab aggregators Uber and Ola said they will restart services in the capital starting Tuesday. The Delhi order stated that no pool or shared rides will be allowed in the city till May 31. In a statement, the Uber India team said a passenger should not sit in the front, next to the driver.“If you are booking a car or an auto ride, to maintain social distancing, we recommend not more than two riders should travel at a time, besides the driver,” it said. Ola said driver-partners operating three and four-wheelers on its platform will be available but “with the highest levels of safety precautions”.“This also brings relief to millions of drivers-partners whose livelihoods depend on serving citizens on a daily basis. In all of the 160+ cities where Ola is now operational, enhanced safety protocols are applicable across every single trip. This includes compulsory mask usage for driver-partners and passengers, complete sanitization of cars post-trips, adhering to social distancing norms by limiting passengers to two,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/capital-s-transport-network-back-today/story-sdhPEkCf0W7URpiXaQ8g6H.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Traders express doubts over odd-even scheme even as Delhi shops get ready to open up||After a two-month hiatus, a half of Delhi’s shops will finally be up and running from Tuesday, based on the odd-even formula devised by the Delhi government and with proper social distancing norms in place. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced that shops in the city will reopen with odd-even formula except those selling essential items — including books and stationery shops, electrical goods shops selling fan etc, in markets and market complexes — which will remain open on all days. Most traders welcomed the decision as a much needed step towards stepping towards normalcy. Some, however, were apprehensive about the implementation of the odd-even scheme.The odd-even scheme of the Delhi government is a traffic rationing measure, taken up during peak pollution season mostly, under which private vehicles with registration numbers ending with an odd digit is allowed on roads on odd dates and those with an even digit on even dates.As per the scheme, even-numbered shops will open on even numbered days and vice versa.Hours after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the relaxations in lockdown norms on Monday, market associations held meetings to chalk out the plan with help from local police.Almost all markets such as Connaught Place, Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, Greater Kailash-I, Kamala Nagar Market, among others, have decided to reopen shops from Tuesday. But the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal said they will keep the heritage market shut till May 31. Parts of Sadar Bazar market is also likely to remain shut due to its proximity to containment zones in the area. Traders here said that there was no clarity as to which shops can open here.“We have voluntarily decided to remain shut till May 31. The government has announced relaxations without declaring red, orange and green zones, which should have been done first. The number of cases are on a rise and our area is close to a containment zone,” said Sanjay Bhargava, president of Sarva Vyapar Mandal, which has around 800 shops on the main road.Traders from Karol Bagh market associations too appeared divided over opening of shops and said they will take a decision in a day or two.Chandni Chowk market is close to containment zones of Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim, Sadar Bazar, and Ballimaran. The district has reported at least 100 positive Covid cases so far. Traders in adjoining bylanes (katras) — which house a number of wholesale markets such as Khari Baoli (spices) and cloth market, among others — said they were yet to take a decision regarding reopening of shops.While majority of markets have agreed to open, market associations expressed apprehension about the implementation of odd-even scheme. We have decided to open shops as per government order, but implementing the odd-even scheme is not practical,” said Sanjiv Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders Association.He added, “There are two-three shops registered under one number (for example, 1, 1A and 1B). How will we decide which shop to open and which one to close? We will take up the matter with the government.”The problem was the same in Kamala Market and at Greater Kailash. “There is no clarity on how it will be implemented as there are two-three shops in one property on different levels,” said Naresh Sambher, president of north Delhi’s Kamala Nagar market.In some buildings, there is a shop in the basement. “What happens to the basement shops? When will they open? We are trying to work out the details,” asked Rajinder Sharda, president of GK-I M-Block market.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Monday urged the Delhi government to reconsider the odd-even scheme and provide an alternative. “The odd-even concept will not work smoothly for business operations. Traders are interdependent for procurement of goods. The government should come up with an alternate scheme,” said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general, CAIT.Brajesh Goyal, national convener, chamber of trade and industry (CTI), said decision to open shops on odd-even arrangement was taken with the consent of traders unions and it was in their interest. “We will start disinfection drive in markets tomorrow starting from Kashmere Gate area,” said Goyal. For industrial area, the government has proposed staggered timing. Ashish Garg, secretary of Narela Industrial Complex Welfare association, “The working hours are anyway restricted from 7am to 7pm. Staggered timing will only further bring down the number of hours of work.”Despite implementation issues, traders are happy to be back in business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traders-express-doubts-over-odd-even-scheme-even-as-delhi-shops-get-ready-to-open-up/story-iY5newCUU0vXnRB5gHSrhJ.html

That’s how coaches in the Indian Super League (ISL) operate at this time of the year, three months prior to pre-seasons. Ferrando says he is getting ready to be Sergio Lobera’s successor at FC Goa like he would in “normal times”.Ferrando is linking up with the fitness coach every morning, getting the team doctor on WhatsApp to inquire about previous injuries, watching games to understand the Indian Super League (ISL) and preparing individual programmes for players who can train outside. “This is a moment to learn,” he says.Also Read | Premier League clubs agree to return to small-group training from TuesdayIf that sounds like a lot of work in the time of lockdown, it is. After all, Ferrando is replacing someone who took FC Goa to two ISL semi-finals, one final and a Super Cup title in three seasons. In 2020-21, FC Goa will also be the first team from India in the main round of the Asian Champions League by topping the league phase of ISL 6.“I go for a run for one or two hours every day to take my mind off football. The rest of the day is about programme, planning and players,” says Ferrando, 39, on a Zoom call, from his home in Barcelona.Then he lowers his glasses, looks into his screen as if to digitally lock eyes with the questioner, and says: “But this is not really football. One month without it is okay but two months is so hard… and you can’t see Espanyol play at home.”Also Read | The 10 youngest debutants in 21st century in LaLiga historyUncertainty in the time of Covid-19 also isn’t helping the new coach “close” his squad - especially new foreign players - by August-September for six or eight weeks of pre-seasons assuming ISL 7 would begin in late October. “The pre-seasons prepare muscles and players’ psychology because the next season would be a hard season,” says the man who has a doctorate from the University of Zaragoza’s department of medicine. Ferrando’s thesis was on how body vibration training helps spot jumps of professional footballers. He has also been fitness, tactical and technical coach at Espanyol’s football school. Ferrando’s interest in sports science - he has degrees and diplomas from University of Barcelona - took him to Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal and to Brighton when Gus Poyet was manager. It was an opportunity to learn coaching, says Ferrando who was also the personal trainer of Cesc Fabergas and Robin van Persie.A coach since he was 18, Ferrando has also learnt from Marcelo Bielsa - “crazy coach but an inspiration about lot of things,” he says about the Argentinean - Pep Guardiola, Thomas Tuchel, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte who “was perfect at Chelsea (in 2016-17).”Intensity, innovation, verticality, the importance of possession and attacking football unite those famous names. Statements such as “protecting the ball is good,” and “keeping the ball is important” followed from Ferrando. “If the focus is positive, of course, you can lose but maybe you will have more options to win,” he says. It’s an idea Lobera, who like Ferrando spent time at FC Barcelona, wedged deep in FC Goa; one he fine-tuned with increased defensive discipline in 2019-20 before the sudden departure.“There are, however, certain tactical details I would want to change but let that stay a secret,” says Ferrando.Now with Mumbai City FC, Lobera sealed a 2021 Champions League berth for FC Goa. Indians clubs have done poorly in Asia last season and that was in the AFC Cup, the continent’s second-tier competition. “Our mentality will be competitive,” says Ferrando.Will ISL allowing five imports in the playing 11 and the continent following the 3+1 rule, including one player of Asian origin, add to his squad-building problems? “We will take the best three players who can help the team. In this moment, we are in that position,” says Ferrando the fifth Spanish coach in the 10-team ISL.As assistant-coach Ferrando was part of Moldova’s FC Sheriff campaign in Europe. His biggest moment as a coach though came in Greece when Ferrando helped Volos NFC win successive promotions and move from third to first division between 2017 and 2019 before leaving because of an eye problem. “We had players hungry about their future and players with experience. There was also a good feeling in the dressing room,” he says.To create that feeling of team spirit, it is crucial that everybody enjoys what they are doing, he says. “You need to find exercises to enjoy. I am not a military type coach like many Serbians and Russians,” says the polyglot who can speak Spanish, English, Russian, Greek and Catalan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/working-from-home-juan-ferrando-gets-ready-for-fc-goa/story-ZsxEq1AH6HoSXjIpIVaM8O.html
19-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi ends 14-day mandatory quarantine for all health workers||Doctors, nurses and other staff members at hospitals designated to treat Covid-19 in Delhi will no longer be put under 14-day quarantine after their Covid-19 duty, according to the new guidelines of managing health care workers issued by the Delhi health secretary Padmini Single on Monday.Staff will have to go into quarantine only if they have had a “high risk exposure” such as them treating Covid-19 patient or handling their samples without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) or probable breach of PPE protocol. The quarantine will also be required if a staff comes in in contact with a positive person ( within a distance of 1m) for more than 15 minutes without mask, face shield or goggles.“Regular quarantine of health care workers after performing duty in Covid-19 areas is not warranted except as elaborated under protocol of high risk and low risk contact,” the order reads.So far, most Covid-19 hospitals have been following a rotation roster, whereby the staff worked for 14 days and remained in quarantine for 14 days. “As the incubation period of the virus is 14 days, a quarantine and then testing of those working in Covid-19 wards would ensure that they do not pass on the infection to their families or to other patients that they might treat afterwards,” Dr Shivaji Barman, president of the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA), said.On Monday, FORDA wrote to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan asking him to reconsider the guidelines of the health ministry.“The virus has an incubation period ranging from two to 14 days following exposure. There are multiple instances of doctors testing positive for Covid-19 following the second test or subsequently. Also, many asymptomatic patients are testing positive for Covid-19. Under the current circumstances, a 14-day quarantine along with adequate testing for all doctors following Covid-19 duty is a necessity in order to prevent spread of the infection among their colleagues, family members and in the community,” the letter said.As for non-Covid-19 hospitals, the order directs them to create separate isolation wards to admit suspected Covid-19 patients referred by flu corners to ensure that the infection does not spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-ends-14-day-mandatory-quarantine-for-all-health-workers/story-wp44edKWrlqr8h40CHT0mN.html
19-05-2020||City||Liquor shops set to open, those in malls to remain shut||As the Delhi government eases restrictions in the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown, 700-odd liquor shops in the city – including around 100 that have been functioning since May 4 – are likely to open later this week, a senior government official said on Monday.All 700-odd shops are either standalone enterprises or located in markets. None of them are in shopping malls. The Delhi excise department is likely to issue a separate order on liquor shops in a day or two, the official said.Delhi has 864 liquor shops, of which around 150 are located in malls and prohibited spaces such as the airport. Such liquor shops will not be allowed to function under the Union home ministry’s guidelines released on Sunday, the official said.Out of the 700 shops, around 200 have been identified as ‘standalone’ and would be allowed to function all days a week. The remaining 500 will have to follow the odd-even rule applied to all markets, under which enterprises would be allowed to operate on alternate days depending on their shop number, the official said.In the last two weeks, around 100 liquor shops in the city that have been functioning saw massive crowds and rampant violation of social distancing norms, forcing the government to start an e-coupon system under which one can apply online and visit a designated liquor shop on a given date and time to avoid queues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-shops-set-to-open-those-in-malls-to-remain-shut/story-eilInZcqFROy9z1cdwPgTL.html

Officials said they also need to check the effect of the chemical on the water that comes out of the STP after treatment.“The treated water gets into Sutlej River through Buddha Nullah and we need to ensure that it does not affect the water quality and aquatic life,” said PPCB superintending engineer Sandeep Behl.MC superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said, “The government and the civic body are working to stop industrial waste from getting into the STP. But even with the industrial waste getting into the plant, the trial is giving good results. The black water that earlier used to come out of the STP has diluted and water quality has also improved. The MC has also sent the samples for testing separately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ppcb-collects-samples-as-ludhiana-mc-treats-sewage-with-poly-aluminium-chloride/story-XtuqUCeoUui9P20Mr6JQDI.html

The road is also aimed at reducing traffic in Chandigarh and Mohali by serving as a ring road to connect Kharar with Zirakpur as well. It will also connect to the Kurali road that leads to Rupnagar and Morinda.GMADA has acquired around 120 acres for the 200-foot wide road, which will begin from New Sunny Enclave (near KFC), connecting to Mullanpur, New Chandigarh near the cricket stadium. The Rs 130-crore project is scheduled to be completed in 18 months. Land for the project has been acquired in Sunny Enclave, Daun village and Mundi Kharar.GMADA chief engineer Sunil Kansal said, “The project was delayed due to the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The agency, Rajinder Infrastructures Private Limited, which has been allotted the project, has already begun its survey and work will be completed in nearly 18 months.”The 18km stretch connecting Kharar to Zirakpur was completed around four years ago, but work on the road connecting Kharar to New Chandigarh has been pending over last four years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delayed-by-lockdown-construction-of-kharar-mullanpur-road-begins/story-4D5BbKdTeuQDMJBh5mrz8H.html

19-05-2020||Pune||Air, river, noise pollution in Pune fall by unprecedented levels: PMC report||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) carried out a scientific study of the impact of lockdown on Mula-Mutha river, noise and air pollution and found out that the city has performed exceedingly well and the readings are even better than those recommended by the central pollution control board (CPCB).According to environment officer Mangesh Dighe, the PMC carried out this survey in March and April, and some of the data was collected till May 15. “We have received surprising results and Mutha river quality is getting improved drastically and some parameters are better than the norms given by CPCB,” Dighe said.“There are three parameters that show the water quality in a river. First is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), secondly the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and thirdly the dissolved oxygen (DO). In all the three parameters there is a drastic improvement and BOD and COD have come down below the CPCB parameters. The main reason for this is commercial establishments, offices, hotels have closed down so the sewage generation has reduced,” Dighe added.Before March 2020, the BOD level was 61.61 in Mula-Mutha river which came down to 32.09 in April during the lockdown. The COD level was 159.68 before lockdown which came down by 67.7 per cent.“The pollution control board expects it below 150 but it came down drastically. The dissolved oxygen level improved from 3.19 to 4.6 which is good. If all these levels are maintained, the river would remain clean and pollution-free,” Dighe said.Like the river, there is also an improvement in noise pollution. Noise levels in the city have come down in all the three categories which are commercial, residential and silence zones. The noise level came down below those prescribed by the pollution board.Dighe said, “As the number of vehicles on the road has come down in the city during lockdown, the air quality has improved drastically. PMC collected data from the Indian institute of tropical meteorology (IITM) and found that on all parameters there is an improvement in the air quality of the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-pollution-at-a-record-low-readings-better-than-cpcb-recommendation/story-jjSg2HSylBriIJ3cmue2rN.html

They had last appeared for an exam on March 18 after which the board postponed the exams in view of the coronavirus outbreak.Srishti Verma, a Class 12 commerce student of BCM Senior Secondary School, Basant Avenue, said, “Since the imposition of the lockdown, I have started reading newspaper daily to keep myself updated with the current affairs and also read up online regarding the situation globally. Now, I will plan my day in a way that I can continue reading novels along with the preparations for the examinations. I am left with only two exams -- computer science and business studies.”Another Class 12 student of humanities stream from Guru Nanak International Public School, Gaganpreet Kaur, said, “I was left only with Punjabi examination, but was shocked on not finding it in the datesheet declared by the board. When I called up my class in-charge, I got to know that the subject’s date will be decided by the regional office and will be intimated to us soon.” “Meanwhile, I have started preparing for the examination.”CBSE city coordinator Paramjit Kaur said, “We are coordinating with the regional office, Chandigarh, to know the date for Punjabi examination. As soon as we get to know the date, it will be intimated to the board affiliated schools and students across the city.”GUIDELINES FOR CENTRESAs per the CBSE guidelines, at the examination centres, 12 students will be accommodated in one room at a distance of 1 metre each and one invigilator will be deployed in each room.

19-05-2020||City||After 55 days, Ludhiana shops open to lukewarm response||With Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh easing the curfew to give way to a lockdown, shops in Ludhiana finally opened after a gap of 55 days. The shopkeepers, visibly relieved after getting back to business, welcomed the customers with smiles. Though most say that the footfall was less, they are hoping that the situation will improve in the coming days. Ghumar mandi market association president Pawan Batra said, “We saw only 10% of the normal footfall but hope that it increases in the next few days. As a precautionary measure, we have deputed staff with thermal scanners at the entry points of shops and are also providing masks to residents who come to the market with a handkerchief covering their mouth. Also social distancing is being strictly observed in all shops and these are functioning with 33 to 40 per cent staff,” said Batra.Gurcharan Singh, a garment store owner in Chaura Bazar, said that around 85% of the shops in the market opened on the first day of the fourth phase of the lockdown.”We received a lukewarm response from residents today but that was expected. However, there was a considerable rush in the markets and we are confident that the business will pick up steam in the coming days,” he said. Some shopkeepers demanded that the administration should allow them to open shops till 8pm as fewer people step out in the day these days due to the soaring temperature. Model Town market association (regd) president Amarjit Singh said, “ If shopkeepers are allowed to run their businesses till 8pm, they would be able to cater to more customers.Today, the shopkeepers were asked to shut their shops by 6pm.” Dilpreet Singh, a resident of Wait Ganj area, said residents had been eager to throng the markets as they were stuck inside their homes for 55 days. “I stepped out to purchase grocery items but took care to avoid the busy streets. Everyone must take care to practise social distancing else the relaxation could turn fatal for us.”Meanwhile, traffic jams were witnessed in old city areas including Saban Bazar, Dal Bazar and Jagraon bridge. Police were making rounds of market areas, urging the people to maintain social distancing. Industry relieved as supply chain restored The industry has heaved a sigh of relief as with the opening of shops, supply chain has been restored. Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja said that it will help the cycle industry, but the auto sector is still going through a slump. “Textile and hosiery industry is also facing a crisis as these units have to commence production for winters but they are apprehensive of low demand, he added.United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) president DS Chawla said opening of shops is a good sign as hardware, fasteners and other material required by the industry would be available now. People should also stick to the Covid-19 guidelines to contain the infection, he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-55-days-ludhiana-shops-open-to-poor-response-from-customers/story-sLeQ99Ey3GHRIkGEkwGz3H.html

19-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt accepts Priyanka Gandhi’s proposal to run 1,000 buses for migrants||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday decided to accept Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s proposal for the party to run 1,000 buses to help ease the movement of migrant labourers in the state. The development comes a day after chief minister Yogi Adityanath targeted the Congress over the ‘migrant labourers’ transit’ issue as the party lined up buses on the UP-Rajasthan border in Bharatpur.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has thanked the chief minister for giving her party the permission to run these buses. “@myogiadityanath ji saving life of people, protecting the poor and their dignity is our moral responsibility and right in the time of this pandemic. In this difficult time, the Congress is doing its duty of service as per its capability. Running these buses is an extension of our service…. We thank you for giving permission to the Congress to run 1000 buses on its cost to help thousands of brothers and sisters walking down. I assure you that we will continue to stand with the people of UP affected by lockdown, with a feeling of positivity,” said Priyanka Gandhi in her tweets.Earlier in the day, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi, in a letter addressed to the private secretary of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, asked for a list of buses, along with names of driver/conductor and other details immediately.“Please refer to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s letter dated May 16, 2020 addressed to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. I have been asked to say that your proposal relating to migrant labourers has been accepted. Provide a list of buses, along with the name of driver/conductor and other details immediately so that they can be used for the service of migrant labourers,” said Awasthi in the letter dated May 18.The Congress welcomed the state government’s move within minutes, saying it was ready with the list and more details sought by state government would be sent at the earliest.“We welcome the state government’s decision. Our 400-500 buses have been waiting on the border since Sunday. We are compiling details and will submit the list at the earliest,” said Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhna Mishra.“Both the ruling party and the opposition should work together and it is time for cooperation from both the sides. We hope the move will be beneficial in easing the problem. No one will appreciate the move if turns out to be a game of political one-upmanship,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of the department political science, Lucknow University.In her letter sent to the chief minister on Saturday, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had requested the state government for permission to run 1,000 buses.“The Congress, in its responsibility towards hapless migrant labourers, wants to run 500 buses from the Ghazipur border of Ghaziabad and another 500 from the Noida border. All India Congress Committee will bear the cost of running these buses. We want permission to run 1,000 buses following all norms for protection against Covid-19 pandemic to help the migrant labourers,” said Priyanka Gandhi in the letter that a party delegation delivered to chief minister’s office on Saturday. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Ajay Kumar Lallu and Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra led the delegation.Priyanka Gandhi, in her letter, further said, “Lakhs of migrant labourers are returning from different corners of the country. No arrangement has been made for the safe return of these migrant labourers walking down to their homes. So far, 65 migrant labourers have died in different road accidents.”Priyanka Gandhi had also taken to Twitter on Sunday and posted a video featuring buses queued up in a row.“Our buses are standing at the border. Thousands of migrants and labourers are walking in the heat. Please give permission CM Yogi Adityanath ji, let us help our brothers and sisters,” she had said.In another tweet, she had said, “Respected chief minister, I am requesting you, this is not the time for politics. Our buses are standing on the border. Thousands of labourers and migrants, without eating anything, are walking towards their homes. Let us help them, give permission to our buses.”The same day, the chief minister had said, “The politics by Congress in the coronavirus crisis must be flayed.”Without mentioning Congress governments, he blamed them for the Auraiya tragedy, saying that one of the trucks responsible for the death of the migrants came from Punjab and the other truck was from Rajasthan.At least 25 migrant workers were killed when a truck rammed into a stationary truck from behind on the highway in Aurairya on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-accepts-priyanka-s-proposal-to-run-1-000-buses-for-migrants/story-kbaT8u09ya7iwStt2FZFFI.html

19-05-2020||World||UN chief recommends scaled-back UN meeting of world leaders amid pandemic||Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is recommending that the annual gathering of world leaders in late September, which was supposed to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, be dramatically scaled back because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Guterres suggested in a letter to the president of the General Assembly that heads of state and government deliver prerecorded messages instead, with only one New York-based diplomat from each of the 193 U.N. member nations present in the General Assembly Hall.Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande has said a decision on the annual gathering will be made after consultations with U.N. member states.The meeting of world leaders usually brings thousands of government officials, diplomats and civil society representatives to New York for over a week of speeches, dinners, receptions, one-on-one meetings and hundreds of side events.This year was expected to bring an especially large number of leaders to U.N. headquarters to celebrate the founding of the United Nations in 1945 on the ashes of World War II.But New York has been an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic with over 190,000 cases and nearly 16,000 confirmed deaths.Guterres said in the letter, first reported by the Press Trust of India and obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press, that although September is some months away “the medical community anticipates that the pandemic will continue to cycle with varying degrees of severity, depending on the ability of the affected nation to implement aggressive identification, testing, tracing and containment measures.”“It is expected, therefore, that international travel restrictions may remain in place for some destinations — meaning quarantines might affect travelers to and from New York City,” he said.While the General Assembly could consider postponing the high-level meeting to a date in 2021, he said it would be better to hold it at the start of the new General Assembly session in September.This will allow the U.N.’s work “to continue uninterrupted, albeit in a different format, and for world leaders to convey their views on important international issues, including on the international response to the pandemic, as well as to hear the views of other leaders,” Guterres said.General Assembly spokeswoman Reem Abaza reiterated Tuesday that “no decision has been made yet” regarding the annual gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-recommends-scaled-back-un-meeting-of-world-leaders-amid-pandemic/story-4CzchlptGAwW6qCzBXgzjO.html

The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.The extent of Gulf Arab ties with Israel is still mostly kept private, though. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have allegedly used Israeli spyware to go after government critics.Oman, which has ties with Iran, hosted the Israeli prime minister in a surprise visit in 2018 that served to remind Washington of its unique ability to be a conduit for talks.But such ties remain highly contentious among the Arab public, particularly as the Palestinians remain without a state of their own despite decades of talks.Israel and the Palestinian Authority imposed sweeping lockdowns in mid-March aimed at containing the virus, limiting travel and public gatherings and forcing nonessential businesses to close. Many of the restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks as the rate of new infections has declined.Israel has reported more than 16,600 cases and around 270 deaths, with more than 13,000 of the patients having recovered. The Palestinian Authority has reported around 390 cases and two fatalities, with around 340 people having recovered.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying conditions.The Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, will reopen next week after the conclusion of a major holiday marking the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan. It follows weeks of closure aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. It had been closed since March over the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/etihad-airways-to-fly-aid-for-palestinians-in-first-known-flight-between-uae-and-israel/story-uTUTznmzzDtNES4qjuL16O.html
19-05-2020||World||Unemployment in UK highest since 1996; severe recession likely, says Rishi Sunak||Unemployment claims in Britain jumped by a record amount in April to their highest level since the 1990s, underscoring the impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the economy despite government programs to keep workers on payrolls.Treasury chief Rishi Sunak downplayed the chances of a swift recovery in a parliamentary hearing. He could not, in short, pledge to secure every job or business. An immediate bounce back is not a given.“Obviously the impact will be severe,” he said. “We are likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have never seen.”Jobless claims surged by 856,000 in April, to 2.1 million, the highest since 1996 and an increase of 69% from the month before, the Office of National Statistics said Tuesday. The figures covered only the first weeks of the lockdown, said Jonathan Athow, a statistician at the ONS.As bad as it was, economists suggested it could have been much worse. The government created a job retention program to prevent millions of people from being laid off by effectively putting them on the government payroll. Britain’s Treasury said Tuesday that 8 million people have been put on furlough schemes and that a further 2 million self-employed people have applied for income support.“The fact unemployment hasn’t already shot up far higher given the huge fall in GDP and temporary closure of around a quarter of businesses is a good result for the government,” said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics. He said that reflects the fact so many people have been furloughed rather than being made redundant.The government wage support scheme is due to ask employers to share costs from August, so job losses could accelerate if employers decide that their businesses can’t survive and give up.Among the sectors hit hardest were hospitality and construction. Job vacancies also dropped sharply, with the number of empty posts falling by 170,000 to 637,000 in the three months to April compared with the previous quarter.The unemployment rate was at 3.9% in March, the last month for which full labor market statistics are available. Experts predict it will rise toward 10% by the fall.Economist Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank said that would mean an increase in the number of unemployed workers to around 3.3 million from about 1.35 million in March — far exceeding the previous peak of 2.7 million in October 2011 in the wake of the financial crisis. Others think it could rise far higher, especially if there is a second peak in the virus.An unemployment rate peak of 10% would still be well below the rate in the U.S., where the jobless rate hit 14.7% already in April and is forecast to rise further.The British government also announced Tuesday it was quadrupling the size of loans available to larger businesses which have been affected by the coronavirus crisis, many of whom have already used the job retention scheme to put workers on furlough.The Treasury said companies will now be able to receive up to 200 million pounds ($245 million) under the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, from 50 million pounds before. The scheme is available for firms with an annual turnover of more than 45 million pounds.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said the change “will help ensure that more businesses of all sizes get access to the finance they need to help weather this unprecedented economic storm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unemployment-in-uk-highest-since-1996-severe-recession-likely-says-rishi-sunak/story-USAO9Ik6wsYPQL8bggRT4N.html
19-05-2020||World||Coronavirus threatens ‘years of progress’ on climate issues||The coronavirus pandemic threatens to derail any progress made in recent years to deal with the climate change crisis, organizers of the annual gathering of business and political elites in the Swiss ski resort of Davos said Tuesday.In a survey of industry professionals that reassesses the risks to the global outlook in light of the pandemic, the World Economic Forum said “years of progress” on addressing climate change could be undone and that it is important for countries to make sure environmental issues are at the heart of recovery plans.“We now have a unique opportunity to use this crisis to do things differently and build back better economies that are more sustainable, resilient and inclusive.” said Saadia Zahidi, the WEF’s managing director.The WEF warned that “omitting sustainability criteria in recovery efforts or returning to an emissions-intensive global economy risks hampering the climate resilient low-carbon transition.”At the most recent gathering in Davos in January, climate issues dominated the week’s discussions and many companies, as well as national governments, insisted that dealing with global warming would be central to their programs over the coming years. Spurred on by young climate activists, such as Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate, promises were made to meet the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.Since then, though, everything has been upended by the coronavirus, which has forced much of the world to impose unprecedented lockdowns of their societies. The economic damage and the difficulties involved in lifting the restrictions are having a colossal economic impact, with tens of millions of people around the world losing their jobs and many countries facing potentially the deepest recessions since World War II.The nearly 350 senior risk professionals in industries from retail to manufacturing who were surveyed for the report fretted most about the economic impact, with 68% identifying a “prolonged global recession” as most likely over the coming 18 months. A surge in bankruptcies and industry failures also featured highly, as did concern over another COVID-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-threatens-years-of-progress-on-climate-issues/story-4Q6A5eiv7tYfhnX3zJ1H0J.html

Each porcupine or civet, a catlike species previously linked to the sever acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic in the early 2000s, will bring a payout of about 600 yuan (US$84),” it added.Neighbouring Jiangxi province has also released documents on plans to help farmers dispose of animals and financial aid.The state-run Jiangxi Daily newspaper reported last week that the province has more than 2300 licensed breeders, mostly rearing wild animals for food.“Their animals are worth about 1.6 billion yuan ($225 million),” the report, quoted by AFP, said.On February 24, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, or China’s top legislature, adopted a decision on thoroughly banning the illegal trading of wildlife and eliminating the consumption of wild animals to safeguard people’s lives and health.The same week it was announced that the government had stepped up oversight of illegal wildlife trade via e-commerce platforms.“More than 750,000 pieces of information about wildlife trade were removed or blocked from major e-commerce platforms while 17,000 online stores or accounts were closed,” Liang Aifu, an official with the State Administration for Market Regulation, was quoted as saying by the state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quit-wildlife-trade-get-cash-chinese-provinces-to-farmers-amid-pandemic-pressure/story-ezWUA5lV3owY115Yi4VIhL.html

At the reunion event, organised by Xi’an police, Mao emerged from a side door to a conference room and ran into his mother’s arms. “I don’t want him to leave me anymore. I won’t let him leave me anymore,” Li said as she held onto her son’s hand. Mao, who runs a home decoration business in Sichuan, told CCTV he would move to Xi’an to live with his birth parents.There are no official statistics on the number of children who disappear every year in China, but a system was established in 2016 to send alerts about missing children through social media and mobile phone texts.Police have helped more than 6,300 abducted children to reunite with their families over the past decade through the DNA matching system, official news agency Xinhua reported.Kidnapping and child trafficking became widespread in China from the 1980s, when the draconian one-child rule was enforced, with a cultural obsession with sons also fuelling demand for kidnapped babies.prw/rox/je/fox||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-abducted-as-child-in-china-reunited-with-parents-after-32-years/story-8QHHt0YFpPoKedOokAzntM.html
19-05-2020||World||China bows to pressure, co-sponsors WHO resolution for Covid-19 probe||The World Health Assembly on Tuesday agreed to an independent probe into the WHO’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak that has come under criticism from several countries, particularly the United States.It asks the WHO director general Tedros Adhanom to have an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the international response to the crisis, including a probe of WHO actions and “their timelines pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic”.The resolution, initially drafted by the European Union, was co-sponsored by more than 130 countries.Chinese President Xi Jinping, which had all along been against a probe into the Covid-19 origin or the response, had yesterday underlined that Beijing was all for a comprehensive probe but only after the world had got a grip on the disease that has impacted infected millions.Watch: China agrees for probe on Covid origin, vows $2 billion for WHO But China, which has been accused of concealing information about the disease, had to give up that stance in face of pressure from far too many countries.The United States, which has played a lead role in the campaign against China and the World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom, forced the matter by firing a strongly-worded letter threatening to exit the WHO.US President Donald Trump’s letter, which accused China of hiding crucial information about the disease, was a sharp contrast to the administration’s nominee at the WHA who did not name China through his speech, only referring to Beijing as “one country”.US secretary of health and human services Alex Azar told the World Health Assembly that the pandemic had “spun out of control” in great part due to a costly “failure” by the WHO, and called for a more effective world body.“There was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,” Alex Azar told the annual assembly.The United States, which had reservations about a portion of the resolution that also backs the right of poor countries to ignore patents to gain access to a Covid-19 vaccine or treatment, also put aside its concerns to back the resolution that echoed its views on the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.Diplomats in Geneva, however, indicate that the final report that emerges at the end of the review of the global response to the outbreak may end up being a balancing act. Since the review would be in consultation with the member states, it is likely that a version which is too harsh would be considered unacceptable by either party, China or the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bows-to-pressure-co-sponsors-who-resolution-for-covid-19-probe/story-0pP8sOcRVNr3I5sVwHjXYM.html

These incidents come a week after another attack in which six army personnel, including one officer, were killed.Local media reported that a vehicle of the Frontier Corps (FC), a wing of the Pakistan Army, in Mach was targeted using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which led to six soldiers were killed.In a separate incident at Kech, another soldier, Sipahi Imdad Ali was killed in an exchange of fire with militants.Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari also took to Twitter to condemn the incident. She said that terrorist outfits were coming under “increased pressure” as they were increasingly isolated internationally. She added that “Pakistan continues to make gains in its fight against terrorism”.Earlier this month, five FC soldiers and one officer were martyred after their vehicle was targeted with an IED near the Pakistan-Iran border.In a tweet, the military’s media wing said the security personnel were returning from patrolling in Buleda — 14 kilometres from the Pakistan-Iran border — to “check possible routes used by terrorists in the mountainous terrain of Makran”. As they were returning, their vehicle was targeted with a remote controlled IED, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-pak-soldiers-killed-in-terror-attacks-in-balochistan/story-YGF2Wylh2lwozL9LjxPsbJ.html

It is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the first and second Jewish temples in antiquity.The site has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and perceived encroachments by Israeli authorities and hard-line Jewish groups have ignited clashes on a number of occasions. Israel says it has no intention of changing the status quo at the site.The site is in east Jerusalem, which Israeli seized in the 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state.Israel and the Palestinian Authority imposed sweeping lockdowns in mid-March aimed at containing the virus, limiting travel and public gatherings, and forcing nonessential businesses to close. Many of the restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks as the rate of new infections has declined.Israel has reported more than 16,600 cases and around 270 deaths, with more than 13,000 of the patients having recovered. The Palestinian Authority has reported around 390 cases and two fatalities, with around 340 people having recovered.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jerusalem-s-al-aqsa-mosque-to-reopen-after-muslim-holiday/story-WmHFM02u6qBt7BzfEdzbQK.html

And the spokeswoman said: “The European Union backs the WHO in its efforts to contain and mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak and has already provided additional funding to support these efforts.”Not for the first time, this puts Brussels in opposition to Washington, where Trump has accused the UN health agency of being too close to China and of being slow to react to the COVID-19 outbreak.On Monday, the US leader -- who has already frozen US funding for the WHO -- wrote its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to lay out the charges and threaten to pull out.“They’re a puppet of China, they’re China-centric to put it nicer,” he explained.Beijing has furiously denied the US allegations that it played down the threat and Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated at the World Health Assembly that his nation had been “transparent” throughout the crisis.Brussels is backing an independent inquiry into how the epidemic erupted and spread, but has tried to lead an international, multilateral response to the crisis and raise funds for vaccine research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-solidarity-not-finger-pointing-eu-backs-who-after-trump-pull-out-threat/story-6QVGIo9si2gTGjh2wPTdzO.html

Opposition parties say he was too slow to impose a lockdown, too slow to introduce mass testing and too slow to get enough protective equipment to hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-death-toll-nears-43-000-report/story-ZopPtHSdnpqZcgnhRSqsRM.html
19-05-2020||World||Beijing says Donald Trump ‘shirking responsibility’ to WHO||Beijing on Tuesday accused Donald Trump of smearing China and shirking American responsibilities to the World Health Organization, after the US president threatened to pull out of the UN health body.The American leader has been locked in a bitter war of words with Beijing, alleging it covered up the initial outbreak in central China late last year before the disease spread globally, causing economic devastation and claiming lives across the planet.Trump on Monday called the WHO a “puppet of China” before tweeting a letter he had sent to the organisation’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus threatening to make permanent a temporary freeze on funding from the US.China in response accused Trump of trying to “smear China” and “shirk responsibility and bargain over its international obligations to the WHO”, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing Tuesday.“The US leader’s open letter you mentioned is full of hints, ‘perhaps’, and ‘maybes’, and tries to use specious methods to mislead the public, and achieve the goals of smearing China’s anti-virus efforts, and shirk responsibility for the United States’ own insufficient response,” Zhao said.“The US tries to use China as an issue to shirk responsibility and bargain over its international obligations to the WHO. This is a miscalculation and the US has picked the wrong target.”More than 317,000 people have died of COVID-19 out of nearly 4.8 million infections worldwide, and governments are scrambling to contain the virus while seeking ways to resuscitate their hammered economies.Zhao added the US was attempting to deflect from its own “insufficient prevention and control” against the virus.With more fatalities and cases in the United States than any other country by far, under-pressure Trump has blamed the WHO for not doing enough to combat its initial spread.“The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” Trump’s letter read. China urges the US to “stop shifting the blame” and instead focus on containing the virus, Zhao said at a regular press conference.Earlier Monday the WHO said it would launch an independent review of the response to the coronavirus pandemic, and Chinese President Xi Jinping said China supports a “comprehensive evaluation” of the global response to the pandemic after it has been brought under control.Governments including the US and Australia had previously called for an investigation into the origins of the virus.But Zhao said Tuesday that the draft motion currently under discussion at the World Health Assembly is “completely different from the so-called ‘independent international inquiry’ into the pandemic previously mentioned by Australia”.He added that Australia should be willing to “change its ways” and “completely abandon its political manipulation of the pandemic”.Beijing has furiously denied US allegations that it played down the threat, and Xi reiterated at the WHO’s World Health Assembly on Monday that his nation had been “open, transparent and responsible” during the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-says-donald-trump-shirking-responsibility-to-who/story-Eeic0zIWkoeSRcEkjtcpPM.html
19-05-2020||World||UK government accused of virus testing failures||An influential group of British lawmakers is accusing the government of failing to conduct enough tests for the new coronavirus, saying the lapse helped Covid-19 cut a deadly swath through the country’s nursing homes.The House of Commons’ Science and Technology Committee says that “testing capacity has been inadequate for most of the pandemic so far.” In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, committee chairman Greg Clark said Britain’s testing capacity “drove strategy, rather than strategy driving capacity.” The UK authorities initially sought to trace and test everyone who had been in contact with people infected with the coronavirus. But they abandoned that strategy in mid-March as the number of infections overwhelmed the country’s limited testing capacity.Click here for the full coronavirus coverage Clark, a lawmaker from the governing Conservatives, said that “pivotal” decision meant that nursing home residents and staff were not tested “at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant.” Thousands of nursing home residents have died with Covid-19.The country’s testing capacity has now been scaled up to more than 100,000 tests a day, and the government plans to reintroduce a “test, track and trace” policy as part of plans to control the virus and ease the nationwide lockdown.But the committee also said that “it is not clear that the lessons of the delays to testing have been learned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-accused-of-virus-testing-failures/story-snCv5kTWCdu6ivH9kvkhwO.html

But China’s persecution of the Panchen Lama is not unusual,” Pompeo said.He called on the Chinese government to immediately make public the Panchen Lama’s whereabouts and to uphold its own constitution and international commitments to promote religious freedom for all persons.The United States, he said, remains deeply concerned about PRC’s ongoing campaign to eliminate the religious, linguistic and cultural identity of Tibetans, including through the ongoing destruction of communities of worship and learning, such as the Larung Gar and Yachen Gar Buddhist Institutes.Tibetan Buddhists, like members of all faith communities, must be able to select, educate and venerate their religious leaders according to their traditions and without government interference, he said.In 1995, a young Tibetan boy Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was recognised as the 11th Panchen Lama, the second highest spiritual authority in Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama.However, Nyima disappeared days after, becoming the world’s youngest political prisoner.China, which claims Tibet as its own territory, named another boy Gyaltsen Norbu to the position. He is said to be living under a close surveillance in mainland China.However, the Tibetan Parliament in India, known as the Kashag, continues to recognize Nyima as the sole legitimate holder of his title.India’s Dharamshala is home to the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama as well as the Central Tibetan Administration, often known as the Tibetan government-in-exile.China has grown increasingly wary about who will succeed the 14th Dalai Lama, who lives in India on exile. The current Dalai Lama, who is 84, was designated by high priests as the next Dalai Lama when he was just 2.According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, when the current Dalai Lama passes away, he will reincarnate as another person. China has maintained that it has the authority to appoint the successor to the 14th Dalai Lama, who is loyal to Beijing.While Beijing views the Dalai Lama as a separatist who seeks to split Tibet from China, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize laureate says he only seeks greater rights for Tibetans, including religious freedom and autonomy.China says Tibet for centuries has been its territory well before the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) took control of the region in 1950.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-calls-on-china-to-immediately-make-public-panchen-lama-s-whereabouts/story-EIhpyyJXMpdE9kfhDeRSpJ.html

The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” Trump said in a letter to Tedros Adhanom.In his four-page letter, Trump detailed every occasion since December last when, according to the US, the WHO did not act on the available information, made misleading claims or gave the world bad advice.WHEN TRUMP HIT THE EJECT BUTTONThe US quit the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) accusing the UN agency of anti-Israel bias. Donald Trump administration pulled out the US from United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2018 accusing the body of being a “hypocritical and self-serving” besides holding a chronic bias against IsraelThe US has started the process to exit from 2015 Paris climate agreement on grounds that staying in the global pact hurts the United States’ economic competitiveness. Trump announced his intention to exit the pact in 2017Donald Trump set a October 2019 deadline to exit the Universal Postal Union over postal rates but stayed put after the organisation arrived at a last-minute compromise last year.Trump gave Tedros Adhanom 30 days to commit to major substantive improvements, warning that if the WHO doesn’t deliver on this, “I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership”.Trump’s letter was sent hours after the WHO’s policy making body began its meeting on Monday. At this meeting, China, which had opposed a probe into the origin of the virus that has killed nearly 3.2 lakh people and infected millions across the world, was forced to back down. The formal resolution is expected to be passed today.Trump’s letter did not spell out the improvements or reforms that he was looking for. “My administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organisation,” he wrote.Also Read: ‘The only way forward for WHO is...’: Full text of Trump’s letter to WHO chiefDiplomats in Washington and Geneva told Hindustan Times that Trump’s letter, which had put the WHO chief on notice, appeared to be prepping the ground for a possible exit from the WHO. Watch: Donald Trump threatens to permanently halt funding to WHOIt is argued that the WHO could not carry out any substantive reforms in a rush. The WHA, which has representatives of 194-member nations, is meeting over video conference for a truncated session that is to end in a few hours.“Any major reform, like the one the US President appears to be looking for, can only be made with the approval of the general body, the WHA,” a diplomat said.To be sure, this isn’t the first time that the Trump administration has spoken about walking out of the UN’s health body. But the letter to the WHO boss makes the threat formal.Donald Trump does have a track record of pulling the United States out of international agreements and organisations when he doesn’t get his way. Trump has already led the US out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Human Rights Council and last year, came close to backing out of the Universal Postal Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-puts-who-s-tedros-on-notice-over-covid-19-says-might-exit-who/story-SgDkcaXGzeLNQop2zlKtEN.html

We also call on all the G20 leaders to honour existing global health commitments,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kailash-satyarthi-among-88-noble-laureates-leaders-call-for-usd-1-tn-to-protect-children-amid-covid-19/story-eV3QcMMeATcZ4KN5kOCbTN.html
19-05-2020||World||Massive coincidence? Study says coronavirus adapted too quickly to humans, raises questions on its origin||The novel coronavirus is ideally suited to infect human cells rather than animal ones, a new study by researchers in Australia claims, raising questions about the origin of the virus, which has until Tuesday killed over 3.18 lakh people and infected more than 4.8 million globally.Using an “in silico” or computer simulation method, the researchers found that the data generated indicated “… SARSCoV2 is uniquely adapted to infect humans, raising questions as to whether it arose in nature by a rare chance event or whether its origins lie elsewhere”.A team of four researchers, including two trained in India, tested the binding affinity of Covid-19 virus’ “spike protein” to humans and several animals including pangolins.Also read: 4,970 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours push India’s tally past 1 lakh-mark“Notably, SARSCoV2 spike protein had the highest overall binding energy for human ACE2 (a receptor on cells), greater than all the other tested species including bat, the postulated source of the virus. This indicates that SARSCoV2 is a highly adapted human pathogen,” the study found.The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and is now available on the prestigious US-based Cornell University’s pre-print server.An independent expert spoke to HT and said the research was plausible but the evidence put out to support it was thin.China has consistently cited international research to deny that the virus originated in a high-security biology lab in Wuhan Institute of Virology. The central Chinese city of Wuhan is where the Covid-19 disease broke out late last year.Also read: Covid-19 response, China’s offer of help - All about day 1 of WHO sessionThe four researchers of the paper, however, were surprised at the rapid rate at which the virus adapted to humans. “Normally a virus will bind tightly to the cells of its normal host species and less tightly to cells of species it has not infected before. The surprise with Covid-19 is that we found that it bound tightest to human cells than any other species we tested. This is either a massive coincidence or Covid-19 has somehow, in the past, been adapted for human cells. One way in which this can happen is via culture with human cells in a lab,” lead researcher Nikolai Petrovsky, a clinician and vaccinologist, told HT over email.The other researchers involved are Sakshi Piplani and Puneet Singh - both are bioinformatics scientist originally trained in India - and David Winkler, a professor of biochemistry and genetics.Piplani and Petrovsky are affiliated to the Flinders University in Australia. Singh is with Vaxine Pty and Winkler is affiliated to the La Trobe University.“Yes, this virus looks and behaves as if it is perfectly adapted to humans. That is a surprise for a virus that has apparently just entered humans for the first time,” Petrovsky said.He added that zoonotic events, where pathogens jump from animal to human are not rare and have been regularly witnessed in diseases like Ebola, bird flu, MERS etc.“What is rare is to not find any animal source of the virus. For example, for MERS it was rapidly identified to be coming from camels, SARS from bats via civet cats, Ebola from bats via monkeys. So far, no animal source has been found for Covid-19 – this may still be found, but its absence allows other possibilities to be considered.”Not everyone, like Richard H Ebright, from the department of chemistry and chemical biology at the US’s Rutgers University is fully convinced.“The conclusion of the paper that the virus was ‘pre-adapted for human transmission’ is consistent with the scenario of lab ‘gain-of-function’ research followed by a lab accident,” Ebright told HT over email.“Gain-of-function” is a scientific research term, which means accelerating research that improves the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.However, the evidence for that kind of an incident in a lab is thin in the paper, Ebright added.“However, the evidence for the conclusion of the paper that the virus was ‘pre-adapted for human transmission’ is thin,” he said.Petrovsky said their study shows the need to carry out more research into the origins of the coronavirus.“Of course, we know there were institutes in Wuhan that were researching bat and pangolin coronaviruses to which Covid-19 is most closely related, with genetic elements from both. It is certainly possible that if both viruses ended up in a cell culture together, which is not unheard of in a lab due to cross-contamination, then a new variant virus could be created just as it does in an animal that is infected by two viruses at the same time,” he said.“Both scenarios are equally possible, hence the need to do further investigation to see if either of these is the most likely explanation.”The need for further investigation is also emphasised in the research paper.“Given the seriousness of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is imperative that all efforts be made to identify the original source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”The researchers added: “In particular, it will be important to establish whether Covid-19 is due to a completely natural chance occurrence where a presumed bat virus was transmitted to humans via an intermediate animal host or whether Covid-19 has alternative origins. This information will be of paramount importance to help prevent any similar human coronavirus outbreak in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-massive-coincidence-study-says-coronavirus-adapted-too-quickly-to-humans-raises-questions-on-its-origin/story-4yHc2Tz1t8AJqJMGAZKG8O.html

While the warning does not name China, it follows that from American agencies which were explicit in naming it.A statement in this regard was issued jointly by Canada’s Communications Security Establishment or CSE and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).CSIS pointed to “an increased risk of foreign interference and espionage.” It noted it is working with such potentially vulnerable organisations “to ensure that their work and proprietary information remains safely in their control. Its focus is on protecting Canadian intellectual property from these threats.”The Communications Security Establishment assessed that it was “near-certain that state-sponsored actors have shifted their focus during the pandemic and that Canadian intellectual property represents a valuable target,” according to the statement.“With regards to the specific threats, the Cyber Centre has assessed that the Covid-19 pandemic presents an elevated level of risk to the cybersecurity of Canadian health organizations involved in the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” the statement added.Also read: ‘The only way forward for WHO is...’ - Full text of Trump’s letter to WHO chiefIt also underscored coordination with the United States in the effort to safeguard intellectual property related to coronavirus research and development activity, as the statement said, “We regularly share information with our partners, including the US, which has a significant impact on protecting our respective countries’ safety and security.”This statement comes in the wake of that issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in America. The US has openly named China and its agencies as being the attempts to steal such critical research at this time.The Canadian statement comes after the CSE had issued a public alert in March in which it had warned that such attempts at piracy of proprietary knowledge was to be expected, as it said then: “These actors may attempt to gain intelligence on Covid-19 response efforts and potential political responses to the crisis or to steal ongoing key research towards a vaccine or other medical remedies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/increased-risk-of-foreign-interference-and-espionage-canada-warns-of-threat-to-its-covid-19-effort/story-EwH6gDhIUlCiQhzekI7sBP.html

19-05-2020||World||‘The only way forward for WHO is...’: Full text of Trump’s letter to WHO chief||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday took to Twitter and shared the four-page long letter that he has written to World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. In his tweet, Trump said that the letter is “self-explanatory”. Time and again, the US president has accused the global health body for supporting China during the coronavirus pandemic.“The WHO failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself,” Trump’s letter read.Trump said that the WHO “consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December” and concluded his letter by saying that “the only way forward for the WHO is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China.”This is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is self-explanatory! pic.twitter.com/pF2kzPUpDvHere’s the full transcript of the Trump’s letter to the WHO chief:Dear Dr. Tedros:On April 14, 2020, I suspended United States contributions to the World Health Organization pending an investigation by my Administration of the organization’s failed response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This review has confirmed many of the serious concerns I raised last month and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization’s alarming lack of independence from the People’s Republic of China. Based on this review, we now know the following:•The World Health Organization consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal. The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself.• By no later than December 30, 2019, the World Health Organization office in Beijing knew that there was a “major public health” concern in Wuhan. Between December 26 and December 30, China’s media highlighted evidence of a new virus emerging from Wuhan, based on patient data sent to multiple Chinese genomics companies. Additionally, during this period, Dr. Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China’s health authorities that a new coronavirus was causing a novel disease that was, at the time, afflicting approximately 180 patients.• By the next day, Taiwanese authorities had communicated information to the World Health Organization indicating human-to-human transmission of a new virus. Yet the World Health Organization chose not to share any of this critical information with the rest of the world, probably for political reasons.• The International Health Regulations require countries to report the risk of a health emergency within 24 hours. But China did not inform the World Health Organization of Wuhan’s several cases of pneumonia, of unknown origin, until December 31, 2019, even though it likely had knowledge of these cases days or weeks earlier.• According to Dr. Zhang Yongzhen of the Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center, he told Chinese authorities on January 5, 2020, that he had sequenced the genome of the virus. There was no publication of this information until six days later, on January 11, 2020, when Dr. Zhang self-posted it online. The next day, Chinese authorities closed his lab for “rectification.” As even the World Health Organization acknowledged, Dr. Zhang’s posting was a great act of “transparency.” But the World Health Organization has been conspicuously silent both with respect to the closure of Dr. Zhang’s lab and his assertion that he had notified Chinese authorities of his breakthrough six days earlier.• The World Health Organization has repeatedly made claims about the coronavirus that were either grossly inaccurate or misleading.- On January 14, 2020, the World Health Organization gratuitously reaffirmed China’s now-debunked claim that the coronavirus could not be transmitted between humans, stating: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) identified in Wuhan, China.” This assertion was in direct conflict with censored reports from Wuhan.- On January 21, 2020, President Xi Jinping of China reportedly pressured you not to declare the coronavirus outbreak an emergency. You gave in to this pressure the next day and told the world that the coronavirus did not pose a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Just over one week later, on January 30, 2020, overwhelming evidence to the contrary forced you to reverse course.- On January 28, 2020, after meeting with President Xi in Beijing, you praised the Chinese government for its “transparency” with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a “new standard for outbreak control” and “bought the world time.” You did not mention that China had, by then, silenced or punished several doctors for speaking out about the virus and restricted Chinese institutions from publishing information about it.• Even after you belatedly declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, you failed to press China for the timely admittance of a World Health Organization team of international medical experts. As a result, this critical team did not arrive in China until two weeks later, on February 16, 2020. And even then, the team was not allowed to visit Wuhan until the final days of their visit. Remarkably, the World Health Organization was silent when China denied the two American members of the team access to Wuhan entirely.• You also strongly praised China’s strict domestic travel restrictions, but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border, or the ban, with respect to people coming from China. I put the ban in place regardless of your wishes. Your political gamesmanship on this issue was deadly, as other governments, relying on your comments, delayed imposing life-saving restrictions on travel to and from China. Incredibly, on February 3, 2020, you reinforced your position, opining that because China was doing such a great job protecting the world from the virus, travel restrictions were “causing more harm than good.” Yet by then the world knew that, before locking down Wuhan, Chinese authorities had allowed more than five million people to leave the city and that many of these people were bound for international destinations all over the world.• As of February 3, 2020, China was strongly pressuring countries to lift or forestall travel restrictions. This pressure campaign was bolstered by your incorrect statements on that day telling the world that the spread of the virus outside of China was “minimal and slow” and that “the chances of getting this going to anywhere outside China [were] very low.”• On March 3, 2020, the World Health Organization cited official Chinese data to downplay the very serious risk of asymptomatic spread, telling the world that “COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza” and that unlike influenza this disease was not primarily driven by “people who are infected but not yet sick.” China’s evidence, the World Health Organization told the world, “showed that only one percent of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days.” Many experts, however, citing data from Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere, vigorously questioned these assertions. It is now clear that China’s assertions, repeated to the world by the World Health Organization, were wildly inaccurate.• By the time you finally declared the virus a pandemic on March 11, 2020, it had killed more than 4,000 people and infected more than 100,000 people in at least 114 countries around the world.• On April 11, 2020, several African Ambassadors wrote to the Chinese Foreign Ministry about the discriminatory treatment of Africans related to the pandemic in Guangzhou and other cities in China. You were aware that Chinese authorities were carrying out a campaign of forced quarantines, evictions, and refusal of services against the nationals of these countries. You have not commented on China’s racially discriminatory actions. You have, however, baselessly labeled as racist Taiwan’s well-founded complaints about your mishandling of this pandemic.• Throughout this crisis, the World Health Organization has been curiously insistent on praising China for its alleged “transparency.” You have consistently joined in these tributes, notwithstanding that China has been anything but transparent. In early January, for example, China ordered samples of the virus to be destroyed, depriving the world of critical information. Even now, China continues to undermine the International Health Regulations by refusing to share accurate and timely data, viral samples and isolates, and by withholding vital information about the virus and its origins. And, to this day, China continues to deny international access to their scientists and relevant facilities, all while casting blame widely and recklessly and censoring its own experts.• The World Health Organization has failed to publicly call on China to allow for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, despite the recent endorsement for doing so by its own Emergency Committee. The World Health Organization’s failure to do so has prompted World Health Organization member states to adopt the “COVID-19 Response” Resolution at this year’s World Health Assembly, which echoes the call by the United States and so many others for an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review of how the World Health Organization handled the crisis. The resolution also calls for an investigation into the origins of the virus, which is necessary for the world to understand how best to counter the disease.Perhaps worse than all these failings is that we know that the World Health Organization could have done so much better. Just a few years ago, under the direction of a different Director-General, the World Health Organization showed the world how much it has to offer. In 2003, in response to the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, Director-General Harlem Brundtland boldly declared the World Health Organization’s first emergency travel advisory in 55 years, recommending against travel to and from the disease epicenter in southern China. She also did not hesitate to criticize China for endangering global health by attempting to cover up the outbreak through its usual playbook of arresting whistleblowers and censoring media. Many lives could have been saved had you followed Dr. Brundtland’s example.It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world. The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China. My Administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste. That is why it is my duty, as President of the United States, to inform you that, if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America’s interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-only-way-forward-for-the-who-is-full-text-of-trump-s-letter-to-who-chief-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus/story-MCee8MiYg9NYh7gPcYMGRO.html

The data comes from eight people who took part in a 45-subject safety trial that kicked off in March. The Moderna vaccine is one of more than 100 under development intended to protect against Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19. Overall, the study showed the vaccine was safe and all study participants produced antibodies against the virus.“These are significant findings but it is a Phase 1 clinical trial that only included eight people. It was designed for safety. Not for efficacy,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved in the study.The very early data offers a glimmer of hope for a vaccine among the most advanced in development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-developers-report-first-positive-sign-in-human-trial/story-FsuAwE2dscboq65orUBZcL.html

The world was “paying a heavy price” for the sometimes contradictory strategies, he added.China offers helpChinese President Xi Jinping voiced support for a joint approach, vowing in his address to make any vaccine his country developed available for all.A WHA resolution tabled by the European Union calls for an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the international response to the coronavirus crisis.US health secretary Alex Azar called for an independent review of “every aspect” of the UN health agency’s response to the pandemic.While Tedros welcomed that call, he stressed there was no need to dramatically overhaul the WHO. Tedros said that the immediate need was to strengthen, implement and finance the systems and organisations, including the WHO.Despite swelling tensions, countries hope to adopt a resolution by consensus.Taiwan decision delayedMember states steered clear of a controversial discussion on whether to grant Taiwan observer status, a move vehemently opposed by Beijing, which considers the island part of its territory.Nearly 15 states, including Belize, Guatemala and Honduras, wanted the question of Taiwan’s participation to be added to the WHA agenda.Washington has also been increasingly vocal, with demands that Taiwan be allowed in as an observer.But amid fears the row would overshadow the global health body’s work to address the Covid-19 crisis, members unanimously agreed Monday to postpone the discussion until later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-response-china-s-offer-of-help-highlights-of-the-first-day-of-key-who-session/story-8DAHGjtqaL3EFfzH5hXQYK.html
19-05-2020||World||Taking anti-malaria drug HCQ to protect against Covid-19: Trump||US President Donald Trump on Monday announced he has been taking the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine along with a zinc supplement he has touted as a game-changer in the battle against Covid-19 despite warnings of fatal side-effects issued by his own drug regulator, backed since by studies.“You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers, before you catch it. The front-line workers -- many, many are taking it. I happen to be taking it. I happen to be taking it -- Hydroxychloroquine,” Trump told reporters unprompted at a roundtable with restaurant owners, who have been hit the hardest as a sector.“I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this,” he added, addressing the effect of his stunning announcement on reporters and the country. Trump said he feels fine, has no symptoms and has tested negative repeatedly. He is using the drug combination as a prophylactic, he said, like “many frontline” health workers and doctors. He was not prescribed the drug combination by the White House physician, he clarified, but was given the go-ahead when he checked with him.Commander Sean Conley, the president’s physician from US Navy, said in a statement that after a member of the president’s staff tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago — the valet — he and Trump had numerous discussions regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine and “we concluded the potential benefit from treatment (using the drug) outweighed the relative risks”.Commander Conley added that he continues to monitor studies and reports about the use of the antimalarial drug and in consultation with public health officials and experts he anticipates “employing the same shared medical decision-making based on the evidence at hand in the future”.The US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency-use authorization for hydroxychloroquine for clinical trial and to be administered to patients under close supervision of physicians it as also warned of side-effects such as “potentially life-threatening heart rhythm problems”.The drug’s side-effects have been corroborated in an increasing number of studies in the United States and abroad.Cardiac arrest was found to be a key side-effect in a large observational study of the use of the antimalarial drug in combination with the antibiotic among more than 1,400 Covid-19 patients in New York hospital, according to an announcement by University of Albany researchers last week. By itself, hydroxychloroquine had no side-effects. But the drugs, in combination or separately, were found to have had no significant benefits.This was the largest study yet of the drug’s safety and efficacy for treating Covid-19 patients, but it was observational. Results of randomized clinical trial, the gold standard for drugs, is awaited.President Trump had noticeably stopped touting the drug around the time, but it appears he had been using it already by then, convinced by what, as he said Monday, he was hearing from hundreds of doctors and people.The president is leery of studies and analyses that question the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and its earlier avatar chloroquine. And on Monday, he dissed an earlier study of patients conducted by the Department of Veteran Affairs, telling reporters it was conducted among very ill patients, suggesting, therefore, it was not tried as a preventative, which is how he has been using it.President Trump began promoting the drug as a “game-changer” mid -March when Covid-19 had begun to take a heavy toll on the country with spiking infections and fatalities. Experts of the White House task force would shortly say they feared the virus could kill 100,000 to 240,000 Americans.Two weeks later, President Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi to request him to allow a large US order of hydroxychloroquine to go through. India, a leading manufacturer of medicines and supplier of 40% of over-the-counter drugs in the US, had banned the export of more than two dozen drugs at the time to protect and preserve its supplies from China’s predatory shopping spree driven by its panicky response to growing global outrage over its failure to contain and kill the epidemic that started on its soil in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-is-taking-antimalarial-drug-hcq-as-prophylactic-against-covid-19/story-xKKUYsHovzQByntRr8lACP.html

The measures will be effective from May 19.Australia has fueled tensions with China in recent weeks by calling for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, with a focus on wildlife wet markets. Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said on Sunday that the country would challenge any duties imposed by China in the World Trade Organization. Barley exports to China were worth A$1.4 billion ($898 million) in 2017.China’s embassy in Canberra has warned its citizens might be offended by Australia’s behavior and choose to travel to alternative destinations and send their children to universities in other countries — threatening Australia’s two key service exports.Meat imports from four Australian processing plants have also been suspended by China. However, the Chinese government has denied any link to the call for a probe into the virus, describing the ban as a health and safety issue.“China never says it’s retaliation, but China does have a history of using agricultural trade as a political lever, going back at least 10 years,” Tim Hunt, Rabobank’s head of food and agribusiness research for Australia, said earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slaps-anti-dumping-duty-on-australian-barley-for-5-years/story-Zyu9SOSoDmRTH3FKCcZFvN.html

Plans are being crafted to slash this because “we’re not treated right.”“They gave us a lot of bad advice,” he said of the WHO.Trump spoke as the WHO held its first annual assembly since the pandemic swept the world after originating in China, causing massive economic disruption and killing 316,000 people -- close to a third of them in the United States.Trump said China only pays about $40 million a year and one idea was for Washington to bring “our 450 down to 40,” but “some people thought that was too much.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-who-puppet-of-china-says-us-may-cut-funds-to-world-health-body/story-FiFQJkinhD8pVNQzuHpqvM.html

19-05-2020||World||Indian envoy to UK retires after a ‘roller-coaster ride’||Ruchi Ghanashyam, who was only the second woman Indian high commissioner to the UK since independence when she took over in December 2018, has retired and is leaving for home this week after a term she described as a “roller-coaster ride” on Monday. The first woman to hold the top job in India House was Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, from 1954 to 1961. For 57 years, London waited for another woman high commissioner, and then two come along. Ghanashyam is to be succeeded by Gaitri Issar Kumar, ambassador in Belgium.Ghanashyam’s short term was busy: General elections were held in India and the UK, besides prolonged debates over Brexit with hopes of a free trade deal with India, and now the coronavirus pandemic that left thousands of Indians stranded in the UK.Speaking to members of the Indian Journalists Association (established May 1947) by video-link, Ghanashyam said: “There was never a dull moment. We came across many challenges but they could be addressed with the help of our large diaspora”.The attack on the mission on August 15, 2019, when a large crowd protesting against changes made by New Delhi in the federal structure of Jammu and Kashmir, was a “traumatic experience” for her, when additional police were called to rescue people trapped.“The situation could have been more traumatic, but we managed to get the Indians who had come to celebrate Independence Day into the building”, she said, recalling events of the day, that snowballed into a diplomatic row between the two countries.Ghanashyam also made headlines for “jhadu diplomacy”, for taking up the broom and mop to clean sections of the heritage building and the pavement in the Strand that were sullied by eggs and projectiles hurled by protestors on September 3.It has been possible to deal with the challenge of dealing with thousands of stranded Indians, she said, due to the large diaspora. Many individuals and groups across the UK came forward to arrange their stay and extended medical and other assistance.“People here have been very welcoming, shows how well the person who holds the office of Indian high commissioner is regarded. There are multiple aspects of our engagement with the UK, but our biggest strength is the large diaspora”, she said.Ghanashyam’s predecessor, Y K Sinha, was appointed information commissioner in New Delhi after retiring. After a career in diplomacy, Ghanashyam remained diplomatically silent as journalists mentioned the possibility of a new assignment beckoning her back home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-envoy-to-uk-retires-after-a-roller-coaster-ride/story-GiLieoRLewGomckNWwKdXL.html

The drug has the potential to cause significant side effects in some patients and has not been shown to combat the new coronavirus.Trump said his doctor did not recommend the drug to him, but he requested it from the White House physician.“I started taking it, because I think it’s good,” Trump said. “I’ve heard a lot of good stories.”The Food and Drug Administration warned health professionals last month that the drug should not be used to treat Covid-19 outside of hospital or research settings, due to sometimes fatal side effects. Regulators issued the alert for the drug, which can also be used to treat lupus and arthritis, after receiving reports of heart-rhythm problems, including deaths, from poison control centers and other health providers.Trump dismissed reports of side effects, saying, “All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK.”At least two White House staffers tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this month, sparking concerns about the steps taken by the administration to protect the president and sending Vice President Mike Pence and other officials into varying forms of self-isolation.The White House has since mandated that those in the West Wing wear face coverings and has introduced daily testing for the virus for the president, vice president and those they come in close contact with.Trump last underwent an “interim” checkup in a November visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that was not noted on his public schedule. His last complete physical took place in February 2019.Trump has repeatedly pushed the use of the drug with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, but no large, rigorous studies have found them safe or effective for preventing or treating Covid-19.Two large observational studies, each involving around 1,400 patients in New York, recently found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Two new ones published Thursday in the medical journal BMJ reached the same conclusion.One, by French researchers, gave 84 hospitalized patients the drug and 97 others the usual care. There were no differences in the odds of death, need for intensive care or developing severe illness.The other study from China was a stricter test: 150 adults hospitalized with mild or moderate illness were randomly assigned to get hydroxychloroquine or usual care. The drug made no difference in rates of clearing the virus or time to relief of symptoms, and they brought more side effects.In April, the National Institutes of Health launched a study testing hydroxychloroquine versus a placebo drug in 500 hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Last week, NIH announced another study to see if hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin can prevent hospitalization or death in people with mild to moderate illness. About 2,000 U.S. adults with confirmed coronavirus infections and symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath will get the drugs or placebo pills.U.S. prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged roughly 80% in March to more than 830,000 compared with same period in the prior year, according to data tracking firm IQVIA. That jump in prescribing came before the federal government accepted nearly 30 million doses of the drug donated to the strategic national stockpile by foreign drugmakers. Since then, millions of those tablets have been shipped to U.S. hospitals nationwide for use treating patients with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-s-taking-malaria-drug-to-protect-against-covid-19-for-over-a-week/story-WC9fpVcV5XIGYU7FxQJM0H.html
19-05-2020||World||Profile: WHO chief Tedros unbowed amid attacks, Trump criticism||The World Health Organization’s director-general has faced many challenges during the coronavirus pandemic: racial slurs, death threats, social media caricatures — he was once depicted as a ventriloquist’s dummy in the hands of Chinese President Xi Jinping — and US funding cuts.Through it all, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has endeavored to rise above the troubles with a focus on one main task: Building international “solidarity” against an outbreak whose confirmed death toll is nearly 300,000 and that quelled economic activity in countries rich and poor. Many health policy experts have praised his handling of the outbreak overall, despite criticism of the UN health agency by the Trump administration.Next week, Tedros’ track record and background will come under intensified scrutiny as WHO holds its biggest annual event — the World Health Assembly — in a “virtual” and abbreviated version that focuses on Covid-19.Critics and some analysts cite his background as a government minister in Ethiopia, with its history of authoritarian regimes. Not long after taking office in 2017, Tedros appointed Zimbabwe’s then president, Robert Mugabe, who often traveled abroad to receive health care, as a WHO “goodwill ambassador,” only to revoke the appointment after a wave of outrage erupted.Most recently, Trump has faulted WHO for being too accepting and praising of China’s handling of the early outbreak, wedging Tedros personally in the tense political standoff between the US and China. He has shied away from criticizing the two powerful UN members, and has praised both President Donald Trump and Xi — even while leaving hints seemingly directed at Beijing and Washington.“Don’t use this virus as an opportunity to fight against each other or score political points. It’s dangerous,” he said recently, appealing to the world. “It’s the political problem that may fuel further this pandemic.”Tedros, 55, knows about the punishing sides to both politics and pandemics: A malaria expert with a doctorate in microbiology from the University of Nottingham in Britain, he served as health minister and foreign minister in Ethiopia before his election in 2017 in one of WHO’s most competitive races.He’s the first WHO chief from Africa, and the first who doesn’t have a medical degree — seen as a hole in his resume by some critics.Tedros was born in the city of Asmara, before it and the rest of Eritrea split from Ethiopia. Like many Ethiopians, he goes by his first name. A father of five, he has tweeted about riding bikes with his daughter. A few years ago, he tried out the saxophone, but give it up because of a heavy workload.Years ago, Tedros was spotted as a rising star of health policy by Melinda Gates, whose charitable foundation has become WHO’s No. 2 donor. He has been credited for helping expand Ethiopia’s health care workforce as health minister from 2005 to 2012.Tedros often uses wit, feigned ignorance and charm to disarm or sidestep critics. He has drawn on the star power of Lady Gaga and garnered support from European leaders, and called Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez “mi hermano”: my brother. He bills himself “Dr. Tedros,” leaning on his doctorate, and actively tweets to a million followers.No stranger to the personal anecdote, Tedros once said it was “pure luck” for him to aspire to the top WHO job, noting that when he was 7, his younger brother died from a childhood disease — and it could just as easily have been him.Dr. Lia Tadesse, Ethiopia’s current health minister, who worked with Tedros when he had her job, said he was known for showing calm, patience and a good ear.“While he was a minister, he was known to really care for people who are considered at the lowest level of the strata, like the cleaner, the security guard and so on,” she said by phone. “He takes time to listen to their problems, and really recognize their efforts.”Tedros has played down death threats against him, but has stood up to defend Africa. He has blasted the government of Taiwan, which isn’t a UN member state, for allegedly condoning “racial slurs” against him. Taiwan’s current government has faced intense political pressure from rival China, and has been appealing for admission as an observer to the World Health Assembly on Monday and Tuesday.Political sniping between the US and China, and Tedros’ own political baggage, can make it tough to cut through the noise during a global health emergency.“If you criticize the WHO and Tedros, you’re somehow seen as a supporter of the Trump administration and their clearly self-serving attacks to shift blame from their own failure,” said Jeffrey Smith, director of Washington-based Vanguard Africa, a promoter of democracy. “On the other hand, if you defend Dr. Tedros and the WHO, you’re seen as somehow endorsing his comfort level with the world’s despots and dictators.”“Yes, Dr. Tedros is the product of a deeply authoritarian regime. And he has long displayed an affinity for dictators,” Smith said. “The WHO does critical work and deserves support. And yes, the WHO also needs reform. All of these things can be true.”David Shinn, a US ambassador to Ethiopia in the 1990s, said Tedros had a good relationship with both Beijing and Washington while Ethiopia’s foreign minister. Shinn cited a “cautionary note:” Tedros had the job when Ethiopia relied heavily on China for economic and political support, as it does today.“As a result, he probably was willing to accept at face value what he was being told by China with perhaps not questioning as strongly as he might have what the situation really was,” said Shinn, an adjunct professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs.Tedros appears to have learned one key thing from his predecessor, Dr. Margaret Chan of China: Be reactive to outbreaks. Amid the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo that’s now seemingly on its last legs, Tedros traveled over a dozen times to the region. With Covid-19, he has been omnipresent.“Dr. Tedros has been very much at the helm in terms of being in almost every single press conference, communicating directly with the public, tweeting — really speaking directly to people,” said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Center at Geneva’s Graduate Institute.“He’s able to really humanize a situation that’s quite frightening for most people and be a reassuring presence,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-tedros-unbowed-amid-attacks-trump-criticism/story-AIOE0lzGPPDCGJunXLFopN.html
19-05-2020||India||Shramik Specials:Consent of receiving states no longer required||Consent of states where trains ferrying migrants terminate is not needed to run the special Shramik trains, the government said on Tuesday, reversing an earlier order that called for the mutual agreement of both sending and receiving states in order to transport stranded labourers to their hometowns.The move came on the day the government issued a fresh standard operating procedure (SOP) for operating the services flagged off on May 1, announcing that the movement of these Shramik trains will be permitted by the railway ministry in consultation with the ministry of home affairs (MHA). “Today (Tuesday), MHA has withdrawn the May 1 circular and issued a separate SOP for railways. Now, the implication is this that the consent of receiving state is not mandatory for running Shramik Special trains,” a railway ministry spokesperson said. The move came against the backdrop of differences between the Centre and some states over the running of these trains. Railway minister Piyush Goyal said states such as West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, which have large migrant populations, are not approving enough trains — a charge dismissed by them.In guidelines issued early May, the government said states sending and receiving migrant labourers “may consult each other and mutually agree to the movement”, while railways will run the services based on the requirement communicated by the state where the trains will originate.On Tuesday, the fresh SOP by the home ministry asked all states and Union Territories to “designate nodal authorities and make necessary arrangements”.“Movement of Shramik Special trains shall be permitted by ministry of railways in consultation with ministry of home affairs…“The train schedule including stoppages and destination shall be finalized by the railway ministry based on requirements of states/UTs and shall be communicated by railway ministry to the states/UTs for making suitable arrangements for sending and receiving such stranded workers,” the SOP said. Describing the Centre’s new proposal as “unfair”, West Bengal minster Tapas Roy said: “These are issues that have to be decided by both states (receiving and sending), and the Centre. It is unfair if the Centre decides on its own when and how it will send back the stranded migrant workers.”Shiv Dahariya, urban development and labour minister of Chhattisgarh, said his state never opposed Shramik Special trains. “The central government has always been apathetic towards the common man of the country,” he alleged.According to railway ministry data till Monday, reviewed by HT, Uttar Pradesh has allowed the maximum number of incoming trains (641), followed by Bihar (310), Madhya Pradesh (89) and Jharkhand (56). While West Bengal has allowed nine such trains, the corresponding number for Chhattisgarh stands at 14.Gujarat has flagged off the maximum number of outgoing trains (496), followed by Maharashtra (266) and Punjab. Till Monday, the railways had run about 1,400 Shramik Special trains ferrying over 1.8 million migrants.Railway minister Goyal said that in the next two days, 400 Shramik Special trains will run every day. “All migrants are requested to stay where they are, the Indian Railways will get them back home over the next few days,” he added.“For the last three days, we have been running nearly 150 trains per day. There were some issues with states that were not giving the clearances for running trains. We can run more trains per day, we have the capacity of doubling it,” a senior railway official who did not want to be named said. At present, to run a Shramik Special train after agreement by both states, they seek clearances from the home ministry, and then the railways.“Once the clearance is received (from the home ministry), the ministry of railways provides the train and tickets for the total number of passengers to the state government,” another senior railway ministry official said requesting anonymity. After the necessary clearance, the state sending the migrants has to arrange for buses for taking migrants to a railway station. A similar process is followed after the train reaches the destination station. The local authorities arrange for buses to take the migrants to their villages, and they could be put under home quarantine in accordance with the receiving state’s protocol, the second official added. In separate guidelines issued on May 2, railways said the originating state will indicate the number of passengers travelling in a train, and then railways will print tickets and hand them over to local officials. State authorities shall collect fares after distributing tickets among the migrants, the guidelines said.After Tuesday’s move by the railways, it is not clear if the process of paying for fares will be revised. At present, originating states pay in some cases, while destination states bear the costs on occasions. At times, migrants have to pay for their tickets. According to officials, the payment part was left to the understanding of both states. Facing criticism over charging migrants, the Centre has said it is already paying for 85% of the expenses, and states need to bear the cost of the remaining 15%.“Train schedule; protocols for entry and movement of passengers; services to be provided in coaches; and arrangements with states/UTs for booking tickets shall be publicized by the railway ministry,” the home ministry guidelines issued on Tuesday said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shramik-specials-consent-of-receiving-states-no-longer-required/story-JghHpmgSslVCSZe92ujqvM.html
19-05-2020||India||Cong offer on buses for migrants sparks UP tussle||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s office continued to exchange letterr (over e-mail) and charges related to the latter’s plan to send 1000 buses to help transport migrants in Uttar Pradesh. The offer was made on Saturday, and accepted on Monday. But by Tuesday evening, the state government said only 879 of the 1,000 vehicles were buses, and the rest three-wheelers and other vehicles, triggering angry reactions from the Congress. Late in the evening, police booked Gandhi’s private secretary Sandip Singh and state Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu for allegedly providing ‘misleading’ information about the buses.On Monday, the UP government asked for details of the buses. Gandhi’s office did this by around 8pm on Monday. In response to the list, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi wrote back, at 11.30 pm on Monday night, asked that the buses be provided in Lucknow at 10am on Tuesday. In response, Sandip Singh wrote at 2.10 am on Tuesday: “A large number of migrant labourers are stuck on the Delhi-UP border and a large crowd is seen at registration centres. Under such circumstances, sending 1,000 empty buses to Lucknow is not only a waste of time and resources, it is also inhuman and a creation of anti-poor mindset….” In response, the state government asked the party to provide the buses to the district magistrates of Noida and Ghaziabad by 12 noon on Tuesday. “Please refer to your letter dated May 18, 2020. As per your letter, you have shown your inability to provide buses at Lucknow and want to provide buses at the Noida and Ghaziabad borders…. Under such a situation, please provide 500 buses to the district magistrate, Ghaziabad, at Kaushambi and Sahibabad bus stops by 12pm. In addition, provide 500 buses to the district magistrate, Gautam Buddha Nagar, at Expomart,” said Awasthi in his letter sent to Singh on Tuesday morning.Singh responsed at 12.15 pm: “Some of our buses are coming from Rajasthan while some are coming from Delhi. The process of reissuing them permits is underway. As the number of buses is high, it may take some hours. As asked by you, we will make efforts to take them to the Ghaziabad/Noida border by 5pm.” He requested the state government to keep the list of passengers and route map ready by 5pm to avoid any problem in their operation, saying, “This will be a historic step when the UP government and the Congress party will keep away their political reservations.”Meanwhile, at 12pm, the Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday said that the list of 1,000 buses submitted to it for transporting migrant workers included some numbers that were of auto rickshaws. UP government spokesman and minister for MSMEs Sidharth Nath Singh accused the Congress of providing a fake list to the state government. Singh said preliminary inquiry into the Congress list had shown that the list carried registration numbers of three-wheelers. “This is a three-wheeler number… This is the number of a goods career. This is unfortunate. We condemn it. The Congress denied this and said its buses were stranded on the UP-Rajasthan border at Uncha Nagla in Bharatpur and requested permission to move ahead and ensure compliance with the government’s directives of providing the buses to the district magistrates of Noida (Gautam Buddha Nagar) and Ghaziabad at the earliest.“We are standing at UP border at Uncha Nagla with the buses for past three hours. The Agra administration is not allowing us to enter. This is the time to show sensitivity. We request you again to grant permission to allow entry of all our buses immediately so that we can move forward,” Singh said in a letter to Awasthi at 3.45pm on Tuesday.An official spokesman of the state government said out of the list of 1049 vehicles provided by the Congress, 879 were found to be buses while 31 were three-wheelers and 69 registration numbers were of some other vehicles.This enraged the Congress. “In its own statement, the state government has admitted 879 buses in the list have been found alright. Administration (Agra) has stopped our 500 buses for hours while 300 buses are reaching the Delhi border. Allow 879 buses to run,” said Gandhi in a tweet in the evening.“UP government has crossed all the limits. When there is an opportunity to do away with political differences and serve helpless migrant labourers it has caused all the hindrances. @myogiadityanath ji you can use BJP flags and your posters on these buses, but don’t reject our feelings of service,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-offer-on-buses-for-migrants-sparks-up-tussle/story-Ze4fIplSV5aHgzzntNszqN.html
19-05-2020||India||Migrants from Maharashtra give Karnataka single biggest day Covid-19 spike||Karnataka recorded its single biggest day spike in Covid-19 cases with 149 new patients being quarantined. 113 of the 149 new cases have a history of interstate travel with most of them carrying the dreaded virus from Maharashtra to the interiors in Karnataka. For instance, Mandy alone reported 71 new cases today and all of them were returnees from Mumbai, Maharashtra.The education minister of Karnataka Suresh Kumar, while pointing finger at the migrants who had come back from other states for the spike in the number of cases said, “These cases, unfortunately, don’t have any certificate, so they have not gone through any testing before coming.” The minister pointed out that it was in this context that the Karnataka government on Monday decided to restrict entry of people coming from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu at least till May 31.In spite of the large spike, Suresh Kumar pointed out that Karnataka “is at number 12 in the country in the number of cases.”The state, till now, has 1,395 positive cases registered including 40 deaths and 543 recoveries. Responding to another question on the ability of the state to handle a further increase in the number of cases, the minister said: “Our current bed occupancy rate is 6.09 per cent and fatality rate at 2.8 per cent.”While Karnataka currently has 46 testing labs-- 28 government and 18 private – together capable of testing 8,000 cases per day, it is aiming to increase the capacity to 60 testing facilities by the end of May to be able to test 10,000 people a day.Meanwhile life returned to almost normal in most parts of the state with traffic jams being witnessed in several major cities of the state including capital Bengaluru. Tickets on some inter-district buses like Shivamogga to Bengaluru were sold out in minutes with KSRTC assuring to beef up its services further. Except for shopping malls, theatres and restaurants, most other commercial establishments have restarted operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-from-maharashtra-give-karnataka-single-biggest-day-covid-19-spike/story-VKDRGupCXTMIiqNb3BwCFN.html
19-05-2020||India||50 ventilators donated by US expected soon||New Delhi: The first tranche of 50 ventilators out of 200 ventilators being donated by the US administration to India is expected to arrive soon to bolster the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, American officials said on Tuesday. “This is a donation. The US government plans to donate 200 ventilators to India, and we expect the first tranche of 50 to arrive soon,” Ramona El Hamzaoui, acting director of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), said in a teleconference.US health and human services (HHS) attache Preetha Rajaraman underlined the importance of countries such as India and the US working together to ensure widespread access to medical solutions for Covid-19. “We have to access solutions from different parts of the world. It is important to work together for access [to vaccines and solutions] and to supply chains.” “USAID, on behalf of the US and through the generosity of the American people…is providing access to medical supplies and ventilators to India and other countries,” El Hamzaoui said.She said USAID is working with India’s health ministry, the Indian Red Cross Society, and other stakeholders in both countries to assist in the delivery, transportation, and placement of the ventilators.The equipment will complement India’s efforts to “make the best of care urgently available to those most in need without impacting the availability of these supplies to the American people”, she added.The American officials were unable to state what authorities in the US had meant when they said the ventilators are “repurposed”. El Hamzaoui said the US government, private companies, and non-profit and academic organisations have shared their expertise with partner countries such as India on the production of ventilators and other equipment.People familiar with developments in New Delhi said Trump had made it clear that the ventilators are a donation. The firms providing the equipment will be paid by USAID, they said on condition of anonymity.“As of now, the plan is to deliver 100 ventilators in May and the remainder in June. USAID will give us the final schedule next week,” said one of the people cited above,El Hamzaoui, Rajaraman and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mission director Meghna Desai underlined the long-standing healthcare cooperation between India and the US that is driving current joint efforts against Covid-19.The search for a vaccine remains one of the highest priorities and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has allocated more than $350 million while additional funding of $2.6 billion has been secured through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).Referring to these efforts and the 33-year-old Indo-US Vaccine Action Program, Rajaraman said: “One of the things that we do need to be thinking about very carefully is the issue of access and that differs in every case, depending on how the vaccine comes to us.”Desai said the pandemic has “made it crystal clear that we are one world” and countries must unite their efforts to “ensure effective and affordable therapeutics and vaccines that benefit everyone everywhere”.USAID has so far announced $5.9 million in funding for India to combat Covid-19, including $2.9 million to provide care to the affected, disseminate information, contact tracing and surveillance, and $3 million to support a financing facility that can mobilise private sector resources to assist more than 20,000 health facilities enrolled under India’s health insurance scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-ventilators-donated-by-us-expected-soon/story-dGDTcbkLQ3kzFzISg4lvxK.html

It had hurt the doctors across the nation. “IMA, Andhra Pradesh unit, rose to the occasion in defending the dignity of the doctor and looking after his health,” they said.On behalf of the doctors of the nation, the IMA expected a fair investigation into the incident and his earlier suspension. Appropriate punishment may be apportioned for the erring police officials, they said.Videos of Sudhakar with his hands tied behind his back being beaten up by the police went viral in the social media triggering protests from the opposition parties.Visakhapatnam police commissioner R K Meena said Sudhakar was creating nuisance on the highway in a drunken state and abusing the chief minister, the state government and others. He was arrested and sent for medical examination immediately.Meena also announced suspension of a constable who allegedly manhandled the doctor.On Sunday, Sudhakar was sent to the Institute of mental health in Visakhapatnam, where superintendent Dr K Radha Rani declared that he was suffering from acute and transient psychosis.The police have registered a case against Dr Sudhakar under IPC sections 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 427 (Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees).Last month, Sudhakar, working in the government hospital at Narsipatnam, was suspended for approaching the media to complain against the government for not providing sufficient number of PPE kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-flays-inhuman-treatment-of-suspended-doctor-by-vizag-police/story-e5bjnFLglA1AqCPWsQhU3L.html

In Vidarbha, only Akola and Amravati where 14 and 20 deaths were reported respectively due to Covid-19, continue to remain in the red zone.During a hearing the counsel for Nagpur Municipal Corporation told Justice Rohit Deo that the city would now be an orange zone as only 138 active Covid-19 patients are in the containment zones.The NMC’s submission came right at the moment when the court was about to pass a ruling on petitions challenging the action of the NMC Commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, who issued lockdown guidelines contrary to the Central and State guidelines.On the other hand, in a notification issued by the chief secretary, Ajoy Mehta on Tuesday stated that there will be only red and non-red zones in the state. With only seven deaths and 378 positive cases, of which only 138 remain active, in the last 59 days, Nagpur district has received non-red zone category.This has resulted in more relaxations in lockdown restrictions. The relaxed rules, which will come into effect from May 22, will remain in place till May 31. Various shops dealing in non-essential trades like the salon, spa, private offices, and government offices can open with 100% attendance, RTO registration etc. can resume. Wine shops, which were now giving home delivery, are also likely to open.Referring to the state’s new guidelines, Mundhe and collector Ravindra Thakare will issue guidelines for the city and Nagpur rural, respectively.Meanwhile, 444 Covid-19 patients have recovered in Vidarbha region so far.

As people are still hesitant to step out due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, other markets and shops in the city too waited to welcome customers.Most shops have put notices outside their entrances that read ‘No entry without masks’ and sanitisers have been kept outside for the customers.Sanjay Kala, president of the Jaipur Jewellers Association does not see the jewellery business picking up for the next one year. “People will spend less on jewellery. Incomes have dried up, jobs are being lost so people’s priorities are now different,” he said.“Since jewellery is more for show, with small gatherings and less opulent marriages, spending on jewellery will go down” he added.He said the association will write to chief minister Ashok Gehlot to let jewellery shops in the walled city also open. “Those shops that are not in the containment zone should be allowed to open.”Siddharth Palawat of Textorium, a garments store on MI Road said they were visited by customers on Tuesday. The store is following the regulations such as wearing masks and sanitising hands. Customers are also being scanned with thermal scanners.“We are hopeful that business will pick up in a few months,” he said.Natasha Singh Chauhan, who owns Tangerine salon in the civil lines area, said the response of customers had been very positive. “We had 10-11 customers on the first day. I was getting calls from customers even during the lockdown. Now that we have opened, I am hopeful that business will pick up in a few months.”Chauhan said the salon is following all the guidelines stated by the government. “We have called only 4-5 of our staff members and they are wearing masks, gloves and face shields. We service 5-6 clients at a time so there is no overcrowding,” she said.Om Taneja, owner of Pratapsons store, however, said they had no customers on Tuesday. He does not foresee the business picking up anytime soon. “The effect of the pandemic will last through 2020,” he said, who is also the president of the Rajasthan suits and sarees traders’ association.Arun Agarwal, executive vice president of the Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry, says trade and industry have been hit up to 80% by the Covid-19 pandemic. While factories have reopened, there is scarcity of labour and lack of demand in the market. Businesses won’t pick up till demand is not generated, he said. He did not see businesses reviving before 2021, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shops-reopen-in-rajasthan-business-revival-unlikely-before-2021-say-industry-leaders/story-azjye2ZOGZ6fj0zHS1sROM.html

The aim of setting up an inquiry is to see why the passengers suffered and had to wait for hours at the tarmac,” he said.Colonel (retired) Sharad Awasthi, 66, who boarded the flight with his wife Shikha, 62, from Sharjah after a forced extended stay due to the lockdown, said, “Both of us had been touring the Gulf since January 15 but our plans went haywire due to the disruptions caused by Covid-19 pandemic. However, we were able to return to Lucknow on May 9, but were disappointed to see poor preparations, which caused hardship to the passengers.”“The flight landed at Lucknow airport around 9 pm , but instead of taking them to the lobby and offering them seats, or water, the passengers were made to stand at the tarmac itself for over two hours. The tarmac was full of mosquitoes and standing there for such a long time after a four-hour long flight was torturous,” Awasthi said, adding, “there were no senior officials to listen to their woes. They could not even use the washroom.”According to the passengers, there were eight pregnant women, who just couldn’t stand for long and had to sit on the ground. They wanted to use the washroom but were denied permission to leave the tarmac by the security forces manning the area. The security forces, they said, kept saying all the passengers would be allowed to go after they got the requisite instructions.“The passengers were called three hours in advance at the Sharjah airport and they spent a good four hours inside the flight. Thus, most were desperate to reach their quarantine centre at the earliest,” said one of the passengers in quarantine. Col Awasthi said, “The situation was difficult for pregnant women and the aged, some of whom showed signs of illness. We husband and wife were already under distress as we both have age-related ailments. We ran out of our stock of medicines around one-and-a-half month back. So, we were not feeling well and wanted to sit somewhere. We needed a glass of water and some snacks but no official of AAI or district administration was present to listen to our problems. I was so surprised to see a photograph of the district magistrate garlanding a passenger published in a daily, while we kept on searching for any official at the airport.”The passengers alleged that there was no one to guide them.“There were only policemen and paramilitary personnel to greet us. It was 12 am when we started searching for buses for our hotels,” said Col Awasthi.A pregnant woman, resident of Kanpur who came from Sharjah and had chosen Radison hotel for her stay, was refused room by the hotel staff because they were not ready to open their hotel for just one person.Later, the police helped her with another city hotel. However, during all this, no officials of the district administration were seen, Col Awasthi quoted the woman as saying.Director of Lucknow Airport Sharma said, “We had to maintain social distancing according to the protocol and guidelines. It was our first experience and perhaps some mistakes were made. We will surely improve. It was not only the AAI but a lot of other departments like CISF, district administration that were also involved in the process. However, the airlines are bound to make arrangements for the aged people and women in the flight.When the question was put to Lucknow divisional commissioner Mukesh Meshram, he said, “We are not aware of any such incident after the flight landed in Lucknow on May 9. If such complaints are made by any passenger, we will definitely probe the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-women-others-waited-at-tarmac-vande-bharat-flight-passenger/story-DLCG2utvnSkgy2oXudMKFP.html

Performance of other rituals should also be allowed as has been done for ash immersion rites,” said Pradeep Jha, Ganga Sabha president.Last positive patient in Haridwar district was discharged after cure on May 16 from Mela hospital Covid-19 center. No new case has emerged since April 18, when the last two positive cases were detected.“Earlier Central government had earmarked the zones based on varied criteria but now the state government has been given the power to categorize the districts. Health personnel involved in the Covid-19 operations deserve major credit for ensuring all the seven positive patients got cured but we all need to ensure that we adhere to social distancing norms and wear face masks as preventive measures to ensure the green zone tag continues further,” said chief medical officer (CMO) Haridwar Dr Saroj Naithani.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The trader community has hailed the decision to open establishments including saloons, beauty parlours and home delivery service for food and other items.

The election is a procedural formality.“It is not a full time assignment… But Dr Harsh Vardhan will be required to chair the executive board’s bi-annual meetings,” a senior government official told Hindustan Times.The WHO’s South-East Asia group had unanimously decided last year that New Delhi would be elected to the executive board for a three-year-term beginning May. It was also decided at this meeting that New Delhi’s nominee would be the Executive Board chairman for the first year beginning Friday. The chairman’s post is held by rotation for one year among regional groups.On Tuesday, the 194-nation World Health Assembly signed off on the proposal to appoint India’s nominee to the executive board. Former health minister JP Nadda had chaired a similar session of the WHA back in 2016.Harsh Vardhan, an ENT surgeon by training, will replace Dr H Nakatani, who is the advisor for international affairs to Japan’s health minister.As head of the 34-member Executive Board that is mandated to implement the decisions of the World Health Assembly, health minister Harsh Vardhan will have to work closely with Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who has lately been the punching bag for many countries led by the United States over the WHO’s initial response to Covid-19.Harsh Vardhan, who will continue in the executive board after the one-year term as chairman ends, will also have a say in shortlisting the next WHO director general when Tedros Adhanom’s five-year-tenure ends in May 2021.Earlier, the executive board would select the WHO director general and get its choice vetted by the health assembly.

19-05-2020||India||UP Congress president detained for dharna over buses for migrants||Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu was detained on Tuesday for holding a dharna with partymen on the Bharatpur- Agra highway demanding that buses stranded on the border should be allowed to move towards Noida and Ghaziabad to be provided to district administration there.Four policemen, one holding him by his feet and three supporting him at the shoulders, were seen carrying him away to the police car. Lallu is then seen calmly climbing into the waiting car. At this point, he tells his supporters, “Na jhuke hain na jhukenge (We will not bow)”. SSP Agra Babloo Kumar has confirmed that the Congress leader has been detained. Along with Lallu, other party leaders Pradeep Mathur, Vivek Bansal were also detained. The Congress and the Yogi government have been involved in a tussle over the buses that the party proposed to provide in order to send stranded migrant workers home.The Congress has accused the BJP and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of indulging in “cheap politics” by not allowing its buses to ferry migrants stranded at the borders.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala urged Adityanath to come to the aid of migrants and immediately grant permission to 1,000 buses made available by the Congress in this regard and not “create hurdles instead”.“Kindly put a stop on cheap politics and not be insensitive and inhumane towards the plight of migrants. Kindly allow buses to ply migrants home and help them instead of embroiling them in cheap and petty politics,” Surjewala told a press conference through video conferencing.Earlier today, the Uttar Pradesh government said the list of 1,000 buses offered by the Congress to ferry migrant workers contained registration numbers of two-wheelers and cars, fuelling a war of words between the two sides.The Congress, however, challenged the UP government to conduct a “physical verification” of the buses it has brought to the state’s border to take UP’s stranded workers home.Even while accusing the Congress of playing politics over the plight of workers heading home after the coronavirus lockdown, the UP government on Monday formally accepted the offer.It asked the Congress to submit a list of the buses, and its drivers and conductors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-congress-president-taken-in-custody-for-dharna-over-buses-for-migrants/story-zPEwc2wb91JfjQ4NoWWliM.html

But, state-run buses and metro rail services are yet to resume within the city limits.Auto-rickshaws and private taxis were back on the roads but their numbers were few and far between, as many drivers are still held up at their native places.Automobile showrooms, shops selling spare mechanical parts, hardware, electrical and electronic shops, and mobile phone stores have been operational for the last four days.Other smaller commercial establishments, including garments’ shops, footwear shops, and jewellery showrooms also opened on Tuesday.However, only 50% of the shops opened on the first day, because of the odd-even rule enforced by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) authorities.“The shops will be allowed to open on corresponding alternate days. Those with odd numbers will open on odd days and those with even numbers will open on even-numbered days of the week,” said Lokesh Kumar, commissioner, GHMC“In case of any problem or a dispute between two adjacent shops or cluster of shops, the administration will close down all the shops till the lockdown period,” he added.Most of the commercial establishments, however, did not engage in sales on the first day, as they were busy in a clean-up drive.“We had to hurriedly close our shops on March 22 without making any arrangements for packing and storing the materials kept on display. Many dress materials got damaged,” said Ramesh, owner of a garment boutique in Punjagutta.“It’ll take another couple of days for normal life to be restored in Hyderabad. People are still hesitant to come out because of the growing panic over Covid-19. Besides, shopping malls, multiplexes, and restaurants are still closed. Unless it’s essential, people are unlikely to venture out,” said Satyanarayana, a GHMC official.The state government has not permitted inter-state bus services, including those to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. However, intra-state bus services resumed their operations from 6 am on Tuesday.State-run buses, which are slated to come to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station, are barred from entry into the city because they have to pass through containment zones. But Jubilee Bus Station in Secunderabad was thrown open on Tuesday. The state government-run Road Transport Corporation (RTC) authorities have provided masks and hand sanitisers to their staff. “There wasn’t much rush of passengers on the first day, as we resumed our services with 6,000 buses,” said Yadagiri, executive director, RTC, Telangana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-crawls-back-to-normalcy-after-easing-curbs-on-covid-19-lockdown/story-jnAURvtNme5h91rcmqJ2WM.html

It showed community spread did not take place in the state, he said adding that most of the recent cases are imported ones.“Our vigil helped containing the local spread. Since people started coming in large numbers we have to keep an eye on aged, people suffering from major ailments and children,” he said. He said around 75,000 people have reached the state in last ten days and the state will have to resort to reverse quarantine in a big way.Reserve quarantine is a practice of isolating the most vulnerable people, aged or people with co-morbidity conditions, from the rest and monitor their health conditions closely to protect them from possible infection. Since the state has 30 per cent population above 65 years of age many health experts have suggested reverse quarantine.Meanwhile three Congress MPs--V K Sreekandan, Remya Haridas and T N Prathapan_ who were on house quarantine tested negative. They were asked to go on quarantine after they visited the stranded people along TN-Kerala borders in Walayar. One of the persons came from Chennai was later tested positive. But MPs alleged “political bias” saying they were targeted due to political reasons. They observed a fast on Tuesday seeking quarantine for state minister A C Moideen, who they said, interacted with some of the affected. When asked about this the CM refused to comment.The Chief Minister said a special train from New Delhi will start on Wednesday and a non-AC train will run on Bangaluru-Thiruvananthapuram route daily from Wednesday. He said at least 20 trains are being planned next week to bring stranded in different parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-fresh-cases-in-kerala-no-community-spread-says-cm-pinarayi-vijayan/story-8GIYoU38ASiMYrwGk6bZ5N.html

The court had immediately stayed order till further direction.Special public prosecutor Ajay Missar said, the court after hearing the plea of the agency, cancelled the bail. The prosecution argued that while obtaining bail, the defence did not inform the agency. It also pointed out that as per the direction of the high-power committee, the accused booked for economic offences are not eligible for interim bail.Rakesh and his son Sarang Wadhawan were arrested on October 3, 2019, by EOW authorities in connection with the PMC fraud case.As per the prosecution, the PMC Bank granted loans to realty group HDIL without following the due process. The principal loan amount of Rs 2,400 crore snowballed into Rs 6,670 crore because HDIL failed to repay multiple loans between 2008 and 2019. Senior management of PMC Bank covered up these irregularities in a bid to avoid scrutiny by the Reserve Bank of India.EOW in their charge sheet claimed that Rakesh is the key accused of the fraud as the ‘patriarch’ of the HDIL’s business. He gradually plotted the fraud and obtained loans from the bank with the help of other accused, the agency alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmc-bank-fraud-rakesh-and-sarang-wadhawan-s-interim-bail-cancelled/story-XRur54lFRAXYibE20SMb6O.html
19-05-2020||India||MP experiments with contactless vegetable-sale after vendors turn Covid-19 superspreaders||Madhya Pradesh is coming to grips with vegetable vendors turning superspreaders of coronavirus, by organising the sale of vegetables and implementing a new guideline for street vendors to cut the chain of transmission of the disease.Of late, Ujjain, one of the major Covid-19 hotspots, has introduced an almost contactless method of vegetable sales at the doorsteps and is even training vendors to accept digital payment instead of letting cash exchange hands. Residents are also being encouraged to purchase baskets of vegetables priced at Rs 50 and Rs 100 instead of choosing, a process conducive to the spread of the contagion.Besides, every vendor is being trained to make customized vegetable packets apart from using sanitisers during the sale. Around 100 vendors have been pressed to service 59 wards in Ujjain and they are packing vegetables in cloth bags instead of plastic ones.Earlier, it was Indore that experimented with the selling of custom-sized vegetable baskets instead of loose items. The baskets were priced at Rs 150 and Rs 200.“administration in several districts of Madhya Pradesh found that a number of vegetable and fruits vendors, too, contributed to spreading of the virus, hence these districts have started taking tough measures against the vendors violating lockdown restrictions,” a health department official said.In the past three days, Bhopal Police has booked at least 20 vegetable vendors for not complying with lockdown restrictions after one of them was found to be positive for Covid-19. Only authorised vendors are authorised to sell vegetables in Bhopal at fixed rates.Earlier, in Ujjain, two vendors were put under treatment after found to be Covid-19 positive and another 65-year-old woman died in RD Gardi Medical College. She was suspected to have picked up the virus from the vegetable market.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIn April third week, the municipal corporation in Indore had seized vegetables from a vendor’s house after he was found operating his shop from his house despite a ban on the direct sale of vegetables and fruits.Rishi Garg, commissioner of Ujjain municipal corporation (UMC) said that the conventional functioning of the supply chain of farmers, whole-sellers at Mandi and vendors, is prone to spreading the infection..The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“The corporation has tied up with vendors who bring vegetables from select farmers from outside the city. Each ward in the city has been allotted one or two loader vehicles. The cell phone numbers of the driver and the nodal officer have been shared in public so that people can call them up for home delivery,” Garg explained how the administration was trying to disrupt the conventional model to break the chain of the virus.He added that in order to minimise the exchange of currency, vendors have also been trained in digital payments using platforms such as Bhim App or Paytm.Similar tactics were being followed in Indore as well. Information officer Dr RR Patel said that certain marriage halls outside the city had been earmarked and allotted to traders who deliver packed vegetables at the doorstep..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-experiments-with-contactless-vegetable-sale-after-vendors-turn-covid-19-superspreaders/story-YaD6vEXkx10q5xzsaLr9uI.html

While the older girl managed to escape, the baby was burnt alive. Ravi Saini, station house officer, Ramnagar police station said, “At the time of the incident, the boy’s father who works at a mining site as a truck driver was at work while his mother had gone out to fetch drinking water. Only he and his sister were present inside the makeshift hut which caught fire likely due to a beedi or a lantern.”Saini said, “When the hut caught fire, the girl managed to come out. A neighbour informed police which then informed the fire tenders. Both rushed to the spot to douse the fire. By the time the fire was doused, the boy was charred to death.”“After receiving the body, police sent it for post mortem examination at the nearby hospital. We are investigating the matter,” teh officer said.In a similar incident in April last year, a 15-day-old infant died in Halduchaur area in Nainital district. The incident occurred when the child’s mother lit an earther stove and went out to fetch water leaving her three children inside the hut at that time. When the hut caught fire, two older children escaped, while the infant was left behind and was charred to death. The labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand come to work in the mining sector in Kumaon, often mkae temporary huts near their work areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infant-burnt-alive-in-uttarakhand-s-nainital-district-as-hut-catches-fire/story-CXFjuR8FBLAY7US5cWit7K.html
19-05-2020||India||Oral cancer screening suspended due to Covid-19 risk||The Union health ministry has temporarily suspended oral cancer screening under its National Cancer Screening Programme due to high risk associated with the examination of the oral cavity as saliva is high in Sars-Cov-2 viral load that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “Due to the high risk associated with the examination of the oral cavity, oral cancer screening under National Cancer Screening program should be deferred until new policy/guidelines are issued,” said health ministry in a directive issued on Tuesday.An official from the government confirmed, on condition of anonymity, said, “The door-to-door screening of people above 30 years of age as part of the national programme has been currently suspended. However, if there is an emergency case requiring biopsy that will be addressed as per protocol. These are temporary guidelines subject to revision depending on change in overall situation.” Dental clinics in the containment zones have also been directed to remain closed, as most dental procedures require close contact with the patient’s oral cavity, saliva, blood, and respiratory tract secretions, increasing the risk for dentists of contracting the viral infection.All routine and elective dental procedures need to be deferred for a later review until new policy or guidelines are issued.“Dental operations should be restricted to emergency and urgent treatment procedures only. However, clinics in containment zone are allowed to provide tele-consultation, and patients in need of emergency treatment can use ambulance services to travel to the nearby Covid hospital providing dental facility,” the directive says.In the red zone, only emergency procedures are allowed, but dental clinics in orange and green zone can remain open for consultation also.Emergency procedures have been classified as those that if not attended to increase the patient’s death risk, and urgent cases are those requiring priority care but do not increase the patient’s death risk.“Urgent procedures should be undertaken only after teleconsultation, tele-triage, consent, and through pre-fixed appointment,” says the directive. The ministry has also issued a detailed list of procedures that fall under emergency dental procedures such as procedures for patients going in for cardiac surgery, radiation therapy or organ transplantation surgery or those patients undergoing treatment in hospital for any acute conditions. If infection in dental pulp has reached a stage wherein painkillers and other medicines are ineffective, then an emergency procedure can be performed to relieve the symptoms. Also, there is a list of dos and don’ts to modify dental clinic setting to minimise risk of infection. Experts say it is good to have these guidelines in place for better clarity on the matter.“There are two things why dentists can be at high risk: one is that saliva is very rich in covid causing virus, and second is that the contact with a patient during dental procedures is comparatively longer and closer. Therefore, it makes sense to put on hold elective, aesthetic or rehabilitative procedures for time being, and concentrate on only life-threatening and urgent procedures,” says Dr Mahesh Verma, former director, Delhi government-run Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oral-cancer-screening-suspended-due-to-covid-19-risk/story-5Qphv2elMSYrQGmpIpybiJ.html
19-05-2020||India||India’s Coronavirus cases cross 100,000, jump at fastest pace in Asia: Report||India’s coronavirus infections crossed the 100,000 mark and are escalating at the fastest pace in Asia, just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi further relaxed the country’s nationwide lockdown to boost economic activities.Infections in the South Asian nation of 1.3 billion people were at 100,328, including 3,156 deaths, as of Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. As many as 5,242 new cases were added on Tuesday, according to the health ministry.India is now among the nations worst hit by the epidemic, with a 28% increase in cases since last week according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Tracker. Neighbor and nuclear rival Pakistan has 42,125 cases including 903 deaths. Its cases increased by 19% over the same period, the tracker showed.“The challenges are huge, but a two-fold strategy would help reduce infections and flatten the curve,” said Rajmohan Panda, additional professor at the Public Health Foundation of India, adding the rise in infections is expected with the opening of the economy. “The focus should now be prioritized in low income settlements, with an emphasis of sub district level containment measures.”Since Monday, states have further eased restrictions for industries, shops and offices and reopened public transport, while the lockdown in the worst affected areas of the country -- including a ban on interstate and international air travel -- has been extended until May 31. The government is hoping to ease the economic impact of the world’s biggest lockdown, which has crippled business activity and left millions jobless.Still, companies are facing difficulties reopening factories -- primarily because of travel restrictions, conflicting rules, broken supply chains and a shortage of workers. The movement of millions of migrant workers from the cities where they had jobs to their homes in rural villages -- and their reluctance to return -- is one of the key challenges for the economy, which could be heading for its first full-year contraction in more than four decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-coronavirus-cases-cross-100-000-jump-at-fastest-pace-in-asia-report/story-Q8c5jVcEG1dZqtu8o3EvQP.html

19-05-2020||India||UP govt accuses Congress of submitting ‘fake’ bus list for migrants||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday described as fake the Congress’ list of 1,000 buses submitted to it for transporting migrant workers, and said some of the registration numbers of vehicles given therein were of three-wheelers.However, the Congress claimed its buses were on the UP-Rajasthan border at Uncha Nagla in Bharatpur and requested permission to get them moving.All through the day on Tuesday, both sides exchanged a number of letters over the buses that the Congress proposed to provide in order to send stranded migrant workers home.“We are at the UP border at Uncha Nagla with the buses for the past three hours. The Agra administration is not allowing us to enter. This is the time to show sensitivity. We request you again to grant permission to allow entry of all our buses immediately,” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s private secretary Sandip Singh said in a letter sent to additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi at 3.45 pm on Tuesday.Earlier in the day, the party had reiterated its commitment of providing all the 1,000 buses at Noida and Ghaziabad by 5pm. “Some of our buses are coming from Rajasthan while some are coming from Delhi. The process of getting permits is underway. As the number of buses is high, it may take some hours. As asked by you, we will make efforts to take them to the Ghaziabad/Noida border by 5pm,” said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s private secretary in his letter to Awasthi at 12.15pm on Tuesday.He even requested the state government to keep the list of passengers and route map ready by 5pm to avoid any problem in their operation, saying, “This will be a historic step when the UP government and the Congress party will keep away their political reservations.”The Congress response came a few minutes after the state government asked the party to provide the buses to the district magistrates of Noida and Ghaziabad by 12 noon on Tuesday. “Please refer to your letter dated May 18, 2020. As per your letter, you have shown your inability to provide buses at Lucknow and want to provide buses at the Noida and Ghaziabad borders…. Under such a situation, please provide 500 buses to the district magistrate, Ghaziabad, at Kaushambi and Sahibabad bus stops by 12pm. In addition, provide 500 buses to the district magistrate, Gautam Buddha Nagar, at Expomart,” said Awasthi in his letter sent to Priyanka’s private secretary on Tuesday morning.“We are being stopped on the UP border with Rajasthan near Fatehpur Sikri. We are not being allowed to enter. We are trying to reach Noida/Ghaziabad borders now,” said Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu on Tuesday noon.UP government spokesman and minister for MSMEs Sidharth Nath Singh accused the Congress of providing a ‘fake’ list to the state government. Singh said preliminary inquiry into the Congress list had shown that the list carried registration numbers of three-wheelers.He showed to the media some documents, saying the list provided by the Congress had numbers of auto-rickshaws, etc and blamed Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for giving a ‘fake’ list.“This is a three-wheeler number… This is the number of a goods career. This is unfortunate. We condemn it. Congress president Sonia Gandhi should give an explanation for this,” the minister said.The Congress had provided the list through an email to the state government at about 8 pm on Monday.In response to the Congress list, Awasthi at about 11.30pm on Monday had asked the party to provide the buses, along with names of drivers and conductors in Lucknow at 10 am on Tuesday. Taking strong exception to the state government’s directives to provide 1,000 buses in Lucknow, the Congress said there was no point in taking empty buses to Lucknow when the migrant labourers were stranded on the UP-Delhi borders.“A large number of migrant labourers are stuck on the Delhi-UP border and a large crowd is seen at registration centres. Under such circumstances, sending 1,000 empty buses to Lucknow is not only a waste of time and resources, it is also inhuman and a creation of anti-poor mindset…,” said Priyanka’s private secretary in his letter to Awasthi sent at 2.10am on Tuesday.The Congress had on Saturday requested the state government for permission to run 1,000 buses from Noida and Ghaziabad to carry stranded migrant workers home. The state government accepted the Congress proposal on Monday and informed the party the same afternoon, asking for a list of buses at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-accuses-congress-of-submitting-fake-bus-list-for-migrants/story-xk5ZA5WVgslISnhL0UR8ZK.html

It lay centred over west-central Bay of Bengal, about 420 km south of Paradip (Odisha), 570 km south-southwest of Digha (West Bengal) and 700 km south-southwest of Khepupara in Bangladesh, said H R Biswas, the director of Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar. The system is likely to move north-northeastwards over Bay of Bengal and cross West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts between Digha and Hatiya Islands during Wednesday afternoon or evening as a very severe cyclonic storm with maximum sustained wind speed of 155-165 kmph gusting to 185 kmph, he said. The cyclone is being continuously tracked by the Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) at Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. Under its impact, light rain was witnessed in several areas of Puri, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur and Khurda districts of Odisha, and the intensity of rainfall and wind speed was likely to increase gradually, a Met official said. IMD Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said since the super cyclone is gradually weakening, its impact is unlikely to be very severe on Odisha. However, coastal districts like Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Bhadrak and Balasore are likely to be battered by heavy rain coupled with high velocity winds from Tuesday evening, he said. Several parts of Jajpur and Mayurbhanj districts are also expected to be lashed by torrential rain and high speed winds, he said. Wind speeds will be in the range of 110 kmph to 120 kmph and may even go up to 135 kmph in coastal regions of Odisha from Tuesday night till Wednesday. Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) P K Jena said evacuation of people living in low-lying areas, thatched and mud structures in the coastal districts is under progress and the process will be completed by evening. He said the state government has made arrangements for evacuating over 11 lakh people as a precautionary measure. Evacuation exercise is also being undertaken in some areas of Gajapati district in view of a possible landslide, he said. As per IMD forecast, no abnormal storm surge is expected to occur due to the cyclone in Odisha, Jena said. Fifteen units of National Disaster Response Force and 15 teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) have been deployed in the districts likely to be hit. “We are in constant touch with the collectors of the 12 districts which have been put under alert in view of the cyclone. We are fully prepared to deal with any eventuality,” Jena said Chief Secretry A K Tripathy said four senior officers with vast experience in handling such calamities have been deputed to different districts on the direction of Chief Minister Navin Patnaik to supervise preparations and guide the local administration. As high velocity winds may damage power infrastructure and roads, necessary equipment and manpower have been mobilised in order to ensure quick restoration in the affected areas, he said. All fishermen along with boats and vessels have already returned from the seas and they have been advised not to venture out for fishing activities till May 21, the SRC said. The cyclone comes a year after ‘Fani’ barrelled through vast areas of Odisha on May 3 last year, claiming at least 64 lives and destroying infrastructure in power, telecom, water supply and other vital sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amphan-weakens-into-extremely-severe-cyclonic-storm-rain-lashes-several-parts-of-odisha/story-RSCEtsrDGm2C8rWrjbwzFM.html

This coincided with the state crossing the 100-mark with a total of nine new cases taking the Covid-19 infected tally to 105 till the filing of this copy.The new infections recorded have largely been driven by the return of migrant workers, 31 of whom have tested positive in the past one week.The afternoon bulletin released by the state health department had reported eight new cases including two detected last night in Chamoli and Pauri Garhwal. However, by Tuesday evening, chief medical officer of Udham Singh Nagar district said a 46-year-old man with travel history to Mumbai had also tested positive.Since Tuesday morning, seven cases were detected in the state, with two cases each from Nainital and Bageshwar districts and three cases from Udham Singh Nagar district.Two male patients aged 35-years and 20-years tested positive in Bageshwar district, three individuals including a 19-year-old female, a 13-year-old male and a 46-year-old male tested positive in US Nagar and two persons including a 22-year-old male and a 14-year-old male tested positive in Nainital district.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOfficials said Nainital district’s two new cases had a travel history to Rampur in Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi respectively. Dr. Shailaja Bhatt, chief medical officer of US Nagar district said that the two teenagers who tested positive in the district were close contacts of a positive case who returned from Gurugram on May 16. She added that the other case, found positive, had returned from Mumbai and was also suffering from diabetes. The bulletin further mentioned that a patient who tested positive on Tuesday at AIIMS Rishikesh lab was under treatment in Uttarkashi district, but it would still be counted among cases in Dehradun district since his sample was taken there.Uttarakhand Covid latest: Focusing on micro picture is key to recouping lost fortuneAfter the first case from Chamoli was reported on Tuesday, district magistrate Swati Bhadouriya directed that medical examination of every person who came in contact with the Covid-19 positive patient be done.“One person who reached Uttarkashi from Maharashtra was found to be positive. Four people from Chamoli also came with that person in the same bus. Rigorous contact tracing should be done for that Covid-19 positive patient and the four persons should be medically examined and –quarantined,” the DM said.Uttarakhand has so far tested 14,691 samples while results of 1,456 samples are awaited. The disease doubling rate in the state (based on the past seven day’s data) has now reduced to 12 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-enters-two-untouched-hilly-districts-uttarakhand-total-crosses-100-mark/story-s3YkcK9PrqJDa15kjfSErM.html
19-05-2020||India||No time for politics: BJP to KCR after he criticises economic package||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday took strong exception to Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s comments describing the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package announced by the Centre as “bogus” and “hollow.”Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said the Telangana chief minister’s comments were irresponsible and unwarranted, at a time when the states and the Centre were supposed to work together as “Team India,” and overcome the crisis arising out of Covid-19 pandemic.“This is not the time to do politics. It is a challenging time for the Centre and the states to bury their differences and work together to tackle the present crisis. We should focus on bringing the country back to normalcy,” Reddy said in a media interaction through video conference.Explaining the details of the stimulus package announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman, Reddy said KCR should study the package thoroughly before making unwarranted statements.Stating that the tone and tenor of KCR’s comments were highly objectionable, the Union minister wondered what loss the package had caused for Telangana. “It is in fact a wholesome package aimed at benefitting all the states in a big way, cutting across the regions and parties,” he said.He wondered whether Telangana wouldn’t get new hospitals and diagnostic centres under the new package. “Does it not help thousands of small-scale businesses and shop owners get Mudra loans and ensure work for construction labourers? How can KCR call it a bogus package?” Reddy asked.Reacting to the Telangana chief minister’s criticism on linking of relaxation of FRBM norms with certain economic reforms, the Union minister argued that the reforms were only aimed at boosting the economy and attracting new investments into the country.He pointed out that the Telangana government, too, was liking payment of financial assistance to farmers under Rythu Bandhu scheme with reforms in agriculture.“KCR announced that Rythu Bandhu is applicable only if the farmers cultivate the crops listed by the government. Did we oppose your policy on Rythu Bandhu? If what you are doing is correct, how can you blame the Centre for insisting on reforms? You can’t have this double-standard,” Kishan Reddy said.BJP Telangana unit spokesman K Krishna Sagar Rao also condemned KCR’s criticism against the Centre’s stimulus package. “We understand the frustration of KCR, as the Central government has imposed certain conditions for using the increased FRBM limits, demands accountability and fiscal discipline,” he said.Stating that the chief minister’s comments were in bad taste and language was unacceptable, Rao said his party strongly objected to the derogatory language by the CM against the Centre. “He has failed to maintain fiscal discipline, contain corruption and check resource mismanagement, which has bankrupted the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-time-for-politics-bjp-to-kcr-after-he-criticises-economic-package/story-sg5osQQZ4JAwXHEHJhUukK.html

Later, she was shifted to another hospital in Khatima, where she died on early Tuesday morning. The post-mortem examination report will reveal the exact cause of her death,” said Dhirendra Kumar, in-charge, Tanakpur police station.Police said that the deceased got married in April 2019 in Udham Singh Nagar district but the marriage broke within 15 days and she went to Lucknow to look for a job.On May 10, she returned from Lucknow and was put under home quarantine, as a precaution because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. However, she was denied home quarantine at her native place by her parents.

19-05-2020||India||Uttarakhand Covid latest: Focusing on micro picture is key to recouping lost fortune||Uttarakhand has suffered a revenue loss of about Rs 7,000-8,000 crore due to the lockdown imposed to battle Covid-19 pandemic, with tourism, transport and industries among the worst-affected sectors, said state officials. Due to a near-complete lockdown in the first two phases, the economic activities in the state had largely come to a halt, a situation which improved in the third-phase with the resumption of some industrial activities and the opening of liquor shops. However, the state officials estimate that the revenue loss in the first two phases has been substantial. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Monday that it will take about a year for the state to recover. “The state’s economy has definitely suffered due to the lockdown. As per our primary assessment, there has been an estimated revenue loss of about Rs 7,000-8,000 crore during the lockdown period,” said Amit Negi, secretary finance department. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesNegi said, “The major sectors which have been affected hard due to the pandemic are tourism, transport, industry and mining. Except for agriculture, all the major revenue-generating sectors have been largely affected.”The senior bureaucrat, however, said that with certain measures the government can borrow some additional revenue as declared in the economic relief package announced by the centre. “Recently the Centre has increased the Gross State Domestic Product borrowing capacity by 2% taking the total to 5%. Though, only about 0.50% of it is unconditional, it would still mean that the government will be able to borrow an additional Rs 1,200 crore to its existing limit of about Rs 8,000 crore. The remaining percentage of additional borrowing require some conditional reforms, if we manage to do at least two or three of those reforms then our additional borrowing can go up to Rs 2,200 crore, which will help cut down this revenue shortfall,” he said. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Negi also said that the GST compensation would further reduce the revenue gap helping the state economy gradually recover in the coming months.Economic experts, however, believe that the state government needs a three-tier plan and focus on the micro economy for revival. Indu Kumar Pandey, a retired IAS who is chairing a high-level committee constituted by the state government to suggest measures for economic revival said, “A three-tier strategy including a short-term, middle-term and long-term one should be framed. The short-term strategy will comprise plans for a period of six months, followed by plans for six months to two years in middle-term strategy and plans for a period of up to two years and more under the long-term strategy.”Pandey said, “It is also important to focus on the micro-economy till the last level, including that of villages and blocks. Also, a thorough sector-wise analysis of the present situation is needed to frame a comprehensive strategy for economic revival.”The chairman of the committee said, “It is equally vital to analyse the major sectors of the state-- tourism, service and agriculture which are the most affected by this pandemic. While doing so, it is also important to shed light on sub-sectors such as ecotourism, leisure tourism and religious tourism under the tourism sector. We have to touch every aspect of the village and the block level for which the district administrations have to be made responsible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-covid-latest-focusing-on-micro-picture-is-key-to-recouping-lost-fortune/story-yAl3HMKrpw417FLaUWvjTO.html
19-05-2020||India||Hizbul terrorists, including separatist leader’s son, killed in Srinagar encounter||Two Hizbul Mujahideen militants, including divisional commander Junaid Ashraf Khan, were killed in a gun battle with security forces at Nawakadal in Srinagar’s old quarters on Tuesday.Khan is the youngest son of senior separatist leader and Tahreek-e-Hurriyat chairman, Mohammad Ashraf Khan alias Sehrai.This was the first gun battle between security forces and militants in the city’s old quarters in the past two years. The presence of militants in the area is being seen as the re-emergence of militancy in the densely populated part of Srinagar.Police said a joint operation was launched in the area late on Monday night by police and CRPF following a specific tipoff about the presence of militants.The operation, carried out along with the Central Reserve Police Force, began at around midnight when security forces encircled a cluster of houses in the neighbourhood. Local residents said they heard an exchange of fire at around midnight. The exchange of fire resumed on Tuesday morning and the gun battle ended at around 1 pm, when troops recovered two bodies from a house that was blasted during the fighting.Jammu and Kashmir’s director general of police Dilbag Singh said both militants were locals. “We have identified the terrorists as Junaid Ashraf Khan, who is from Srinagar, and Tariq Ashraf Sheikh from Pulwama. Junaid is the younger son of Hurriyat chairman Mohammad Ashraf Khan. He joined militancy two years ago,” he said. Singh told a news conference that Khan was operating in the four districts of Srinagar, Budgam, Pulwama and Shopian. “His associate had joined militancy only in March,” he added. Khan was allegedly involved in more than half a dozen criminal cases, attacks on security forces and issuing threats to civilians, Singh said. “He was operating as the divisional commander of Hizbul Mujahideen for central Kashmir, including Pulwama and Shopian,” he said. Singh said security forces are trying to keep Srinagar as peaceful as possible, but enemies make attempts to disturb the peace. “Most of the grenade attacks in the city have been linked to the Hizbul Mujahideen. We arrested 12 people and busted modules, which were trying to attack the city,” he said. Singh said Khan was being tracked by the security forces for many days and the operation was launched on Monday after officials received a specific input about the presence of militants in the area.Mobile internet services across Srinagar were suspended and voice calls of all service providers other than BSNL were snapped during the operation. Strict restrictions were imposed in the area because of fears that the killing of the militants could trigger clashes in the old quarters of the city.Since the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown in late March, there has been surge in gun battles and top Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Ahmad Naikoo was recently killed with an associate at Beighpora Gulzapora. The security forces had described his death as a big success and a setback for the Hizbul Mujahideen. Khan was the second top Hizb commander to be killed in Kashmir in recent days.After the killing of Naikoo, the Hizb had announced the names of three new commanders, including Ghazi Haider, who was named the group’s new operational chief.Khan had joined militancy in March 2018 after he went missing from his house in Srinagar. Later, he posted a picture of himself holding a gun on social media and announced he was joining the Hizbul Mujahideen. The same year, his father Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai, 74, replaced Ali Shah Geelani as the chief of the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat. Khan had done his MBA from Kashmir University before joining militancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hizbul-terrorists-including-separatist-leader-s-son-killed-in-srinagar-encounter/story-npyD8DdjmrugahKNujoOoL.html

19-05-2020||India||With over 1 lakh Covid cases, India is still better placed than others. Here’s why||While India acquired the dubious distinction of crossing 100,000 coronavirus cases to break into the top 11 worst Covid-19 affected countries, the central government on Tuesday cited a healthy recovery rate from the disease to highlight some of the successes achieved in this grisly battle with the one of the worst crises the world has ever seen.The ministry of health said that a total of 2,350 Covid19 patients have been cured in the last 24 hours taking the total number of recoveries to close to 40,000 at 39,174.“Thus, so far, a total of 39,174 patients have been cured of COVID-19. This means a recovery rate of 38.73% amongst COVID-19 patients. The recovery rate is improving continuously,” said the ministry. India currently has 58,802 active cases, which are all under active medical supervision and of whom, only around 2.9% are in the intensive care unit (ICU).The ministry had earlier presented data to point out that the country had also managed the contagion’s growth rate much better than several other badly affected countries. On Tuesday, it added that India had seen 0.2 deaths/lakh population compared to approximately 4.1 deaths/lakh population for the rest of the world to back its claim.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAccording to the WHO situation data referenced by the health ministry, USA, UK, Italy, France, Spain, Brazil, Belgium, Germany, Iran, Canada, Netherlands, Mexico, China, Turkey and Sweden had seen more deaths per million. “The relatively low death figures represent timely case identification and clinical management of the cases,” said the ministry highlighting the continuous scale-up in country’s testing capacity.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19According to the latest ministry data, a record number of 1,08,233 samples were tested on May 18 taking the total number of samples tested to 24,25,742.“From one laboratory conducting Covid-19 test in January, India has very rapidly increased its testing capacity by adding over 385 government laboratories and 158 private laboratories for testing in the country. Duly forging partnerships with all central government labs, state’s medical colleges, private medical colleges and private sector, the testing capacity in the country has been expanded. Other testing machines like TrueNAT and CBNAAT have also been mobilized to ramp up testing,” a health ministry communiqué said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-may-be-past-100-000-but-here-s-why-it-is-better-placed-than-several-others/story-6YHVS71Z4aV74SQYlF4qNI.html

19-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Kerala concerned as Gulf returnees hiding medical history||Kerala is bracing for a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases because of the influx of stranded expatriates from West Asian countries, who are being evacuated by the central government, and those stuck in other states are also returning home amid the easing of lockdown restrictions that were imposed in end-March to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The state has reported 97 Covid-19 positive cases in the last five days, taking the total count to 630, including four deaths. Of late, there has been a spike when it appeared that Kerala is on the verge of flattening the curve, as the number of active Covid-19 positive cases has risen to 130 from 16 since the influx of Persian Gulf returnees.Police booked three persons in Kollam under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, on Tuesday on charges of hiding their health condition after they returned to Thiruvananthapuram from Abu Dhabi two days ago. The trio tested Covid-19 positive upon their arrival and had tell-tale symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, even before boarding the flight from Abu Dhabi.Now, state health authorities have asked all their co-passengers to undergo tests on an emergency basis.Many complaints have surfaced that people often suppress their fever by popping paracetamol tablets before boarding flights to escape thermal scanners. These three persons had reportedly tested Covid-19 positive during anti-body tests in Abu Dhabi and they were allowed to board the flight at the last moment.State Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had termed their behaviour as “most irresponsible”.“It’s a serious issue. We’ll take it up this with the central government and the diplomatic missions concerned. We’ve been asking for thorough tests before expatriates are allowed to return home,” the CM had said on Monday.A 34-year-old nurse, who had recovered, tested Covid-19 positive again on Monday. She was evacuated from Kuwait on May 13, as she is pregnant. Doctors said her case showed that chances of a Covid-19 relapse are high among recovered patients, whose immunity is weak.“She came back from Kuwait with a cured certificate. She was asked to come back for a re-test and tested positive on Monday.

19-05-2020||India||Consent of destination states not needed: Railways on trains for migrants||The consent of destination states is not required for running Shramik special trains to ferry migrant workers, the ministry of railways said Tuesday revising its earlier order where it was mandatory for both states to mutually agree for running the trains.This comes after the home ministry issued a fresh set of guidelines for running Shramik trains. “Today MHA has withdrawn the May 1 circular and issued a separate SOP for railways. Now the implication is that the consent of the receiving state is not mandatory any more for running Shramik Special trains,” a spokesperson for the ministry of railways said. Officials said the ministry aims to increase the capacity of running Shramik Special trains to 300 trains per day. “The last three days we have been running nearly 150 trains per day. There were some issues with states that were not giving the clearances for running the trains. We can run more trains per day, we have the capacity of doubling it,” a senior official said. In its earlier guidelines the ministry had specified both the originating and terminating state will have to mutually agree before running the Shramik special trains. In guidelines issued on May 2, the railway ministry had said, “The sending and receiving states may consult each other and mutually agree to the movement by rail. The originating state will finalise the requirement of special trains in consultation with receiving states and communicate the requirement of special trains to the nodal officer of railways. Railways will endeavor to plan and run the special trains based on the requirement given by the originating state subject to availability of the rolling stock.”Earlier today, the home ministry also issued a fresh standard operating procedure of the movement of stranded migrant workers by trains. “Movement of Shramik Special trains shall be permitted by the ministry of railways in consultation with the ministry of home affairs. All states/UTs should designate nodal authorities and make necessary arrangements for receiving and send such stranded persons,” the guidelines said. The train schedule, including stoppages and destination shall be finalised by the railway ministry based on requirements of states. There has been a constant tussle between the Centre and states over the issue of running the Shramik Trains. The Centre had complained that some states like West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan - which have a significant migrant population in other states - were not giving permission for the migrant trains. The accusation has been denied by the states. According to railway ministry data, reviewed by Hindustan Times, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have taken the maximum number of trains thus far, 641 and 310, respectively, followed by Madhya Pradesh (89), Jharkhand (56) and Rajasthan (25). Among originating states, where the trains departed from, Gujarat has sent the most (496) followed by Maharashtra (266) and Punjab (188), thus far. The railways till Monday has run more than 1400 Shramik special trains ferrying nearly 18.5 lakh migrants. Officials clarified, states will have to share the requirement for the trains with the railway ministry and make suitable arrangements for sending and receiving people. “Train schedule; protocols for entry and movement of passengers; services to be provided in coaches; and arrangements with states/UTs for booking tickets shall be publicized by the railway ministry,” the MHA guidelines said. At present, to book a Shramik Special train once both states agree, clearance is sought by the ministries of home affairs and then the railways. “Once the clearance is received the ministry of railways provides the train and the tickets for the total number of passengers to the state government,” a senior railway ministry official said requesting anonymity. After the necessary clearance is provided, the sending state has to make arrangements of buses for taking the migrants to the nominated railway station. On an average each train requires nearly 70 to 80 buses to ferry the migrants, the official added. A similar process is followed once the train reaches the terminating station of the receiving state. The local DM arranges for the buses to take the migrants to their villages and then put them under home-quarantine as per the state government’s protocols, the official added. The railways, in its earlier guidelines, had also said the Shramik trains are being run only for those who have been cleared by the originating state in consultation with the receiving state. It had said that the originating state will indicate the number of passengers traveling in the train followed by which the railways will print the tickets and hand them over to the local state government. “The local state government authority shall handover the tickets to the passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and hand over the total amount to the railways,” the guidelines had said. It is not clear yet, if this payment structure decided by the railways will also be revised. The payments for the fares was left to the understanding of both the states to decide, officials said. In some cases, the originating states paid, in others the destination states did, in some it was shared while in some cases the migrants were made to pay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consent-of-destination-states-not-needed-railways-on-running-migrant-trains/story-3Xb6G5BM86UjNywQCgDIxM.html

Look at their behaviour - they are asking for papers, and don’t care about the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the state (migrants walking towards their home). We replied within two hours, but got a response at 11.05 am the next day saying bring 500 buses to Ghaziabad and 500 to Noida,” said Surjewala.“We replied saying the buses are coming from far away states like Rajasthan and will reach by 5 pm today. And hundreds of buses are standing at the border, but officials are not allowing them to enter saying they don’t have orders,” Surjewala added.He then called UP government “insensitive” and condemned the state administration’s behaviour.“Mr Adityanath, you said that service to man is service to god. When there is Modiji’s rally, you make all the arrangements like food, transport etc. But today, these buses are not acceptable to you because they have been arranged by Congress? This is cheap politics,” said Surjewala.Rajeev Shukla said around 700 buses are standing at UP border, waiting for order from the state government to enter.“We humbly request you to stop this kind of politics. We want to cooperate, not do politics,” said Surjewala. “This is for a noble cause, our migrant workers need these buses. Don’t take their curse, help us in this endeavour.”The Uttar Pradesh Congress claimed to have submitted the list of 1,000 buses to the Yogi Adityanath government following which the state government sought details of the buses and drivers. On Monday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had slammed the Congress for not submitting the list of buses and playing ‘petty politics’ on the migrant workers.The Uttar Pradesh government said that the list of buses offered by the Congress to ferry migrant workers contained registration numbers of two-wheelers and cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cheap-politics-congress-slams-up-govt-after-row-over-buses-to-ferry-migrant-workers/story-wjPzbunsfgr7cPa3DMf2mO.html

He says what helped him apart from the treatment, was a will to live and happy memories to die for.The enormity of odds Mitra faced could be understood from the fact that while having even any one among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular ailments can be fatal for a Covid-19 patient, Mitra had all four.Over the next 24 days, as the doctors struggled with “a very bad Covid-19 infection” and a secondary infection that developed in his bloodstreams, twice forcing Mitra into the intensive care unit (ICU), the octogenarian banked on “happy memories” to summon the strength to defeat the deadly contagion.“Lying on the bed, I tried to remember happy and good memories. I banked on remembering travels and people. That helped me survive through this unprecedented mental stress,” said Mitra, a former corporate honcho who had served as the managing director of Indian Aluminium, chairman of Haldia Petrochemicals, and eastern region chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry. He is also the president of the prestigious Calcutta Rowing Club.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Mitra was taken to the private hospital after he reported breathing difficulties and admitted to the isolation ward before he tested positive for Covid-19.“Initially, I was damn scared to be in the isolation room. To live in complete isolation looked unbearable. But later, the doctors and nursing staff helped me cope with the situation,” he said after his release from the hospital on Monday.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesTalking to family members over video calls further inspired him to win this Covid-19 battle. He has been advised rest at home for the time being. According to Raja Dhar, a pulmonologist and the director of Fortis Hospital Anandapur where Mitra was admitted, Mitra had “very bad Covid-19 infection”, with his lung getting badly affected, and later a secondary bloodstream infection made things all the more critical. He was put into the ICU twice.“Mitra’s recovery is very pleasing because it was one of the cases when one nears death but still survives. He is mentally very strong, disciplined and motivated and that also helped in the recovery,” Dhar said.In Bengal, as of May 18, a total of 2,825 persons have tested positive for Covid-19 and 1,006 of them have recovered, while 244 persons have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/happy-memories-an-84-year-old-with-comorbidities-recalls-how-he-fought-off-fear-and-covid-19/story-QpcSaqx7fRoaYzFzCHCw9K.html

As per the revised definition, any firm with investment up to Rs 1 crore and turnover under Rs 5 crore will be classified as “micro”. A company with investment up to Rs 10 crore and turnover up to Rs 50 crore will be classified as “small” and a firm with investment up to Rs 20 crore and turnover under Rs 100 crore will be classified as “medium”.  The previous criteria for classifying enterprises in the “medium” category was investment up to Rs 10 crore and turnover of up to Rs 5 crore.  “We have taken a decision to raise the up to Rs 20 crore investment (criteria) to up to 50 crore and turnover (limit) to up to Rs 200 crore. So we will issue an order for that,” Gadkari said.  The minister for MSME and Road Transport and Highways, Gadkari said he feels the criteria should be based on investment “or” turnover instead of investment and turnover both as announced, adding that the government “will rectify the same”.  The minister said he was also open to considering suggestions regarding enhancing the turnover limit to up to Rs 250 crore for medium enterprises, and will take up the matter with the MSME secretary.Gadkari said the government plans to raise MSMEs contribution to India’s exports to 60 per cent from 48 per cent at present and also boost the sector’s contribution to the country’s GDP from 29 per cent currently to 50 per cent.  “We are planning to create 5 crore new jobs. Until now, we have created 11 crore jobs,” said the minister, adding that he was keen on developing Indian MSMEs of international standards.  Interacting with representatives from an exporters’ body, he urged exporters to take advantage of the “blessing in disguise” posed by the global “hatred against China” through cost reduction and encouraging import substitution.Besides, Gadkari said the government wants to make bus ports and is also planning to build logistics parks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-further-revise-criteria-for-classifying-medium-enterprises-under-msme-definition-nitin-gadkari/story-IU69x1ioPi93CC5zuyfGKN.html

The US government plans to donate 200 ventilators to India, and we expect the first tranche of 50 to arrive soon,” said Ramona El Hamzaoui, acting director of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).“USAID, on behalf of the US and through the generosity of the American people…is providing access to medical supplies and ventilators to India and other countries,” El Hamzaoui said.She said USAID is working closely with India’s health ministry and the Indian Red Cross Society and other stakeholders in both countries to assist in the delivery, transportation and placement of the donated ventilators.The equipment will complement India’s efforts to “make the best of care urgently available to those most in need without impacting the availability of these supplies to the American people”, she added.The American officials were unable to state what authorities in the US had meant when they said the ventilators would be “repurposed”.El Hamzaoui said the US government, private companies, and non-profit and academic organisations have shared their expertise with partner countries such as India on the production of ventilators and other equipment.“Some have open source intellectual property and we fully appreciate the urgency and recognise the global constraints,” she added.People familiar with developments in New Delhi said Trump himself had made it clear that the ventilators are a donation. The firms providing the equipment will be paid by USAID, they said on condition of anonymity.“As of now, the plan is to deliver 100 ventilators in May and the remainder in June.

The killing took place in Sambhal district, which is a little over 200 kilometres from national capital Delhi.The SP leader Chhote Lal Diwakar and his son were gunned down after a fight broke out over a work being done under MGNREGA scheme of the central government in the area, the police said.“Some work was being carried out under MGNREGA due to which some dispute happened. Two people have been shot dead,” said Yamuna Prasad, Superintendent of Police, Sambhal.News agency IANS quoted the family members of the SP leader as saying that Diwakar and his son had gone for a walk in the fields when the assailants came on a motorbike and after a brief altercation, shot them dead. They fled on foot, leaving their motorbike behind.Samajwadi Party’s district president Firoz Khan said that Diwakar had been the party’s candidate for Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections in 2017. He, however, did not fight the polls as the seat went to some other candidate of the SP-Congress coalition. He claimed some local gang leaders killed the SP leader and his son.“Chhote Lal Diwakar of Sansoi village had some tussle with former pradhan (village head) over MGNREGA work. The father and the son died on the spot in bullet firing. Their bodies have been sent for post-mortem and FIR is being registered.

We are fully prepared to deal with any eventuality,” Jena said.Chief secretary AK Tripathy said four senior officers with vast experience in handling such calamities have been deputed to different districts on the direction of chief minister Navin Patnaik to supervise preparations and guide the local administration.As high-velocity winds may damage power infrastructure and roads, necessary equipment and manpower have been mobilised in order to ensure quick restoration in the affected areas, he said.Fourteen units of National Disaster Response Force and 20 teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) have been deployed in the districts likely to be hit.Cyclone Amphan comes as India eased restrictions under the fourth phase of lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease, which has infected more than 100,000 people and killed over 3,000.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/evacuate-people-stock-essential-items-centre-tells-states-as-they-brace-for-cyclone-amphan/story-Acox5vjjRnUDdPXjeHtkTL.html

19-05-2020||India||China claims this drug could shorten recovery time for Covid-19 patients||A top Beijing-based university’s specialised research team has said it is developing a drug that could shorten the recovery time for Covid-19 patients and offer short-term immunity from the pathogen.The drug is being developed and tested by the prestigious Peking University’s Beijing Advanced Innovation Centre for Genomics (BAICG), which has successfully tested the experimental drug on animals.“A joint research team led by Sunney Xie has successfully identified multiple highly potent neutralising antibodies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the respiratory disease COVID-19, from convalescent plasma by high-throughput single-cell sequencing,” a Peking University statement said on Monday.According to the research published in the online medical journal Cell, the “potent neutralising antibody could be used to develop drugs for both therapeutic intervention and prophylactic (preventive) protection against SARS-CoV-2”.“If the Covid-19 epidemic reappears in the winter, our neutralising antibody might be available by that time,” Xie said in the statement.“When we injected antibodies into infected mice, after five days the viral load was reduced by a factor of 2,500,” Xie separately told the news agency AFP.“That means this potential drug has (a) therapeutic effect,” he added.The drug uses neutralising antibodies -- produced by the human immune system to prevent the virus infecting cells -- which Xie’s team isolated from the blood of 60 recovered patients.Meanwhile, three Covid-19 vaccines have entered phase II clinical trials in Beijing, a municipal health official has said.Separately, five innovative drugs have also been approved for clinical trials and all of them have entered phase II clinical studies, Xu Qiang, head of the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.Beijing, Xu was quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency, will accelerate the research and development of diagnostic reagents, drugs, vaccines and medical equipment and support pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers in expanding their capacity to meet the increasing demands.The second phase of the clinical trials is expected to be completed successively beginning in JulyA total of 2,036 volunteer participants have been inoculated for the second phase of clinical trials and researchers are assessing whether or not the vaccines are safe and effective, Xinhua reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-claims-this-drug-could-shorten-recovery-time-for-covid-19-patients/story-KSk7COCCmEG1X1OACSMEIL.html
19-05-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi to chair opposition meet over migrants’ plight on Friday||Congress president Sonia Gandhi will chair a meeting of opposition leaders to discuss the prevailing situation in the country due to the coronavirus pandemic, the impact of nationwide lockdown and the government’s announcement of Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package to revive the Covid-19 hit economy on Friday.The meeting, to be held via video-conferencing, will also discuss the plight of stranded migrant workers walking thousands of kilometers back to their home states, the problems faced by the farmers and the suspension of labour laws in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.Apart from the Congress, the meeting is expected to be attended by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Trinamool Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Samajwadi Party (SP), Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India (CPI), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC), All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) and Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP).This will be the first meeting of the opposition leaders after the lockdown was enforced across the country on March 25 to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. As on Tuesday, the number of coronavirus cases in India has crossed one lakh mark with over 3,100 deaths. The government on Sunday further extended the lockdown till May 31 while relaxing certain restrictions.A Congress leader familiar with the development said both Gandhi and NCP’s Sharad Pawar were keen to hold the meeting and chalk out the future course of action in terms of putting pressure on the government to accept their demands for announcing adequate relief measures, including direct cash transfer, for the poor, migrant workers, farmers. The issue of travel of stranded migrant workers to their home states has triggered a political slugfest between the Congress and the government. While the Congress has accused the government of being insensitive to the plight of stranded migrant workers, the BJP denied the charge and blamed the opposition party for politicising the issue.The other bone of contention between the two sides is the suspension of labour laws in BJP-ruled states. While former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the fight against the coronavirus cannot be an excuse to exploit the workers, suppress their voice and crush their human rights, the BJP insisted that labour law reforms are a long-standing demand of trade unions and industries.On Monday, Pawar wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the Centre’s stimulus package lacked provisions to compensate the losses incurred by farmers during the lockdown period as a result of which they are left with no cash in their hands.He said the package announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is “more of the supply chain-centric”, whose benefits will take longer time to reach the farmers.Pawar also suggested that the procurement price for food grains be decided after taking into consideration the net profit component, which would increase the efficiency of the package for farmers in a true sense.“At the time of determining the prices of food grains, we do not consider the net profit on the final product. Unless we do it, farmers will never get proper rate for their produce,” he added.The NCP chief further said it would take longer to trickle down the benefits of the stimulus package to farmers.“Restructuring of crop loans ahead of the Kharif season is paramount. Farmers have already incurred heavy losses during the lockdown, and they do not have cash in hand to make necessary purchases. No provision is made in the Centre’s package to these farmers for their losses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-to-chair-opposition-meet-over-migrants-plight-on-friday/story-WqTK4IPbmYAuRj4ZFoS6wM.html

19-05-2020||India||Assam students, environment activists launch online campaign to stop coal mining in elephant reserve||College students and environment activists in Assam have launched an online campaign against a new National Board of Wild Life (NBWL) recommendation allowing coal mining in the ecologically-fragile Dehing Patkai elephant reserve.The campaign has been launched after NBWL authorities in April recommended that a portion of 98.59 hectares of the reserve forest could be used for opencast coal mining. While the rest of the reserve forest could be used for underground coal mining, they suggested.The move is expected to have an adverse impact on the flora and fauna in Dehing Patkai elephant reserve, which is part of Dehing Patkai wildlife sanctuary spread across 111 square kilometres in Upper Assam’s Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts. The sanctuary is said to be the largest tropical lowland rainforest in the country.“We launched the campaign last week through social media because it was not possible to bring out rallies or hold processions because of the ongoing lockdown restrictions that have been enforced by the government to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19),” said Farny Ahmed, social service secretary of Gauhati University (GU) post-graduate students’ union.Ahmed and a few others, who are part of the university’s Eco Club, have flooded social media platforms with posters, videos, memes, and photographs to spread awareness about the campaign.In the past few days #SAVEDEHINGPATKAI and #IAMDEHINGPATKAI are trending on Facebook and Twitter and many students from other colleges in Assam are putting out graphics, videos, and photographs on social media to highlight the green cause.“Illegal coal mining in Dehing Patkai has been going on for many years, but the NBWL’s move to allow coal mining in the Saleki area will erase the reserve from the country’s map. We won’t allow this to happen,”warned Lakhyajit Das, vice-president of GU students union, in a social media post.According to a report submitted to NBWL authorities, Coal India Limited (CIL) has been carrying out mining in 57.02 hectares of the forest reserve for several years without obtaining any permission.An NBWL’s standing committee meeting, which was presided over by the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar, and conducted via video-conference on April 17 because of the lockdown, recommended new mining activities in the forest reserve. Environmental activities are concerned about the ministry’s move. “The clearance was given hurriedly via video conference without any proper discussion. The Assam government should have objected to the move, but it seems they’re adamant on destroying the state’s environment and forests,” alleged Rohit Choudhury, a Right to Information (RTI) and environment activist.“We’re in such a helpless condition that it has been left to college students to start an online campaign to save Dehing Patkai. The state forest department has gone morally bankrupt and is shielding the coal mafia,” Choudhury further alleged.Ahmed said that they would submit a memorandum to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal soon, urging him to ensure coal mining activities are stopped in all parts of Dehing Patkai.Besides wild elephants, leopards, hoolock gibbons, pangolins, and bears, Dehing Patkai is also home to over 200 species of birds, reptiles, and several species of butterflies and orchids. Coal mining is likely to disrupt the habitats of these species and foraging routes of wild elephants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-students-environment-activists-launch-online-campaign-to-stop-coal-mining-in-elephant-reserve/story-bvyE8cCGvsfrjnqwJHb0sO.html
19-05-2020||India||RSS-backed Swadeshi Jagran Manch to launch pan-India self-reliance campaign||The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), that pitches for swadeshi or indigenous production will initiate a pan-India Swadeshi Swavlamban Abhiyan (self-reliance campaign) to promote local production that will in turn generate jobs.A comprehensive plan is being drawn that will involve workers, farmers, small scale entrepreneurs, academicians, technocrats, industry and trade leaders to create awareness about the benefits of promoting swadeshi or local products said Ashwani Mahajan, the national co convenor of the SJM.The SJM’s renewed push for local has picked pace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India should go vocal about local even as it should be part of global supply chains.The SJM, however, said self-reliance means ‘swadeshi’ only; and it can be achieved by rejuvenating indigenous industry, including small scale industries, small businesses, artisans, rural industries, including food processing industry, and other non-farm activities.Mahajan said there are over 700 MSME clusters in the country, with a long and prosperous history of industrial development, however, many of these industrial clusters suffered because of “unfair competition from China and unfair import policies”.“They have to be supported and strengthened by all means so that they not only create employment opportunities but also produce high quality products at the most economical cost,” Mahajan said.The SJM has made cluster studies to identify problems faced by the local industry and more studies will be carried out in a mission mode to revive domestic industry, he said.Citing examples of how jobs can be generated in the rural areas, he said there are opportunities for agro-based activities, including food processing, poultry, dairy, fishing, mushroom farming, bamboo farming, floriculture, horticulture, among others.“It is unfortunate that policy makers in the past never posed trust in indigenous talent, resources and knowledge and therefore, over emphasised on the public sector and later on foreign capital and MNCs. PM Modi’s recent call that we have to be vocal for local is a pleasant departure from the existing policy on globalisation and liberalisation, especially foreign capital dependent model of development,” Mahajan said.To be sure, union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week announced a series of relief measures for the MSME sector as part of the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package.In response to the MSMEs demand for a financial package, the finance minister announced that the government and central public sector enterprises will release all pending MSME payments in 45 days; government will facilitate the provision of Rs 20,000 crore as subordinate debt; infuse Rs 50,000 in equity in MSMEs through a fund of funds and expanded the MSME definition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-backed-swadesh-jagran-manch-to-launch-pan-india-self-reliance-campaign/story-0Xw5EaBsrF5eEMWNNToqrM.html

The court allowed the Mumbai Police to continue with its probe into the case. The bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud also refused to quash the May 2 FIR registered against Goswami for allegedly hurting religious sentiments by making derogatory remarks against a religious community during the broadcast on migrants gathered in Bandra on his channel Republic TV. It directed Goswami to pursue his remedies before a competent court.The apex court, however, extended protection from arrest to Goswami for another three weeks. It asked the Mumbai Police Commissioner to ensure protection to Goswami. On April 24, on Goswami’s plea, the court had granted him protection from arrest that expired this week. In that order, the court had also stayed multiple FIRs in relation to the same broadcast related to Palghar lynching incident. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court bench maintained its earlier order which clubbed all FIRs pertaining to the broadcast of April 21 to be probed under a single FIR. This FIR registered at Nagpur Sadar police station was transferred to NM Joshi Marg police station in Mumbai.The top court had on May 11 directed that no coercive action should be taken against Goswami in the fresh FIR lodged by Mumbai Police and had reserved its verdict on both of his petitions.Goswami had claimed in the top court that he was interrogated by Mumbai Police for over 12 hours with regard to FIR on alleged defamatory statements and one of the two investigating officers probing the case against him has tested positive for Covid-19. He alleged of being politically victimised for speaking against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi during his broadcast.The Maharashtra government too moved the apex court alleging that Goswami has been misusing protection granted by the top court and “browbeating” the police by “creating fear psychosis”. The state government requested the Supreme Court to insulate its probe from interference by Goswami. The FIR against Goswami pertains to hate speech and promoting enmity between religious groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-arnab-goswami-s-plea-seeking-cbi-probe-into-fir-extends-protection-by-three-weeks/story-wTlSvMVpa9hGpKYEAtm3MI.html

Though India’s curve is not as steep as most of the 10 countries that have been the worst-hit by the pandemic, but the rate of increase of cases is yet to show a steep drop that nations such as China and Iran have seen.From the day the outbreak started in India, the country took 78 days to reach 100,000 cases. Of the 10 countries in the world that have crossed the 100,000-mark, only two have seen a slower rate of increase in cases than India. The comparisons between different countries have been made keeping Day 1 as the first day each nation reported over 500 cases. China reported an extremely high rate of cases, at times even straying above the ‘doubles everyday’ line. By Day 30, China flattened its curve completely, dropping below the ‘doubles every three days’ line. The United States and Russia, the two countries with the highest number of cases in the world, currently are the only two nations that are above the ‘doubles every week’ line.Here’s a look at days these countries took to report 100,000 cases:Turkey: 44Italy: 60 Spain: 61Brazil: 68 United States: 69 Germany: 70 UK: 77 Iran: 78 India: 78France: 80 Russia: 91(Sources: HT’S Covid-19 dashboard and Worldometer)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-breaches-1-lakh-mark-in-78-days-here-s-how-other-countries-fared/story-VwSLYCiRTAi64KtspC7hfL.html

19-05-2020||India||It’s time to flex the lex: Demystifying new words and top searches in a Covid-19 affected world||This year has been a roller-coaster ride, bringing with it drastic overhauls and dynamic shifts in not just economies and trade, but in language as well. As a result of Covid-19, many new words have become part of the common lexicon. A quick scan through web searches throws up quite a mixed bag of searches in India. At first, the searches brought results for the medical terminology, such as PPE Kits, but as the lockdowns kept getting extended, the searches showed results for the social outcome of the Coronavirus. Searches also show that the most trending words change if there’s a national event, government announcement or celebrity news. Most of this terminology is added to dictionaries including Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and Merriam-Webster in real time and monthly data is released. Here are some words that people searched for the most, since the beginning of 2020:Social Distancing: Remember the assembly meets in school where one-arm-distance was mandatory? It is that, but the negligence of which would have far grave consequences. Tan-Doori, Soshal Distan-Singh, joke all you want, but do not flout the rules.Global Pandemic: A worldwide spread of a new disease, affecting more people than estimated. Did someone say Tik-Tok? Flatten the Curve: Implementing measures to delay the spread of the infection and lower the number of new cases per day, flattening the curve also helps buy time to treat more patients effectively. Lockdown: We have heard enough of this word to not know what it means. X Æ A-12: The name of Elon Musk and his partner, Grimes’ son, there are several theories surrounding it, none of which have to do anything with PAN or Aadhaar numbers.Infodemic: An information overload in times of a pandemic, this portmanteau thrives on messaging apps and chat groups, often leading to unverified news generation and opinion formation. WFH: Work From Home. An alternative to going to work, it is a situation where you can wear a formal shirt with shorts because no one would bother checking over an official video call.Quarantine and Chill: A spin on a pop-culture reference, it means to be comfortable at home while following all rules of social distancing.

19-05-2020||India||Centre clears appointment of judge to Karnataka HC after delay of more than 3 years||The central government on Monday notified the appointment of judicial officer P Krishna Bhat as a judge of the Karnataka high court judge, almost four years after his name was recommended by the Supreme Court collegium. During the period since Bhat’s name was first recommended on August 23, 2016, the Supreme Court collegium passed resolutions three times recommending his elevation, the latest on October 15, 2019.“In exercise of the power conferred by clause (1) of Article 224 of the Constitution of India, the President is pleased to appoint Sri Panjigadde Krishna Bhat, to be an additional judge of the Karnataka High Court, for a period of two years with effect from the date he assumes charge of his office,” the notification appointing Bhat said, ending the deadlock between the Central government and the collegium. Bhat’s name was recommended by the Karnataka high court’s collegium in February 2016. It was cleared by the Supreme Court collegium in August 2016, but was returned by the Central government, which cited a complaint filed against him by another judge in Karnataka.The Supreme Court collegium stood by its recommendation and reiterated it through a resolution dated April 6, 2017. It was again reiterated on October 15, 2019, when the collegium went to the extent of directing the Central government to process the file on Bhat’s appointment “most expeditiously”.While other Supreme Court collegium recommendations made in October 2019 to the Karnataka high court were processed by the Central government, Bhat’s appointment took another seven months.The episode regarding Bhat’s appointment to the Karnataka high court generated a lot of attention, particularly after Justice Jasti Chelameswar, now retired, wrote a strongly worded letter in March 2018 to then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, objecting to what he considered as interference by the government with the elevation of Bhat. The letter said the executive was trying to impede Bhat’s appointment.Bhat was embroiled in controversy in 2016 when a complaint was filed against him by another judge, MS Shashikala, when Bhat’s elevation was around the corner. The complaint was investigated by the then Karnataka high court chief justice SK Mukherjee, who cleared Bhat and noted that while he was serving as district and sessions judge in 2014, he had sent a report to the high court about the alleged misconduct of Shashikala, who was then a first class judicial magistrate. Mukherjee stated in his report that Shashikala had made allegations against Bhat to malign him.When the collegium recommended Bhat’s elevation to the Karnataka high court, the Central government sought a report from the high court chief justice on Bhat. Justice Chelameswar, in his letter to Chief Justice Dipak Misra, objected to the same, stating there was no such instance in the past he could recollect when the executive bypassed the Supreme Court collegium regarding a recommendation made by the collegium and sought a report from the high court chief justice about the concerned judge, despite the fact that allegations against the judge had already been held to be false.In 2018, the elevation of Justice KM Joseph to the Supreme Court had been delayed for nearly eight months before it was eventually notified in August 2018.Former Chief Justice TS Thakur had broken down during a conference of chief ministers and chief justices in April 2016, citing the delay by the Central government in clearing names recommended by the collegium for appointment as judges.High courts are functioning with only 64% of their sanctioned strength according to the latest figures released by the law ministry. As of May 1, there are only 694 judges in the 25 high courts, as against a sanctioned strength of 1,079, with 385 posts vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-clears-appointment-of-judge-to-karnataka-hc-after-delay-of-more-than-3-years/story-hSe2ADkIxHV2t9m7srUedO.html

The directive comes amid a nationwide lockdown to slow down the spread of coronavirus. Despite the relaxations announced in the lockdown, religious and other large gatherings are still banned. The fatwa was issued in response to a query put to the seminary, its spokesman Ashraf Usmani told PTI. The fatwa said the Eid namaz can be offered in the same manner that the Friday prayers are now being read at home. It said not holding the namaz in the usual manner is pardonable in circumstances such as these. Eid falls on May 24 or 25 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darul-uloom-deoband-issues-fatwa-asks-muslims-to-offer-eid-prayers-at-home/story-KKszRt0If39Q0XeS8kVjZM.html

19-05-2020||India||Tripura professor builds robot to help Covid-19 frontline warriors||With the motive to reduce possibilities of contamination of the frontline workers in the hospitals while tackling Covid-19 patients, one young assistant professor in Tripura has made a device that can serve food, medicines and other essential items to the patients without human intervention.If this technique is implemented, Tripura will likely to be the first in the North-Eastern region to use robots in Covid-19 centres during the pandemic.Instead of donating in government relief funds, Harjeet Nath, assistant professor of Tripura University’s Chemical and Polymer Engineering Department, developed this device using mostly available spare parts including three motors, two rechargeable lead acid batteries, transmitter and receiver and USB output. He named it ‘Covid-19 WARBOT’.In the robot, he had installed a two-way communication device in the form of a Wi-Fi-controlled camera with inbuilt microphone and speaker to help both the doctors or nurses and patients to communicate directly and that too, remaining at a safe place. It took him a week to make the device for which he spent nearly Rs 25,000.“This technique can reduce frequent visits of the doctors or nurses to the infected patients. The doctors or nurses can get view of the patients through a mobile phone or computer present with them and make direct communication with them. The patient can only listen to the doctors and act accordingly. I hope this robot can help the doctors and nurses working in Covid-19 centres here. Also I made this choice when the number of Covid-19 patients in Tripura reached 100,” said Nath.Currently, he is doing research in waste to energy utilisation and water purification areas.Explaining the functions of the robot, Nath told that it can carry load of around 10-15 kilograms of materials and its operation range is 15-20 metres. It can work continuously for nearly an hour as the total power of the rechargeable batteries is nearly 135 Watt and it will take three-four hours to get charged.Watching online the utilisation of robots in the Covid-19 hospitals in different countries, Nath got the idea to make such a device in the North-Eastern state. “I am from engineering background and so, making this device was pretty easy on my part. My wife, a former school teacher, also helped me a lot in this case. The only problem I faced that I had to depend on locally available spare parts as Tripura doesn’t have good gadgets to prepare more sophisticated versions of the device,” he said. When asked whether the state government is aware of this technique, Nath told, “I mailed details about the robot on May 15. And I am yet to hear from them. However, I am planning for filing a patent very soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-professor-builds-robot-to-help-covid-19-frontline-warriors/story-Ky0pZwtn0hVOc65iTYJm8M.html
19-05-2020||India||4,970 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours push India’s tally past 1 lakh-mark||India reported 4,970 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and 134 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the tally past the 100,000-mark, according to the Union health ministry on Tuesday.The surge in numbers comes after nearly three months after the coronavirus pandemic began in the country and the second day of the fourth phase of the countrywide lockdown.Moreover, the Covid-19 cases in India have doubled to over 100,000 from 50,000 in less than two weeks.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday that India has successfully managed to delay the peaking of the curve by imposing lockdown and other public health measures in a timely manner. “There are several mathematical models which are predicting the course of the pandemic in India, but till now, we have managed to avoid the dramatically high numbers that several models predicted,” Harsh Vardhan said. There were 58,802 active cases in the country and 3,163 people have died of the highly-contagious disease even as the number of recoveries went up to 39,173, according to the Union health ministry.India’s worst-affected state, Maharashtra, now has more than 35,000 cases and 1249 fatalities, while Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have reported their Covid-19 tally is more than 11,000. Delhi has over 10,000 Covid-19 cases so far as 168 people have succumbed to the disease.The national capital has one of the highest testing rates in the country, with 6,919 tests per million population.

19-05-2020||India||Youngsters glued to social media amid lockdown, nearly half experience heightened stress: Study||The coronavirus pandemic-induced lockdown is leading youngsters to spend more time on social media with many remaining glued to them for hours at a stretch and this could be leading to increased stress levels in nearly half of them, a study has found.The study conducted by professors from Delhi’s Lady Shri Ram College and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) surveyed youngsters from middle- and upper-middle-class families and found that on an average they spent up to six and a half hours every day on social media platforms.Keeping in view this tendency, the study has stressed the importance of the dissemination of accurate information on these platforms as impressionable youngsters are avidly consuming the content.The study by LSR faculty members Dr Kanika Ahuja, Dr Anisha Juneja and Dr Yatan Pal Singh Balhara of AIIMS is based on data of more than 300 college students in the 18-25 years age group. Of these 185 were females and 123 males; 274 were enrolled in undergraduate courses and 34 in postgraduate courses“The average time being spent on social media (by those surveyed) was found to be 6.75 hours, with a standard deviation of 3.35 hours per day,” according to the study.Another detail that emerged was that 44% of those surveyed agreed that social media increased their stress.“Students are stressed over their studies, exams, placements as they are facing an uncertain future. The final year undergraduate and postgraduate students are worst affected as many companies are rescinding job offers. Our findings suggest that the more they are stressed over Covid, the more they use social media, which in turn lowers their well-being,” said Ahuja.Students in general face stressors like financial problems, academic pressure, adjustment to novel social and geographical environments, relationships, life stage transitions and time management, says the report. These stressors probably get aggravated in lockdown conditions characterised by extreme restrictions, little distractions and low face to face social support, the study says.“Though it was not explored further, it is possible that pandemic related content, sometimes fake videos, increasing reports of infections, deaths and spread of the disease all over the internet could be distressing,” it says.Exploring personality types, the study found that extroverts largely are able to maintain some form of connection through diverse virtual platforms available. The lockdown might have resulted in increased socialisation with family members, playing virtual games with known or unknown people, helping them cope better. Participants high on agreeableness and compassion may have found news related to deprivation and sufferings disturbing.“Students are using social media like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, for over six and a half hours on an average every day. The abundance of information reported through social media results in social distancing but not mental distancing,” said Ahuja.The study noted that social media platforms are expected to clear ambiguity in uncertain times like Covid-19, like promoting healthy behaviours of hand washing and social distancing. As much as social media is spreading awareness about public health, it is also being used to spread hatred and unrest. There has been trending of hashtags that link spread of corona to a particular religious community and have been watched by millions of users, the study mentions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youngsters-glued-to-social-media-amid-lockdown-nearly-half-experience-heightened-stress-study/story-1qjnXkZkI38cP0yk5GSJ5I.html

Banerjee also allowed a slew of new relaxations, paving the path towards restoring normalcy.The containment zones would be split into A, B, and C – referring to the affected area, buffer zone and clean areas, respectively. Lockdown will remain in force in containment zone A, while in B there would be certain restrictions. Normal activities will be allowed in zone C.The chief minister said all shops, except for those in areas classified as Containment Zone A, will open from May 21. These include salons and beauty parlours. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs of May 18, the state had 612 containment zones, 339 of which were in Kolkata alone, with another 114 in North 24-Parganas and 76 in Howrah district.“Masks and gloves are mandatory for every shopkeeper or employee. Specific guidelines will be issued for salons and beauty parlours, where the sitting arrangements and equipment would have to be sanitized after use by every customer,” Mamata Banerjee said at the state secretariat on Monday. She also said that the government was not announcing a curfew from 7pm to 7 am, as has been declared by the Union government, but urged people not to gather after 7 pm.“We are not announcing a curfew because it sounds bad but we urge you to avoid gathering and ensure that the police do not need to slap cases on you. The police will act if gatherings take place,” she said.From May 27, Banerjee plans to allow hawker-run markets to open with 50% shops opening on alternate days. The police and the municipal authorities have been asked to formulate the mechanism for opening hawker-run markets that usually operate on pavements.The state will also allow auto-rickshaws to ply with two passengers. Usually, in Kolkata, auto-rickshaws ply with four passengers and in the district with five passengers.To bring back migrant workers, the state will requisition the railways for 120 more trains, adding the total trains requisitioned to 225, Banerjee announced.The chief minister also described the economic reforms and new economic policies announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman over the last four days as “a big zero.”“The whole thing is a lie. We neither got rosogolla nor rajbhog,” said the chief minister, referring to two popular Bengali sweets that are both spherical in shape. “The FRBM relaxation to 5% actually works out to 0.5%. If we want to avail the whole of it then the state will have to give up its autonomy. There are conditions that say we have to increase the price of goods in municipal areas and give up our control of the public distribution system. We cannot do either. It is better to walk the path alone,” said Banerjee. “We got nothing (from Centre) to fight the Covid pandemic. There are states that imposed additional cess on petrol. We did not do such a thing,” said Banerjee.

Though he had come from Surat much before the lockdown was announced, he had to spend 14 days in home quarantine and did not develop any symptoms of Covid-19.On May 11, Gouda suddenly developed breathing problems following which his family admitted him to Maharaja Krushna Chandra Gajapati medical college and hospital in Berhampur town of Ganjam. On May 12, he was shifted to the Covid-19 hospital at Shitalapalli area of town following recommendation of the doctors.He died on May 16 at the Covid-19 hospital, the cause of death is not yet known. On May 17, the state government declared him to have died of Covid-19. However, a couple of hours after his death, the state government backtracked saying his test reports have come negative for the virus. The same day another youth in Ganjam district, who had returned from Surat, succumbed to the virus.The flip-flop over Gouda’s death, however, triggered a major crisis for his family after villagers refused to allow the body to enter the village for cremation over fears that he succumbed to the virus. With people of Haripur village not agreeing to allow Gouda’s body enter the village, his wife has been visiting the mortuary for last 2 days.“The villagers think my husband died of coronavirus which is not true. Why should I suffer for mistakes of the government,” asked Gouda’s wife Rosy.Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrita Kulange said the Surat returnee was shifted to Covid hospital as per the standard operating procedure for anyone having respiratory troubles. “As he was Surat returnee, it was done. He was later tested negative for the virus,” he said.So far 4 persons in Odisha have succumbed to Covid-19 while 896 have tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-declares-covid-19-as-man-s-cause-of-death-then-denies-it/story-JGgR5JODoF3UXkMDrkGzYM.html
19-05-2020||India||MHA withdraws order directing companies to pay full wages to employees during lockdown||The government has withdrawn its order directing companies and commercial units to pay full wages to workers even when they are not in operation during the Covid-19-induced nationwide lockdown, which began on March 25.The lockdown, imposed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, entered its fourth phase on Monday.The government’s move is expected to bring relief to a large number of industries and companies which were unable to pay full wages to their employees.While issuing guidelines for the lockdown’s fourth phase, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla’s order on Sunday said, “Whereas, save as otherwise provided in the guidelines annexed to this order, all orders issued by National Executive Committee (NEC) under Section 10(2)(1) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, shall cease to have effect from 18.05.2020.” The Sunday’s guidelines mentioned six sets of standard operating protocols, mostly related to movement of people, which will continue to remain in force. But it does not include the March 29 order issued by the Union home secretary that directed all employers to pay wages to workers on due date without any deduction even if the commercial unit was closed during the lockdown period.The March 29 order had said: “All employers, be it in the industry or in shops and commercial establishments, shall make payment of wages of their workers, at their workplaces, on the due date, without any deduction, for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown.” Bhalla, while issuing fourth phase’s guidelines, had said he, as chairperson of the NEC under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, “has issued orders on lockdown measures on March 24, March 29, April 14, April 15 and May 1 specifying various issues related to implementation of the lockdown and the exemptions given to various people and services from the curbs”.Interestingly, the Supreme Court on May 15 had asked the central government not to take any coercive action for a week against companies and employers who are unable to pay full wages to their employees during the nationwide lockdown. There may be small companies which are not earning and therefore unable to pay, the top court had observed.A bench of justices L N Rao, S K Kaul and B R Gavai, hearing multiple petitions on the issue through video conferencing, observed that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) circular of March 29, directing companies to make payment of full wages to workers, was an omnibus order and there was a larger question involved which needs to be answered.The top court issued notice on a plea of the Hand Tools Manufactures Association, comprising of MSMEs seeking quashing of the order asking private establishments to pay full wages to their workers during the lockdown.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said that he had a conference on the issue and needs to file a detailed response on the pleas.The bench said there may be small industries, which are affected due to the lockdown as they can sustain for say 15 odd days but not more and if they cannot earn, how are they going to pay their workers.This is an omnibus order (March 29). There is a larger question involved and government has to find an answer to it, the bench observed and posted the matter for this week.It added that if the government does not help these small companies, then they will not be able to pay to their workers.Senior advocate Jamshed Cama, appearing for the association, said the companies are going out of work as they do not have orders for production of goods and they are being prosecuted due to the government circular.He said the government must hold hands of these companies and help them but they cannot be prosecuted.The bench said there shall be no coercive action against any of these companies for failing to pay full wages to its employees till next week.The Association of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) said in its plea that the Ministry of Home Affairs had passed orders without due care and deliberation on the financial implications for employers.The small industrial units warned that making full payments will lead to their closure, which, in turn, will cause permanent unemployment and adversely affect the economy.They have said that such a blanket direction for payment of full salaries is arbitrary, unconstitutional and unsustainable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-withdraws-order-directing-companies-to-pay-full-wages-to-employees-during-lockdown/story-gZWjhY6oIRvFrZZUqODWCL.html

Out of 60 Covid-19 patients, all recovered as the combination of the two drugs were applied,” said Professor Dr Md Tarek Alam, the head of medicine department at private Bangladesh Medical College Hospital (BMCH).Alam, a reputed clinician in Bangladesh, said a frequently used antiprotozoal medicine called Ivermectin in a single dose with Doxycycline, an antibiotic, yielded virtually the near-miraculous result in curing the patients with Covid-19.“My team was prescribing the two medicines only for coronavirus patients, most of them initially reporting with respiratory problems with related complaints, later to be tested Covid-19 positive,” he said.Bangladesh has so far reported 20,995 coronavirus cases. A total of 314 people have lost their lives in the country due to the disease.Claiming that the efficacy of the drug developed by them was such that patients recovered from the virus within 4 days, he said, adding that there were no side effects of it.“We first ask them to be tested for Covid-19 and when found coronavirus positive we apply the drugs . . . they are recovering within four days”.“The repeated or second tests, in line with the procedure, reconfirmed them Covid-19 negative in all the cases under the research which found the combination to have no side effects on patients either,” he said.“We are hundred per cent hopeful” about the effectiveness of the combination, he said, adding they by now contacted the concerned government regulators and preparing to exhaust international procedures for acknowledgement of the drugs for the Covid-19 treatment.Alam said his team was preparing a paper on the development of the drug for an international journal, as required for scientific review and acknowledgement.Alam’s associate Dr Rabiul Morshed said despite being a non-Covid-19 facility a huge number of patients “directly and indirectly end up in BMCH, the country’s premier private general hospital.“But all of them have shown remarkable recovery being (Covid-19) negative in four days and 50 per cent reduction of symptoms in 3 days,” he said.The coronavirus, which broke out initially in China, has claimed the lives of 312,115 people while infected over 4,650,793, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/found-effective-drug-combination-to-cure-covid-19-patients-bangladeshi-doctors/story-K8z0YQD43b2KbptPQAwLdO.html

19-05-2020||India||On 86th birthday, Ruskin Bond says ‘lockdown has given time to reflect on bond with nature’||Ruskin Bond, who will be celebrating his 86th birthday on Tuesday, says the idea of death doesn’t scare him as he has lived a simple, contented and fulfilling life, written books and stories over the last seven decades, through which he will keep living in the hearts of his readers.“Recently one kid asked me when I die, what I would like to be reborn as. I told him that I want to be reborn as a parrot on a mango tree...”, says Ruskin Bond in a telephonic interview with HT on the eve of his 86th birthday, busy as ever, writing his next book, this time his lockdown diary, which, he says, may likely be titled ‘It is a Wonderful Life’. On the question that it is difficult to ask him about death as his books and stories are filled with positivity, optimism, life-affirmative themes, celebration of ordinary life around, understated humour and his tremendous zest for continuing to look at life from his famous hillside window and keep spinning tales, Bond says, “Well I wrote a poem the other day. Its last line is ‘until death comes, all is life...’. So death comes to all of us... I consider myself extremely fortunate to have lived so long and to have been, for the greater part of my life, a fairly contented person; contentment more than happiness. We don’t know what comes next, what I will miss on the other side, but I feel some people here might miss me...” On the feel-good-factor and freshness in his writings, Bond says, “People say this is my writing style; that I have a calming influence (on readers). People say even when I write a ghost story they don’t get frightened. The ghosts are too friendly... I guess, by and large, though I have my low moments, and I sometimes do feel a bit depressed, I have a cheerful nature and I try to see the best in human beings and bring it out.”“I have been writing since the age of 16-17 and a lot of work has accumulated over the years. As I have got older, my readers have also increased. So I am very fortunate that way. I take one day at a time. So at this stage, no point planning too far ahead. I write when I want to write...,” says Bond, whose book about his boyhood days in Dehradun in the 1950s is about to be released.When asked what has changed during the lockdown when he looks out from his window, which over the decades has itself become a character and theme for many of his writings, Bond says, “Well these days from my window, I can see Dehradun and the distant Himalayan peaks very clearly. First I thought my eyesight was improving (he laughs). But it is cleaner air, due to almost no traffic and tourist influx these days”.“Also, in the morning I see more birds these days. Perhaps due to too much traffic and tourists, they were avoiding coming down here. And I must tell you, whenever I run out of ideas to write about, there is always this window that I can write about...Everybody should have a window to look at this beautiful world,” says Bond, who was born on May 19, 1934, in Kasauli to a British couple. On how the lockdown has changed his daily routine, Bond says, “Well honeymoon couples are not coming to seek my blessings these days (he laughs). Letters from readers have also stopped these days. Though I am not a great TV watcher, I loved to watch sports. But these days all sports activities have stopped. Earlier I used to take long walks. But now I mostly go on drives on the hill roads here. That has stopped these days”.“I am used to working from home for long hours. But occasional outings or a walk helps. I wake up in the morning. Write for a few hours. Then after breakfast, I read something-mostly old favourites like The Story of My Heart written by Richard Jefferies, detective fiction by Agatha Christie- and Indian writers like Amitav Ghosh, RK Narayan, Mulk Raj Anand, whom I knew. In the afternoon, I take a siesta and in the evenings I watch TV these days to catch up on what is happening in the world,” says Bond who came to live in Mussoorie in 1964. Asked whether Coronovirus epidemic should make people across the globe rethink and contemplate about their relationship with Nature, Bond says, “I think all this has been possibly caused by too much interference and overexploitation of Nature, fuelled by our over-consumerism, materialism and soaring population. See what has happened with Amazon forests in Brazil. Lockdown has given people enough time to be in solitude and reflect on their lives and their relation with Nature..”.“But I am hopeful that children and youngsters, who are increasingly becoming aware of what is being done with Nature and the environment, will make a difference in the coming time. Youngsters were not so aware in the past, say 40 to 50 years ago. And I think, ultimately it is people who have to change their mindset, you can’t blame the government all the time,” says Bond, who is perhaps the most loved writer by children and regularly interacts with his young readers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-86th-birthday-ruskin-bond-says-lockdown-has-given-time-to-reflect-on-bond-with-nature/story-gC3jTEDU7i36TIevDvCcRM.html

19-05-2020||India||2 months after its first Covid-19 case, Bhubaneswar has no coronavirus positive patients||More than two months after it reported its first case of Covid-19, Odisha’s capital city Bhubaneswar on Monday, was declared free of any Covid-19 patients after the last 3 patients tested negative for the virus, a first state capital to attain this status.Odisha chief secretary Asit Tripathy said with the recovery of 3 people who had tested positive on May 8, all the 57 people in Bhubaneswar who had tested positive have recovered. The 57 cases in the city had led to Bhubaneswar being tagged as a red zone in the MHA guidelines leading to several restrictions earlier.Bhubaneswar had reported Odisha’s first Covid-19 case on March 15, when a 33-year-old student arrived in Odisha from Milan after spending 9 days in Delhi. Soon after, a 19-year-old youth studying in UK tested positive after his return to Bhubaneswar followed by a retired bank official. The cases then increased last month when 15 people in the city who came in contact with another person with travel history to Nizamuddin Markaz tested positive. Soon after a 60-year-old man in the city with no travel history tested positive followed by 6 members in his family and his tenant’s family.Though Jagatsinghpur district was declared free of any Covid-19 cases with the recovery of 5 patients, but soon after 20 new people of the district, all migrant workers tested Covid-19 positive. As of now, Odisha has 615 active cases in Covid-19 hospitals.During a special briefing, the chief secretary said Odisha has excelled and scored highly in several parameters as compared to the numbers at the national level in its fight against the pandemic. While India reported 712.7 Covid-19 positive cases per 1 crore population, Odisha reported 190.4 positive cases per 1 crore population. While 1,706 tests are conducted in India per million people, Odisha conducted 2,082 tests per million.

In Hyderabad, 50 per cent of shops and commercial establishments would be opened on alternate days on an odd-even basis.State-run RTC buses will start running with effect from 6 am on Tuesday all over the state. “However, no city buses would be allowed to run in Hyderabad and there will be no inter-state bus services. Similarly, metro rail services will also remain shut till May 31,” the chief minister said.Similarly, all auto rickshaws with a maximum of two passengers apart from driver and all cab services with a maximum of three passengers would be permitted to run. All these passenger services should have to strictly follow Covid-19 rules, he said.“Haircutting salons can be opened in all parts of the state including Hyderabad, except in containment areas.

19-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India looks set to cross the 100,000 mark, in terms of number of Covid-19 infections, as this column is being written on Monday afternoon. The country touched 95,656 cases on Sunday night, adding 5,084 cases to Saturday’s total. The number of deaths was 2,951 on Sunday night, so that number looks set to cross 3,000. The number of tests per million of its population, according to worldometers.info, was 1,671. The fatality rate (number of dead expressed as a percentage of number of cases) in India is 3.08%, which would put the country between Turkey (149,435 cases; 4,140 deaths; fatality rate of 2.77%) and Germany (176,651 cases; 8,049 deaths; fatality rate of 4.56%). The Turkey and Germany data is also from worldometers.info. But there is one big difference.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIndia’s 1,671 tests per million of its population is dwarfed by the number of tests done by Turkey and Germany. The comparable number for Turkey is 19,293; for Germany, 37,584. India is 11th on the list of countries in terms of number of cases – and not one country in the top 10 has tested fewer people per million of the population than India has. Indeed, only two countries have tested fewer than 10,000 per million – Iran (No.10 with 120,198 cases and 6,988 deaths), which has tested 8,191 per million; and Brazil (No. 5 with 241080 cases and 16,122 deaths), which has tested 3,462.As India enters the next phase of its exit from a complete lockdown – that’s what the next two weeks to May 31 are, more than an extension – testing becomes even more significant. Only widespread testing can show the real extent of the spread of the viral pandemic. Apart from continuing to use the gold standard RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase, polymerase chain reaction) test, India should also use antibody blood tests because these are a good measure of who is immune, who isn’t, and how prevalent the disease is. Sure, there are problems (not just in India, but everywhere else; even in the US) with most antibody tests, but some are better than others – and the new generation ones will be even better because that’s how such tests evolve.This writer’s hypothesis is that roughly 10% of the Indian population is already infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease. Many people who get infected by the virus, we know, are asymptomatic; and many of the infections are mild. The beauty of the 10% number is that it would immediately take down India’s fatality rate by a tenth (which is more like viruses we know). To be sure, this wouldn’t apply just to India. The US, for instance, probably has far more cases than the 1,527,664 it has recorded (90,978 deaths). That would bring down its fatality rate from the current 5.9%. Limited antibody tests in parts of the US have shown 10-20% of the sample tested being infected (or having been infected), although these studies have been too small.India can open up fully by testing enough people; if it doesn’t want to do that, it can still open up by treating anyone with even the mildest symptom as a Covid-19 patient and assuming that a certain proportion of the population (say 5%, though 10% would be better) already has Covid-19. If it tests more it will find more cases – which is what is happening in Tamil Nadu (639 cases on Sunday; 11,224 cases in all; and 4,590 tests per million); Delhi (422 cases on Sunday; 9,755 cases in all; and 7,147 tests per million); and perhaps even in Maharashtra (2,347 cases on Sunday; 33,053 cases in all; and 2,393 tests per million), Gujarat (391 cases on Sunday; 11,380 in all; and 2,291 tests per million), and Rajasthan (278 cases on Sunday; 5,202 cases in all; and 3,366 tests per million). These five states accounted for 80% of the new cases on Sunday.If this is true – this writer’s opinion is that it is – then the low number of cases on Sunday in West Bengal (101), Uttar Pradesh (206), and Madhya Pradesh (187) are likely misleading. The number of tests per million in these states are only 952, 843, and 1,418 respectively. Interestingly, it is only 1,293 in Kerala. While there is a lot to be said for the state’s aggressive contact tracing and quarantining protocols, and also for its quality of health care, Kerala too, I believe, will discover more cases of Covid-19 if it tests more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-QJMQdUlXBoYNwe6Hb2CylK.html
19-05-2020||India||Except Metro, all public transport thrown open||Delhi residents can hop into public transport — cab services and buses; not the metro yet — and shop at pretty much any marketplace (malls are still closed), as long as they are not over the age of 65, and the markets are not in Noida or Gurugram (crossing the borders will still require a pass), according to the latest guidelines issued by the state government. This comes after 55 days of a lockdown imposed in March-end to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). To be sure, the lockdown continues till May 31, but Monday’s announcement by the state, coming on the back of Sunday’s by the Union home ministry, marks the second phase of a gradual exit from it. On Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal allowed auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws with one passenger in every vehicle; green-lighted the resumption of all industries with staggered timings; and said all government and private offices would be open in the city-state where life has come to a standstill due to unprecedented restrictions on movement and activities.“The coronavirus is here to stay. We need to live our lives with corona now. And the lockdown cannot be permanent. So far we have used the lockdown period to prepare ourselves — hospital beds, ventilators, PPE (personal protective equipment), testing kits, etc…Now is the time to revive the economy,” Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing.Delhi’s guidelines were broadly in line with that issued by the central government, incorporating most of the major relaxations in order to bring life and economic activities back on track.However, Kejriwal did not mention any measure on interstate travel, which the Centre has allowed in its fresh order. Also, barber shops, spas and salons, which too have been permitted, will not open in the national capital immediately. On Monday night, Delhi’s coronavirus dashboard stood at 10,054 cases, of which 5,409 are active, and 160 deaths. Thus far, 4,485 people have recovered from the disease in Delhi. All relaxations announced by Kejriwal will be applicable across Delhi, except in containment zones which will allow the movement of essential personnel alone and have stricter perimeter control. At present, Delhi has 73 containment zones, which can broadly be defined as the epicentre of an infection. Kejriwal said taxis and cab operators, such as Ola and Uber, are allowed to function with each vehicle carrying a maximum of two passengers and a driver. The same rule will be applicable for private cars. Pillion-riding will not be allowed in case of two-wheelers and carpooling/shared services will continue to be prohibited.Buses will be allowed with a maximum of 20 passengers in each vehicle, and all people boarding the buses will be screened. “Drivers will be instructed to sanitise the seats after each passenger deboards the bus,” Kejriwal said.“Grameen Sewa vehicles can operate with a maximum two of passengers, maxi cabs with a maximum of five passengers, and rural transport vehicles (smaller buses) with a maximum of 11 passengers,” he said.While Sunday’s federal guidelines permitted interstate movement of passenger vehicles and buses with “mutual consent” of the states and the Union Territories (UTs) involved, confusion prevailed on Monday at Delhi’s borders with Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida) and Gurugram that have been sealed. Authorities in both satellite towns later clarified that stringent restrictions at their borders will continue, and people — except health care personnel — will need passes like before to cross over. In addition to the announcement on public transport, another significant step announced by Kejriwal was the opening of marketplaces and all shops, a move that is expected to bolster stalled economic activities. In line with central guidelines, the chief minister allowed stores in marketplaces, but they will have to follow an odd-even rule.Under the standard operating procedure prepared by the Delhi government, shops will open on alternate days on the basis of shop numbers, according to officials who did not want to be named. It will ensure that half the shops will open on one day, and the other half the next day and so on. However, no such rule will be applicable to shops selling essential items such as medicines, fruits and vegetables, groceries, dairy products, books and stationery. Also, standalone shops, neighbourhood stores and shops in residential areas will be exempt.Kejriwal approved the functioning of industries, albeit with staggered timings, and allowed all government and private offices to begin operations. His government did away with the curbs asking private offices to function with just 33% of their staff from office. But at the same time, he advised firms to encourage employees to work from home to the extent possible.“Industrial firms whose name starts with M/S A to M/S L may function from 7.30 am to 5.30 pm, whereas firms whose registered name starts with M/S M to M/S Z may function from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm,” said the Delhi government order issued late on Monday night.Kejriwal also allowed construction activities, but said workers must be from Delhi. Earlier, the government allowed resumption of work for projects in which labourers were available on site.The chief minister announced that weddings (with a maximum of 50 people in attendance) and funerals (with a maximum of 20 people in attendance) will be allowed in the city, in another move that is in line with the Centre’s guidelines.“Social distancing is a must. Complaints of violation can force us to take strict measures and scale up restrictions…Wearing of masks is also mandatory for individuals when they are outdoors and in workplaces…All workplaces must have provision for sanitizer and hand wash,” Kejriwal said.Activities and services, which are banned across the country, will continue to be prohibited in Delhi. These include metro services, educational institutes, hotels and bars, shopping malls and theatres, and social and political gatherings, and gyms and swimming pools, among others. The restriction on non-essential travel between 7pm and 7am will continue.“Prohibition on outdoor movement of people aged 65 and above, children aged 10 or less, pregnant women and people with health ailments...will continue,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi government order asked Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) not to prevent any person from “performing their services and duties which have been permitted” under the fresh guidelines.“All other activities will be permitted (industrial/commercial) except those which are specifically prohibited... However, in containment zones, only essential activities shall be allowed,” the order said.Just as the central guidelines, the Delhi government’s order too asked employers to put in their “best efforts” to ensure that the contact-tracing Aarogya Setu app was “installed by employees having compatible mobile phones”. It also asked district magistrates to “advise” individuals to install the application, which was previously mandatory for all government and private sector employees.The order did not specifically mention e-commerce, but central guidelines say e-commerce players are allowed to deliver both essential and non-essential items across the country, barring containment zones. Plumbers, electricians, and AC service providers, house helps, cooks and laundry service providers will be allowed to operate in Delhi, adhering to an earlier order, despite finding no mention in the fresh guidelines, a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. Gautam Gambhir, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s East Delhi parliamentarian, criticised the Delhi government’s move. He tweeted: “The decision to open up almost everything in one go can act as a DEATH WARRANT for Delhiites! I urge Delhi Govt to think again & again! One wrong move & everything will be over!!”On March 25, when the lockdown was first imposed for 21 days, Delhi had 31 cases and one death. On Monday, when the fourth phase began, the case count crossed the 10,000-mark. In the meanwhile, the nationwide lockdown was extended thrice. The second and the third phases —beginning April 15 and May 4 — lasted 19 days and 14 days, respectively. The fourth phase will continue till the end of this month.Experts said relaxations of the lockdown guidelines were the need of the hour, though some feared that infections could increase.“There is definitely going to be a spike (in cases) with the relaxations, but they will also ease a bit the vast sufferings of the people...,” said Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University.Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said the purpose of the lockdown was to flatten the curve. “To think that infections will stop with an indefinite lockdown is wrong. Phased relaxation of the lockdown is necessary now. What we need now is more cooperation from people when it comes to adhering to social-distancing and isolation norms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/except-metro-all-public-transport-thrown-open/story-9SPm0kIlmk1LAz02G03NjJ.html
19-05-2020||India||Guidelines silent on workers’ wages||Has the ministry of home affairs (MHA) walked back a March 29 order asking all employers to pay wages to workers even during the lockdown? The union home ministry’s latest Covid management guidelines doesn’t mention this provision. Crucially, the third paragraph of the guideline issued on Sunday, said that all other orders issued under Section 10(2)(I) of the Disaster Management (DM) Act, 2005—except those issued in the latest guideline—“shall cease to have effect from 18.05.2020.”The March 29 order also said there would be action taken against house owners who evicted migrants or students during the lockdown. The part of the order on wages was challenged by some companies in the Supreme Court in early May. Both MHA and the labour ministry refused to comment on the issue. “All employers, be it in the industry or in the shops and commercial establishments, shall make payment of wages of their workers, at their workplaces, on the due date, without any deduction, for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown,” said the March 29 order .In the latest guideline, the government has issued specific orders on standard operating procedures for movement of stranded people; working from home; and the opening of offices. But there is no mention of its previous order, asking employers to pay salaries.On May 8, Indian industry bodies asked for suspension of many labour laws and to treat the ongoing lockdown period as lay-off (a furlough) and payment of wages to workers during this period as “expenses under CSR funds”. The Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 terms a lay off as the inability of a factory to operate normally on account of shortage of raw material or power or a natural calamity. It stipulates compensation for such lay-offs at 50% of the “basic and dearness allowance that would have been payable”. And it adds that if the furlough extends beyond 45 days no additional compensation need be paid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guidelines-silent-on-workers-wages/story-Z0RGysUrQQN2nkX6VeSjIK.html
19-05-2020||India||Cases exceed 100,000, but low fatality ratio offers hope||The number of known coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India crosses 100,000 on Monday, two-and-a-half months after the outbreak began taking hold in the country, which then went into an unprecedented lockdown that slowed the outbreak to a significant extent. The milestone was a grim reminder of the challenge India, which has the second highest population in the world, faces as it rolls back some of the curbs in place since March 25 to allow economic activity to resume. In the 78 days since the outbreak began, total infections were at 100,311 and 3,081 people succumbed to the disease till Monday, but the trend indicates the situation may be less serious than the global scenario, where the proportion of deaths is double what has been seen in the country on an average. “We have successfully managed to delay the peaking of the curve by imposing lockdown and other public health measures in a timely manner. There are several mathematical models which are predicting the course of the pandemic in India, but till now, we have managed to avoid the dramatically high numbers that several models predicted,” said Union Health minister Harsh Vardhan. “It is difficult to predict numbers as they will depend on the adherence of restrictions on mobility and inter-mingling, personal hygiene, and prevention of exposure to infection by people in different areas. Additionally, it will also depend on the proportion of those infected among migrants and travellers from outside and within.” he added.In the national capital, 299 new cases pushed Delhi’s tally above the 10,000 mark. As on Monday, Delhi has 10,054 cases and 160 deaths, putting the mortality rate close to 1.6%, which is roughly half of the national average of 3.09%.Delhi has one of the highest testing rates in the country, with 6,919 tests per million population. The national testing rate for India is 1,540 tests per million population, according to Indian Council of Medical Research.Based on data reported till Monday evening, India’s case fatality rate stood at 3.07%. Across the world, where 4.8 million infections have led to at least 317,000 deaths, the fatality rate is at 6.57%. In United States, the country now hardest hit, the fatality stood at 6%. For China, where the virus first began spreading, the figure is 5.56%, “The Covid-19 outbreak in India could have been far worse. If you look at the number of deaths we have averted, India has done remarkably well. This is mainly because of early measures like the nationwide lockdown,” said Dr Giridhar R Babu, professor and head of life course epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.As India relaxes some more of the curbs that were put in place on March 25, experts said the coming weeks will be crucial to determine whether the country can hold onto these gains. “Lockdown helped reduce the rate of transmission, but what we do now will be of utmost importance. The focus should be on problem states like West Bengal, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, particularly Mumbai,” Babu added.A weekly tracker of Covid-19 infection trends by disease modeling experts at Imperial College London indicated that the rate of transmission of the disease in India came down to below 1 (the authors identified it as 0.98), a threshold that is key to stop the virus from growing exponentially. On May 11, the model predicted there would be 801 deaths in India for the week ending on Sunday. Reported deaths for the week, based on HT’s dashboard of cases, stood at 812. In the week till Sunday, the speed at which the outbreak grew would take India 13.7 days to double its number of cases. But that could change for the worse as the country allows more offices to reopen and public transport to resume. New infections among the hundreds of thousands of migrants returning to their villages and hometowns from urban centres is also feared to seed cases in rural parts of the country that had till now been largely free of infections.A second expert said that India’s aggressive measures need to continue. “Careful risk assessments should identify hotspots and clusters, and continued efforts should be made to further strengthen capacities to respond, especially at sub-national levels. The core public health measures for Covid-19 response remain, rapidly detect, test, isolate, treat and trace all contacts. That’s the only way to overcome this pandemic,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, World Health Organisation South East Asia Region, of which India is a part.Detecting cases will be determined by who and how many people India tests, which could help head-off new clusters. The Indian Council for Medical Research indicated on Monday that more people will be brought under the coverage, including all frontline workers deployed in containment and mitigation duties (such as health care workers and contact tracers) if they show symptoms of a flu. “This category is equally vulnerable as they are directly coming in contact with the suspected or even confirmed cases as part of door-to-door surveys, screening etc. It is good that they people have been also included in the testing list as you don’t want these people to be moving around as carriers of the disease,” said a senior public health expert, requesting not to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-exceed-100-000-but-low-fatality-ratio-offers-hope/story-7zk8OErvCBSpPMSaE4Ho6L.html
19-05-2020||India||Ministers’ panel led by Javadekar to fine-tune outreach strategy||The Centre has formed a panel of ministers to address the problem of fake news and to fine-tune its communication strategy to ensure accurate dissemination of information related to the Covid-19 pandemic, officials aware of the matter said on Monday. Union information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar will lead the panel that will also include Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Hardeep Singh Puri, Kiren Rijiju, and Babul Supriyo. They will spearhead efforts to spread more awareness about the pandemic.Officials said the panel was constituted around a week back and has held meetings and discussed important aspects, including the exodus of migrants, left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown, from big cities to their homes.“The government is quite clear and focused that the battle against the pandemic cannot be won unless there is clear and accurate communication. The Prime Minister [Narendra Modi] has spearheaded efforts to disseminate information on this unprecedented pandemic. And it is important that this communication should reach every person in his or her own language. Naturally, this requires a lot of aspects to be looked at on a daily and even hourly basis that is if you factor in the menace of fake news. Basically, the purpose of this panel is to spread better awareness,” said an official on condition of anonymity.The official said that awareness levels related to the Covid-19 lockdown and even the pandemic were reasonably good but there could be specific areas where the communication needs to be improved. For instance, there could be misconceptions about the use of masks, the official added. The panel will examine all the areas and then form plans and strategies. “In addition, fake news needs to be constantly kept in check,” the official said.The information and broadcasting ministry has formed a special unit to curb fake news and public broadcasters Doordarshan and All India Radio have also been making efforts to ensure the spread of correct information. The government is also likely to plan more information campaigns, especially at local levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-panel-to-fine-tune-outreach-strategy/story-00HZpnM4wI5VRZqA6uQxYJ.html
19-05-2020||India||States can’t dilute guidelines: MHA||As the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown began on Monday, the ministry of home affairs reminded the states and union territories that they cannot dilute the federal guidelines but are free to make them stricter based on local assessment and health ministry guidelines. Several states have already allowed certain activities on Monday after the Centre came up with new guidelines allowing public transport, inter state travel and opening of shops, offices and industries. Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla has reiterated in his letter to states that the guidelines of fourth phase of the lockdown were issued after taking into consideration the views of the states, following a video conference held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers ministers on May 11.“As emphasised in my earlier letters, I would like to reiterate again that States and Union Territories cannot dilute restrictions imposed vide the aforesaid guidelines issued by MHA. States and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may prohibit certain other activities in various zones, or impose such restrictions as deemed necessary. I would urge you to ensure compliance of the new guidelines and direct all concerned authorities for their strict implementation,” Bhalla said in his letter. Officials familiar with developments said that if any state allows running of schools, colleges, or gyms, swimming pools, movement of people during the night (7 pm to 7am), which have been prohibited, this would be treated as “dilution”. The states have been given the freedom to categorise areas into “red”, “orange” and “green” zones taking into consideration the revised guidelines issued by health ministry. Inside the “red” and “orange” zones, containment and buffer zones will be identified by the district administration and local urban bodies with technical inputs at the local level and by taking into consideration the health ministry guidelines. Within the containment zones, strict perimeter control shall be maintained and no movement of persons will be allowed across the zones, except for medical emergencies and maintaining the supply of essential goods and services, the letter said.Response from statesIndependent comment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-can-t-dilute-guidelines-mha/story-LJ36O6yf6NYhogfnABAc8N.html
19-05-2020||India||Rahul takes a dig at PM on additional NREGS outlay||New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “U-turn” on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) citing his initial opposition to it and thanked him for allocating an additional Rs 40,000 crore for the flagship programme on Sunday.He tweeted a video clip of Modi’s speech in Parliament in 2015 in which the Prime Minister called the scheme an example of the Congress’s failures. “Do you think I will disband the scheme? My political wisdom does not allow me to do it. This is a living monument of your [Congress] failures to tackle poverty in 60 years,” Modi had said about MGNREGS in the speech and added the Congress had to send people to “dig up ditches and pay them” even after 60 years of the independence.The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government introduced the scheme in 2005 to provide 100 days of unskilled manual work annually to at least one member of every rural household.The additional allocation has come as the demand for work has surged as millions of migrant workers, left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown imposed in late March, have returned to their homes from big cities.“The Prime Minister has approved an additional budget of Rs 40,000 crore for MNREGA scheme created during the UPA era. We express our gratitude to him for understanding the vision of MNREGA and promoting it.”Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram separately called the Centre’s Covid-19 economic package “hopelessly inadequate” and said it has “left high and dry” several sections, including 130 million families at the bottom half of the population, migrant workers and farmers.“We express our thorough disappointment and request the government to reconsider the stimulus package and announce a revised and comprehensive fiscal stimulus package of not less than Rs 10 lakh crore of real additional expenditure equivalent to 10% of the GDP,” he said.He said the package only amounts to Rs 1,86,650 crore, which is barely 0.91% of the GDP. Chidambaram added already budgeted expenditure, regulatory measures, and proposed reforms have been also included in the package.He called the package inadequate given the gravity of the economic crisis. “Most analysts, rating agencies and banks have placed the size of the fiscal stimulus at between 0.8 to 1.5% [of the GDP].”Modi announced the package last week to help individuals and businesses deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown enforced to combat its spread.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced details of the package, which the government has said is equivalent of a little below 10% of the GDP. Chidambaram said Sitharaman has acknowledged that additional expenditure must be financed by additional borrowing. He said the true value of the fiscal stimulus package “will, therefore, be known when we know what is the additional borrowing in 2020-21 to finance the additional expenditure over and above the expenditure budget of Rs 30,42,230 crore. The truth cannot be hidden for long”.Gopal Agarwal : “The details about the total stimulus given by FM in her press briefing yesterday was about Rs 20 lakh and 90 thousand crores.The spin master wants it to restrict it to some portions only. The total package includes monetary stimulus by RBI and Pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojna, announced earlier and reform package also. The size of total package being 10 % of GDP is well comparable globally with regard to size and content and is much above most of them. This will also kick start Indian economy and bring happiness to all of us, as it has something for everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-takes-a-dig-at-pm-on-additional-nregs-outlay/story-9A6s62PZH7Qd9Cz2tUjyKM.html
19-05-2020||India||50% staff to attend govt office, HoDs to prepare roster: DoPT||New Delhi: The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on Monday issued fresh guidelines saying 50% of staff below the deputy secretary level will attend offices on alternate days. It has instructed the department heads to prepare rosters to ensure staggered timings for the junior staffers. Since last month, officers of the deputy secretary rank and above have been attending offices daily. The DoPT, the Centre’s coordinating agency, had last month allowed only 33% junior staffers to return to work. The government on Sunday extended the nationwide lockdown imposed in late March to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic until May 31. It has also eased curbs on private offices that were previously allowed to function with 33% staff strength while making the wearing of mask mandatory along with social distancing norms.Officials said the Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Ministry was also planning a work from the home framework for which feedback has been sought from the Union ministries. Extension of the virtual private network has been recommended to section-level officers to make work from home more convenient, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-staff-to-attend-govt-office-hods-to-prepare-roster-dopt/story-1274ZtAXhA282wmRLC3UMM.html

A finance ministry spokesperson declined comments. According to the second official, the meeting started at noon and went on for about an hour. The broad theme of the meeting was the road ahead for the country, the official said.“Now that the stimulus package is out, there was a freewheeling discussion on the economy and the road ahead. The steps to be taken, what the ministers see as the immediate future, and broad themes,” the official added.Over the past five days the finance minister has announced the government’s five-part policy reform and fiscal incentive package worth a total of Rs 20,97,053 crore under the Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Initiative). This also includes the Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package under Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) and Rs 8,01,603 crore monetary measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).According to the second official, there will be another meeting of this group of ministers by the end of this week and the Prime Minister will also be briefed about its outcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gom-meets-to-take-stock-of-relief-work-stimulus-package/story-9aD0jS2NyISk03shqTv43N.html
19-05-2020||India||Kabul dismisses Taliban claims of India’s ‘negative role’ in Afghanistan||New Delhi: The Afghan government on Monday rejected a senior Taliban leader’s remarks that India has been playing a “negative role” in Afghanistan, saying India has been cooperating in development and is expected to contribute to the peace process.Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban’s chief negotiator and head of its political office in Qatar, had been quoted by the media on Sunday as saying that India has been playing a negative role in Afghanistan for the past 40 years.Stanikzai, a former military officer who once trained at the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun, also said India should reconsider its policy on Afghanistan. If the Indian government reconsiders its policy and wants an active role in peace, reconciliation and reconstruction, the Taliban will welcome it and look at it positively, he said.The Afghan foreign ministry said on Monday that Afghanistan’s ties with India are “within international frameworks and based on mutual respect”. India has very good relations with Afghanistan and is one of the biggest donor countries, the ministry said.Afghan foreign ministry spokesperson Gran Hewad told the US-backed Radio Azadi: “India one of the biggest donor countries and has helped Afghanistan in development and reconstruction areas. We appreciate their cooperation. We expect India and other neighbouring countries [will] play a significant role in [the] Afghan peace process.”There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Stanikzai’s remarks.Stanikzai had also claimed that India has only cooperated with “those who are corrupt and have been put in power by foreigners not elected by Afghan people”.These developments have come days after the US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, discussed the Afghan peace process with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval during a trip to New Delhi. He also said India should directly engage with the Taliban.People familiar with developments have said India is yet to take a call on engaging with the Taliban in any way.Khalid Sadaat, a political analyst, told Radio Azadi that the Taliban are making such assertions on Pakistan’s demand. He said, “The Taliban should not give themselves this liberty to make county and state-level remarks, as it will have negative consequences for Afghanistan in future.“The other thing is that India and Pakistan are having historical enmity and Pakistan is playing a proxy role in Afghanistan, and Taliban are being accused of playing Pakistan’s proxy role in Afghanistan and are backed by Pakistan. I believe Taliban [are making] these assertions on Pakistan’s demand.”The US has also stepped up efforts to implement its troubled deal with the Taliban, which has run into problems because of several issues, including the release of prisoners. India has also called for a cessation of hostilities so that authorities can focus on the Covid-19 pandemic.Over the past few days, a fake document about the Taliban calling for the launch of jihad in India went viral on social media. The Taliban denied the reports and a spokesman clarified the group’s policy does not allow interference in the affairs of any other country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kabul-dismisses-taliban-claims-of-india-s-negative-role-in-afghanistan/story-daVhxH6VPzSmiXEIM2FliL.html
19-05-2020||India||Vijay Mallya return a shot in the arm for probe of bankers, officials||Businessman Vijay Mallya’s return to India from the UK, inevitable now that he has exhausted his legal options against India’s extradition request, is set to provide impetus to a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of a larger conspiracy involving public sector bankers who lent him money, two CBI officials said.Bankers cleared loans worth Rs.6,027 crore to Mallya’s Kingfisher Airlines (KFA), ignoring false representations and the fact that the airline was in the red, said the officials, who requested anonymity. Mallya fled to the UK in March 2016 as banks closed in on him to recover loans given to the company, which was grounded in 2012.CBI registered a separate case against Mallya and unknown others in August 2016 to probe the alleged conspiracy in the loans extended to Kingfisher by a consortium of 17 banks led by State Bank of India between 2005 and 2010. A chargesheet is yet to be filed in the case because Mallya hasn’t yet been questioned in connection with the suspected conspiracy.On his return from the UK, the CBI may take Mallya into custody and interrogate him about the role played by senior bank executives who may have influenced the decision by banks to extend loans to Kingfisher Airlines, the two CBI officials cited above said. Several managing directors and executive directors of the public sector banks, who approved these loans could face the heat, one of the officials said.Some of the MDs and senior officials from top banks – including SBI, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Central Bank of India – were questioned by a CBI special investigation team (SIT) in mid-2018. Kingfisher Airlines’ total outstanding loans, including interest that piled up, amounted to a little over Rs 10,000 crore.The first official cited above said Mallya had met one bank MD on a Sunday. As banks are closed on Sundays, this is being seen as a move to influence the decision of loan approval. Talking about the role of bankers, judge Emma Arbuthnot of the Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London, ordering Mallya’s extradition to India on December 11, 2018, said:“Conspiracies are very rarely proved with direct evidence and there is none in this case but there is evidence that the GOI [government of India] relies on from which it says the court can draw inferences that the bankers were involved in a conspiracy with KFA”.“If the criteria for lending to KFA had been applied, if the background checks had been carried out, the loans should not have been granted. If the end-use certificates and all the other post sanction conditions applied, the loans would not have been misapplied in the way they were,” the judge noted.The UK high court on Thursday rejected Mallya’s plea to approach the UK Supreme Court for appealing against the extradition.Mallya’ extradition to India is based on a first information report filed by the CBI in July 2015 in connection with a Rs 900 crore loan sanctioned by IDBI Bank to KFA. The Enforcement Directorate has charge-sheeted Mallya in both cases, alleging that he diverted most of the money into foreign assets, the Indian Premier League (IPL) team and F1 motorsport firm Formula One. Mallya’s assets worth Rs 13,000 crore have already been attached by ED.The second CBI officer cited above said “documents pertaining to loans given by 17 banks have already been scrutinized and several bank officials have been examined in last four years. A chargesheet will be filed soon”.Mallya has repeatedly said that he is ready to pay his creditors in full for the loans he owes.He tweeted on Thursday - “Congratulations to the government for a Covid-19 relief package. They can print as much currency as they want BUT should a small contributor like me who offers 100 percent payback of state-owned bank loans be constantly ignored? Please take my money unconditionally and close”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mallya-return-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-probe-of-bankers-officials/story-rDuD8Z99RYFDa4SKSQZlsM.html

The external affairs ministry has already said Lipulekh, at the centre of a border row over the construction of a road to the border with China, is “completely within the territory of India”.Defence minister Rajnath Singh recently opened the 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh Pass. It was built so that pilgrims going to Kailash-Mansarovar can avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.Nepal has also been irked by Indian Army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane’s remarks last week that Nepal’s protest against the border road was at the behest of “someone else” – a veiled reference to China. The Indian Army chief is also the honorary chief of the Nepal Army.Monday’s development came barely a day after Gyawali thanked the Indian government for providing medical logistics and kits for 30,000 tests as part of cooperation to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.Kathmandu has contending the new road “passes through Nepali territory” and the government summoned the Indian envoy last week to lodge a protest. The border row erupted months after Nepal was irked by the depiction of Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand in new Indian maps showing the union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.India has said both sides can resolve such boundary issues through dialogue, though such talks would be held after they have dealt with the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-border-row-with-india-nepal-to-publish-new-maps/story-0HSeKDe0nDavkf3aAVGwcM.html
19-05-2020||India||Bengal and Odisha brace for super cyclone Amphan, PM Modi takes stock||Super cyclone Amphan will make landfall in West Bengal between Digha and Hatiya Island in Bangladesh on Wednesday afternoon and is likely to have a devastating impact on the biodiverse Sundarbans mangrove forest region, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. This is the first super cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal since 1999 when over 9,000 people were killed in Odisha.The wind speed is expected to be around 110 to 120 km per hour when Amphan crosses and is feared to lead to extensive damage even in Kolkata. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday chaired a high-level meeting to review the response measures to deal with Amphan and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)’s evacuation plan. Officials said NDRF has deployed 25 teams, kept 12 others ready in reserve and 24 on the standby.In a social media discussion organised by Union earth sciences ministry, IMD director general M Mohapatra said the cyclone can lead to the uprooting of trees, electric poles, damage to makeshift houses and old structures besides extensive flooding in densely-populated areas with poor drainage.“All kinds of adverse weather can be expected as this is an extremely intense storm. I am making it very clear that it will be very intense,” said Mohapatra. He added Amphan intensified rapidly from a cyclonic storm on Saturday to a super cyclone by Monday afternoon with a wind speed of 220 to 230 km per hour. Amphan was expected to maintain its super cyclone status and intensity over the next 24 hours. Amphan is a massive cyclone, 700 km in extent and 15 km in height, as it rotates around its centre in the central Bay of Bengal. The wind speed during landfall in the North and South 24 Pargana districts of West Bengal is likely to be around 165 to 175 km per hour gusting to 195 km per hour. Extremely heavy rainfall and severe winds are expected in East Medinipur, South and North 24 Parganas, Hooghly and Kolkata. Four to six-metre and three to four-metre high tidal waves above the astronomical tide are likely to inundate low lying areas of South and North 24 Parganas and East Medinipur during the landfall.According to a statement by the ministry of home affairs, the Indian Coast Guard and the Navy have deployed ships and helicopters for relief and rescue operations. Army and Air Force units are also on standby in West Bengal and Odisha. Mohapatra said the cyclone is also expected to extensively damage the biodiversity of Sunderbans. In north coastal Odisha also, wind speed can go up to 135 km per hour during landfall, but major damage is not expected as the cyclone is expected to cross parallel to the state’s coast.“WB [West Bengal] coast is very shallow in nature... normal tidal waves go much inland. This can go up to 25 km along the rivers,” said Mohapatra. He added Amphan is meeting all favourable conditions for a rapid increase of intensity, including high sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity vorticity.IMD said this is the first time that super cyclones will be recorded in two consecutive years—Kyarr (2019) and now Amphan--and could be linked to higher sea surface temperatures. Kyarr was formed in the Arabian Sea but was concentrated there and caused no fatalities. The last severe cyclone Fani hit Odisha in May 2019 and killed over 80 people.“All conditions are currently favourable for the development of a super cyclone. The sea surface temperature is in the range of 30 to 31 degree Celsius, as compared to an expected temperature of 28 degree Celsius. There is vertical wind shear (change in wind speed with altitude), sufficient moisture, convective environment etc,” said Sunita Devi, who is in charge of cyclones at IMD.Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said Amphan has intensified extremely rapidly compared to other cyclones. “Since satellite data is available, such rapid intensification has not been seen. Cyclones draw energy from the ocean surface. So, sea surface temperature is an important factor. We are seeing record temperatures in some parts of the Bay of Bengal. Some buoys of the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services have recorded maximum temperature 32 to 34 degree Celsius during the first two weeks of May. That is linked to climate change surely and is one element which makes sure rapid intensification.”Koll further said, “Amphan, with a wind speed of 145 knots, is now the strongest cyclone to have ever occurred in the Bay of Bengal (ever since 1982 when monitoring began) beating Phailin, the Odisha super cyclone of 1999. Also, this is the strongest cyclone to have occurred in the north Indian Ocean since 1982 (when monitoring began), equalling cyclne Gonu (occurring in the Arabian Sea in 2007) with wind speed of 145 knots. But the 1999 Odisha super cyclone is the strongest cyclone to make landfall over India till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-and-odisha-brace-for-cyclone-pm-modi-takes-stock/story-XfLIGsg9OMIUXl8iIIWvQN.html
19-05-2020||India||Smaller districts new hot spots in Madhya Pradesh||Khandwa city in Nimad region, 271 kilometres north west of Bhopal, with a population of about 2 lakh as per 2011 census, witnessed as many as 90 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, most of them from a colony inhabited by trading community members whereas in the same period, Indore known as the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh, with a population of about 20 lakh (as per 2011 census), added 92 new patients, as per heath department data.Khandwa is among the smaller districts emerging as a new Covid hot spot in the state.Burhanpur, the neighbouring district of Khandwa, and situated, like Khandwa, on the Maharashtra border, is another district which is, of late, witnessing a spurt in new Covid-19 cases in the city. On April 28, the city with a population of about 2.10 lakh had its first Covid patient. In the past 20 days the city has registered as many as 195 positive cases; 11 people died from the infection.Whereas Indore, which reported its first Covid patient on March 25, has a Covid-19 positive case for about every 800 people, a small town like Burhanpur now has a Covid-19 positive case for every 1100 people. Khandwa has one Covid-19 patient for 1100 persons.The other smaller districts worrying the government include Khargone, Dhar, Raisen, Dewas, Mandsaur and Neemuch.As many as 45 of 52 districts have been affected by the disease, which has claimed 248 lives so far among 4977 cases.Dr Yogesh Sharma, an epidemiologist in Khandwa, said, “The sudden spurt in positive cases is because of a particular locality reporting most of the cases. Now, we are tracing those who came in contact with these people. We are yet to know how these people contracted the virus.”Burhapur collector Praveen Singh, said, “Initially some of those who tested positive for coronavirus happened to be public figures like two ex-corporators and a few doctors. Our contact tracing suggested that many contracted the virus from them. I have instructed authorities to ensure strict compliance of curfew restrictions in the city.” However, public health experts and social activists said that had the state government paid attention to these districts right from the beginning, they would not have become new hot spots.A health official from Burhanpur, who didn’t want to be named , said, “We suggested to the then collector that there should be more and more sampling and testing but he turned down our suggestions. However, the new collector has asked us to go for a massive survey and screening.”Prakash, a social activist from Khandwa, said, “An alarming increase in Covid cases is quite unfortunate. Had the administration been alert this situation would have been averted.”Public health expert, Amulya Nidhi, said, “Lockdown has failed and so have the state government’s other strategies as announced so far in containing the virus. The situation remains that even after two months of lockdown the government is not able to control the disease. It is high time the government should chalk out specific plans for every district, ward and block and also involve representatives of all the sections of society including health experts in this exercise.”A health department official who didn’t want to be named said, “Since districts in Nimad region are situated on MP-Maharashtra border, travel of people from MP to Maharashtra and vice versa appears to be one of the main reasons. Testing of samples has been increased in these districts from an average 50 per day to more than 200 per day.” He said, “We have identified at least 10 districts which were added to the list of Covid-19 patients in the past fortnight due to migrant labourers testing positive. On humanitarian grounds, we can’t stop the influx of the migrant labourers but the system is being strengthened at village and panchayat level to ensure quarantine of labourers strictly to ensure that these districts don’t emerge as further hot spots in the state.”Health minister Narottam Mishra said, “The situation is much under control in the state. More and more people are recovering from the disease and are being discharged from hospitals. The recovery rate has gone up to more than 46%. However, we are taking all the precautions and measures for further improvement in the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smaller-districts-new-hot-spots-in-mp/story-DVtPrHZJmkbzw6ReD7l0VM.html

19-05-2020||India||Telangana tests only 225 samples daily; Andhra 9,000||At a time when Andhra Pradesh has been conducting an average of 9,000 tests for Covid-19 every day, the number of samples being tested in the neighbouring Telugu state of Telangana has been only an average of 225 samples a day. Telengana tests 664 per million while the country tests 1660 per million. This came to light on Sunday night when the Telangana medical and health department officials disclosed the data analytics of testing as on May 16 to explain the gender and age distribution among the positive cases for Covid-19.According to G Srinivasa Rao, director of medical and health, Telangana government, the cumulative number of samples tested as on May 16 was 23,388, including that of 947 male positive, 14,256 male negative, 566 female positive and 7619 female negative cases.Among the positive cases, both male and female, 218 cases belong to the age group of 0-15 years, 434 are from the age group of 16-30 years, 406 are from age group of 31-45 years, 301 cases are from the age group of 46-60 and 151 cases are of above 60 years of age.The last time the department released the figures of cumulative number of tests done in the state was on April 28, when the health minister addressed a press conference and disclosed that 19,303 tests were conducted till that date.Taking into account the latest figures of 23,388 samples tested, the total number of tests conducted between April 28 and May 16 was 4085 – an average of 226 cases per day.A statement from the office of Telangana health minister Eatala Rajender said the total number of tests conducted in the state as on May 14 was 22,842. It does mean 546 tests were done in a span of 48 hours – an average of 273 per day, showing that the testing has slightly improved in the last three days.The first Covid-19 cases was reported in Telangana on March 2 and it was only after March 15 that the government released figures about the number of samples tested – 22 samples on March 15 and 764 on March 24, when Tablighi Jamaat episode pushed the number up. After that the Telangana government stopped releasing the data pertaining to number of samples tested for Covid-19.The health minister has been refusing to divulge the data stating that the number of positive cases that were detected in the testing, rather than the number of samples being tested, was a parameter for the spread of the virus.As on Sunday evening, 1551 positive cases and 34 deaths were reported in Telangana; of them, 525 cases are still active and others have recovered.“We do not want to do indiscriminate testing of people just for the sake of figures. We have been conducting tests as per the ICMR guidelines only on those having genuine symptoms and also with comorbid conditions, apart from those who had been the primary contacts of the positive cases,” Rajender said.He further said thought there are private labs that have got permission from ICMR to conduct the tests for Covid-19, the state government did not give the clearance because it would lead to these labs fleecing people even if they had mild symptoms. “Each test costs around Rs 5,000 and we do not want the people to be fleeced,” he said.In Andhra Pradesh, however, the testing of samples for Covid-19 has been stepped up in the last one month, after the state health department began using Trunat rapid testing kits, besides RT-PCR testing. The AP government has also imported two lakh rapid test kits from South Korea, which are also being used for random testing during the door-to-door survey.According to state nodal officer for Covid-19, Arja Sreekanth, 2,48,711 samples have been tested as on Monday. In all, the state reported 2432 positive cases, including 150 those of migrant labourers, besides 50 deaths.Meanwhile, Telangana high court, which was hearing a public interest litigation petition, on Monday observed that the number of tests in the state was too low. It suggested to the government to step up testing by introducing mobile testing as is being done in Kerala.It asked the state government to submit the details of testing for Covid-19 being done in the state and posted the case to May 26 for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-tests-only-225-samples-daily-andhra-9k/story-rhDi6jAtUsvVhp7cP14A5K.html
19-05-2020||India||29 cases in Kerala, highest in 2 months||Kerala on Monday reported the highest Covid-19 cases in two months as 29 people, including 21 who have recently returned from abroad and seven from other states, were diagnosed with the disease, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. The spike came even as the state government announced a series of measures to ease the lockdown imposed in late March to check the pandemic spread. The measures include the reopening of liquor shops from Wednesday.Kerala, which was the first in the country to report a Covid-19 case in January and was the worst-hit in early March, has earned praise for controlling the spread of the disease. The state’s active cases dipped to 16 last week. They have since gone up to 130 while thousands are under observation with symptoms. Kerala has over the last five days reported 97 cases. It is now bracing for a major surge in the Covid-19 cases as 38 flights from abroad and 24 trains from other states are expected to arrive over the next two weeks. Over 2.5 million people from Kerala live abroad mostly in West Asian countries.Vijayan said they have announced some concessions but it does not mean that the restrictions are over. “We have to keep in mind the rising number of cases,” he said. Vijayan said they were a major concern. All liquor shops as well hotel bars will be allowed to sell alcohol for the first time since the lockdown was enforced on March 25. Vijayan said customers will have to register online to buy liquor and they will be allotted particular time slots. The state had earlier refused to open liquor outlets fearing a rush.Prohibition activists have asked the government not to allow selling of liquor, which is one of the main sources of revenue for it. The opposition Congress, too, criticised the move to allow the sale of liquor through bars. The state will also resume bus services within districts with increased fares. For inter-district travel, passes will be mandatory while only half-filled buses will be allowed to ply, said Vijayan. Auto-rickshaws and taxis will also be allowed but with restricted number of passengers.At barbershops, only cutting of hair will be allowed while beauty parlours and spas will remain shut along with shopping complexes and malls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-cases-in-kerala-highest-in-2-months/story-VIgo2YnJYyfkyqbfcfTprM.html
19-05-2020||India||Goa sees biggest 1-day spike with 10 new cases, state tally reaches 39||Goa on Monday reported its biggest spike in Covid-19 cases as 14 people, who have recently returned to the state, were diagnosed with the disease to take its tally to 43, officials said and added 36 of them are active cases detected over the last three days. A 100-bed hospital set up for Covid-19 patients in the state was until late last week empty as all the seven patients had been discharged after recovering. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said 20 of the active cases involve those who arrived by a train from New Delhi after having alighted at Panvel in Maharashtra. He added eight people found Covid-19 positive arrived by train on Saturday while 12 on Sunday.The number of cases in Goa has risen since the weekend and involve largely those who have tested upon their arrival in the state. Officials said a family of five and their driver, two lorry drivers, and a cleaner, two people who returned from West Bengal, two industrial workers, and a seafarer are among those tested positive. “Of the active cases, 33 have come from Maharashtra [the worst-hit state by the pandemic],” Sawant said. He said Goa is the only state which is testing every passenger alighting in Goa. “On our request, the next Rajdhani [train] will not be coming to Goa. It is only the Kerala-bound trains that will continue to stop in Goa,” Sawant said. Around 414 Goans stranded in Italy are being flown in next week on chartered flights arranged by a cruise ship company they worked with. Officials said they will screen and test them at the airport before sending them for quarantine as per the protocol. Officials said 1.5 lakh migrants have registered with the Goa government seeking their return to their home states. Around 10,200 have returned or are scheduled to be sent to their respective states this week. Sawant said states like Bihar, West Bengal, and Orissa are yet to arrange trains for the migrant workers from these states. Special trains carrying migrants have so far been sent to places like Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu & Kashmir. Trains to Uttar Pradesh and Chattisgarh have been planned over the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-sees-biggest-1-day-spike-with-10-new-cases-state-tally-reaches-39/story-xG27OzZJV7hnbg236eLRBI.html
19-05-2020||India||Stimulus package a lost opportunity: Bernstein||Global securities research firm Sanford Bernstein termed the Rs 20 lakh crore economic revival package announced by the Modi government to cope with the coronavirus disease and the impact of the lockdown imposed to slow its spread as a “lost opportunity” echoing growing concern about whether it would help revive the economy. “While the package started on important aspects but the need to announce measures that add up to this top down number, made the entire package aimless, with several generic announcements which should ideally, have been a part of a normal economic agenda. Overall, we see it as a lost opportunity,” the May 17 report on Asia-Pacific Equity Strategy said.India’s desire to announce a large economic package, something that shows the world that it cares about the economy and is willing to match global stimulus numbers, was perhaps the driver for the claim of a large package (USD 280bn, 10% of GDP), the firm said. The finance ministry did not respond to an email seeking comment on the report.Earlier, in an interview with Hindustan Times (published on Monday), finance minister said the government has taken an informed decision on the package . “Every sector has been helped. I think this is a reasonably exhaustive package. And it approaches every section — perhaps in our own way, not in a way people wanted us to. There is hope for everyone to be benefit from this.” The report, however, said, “Broader reforms lack the spark.” Not much was discussed on land, labour reforms, tax rationalization or on any coherent plan to invite foreign manufacturing, it added. “The government’s defence indigenization plan is not new and has been poorly executed in the past and that is also the case with commercial mining for coal. APMC (amendment) plans are good but also need support from states. The discom plan is insufficient,”the firm pointed out. Analysing the proportion of fiscal and monetary measures in the stimulus package, the report said of the overall $280 billion, credit guarantees were around $62billion and liquidity support from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) around $108 billion. Government programs of $173 billion includes $132 billion of loans, $24billion of fiscal support (0.9% of GDP) and rest largely for food grains etc, which is from Food Corporation of India (FCI) stock and other schemes.“India does not have fiscal buffers hence a large fiscal stimulus would have been a bold bet – as that could have impacted ratings and currency, if not executed properly.Government has hence taken an easier path,” it said.Sitharaman addressed this question in Sunday’s interview with HT. “Rating agencies rate you (badly) f you alone are not doing well in a world that is otherwise rosy. With a global pandemic, with every economy being affected….ratings can’t be done in isolation.”“I’ve thought about it, and it doesn’t worry me. Look at the strengths of India: we are less affected; our foreign exchange reserves and macroeconomy are strong; we have had a six year tenure of PM Modi who has handled the economy responsibly; our debt to GDP ratio has come down. Why would the rating agencies treat us badly?,” she added.The Bernstein report, however, appreciated measures taken for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) such as credit guarantees for fresh credit to support a sector that employs large workforce. It gave a thumbs up to package supporting the poor and migrants. “The expansion of MGNREGA, has a negative aspect, as it could impact labour availability, as rural migrants may not rush back for jobs (construction, transport most impacted),” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stimulus-package-a-lost-opportunity-bernstein/story-dedaae4OQjenIjk9oLjm7H.html

The Aarogya Setu Interactive Voice Response System was launched on April 21 to reach 900 million feature phone users across the country after a successful pilot in Tamil Nadu. Union Information Technology ministry officials said 6 lakh people called on the toll-free number for the survey. “A few people have been identified as unwell through the survey and the data has been given to the respective state officials,” said a ministry official, without specifying the number of people identified as unwell or those who have been tested after the assessment.The official said data collected from the survey has helped in finding some hotspots through a variety of data sets. “...the inputs from the system are forwarded to states,” said the official on condition of anonymity without elaborating. As per the ministry’s estimates, there are 1.2 billion mobile phone users in India, but only 350 million have smartphones. The remaining 900 million are feature phone users.A user has to place a call on the number ‘1921’ which then prompts a survey. People are asked if they have come in contact with anyone tested positive for Covid-19 as part of the survey under which details like gender, age, and symptoms are sought. They later receive messages telling them if they are safe or not and are also advised to download the Aarogya Setu app if they have smartphones. The helpline and survey is managed by a team from the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme and the National Informatics Centre in 11 regional languages. V Kamakoti, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, led a team in Tamil Nadu to pilot the tele-survey in March. The team screened 15,000 people over the phone and helped the state detect suspected Covid-19 patients, as well as indications of the hotspots. As many as 115 million people have downloaded the Aarogya Setu app till now.The government on Sunday eased the requirement for office-goers to mandatorily install the Aarogya Setu app, asking employers instead to ensure “on best effort basis” their staff have the tool.The app is still mandatory for those taking the special trains or arriving from abroad by the repatriation flights.Independent software researchers and privacy experts have criticised the app for having vulnerabilities and for collecting excess sensitive data that could aid in illegal surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200k-people-with-basic-phones-took-health-test-via-tele-survey/story-ZIfcQmehXDJ7eq3D8wRUUO.html
19-05-2020||India||TN boy 1st case of Covid inflammatory syndrome||An eight-year-old boy from Chennai has become India’s first case of acute illness because of hyper-inflammatory syndrome associated with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This syndrome describes inflammation in the entire body, including vital organs, which leads to multiorgan failure and shock.The Covid-19 positive child was brought in a critical condition to Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, and was admitted into the intensive care unit, with overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome (toxins produced in body due to overgrowth of a microbe leading to shock) and Kawasaki disease (that leads to inflamed blood vessels), according to the pre-print paper published in the journal of Indian Paediatrics on May 10.“…The initial differential diagnoses were pneumonia with septic shock, COVID-19 penumonitis, Kawasaki Disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome.,” said the paper titled, “Hyper-inflammatory syndrome in a child with Covid-19 treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulin and tocilizumab”.The boy was given intensive care, and recovered completely after two weeks, says the paper.A paper published in The Lancet on May 7 documented having found a cluster of eight children with similar symptoms in South Thames Retrieval Service in London during a period of 10 days in mid-April. There have also been reports of similar cases from the US.Available data says the disease is generally milder in children and adolescents compared with adults. The World Health Organization (WHO) has created a working group of experts from all over the world to begin investigating cases to establish evidence on whether Covid-19 can lead to multiorgan failure also in this age group. Dr Rakesh Lodha, department of pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, is one of the 10 experts from five countries that are a part of the newly constituted working group.The United Nations body has formed the working group to have a protocol in place for collection, collation and analysis of data from around the world, and India is likely to be one of the countries selected as surveillance sites.“The group has just been formed to look into evidence to ascertain whether these clusters that are being reported from various countries of inflammatory shock syndrome in kids and adolescents are in context with Covid or not because these symptoms can also be seen in other infections. The idea is to know whether Covid can lead to this or not since so far it was believed that the disease is largely milder in children,” says Lodha, who is a professor in the paediatrics department.“India could also be selected as one of the sites as there is a case documented from within the country that fits into the case definition that the WHO has defined for selecting children as case studies. WHO will be collecting and analysing data but right now the next step will be to form data sharing protocols as it would relevant permissions from local authorities,” he says. Children up to 19 years of age who are either in the intensive care unit or have severe symptoms will be studied.“It is essential to characterize this syndrome and its risk factors, to understand causality, and describe treatment interventions. It is not yet clear the full spectrum of disease, and whether the geographical distribution in Europe and North America reflects a true pattern, or if the condition has simply not been recognized elsewhere. There is therefore an urgent need for collection of standardized data describing clinical presentations, severity, outcomes, and epidemiology..,” says WHO in its scientific brief.The case definition to be eligible for the surveillance will be a child having persistent fever (more than three days), inflammation, and evidence of single or multiorgan dysfunction (shock, cardiac, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal or neurological disorder).“Since it is to see its corelation with Covid, preference will be to cases associated with Covid in any way including a positive case either with RT-PCR or rapid testing, direct contact of a lab confirmed case or cases from high risk areas,” says Dr Lodha.The researchers in the Indian paper believe that there may be a rise in these symptoms in children across India in the coming weeks. “It is clear from Europe and the USA that appearance of this syndrome in children follows the peak of infections in affected areas... We believe that children across India may present with this inflammatory syndrome related to Covid-19 in the weeks ahead…,” the paper says.Paediatricians say the number is very small, and shouldn’t cause an alarm at the moment.“Multisystem inflammatory syndrome can be seen in any child with any viral infection. It starts a sort of inflammatory chain reaction that affects one organ after another in a short span of time. However, how it happens and why, it is still not very clear. Many of these children succumb because the deterioration happens fast. It is also seen in children with Covid but it shouldn’t cause any panic in general public as the number of children who develop this kind of complication is small,” says Dr Rahul Nagpal, head of department of paediatrics, Fortis Healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-boy-1st-case-of-covid-inflammatory-syndrome/story-n1cRSjXxxmO7AV0a9J6VMK.html
19-05-2020||India||No test needed for emergency cases||In a huge relief to patients needing emergency surgeries, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) directed that no emergency procedure (including deliveries) should be delayed for lack of testing—hospitals can simultaneously send samples for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing.The directive was a part of the revised Covid-19 testing guidelines that the research body released on Monday.“No emergency procedure (including deliveries) should be delayed for lack of test. However, sample can be sent for testing (of eligible patients) simultaneously…[sic],” read the ICMR advisory.“It was reported that some hospitals had been admitting patients only after making them undergo Covid-19 tests; more so in cases of chemo, dialysis or even surgeries. This was much-required clarity from ICMR,” said a senior public health expert, requesting not to be identified.However, all hospitalised patients, who develop influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms should be tested for the disease. According to the guidelines, cases of ILI are defined as those with “acute respiratory infection with fever ≥ 38◦C and cough”.In its fifth revised guidelines on Covid-19 testing, ICMR allowed testing to be expanded to include frontline workers involved in the containment and mitigation of the disease, apart from the health care workers who were already included in its previous guidelines.“This category is equally vulnerable as they are directly in contact with suspected or confirmed cases as part of door-to-door surveys, screening, etc. You don’t want them to be moving around as carriers of the disease,” the senior public health expert said. Covid-19 testing is now also allowed for all symptomatic ILI cases who have returned from abroad as well as for migrants within seven days of display of symptoms, according to the ICMR.Testing among asymptomatic cases is allowed only if a person is a direct and high-risk contact of a laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 case. “…to be tested once between day 5 and day 10 of coming into contact,” said the revised guidelines. This is a shift from the earlier guidelines which stated an asymptomatic case can be tested only between day 5 and 14.India has scaled up its Covid-19 testing capacity to one lakh samples a day. To date, 2,30,2792 samples have been tested, with 90,094 samples tested in the past 24 hours in about 373 government laboratories and 152 private laboratories approved by ICMR.“The more you test, the more you will be able to track and treat. It helps to know the numbers to formulate containment strategies accordingly,” said Dr T Jacob John, senior virologist, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.As of now, there are 916 dedicated Covid hospitals with 1,80,473 beds (isolation beds- 1,61,169 and ICU beds- 19,304) and 2,044 dedicated Covid Health Centres with 1,28,304 beds (isolation beds- 1,17,775 and ICU beds-10,529) along with 9,536 quarantine centres and 6,309 Covid Care Centres with 5,64,632 beds now available to combat Covid-19 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-test-needed-for-emergency-cases/story-V8U3Jj4JRNmbC9dDJodzVL.html
19-05-2020||India||Kashmir is India’s internal matter, says Taliban; denies plan to target Delhi||The Taliban on Monday denied claims on social media that it could join Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir, underlining that the Taliban was clear that it “does not interfere in internal affairs of other countries”.“The statement published in the media about Taaliban joining Jihad in Kashmir is wrong…. The policy of the Islamic Emirate is clear that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.” Suhail Shaheen, the spokesperson for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the political wing of Taliban calls itself, tweeted on Monday evening.The strong clarification comes a day after officials monitoring social media noted a spike in posts around claims that a Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said it was impossible to be friends with India unless the Kashmir dispute is resolved. The spokesperson was also claimed to have said that the Taliban would, after capturing power in Kabul, “capture Kashmir from infidels also”.Diplomats based in Kabul and Delhi told Hindustan Times that the Taliban spokesperson’s clarification came after India worked the backchannels to confirm reports about the group’s approach to India, and on Jammu and Kashmir.Also Watch | Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo eliminated: All the key details New Delhi was told that the social media posts were fake and did not reflect Taliban’s position.But analysts have also underlined that the Taliban wasn’t a monolithic body and comprises people holding different beliefs. For example, while the group has deep linkages with the Pakistani deep state, there are also some who favour an independent line.Since the Afghan Taliban’s top decision-making body Shura is based in Quetta and its sword arm, the Haqqani network based in Peshawar, both in Pakistan, an Af-Pak watcher said, one should not be surprised if there is a tweak in this stance under pressure from Pakistan.Already, political equations are changing rapidly in Afghanistan with the US all set to withdraw from Kabul. Unlike in the past where Islamabad for decades acted as a proxy for the US during the Soviet-Afghan war, this time Pakistan is riding on China, who in turn has close partners in Russia and Iran. This time, Washington is the common enemy.While the US has ensured that Ashraf Gani and Abdullah Abdullah have joined hands in power sharing, it hopes that the Tajik-Pashtun leader may sign an agreement with the Taliban as the former has refused to be any party to it.The Indian initiative in Afghanistan is also at cross-roads as Pakistan based terrorists groups will use Taliban-ruled Kabul to target India without fear of any Balakot. For all the main players, Afghanistan is turning full circle with Pakistan strategically placed in the great game.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-is-india-s-internal-matter-says-taliban-denies-plan-to-target-delhi/story-sOgG3yPsMenP4nZDKRbygL.html

Based on this, the state government will formulate its strategy, a senior government official said.Gehlot said that a large number of migrants from other states have reached villages. Special attention should be given in rural areas as there may be a risk of the infection spreading in such areas, the chief minister cautioned.The Rajasthan government will soon be running Shramik Special buses for migrants heading home on foot through national highways after Sunday’s lockdown 4.0 guidelines permitted inter-state travel through buses and other vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-reports-3-new-covid-19-cases-count-breaches-5000-mark-tally-at-5-375/story-IhkbcOLziorqVt8TFqxA6J.html
19-05-2020||India||Trump’s 200 ventilators for India cost $2.6 million, reaching in 3 weeks||The United States will airlift 200 mobile ventilators, each estimated to cost about Rs 1 million, to help Indians combat Covid-19, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.“It has been indicated that the consignment will arrive by the end of this month or latest, early June,” a government official said. Each of these mobile ventilators is estimated to cost the US administration $ 13,000 (Rs 9.6 lakh at current exchange rates) without accounting for the transportation costs. In all, the ventilators will be worth about $ 2.6 million (or Rs 192 million) plus freight charges.US President Donald Trump had announced the decision to donate the ventilators on Twitter to underline close relations between the two countries. The gesture coincides with reports of India’s 85,700 coronavirus cases surpassing the tally of China (82,933), the country where the outbreak began.“We stand with India and @narendramodi during this pandemic. We’re also cooperating on vaccine development. Together we will beat the invisible enemy!” President Trump tweeted.Trump reiterated the point at his Press conference moments later, referring to his India visit in February, the role played by Indian expatriates in the US and describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “good friend of mine”.“We are working closely with India,” he told reporters.Trump also said the US and India were cooperating to develop a vaccine for coronavirus that has claimed over 307,000 lives and infected more than 4.5 million people globally since it emerged in China in December last year.PM Modi thanked him in a tweet and highlighted the India-US relationship. “In such times, it’s always important for nations to work together and do as much as possible to make our world healthier and free from Covid-19,” he said. Thank you @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. This pandemic is being fought collectively by all of us. In such times, it’s always important for nations to work together and do as much as possible to make our world healthier and free from COVID-19. More power to 🇮🇳 - 🇺🇸 friendship! https://t.co/GRrgWFhYzRThe US move comes weeks after Prime Minister Modi acted on Trump’s request to reverse a ban on export of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that was championed by the US President as a “game changer” in the fight against the coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine, or HCQ, is being used in India as a prophylaxis for health workers at the frontline of the country’s response to the epidemic.Diplomats in Washington and New Delhi said Trump’s offer to send the ventilators and his public statements were an indicator of the deepening ties between the two countries and close contact between the two countries at different levels.It also comes against the backdrop of growing congruence of views between the two countries on accountability and transparency on the origin of the coronavirus, reforms in the World Health Organisation led by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and even strategic issues such as terrorism and the situation in the Indo Pacific.For weeks, Trump has roasted the WHO for allowing itself to be led by China’s assessment of the virus when the disease was detected in central China’s Wuhan city last year. There have also been accusations from Washington that the Sars-CoV-2 virus may not be natural and may have been created in a laboratory, a possibility that was echoed this week by PM Modi’s cabinet colleague Nitin Gadkari in a media interview.That the two sides are on the same page on China and WHO also came across at a seven-nation video conference initiated by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. There was broad agreement on the need to stress on transparency and accountability for the spread of the disease that has killed over 3 lakh people worldwide. The emphasis on transparency and accountability at this meeting attended by Foreign Minister S Jaishankar is seen to be aimed at China and the WHO that is due to hold its annual meet on Monday.(Editor’s note: The story has been updated)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-s-200-ventilators-for-india-cost-2-6-million-reaching-in-3-weeks/story-bO7s9Ng4thj6HuvkcA6DGM.html
19-05-2020||Editorials||The new normal is here | HT Editorial||The fourth phase of the lockdown, announced by the government on Sunday, represents a departure from the past three phases. While relaxations were gradually introduced in each phase, India is now substantially opening up. Inter-state travel is allowed; markets — excluding malls — will resume business; there will be more vehicular movement, including of taxi aggregators; more people will now go back to offices; and the everyday rhythm of life, interrupted since March 25, will be restored to some extent. States have been given the authority to demarcate red, orange and green zones, and will have more liberty in determining the extent of activity permitted in them. To be sure, there will be strict control in containment zones, but the big picture in lockdown 4.0 is of an India getting back on its feet.Here is the paradox. India is opening up on the very day that it neared 100,000 positive cases. Delhi has crossed 10,000 cases, the fourth state to have hit the number after Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. In the last fortnight, the coronavirus disease also hit 180 additional districts, taking the total affected districts to over 550. Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh witnessed the sharpest increase in the number of districts — which is primarily being attributed to the return of migrant workers home, who are now testing positive. This is the case at a time when most migrant workers have not yet returned home, or been tested. So with more relaxations and travel, expect a further spike in numbers.Remember that India imposed the lockdown when there were just a little less than 500 cases. It is opening up when there is a clear surge. The lockdown, as this newspaper has argued, was yielding diminishing returns on the health front and was causing economic devastation of an unprecedented scale. The relaxations are, therefore, legitimate. This period has also been used to ramp up health infrastructure to a limited extent — with more dedicated hospitals, testing kits, personal protective equipment, the evolution of a health protocol around testing-tracing-isolation-treatment, and consistent messaging on social distancing. India will now have to learn to live with this contradiction — between the rising number of cases and relaxations and resumption of economic activity. Adjusting to this “new normal” will not be easy. Government systems will come under stress. There will be more panic as more and more people test positive. But there is no choice. Citizens can do their bit by abiding by social distancing norms, wearing masks and taking precautions, while the State must ensure that gains on the health front are not squandered, and the balance between lives and livelihoods is managed as well as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-new-normal-is-here-ht-editorial/story-NMYOGBtlNeJZc0siURviCJ.html
