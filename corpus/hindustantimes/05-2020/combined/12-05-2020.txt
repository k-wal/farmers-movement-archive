12-05-2020||News||A ‘new normal’ is in the offing. Ensure a balance| Analysis||The World Health Organization (WHO) Southeast Asia region is entering a new phase in its pandemic response. In recent weeks, the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the region has slowed, due to the unprecedented physical distancing measures that countries implemented early and aggressively. Several member-states are now preparing to transition to a “new normal” in which social and economic life can coexist with low disease transmission. To do that effectively, countries must continue to mobilise the full power of their whole-of-government, whole-of-society approaches. The spread of Covid-19 continues to cause disease, death and disruption. It has pushed even the most advanced health systems to the brink. The crude mortality ratio for Covid-19 is estimated to be upwards of 3%, but can change from country to country, and even within countries. Key variables include access to care and the availability of testing. The region’s member-states must continue to take evidence-informed action and conduct careful risk assessments before deciding to wind back on public health and social measures. Due consideration must be given to the local epidemiology of Covid-19, including hotspots and clusters, and the capacity of systems and responders to find, isolate and care for cases, and quarantine contacts. Whatever a country’s current transmission scenario, there is no doubt that we are in for a long haul. In what will be an ongoing struggle against Covid-19, the strategies of member-states must be comprehensive and cover immediate and long-term needs. Three priorities must chart the path ahead: Control and suppression of spread, strengthening and maintaining health services, and supporting each other to stay safe and healthy.To control and suppress spread, we must take the fight to the virus. Active case detection, isolation, testing and contact tracing are the main ways to control the virus. Should community transmission occur, they are vital to suppressing it. Strengthening surveillance and contact tracing, in particular, will help national and local authorities to rapidly adapt to evolving outbreaks, whether moving from one case to a cluster of cases, or from a cluster of cases to no cases. Agility and innovation will be crucial, especially at the subnational level, across borders and with mobile populations. For areas with limited transmission, responders must focus on finding and isolating all cases, providing them with appropriate care, and tracing, quarantining and supporting all contacts. Where sustained transmission occurs, they must reduce it to manageable clusters, for which they may consider reintroducing physical distancing measures in a way that minimises negative impacts.To strengthen health services, all countries must first protect health workers. WHO continues to work with governments, industry and the pandemic supply chain network to overcome global shortages of personal protective equipment. Health workers must be provided gowns, gloves, medical masks and eye protection required to save lives and avoid infection.Countries must continue to expand isolation and intensive care unit capacity, while also rationalising it. By networking Covid-19 treatment facilities, health leaders and administrators can better share the burden among facilities. By implementing clear triage protocols, they will ensure that all patients with severe manifestations are provided safe, rapid admission to intensive care units. Rigorous infection prevention and control is needed to prevent health facilities from facilitating transmission. Ensuring essential health services are maintained is vital. We must not only reduce mortality from Covid-19 itself, but also from vaccine-preventable diseases and other treatable conditions which may increase when health systems are overwhelmed. WHO will continue to support countries in the region to implement key guidelines on maintaining essential health services as they directly respond to Covid-19. To achieve these outcomes, member-states must mobilise a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach. Regular hand-washing, coughing or sneezing into one’s elbow, and avoiding contact with people with flu-like symptoms are crucial. So too is following local and national guidance on physical distancing. Avoid using tobacco, alcohol and other substances that impair the immune system. Support health workers and say no to stigma.Look after your mental health and be supportive of others. It is natural to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or angry. Helpful coping strategies include getting enough rest, exercise, eating well, avoiding harmful substances and staying in close contact with family and friends. WHO will continue to provide accessible and actionable information on coping with Covid-19-related stress and anxiety, and will support all member-states to strengthen mental health services.We must stand together to tackle what is the greatest public health challenge of a generation. The region’s strategy to control and suppress spread, strengthen and maintain health services, and support each other to stay safe, healthy and well, will help all countries to save lives and minimise impact. Our mission is clear. Our challenge is great. Together, forward in the fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-new-normal-is-in-the-offing-ensure-a-balance-analysis/story-eaCoVqxeaAtiIUYRMlm9NL.html
12-05-2020||News||Why Covid-19 poses a sharp challenge for Bihar| Analysis||As globalisation has grown, local epidemics tend to spread faster across the world. We are seeing this in the case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). While the poor are generally the hardest hit, this time it is the developed countries which have been most affected. In India, the poorer states have not been affected as much as initially believed. The spread of the virus, while not insignificant, has been relatively less in Bihar. Bihar also faces periodic challenges from other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, kala-azar and encephalitis. Given this, it must deal with the current pandemic at five levels: Historical, financial, infrastructural, issues related to migrant labour, and the revival of the economy. Historically, Bihar was part of the Bengal presidency. The quality of governance in this region was poor because of the inefficient zamindari system. A memorandum submitted by the then state government to the Simon Commission in 1930 rued the fact that per capita expenditure on health was much lower in the Bengal presidency when compared with the Bombay and Madras presidencies. Even within the Bengal presidency, expenditure on health was the lowest in Bihar, compared to other regions. Unfortunately, even after Independence, this trend continued. The total public expenditure on health in Bihar is budgeted at Rs 8,788 crore (2020-21), which is 4.1% of the total budget. In per capita terms, public expenditure on health in Bihar is only Rs 690. In contrast, the corresponding figure in Kerala is three times that, at Rs 2,092. Health care infrastructure in Bihar is only one-fifth of the national average, measured in terms of hospital beds per 1,000 people. Bihar has not had any major infusion of funds to create the necessary health infrastructure for almost two decades. Since the corporate sector is all but absent in Bihar, the responsibility for infrastructure development is mainly with the state government. But the state government can do little if its finances are chronically weak. During the lockdown, there has been virtually no economic activity in Bihar, and the state government has not been able to generate enough revenue from taxes. Also, the state government has limited borrowing space, thanks to the 3% restriction of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), as prescribed under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003. The state’s share in the central pool of taxes has been routinely reduced. This reduction amounted to Rs 14,796 crore in 2019-20. Under such severe financial constraints, the only source of funds is the Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) which was created in 2008. Due to the financial stress caused by the lockdown, the state government has had to withdraw Rs 1,000 crore from the fund. The current financial capacity of the state government is too limited to allocate adequate funds to strengthen infrastructure.Another important aspect of Covid-19 is the problems faced by its migrant workers. It is estimated that around three million workers have gone to other states for work. The pandemic has left them stranded, without jobs or the wherewithal to return home. After considerable delay, the central government has now arranged for special trains, helping them to return to their homes. But once the lockdown is over, employing these migrant workers, either at home or their earlier places of migration, will be a serious challenge for the state government. Finally, to face the challenges thrown up by the virus, the state government has to revive its economy. Although the economy has registered steady growth in the recent past, it is still weak because of the absence of a corporate or industrial sector on the one hand, and the dependence of a large majority of its workers on the low-productivity agricultural sector on the other. The state government has to take the lead role in getting the economy back on track. The first component will be to provide purchasing power to the people, particularly the poor. Employment-oriented welfare programmes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme are an obvious choice here, but there could be other programmes as well. Second, the state government has to provide substantial relief to kick start the micro, small and medium enterprises sector in Bihar, which has been badly affected by the lockdown. Apart from tax concessions, such relief could also include input subsidies. This will put pressure on the finances of the state government. But the state government should not hesitate to borrow, even if it implies crossing the limit of 3% of the GSDP, as prescribed by the FRBM Act. Reaching out to nations such as Japan, South Korea and Thailand, which share a cultural bond with Bihar because of Gaya and the Buddhist legacy, should be encouraged. The economy is facing an unprecedented situation and, as such, demands an unprecedented response. Bihar can meet this challenge but it will need all the support it can get from the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-covid-19-poses-a-sharp-challenge-for-bihar-analysis/story-C7Lr22Ez5skaPtWfEhSIwN.html
12-05-2020||News||A multisector road map for recovery| Analysis||The government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have initiated many activities for economic recovery. What is most needed is a proactive action plan for growth to bounce back to 6-7% in 2021-22. International economists have predicted a major decline in all economies, except India and China, where growth will dip, but may not contract. As Germany and Japan displayed willpower and determination after World War II, we can overcome the impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) if we pull together nationally, as a team. There are 10 major reforms which will pay off for the economy. One, usher in the next green revolution. While the green revolution in the 1960s resulted in massive productivity enhancement, India still ranks 103 of 119 countries on the Global Hunger Index. Hence, we must enhance farm productivity and introduce more automation in agriculture. Boosting the agricultural processing industry with integrated cold chain, streamlining logistics and building mega food parks will lead to the stated goal of doubling farm incomes. Two, we must set up smart villages with essential services. This will involve modernising over 600,000 villages, and it can transform the lives of at least 500 million citizens. It will also decongest cities. Ten essential services are required in villages — pucca housing, all-weather roads, 100% electrification, potable water, affordable gas, broadband infrastructure, medical clinics, primary and secondary schools, kisan shops and cattle farms. Three, we must set up more special economic zones (SEZs). Following the government’s announcement of lower taxes for new units, and an attractive Make in India policy for the electronics sector, all other sectors need aggressive manufacturing policies to build a supply chain base which is not dependent on China. India is a far superior choice over the smaller Asian countries due to its huge domestic market that needs to be served first. This can be achieved by upgrading the present SEZs and establishing new SEZs similar to Shenzhen and Pudong to make them large employment enclaves. Power and logistics will have to be regionally competitive, and backed by a streamlined approval and clearance process.Four, schools and undergraduate education must be upgraded. Many children still do not have access to higher secondary education and universities, especially girls. We need much more investment in middle, higher secondary schools and undergraduate universities, with future-oriented and digital curriculums.Five, we must invest in modern health care infrastructure. India ranks 145th globally as per the health care access and quality index, 2018, with a single State-run hospital for every 55,591 people, a deficit of 500,000 doctors and only 0.55 beds per 1,000 people. After the gaps in India’s health care system have been laid bare by Covid-19, we cannot delay vital infrastructure investment any longer. Also, telemedicine services must be boosted. Six, we must focus on superior technology development. India is lagging and must focus on research and development. The government has allocated Rs 8,000 crore under the National Mission on Quantum Technologies, launched a digital platform to facilitate the application of intellectual property rights, set up knowledge translation clusters for diverse technology sectors, and provided Rs 6,000 crore for BharatNet to link 100,000 gram panchayats. Together, with the private sector, the government must push ahead with the 2030 national technology agenda.Seven, ensure a big thrust in infrastructure development. The next decade will see investments in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, airports and metros. The government has already made a budgetary allocation of Rs 102,000 crores for the next five years. Considering that a similar amount may be allocated in the following five years, the total amount will be a huge stimulus for infrastructure development as well as employment.Eight, more sectors should be open to 51%-100% foreign direct investment (FDI). India has a huge requirement for international capital, and there is considerable liquidity with many global sovereign funds. There are many sectors where foreign investment is allowed only up to 49%. This needs to be enhanced to 74% or even 100%. Also, we have to provide a red carpet for foreign investors by setting up single-window clearance facilities in the states and Centre. The focus should be on renewable energy, storage, biotech, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Nine, we must globalise national champions. We should assist large Indian companies to grow into large global multinational corporations (MNCs). Companies and industrial houses in the private sector (Tatas, Birlas, Reliance, HDFC and Mahindras) and in the public sector (NTPC, ONGC, BHEL, SAIL and SBI) should be supported to upscale globally. Last, we must showcase industry leadership role models. We should nominate top leaders from the government, MNCs, large domestic companies, the public sector and startups, to promote key qualities of entrepreneurship, deep planning, rapid execution, innovation and transparency aimed at international success. This way, young engineers and managers who are the leaders of the future will be inspired. The best is yet to come for the Indian economy. We just need to prioritise new investments in key sectors for the creation of millions of jobs to achieve the target of becoming a $5-trillion economy. Charlie Chaplin once said, “Nothing is permanent in this wicked world — not even our troubles.” Keep this in mind going forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-multisector-road-map-for-recovery-analysis/story-UhMKVUhdC3psz1bCWu1ofP.html

12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab likely to start random sampling from tomorrow||The Punjab government is likely to start random testing of samples for the coronavirus in the all the districts from Thursday following the fresh guidelines of the Union health and family welfare ministry.“We plan to start random sampling within a day or two as per procedure notified by the central ministry. The district authorities have been asked to chalk out a plan in this regard. The aim of the testing is to check the spread of the virus at the community level,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state health department’s spokesperson for Covid-19.As per Union health ministry’s guidelines, the district health authorities will collect 200 random samples daily as they do for RT-PCR tests from each district. These samples will be tested in a pool of 25 each.“If the pool sample is found negative, it would mean all samples are negative for Covid-19. However, if the result is positive, all 25 samples will individually be put for testing to clear the status of every individual,” a civil surgeon said.The guidelines say 200 samples will include 100 samples of healthcare workers, including those from six public and four private facilities, while 50 samples will be taken from outpatient attendants and pregnant women.The state health department is also planning to include in the testing the police personnel on frontline duties after few more days.Though the department was already collecting random samples but they were of symptomatic patients visiting the flu centres or the private healthcare facilities.“We are also using pool testing of five samples per pool to check the community spread and the majority of them have turned out to be negative. But as most of the positive persons don’t show any symptom, the new Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines would give the exact idea of the spread among the frontline warriors and low-risk persons,” a senior health official said.The new random sampling will be conducted in a focused manner and the idea is to contain the spread of the virus by testing high-risk health workers and low-risk pregnant women and their attendants.This sampling will be in addition to the testing being done already by the district authorities. Apart from taking throat and nasal swabs, blood samples will also be collected during the random sampling process.“We have been asked to take blood samples as the Union health ministry subsequently plans to further check these samples in IgG ELISA testing kits recently developed by the National Institute of Virology, Pune,” an official said.The testing kit can check 90 samples together in two-and-a-half hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-likely-to-start-random-sampling-from-tomorrow/story-kZiNhjaC0O8tkAkKD9EkjL.html

12-05-2020||City||District admin orders to rollback of maintenance fee hike in Greater Noida west society||The district administration Monday issued an order to roll back the maintenance fee hike of Eros Sampoornam society in Greater Noida West after a group of residents claimed that the move is irrational during the ongoing lockdown. The residents claimed that there are around 1,500 families in the society and many are facing salary cuts due to the lockdown. A hike in maintenance fee in such a situation was ill-timed and irrational, they argued. The society has 1,768 flats and 1,500 of them are occupied. The developer had started giving possession in 2017.Shyam Thakur, a resident, said residents are already in trouble due to the lockdown. “The developer increased the maintenance fee by up to 28%, depending on the size of the area, this April. A group of residents approached Jewar MLA Thakur Dhirendra Singh for his intervention in the matter on May 5,” he said.Singh said he found that the maintenance fee hike would adversely affect residents who are already troubled by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. “The employees are already facing 30-40% cuts in their salaries. Considering these issues, we realised that the maintenance fee hike is not justified,” he said. The MLA wrote to the district magistrate and Greater Noida authority to address the issue.Diwakar Singh, additional district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, issued an order stating that as per the revised fee, a resident’s monthly maintenance fee has increased from ₹4,000 to ₹5,800 a month, which is not justified. “This, at a time when the country is suffering from a difficult situation. The developer is directed to roll back the hiked fee, failing which actions would be taken under the Disaster Management Act 2005 and also under Section 188 of IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant),” the ADM’s letter said. The developer said the maintenance fee has not been increased since 2017. “In January 2020, the residents had signed an agreement that the maintenance can be revised from April. Some residents have already paid the fee while a group of others has objections. We have asked them to pay the maintenance charge as per the previous rate as of now. We will form a committee comprising representatives from residents and discuss the issue once the lockdown is lifted,” Alakshendra Singh, head corporate communications, Eros Group, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/district-admin-orders-to-rollback-of-maintenance-fee-hike-in-greater-noida-west-society/story-7LYGrnbADGj1HhEzgpaqbP.html
12-05-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka: Yediyurappa govt warned against ordinance to amend labour laws||Congress and Janata Dal(S) have warned the Karnataka government against bringing an ordinance to amend the existing labour laws or the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) act. The warning by the opposition parties comes a day after the government constituted a 15 member special investment task force aimed at attracting companies looking to relocate from China following the pandemic. One of its tasks was to examine existing labour laws with a view to amend and modify it to make Karnataka an attractive destination for investors.Speaking at two separate press conferences, the Congress and the JDS leaders said they would protest any move to dilute or amend the existing laws without a discussion. Former CM and JDS leader H D Kumaraswamy said that CM B S Yediyurappa should act in the interest of the people of the state instead of trying to please the Central government or BJP party bosses.He also accused the state government of succumbing to the pressure from big industries and the capitalists.“Our silence should not be construed as weakness. Any amendment to the APMC act will be detrimental to farmers and help only big business. Amendment to APMC act alone will cause a loss of Rs 600 crore to the exchequer,” Kumaraswamy alleged.Similarly, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President D K Shivakumar and the Leader of Opposition in the assembly, Siddaramiah, also demanded that a special session of assembly be called to discuss all measures including any proposed amendments to the labour laws and said they would take to streets even amidst a lockdown in case an ordinance was promulgated.Since the term of gram panchayats is expiring on May 24, Congress has demanded a six-month extension for existing panchayats as holding elections in the prevailing circumstances is not possible. Pointing out that several elections, including those of assembly and even Rajya Sabha, have been postponed due to current circumstances, it warned the government against dissolving the existing gram panchayats and nominating its party members in their place till elections are held.“There is a provision to extend the term of such bodies in special circumstances like the current one,” Shivakumar added.Siddaramiah said the Central government had failed in containing the spread of Covid-19 and the economic challenges it poses.“Who gave the permission to hold the Tablighi convention? Rs 35,000 crore has been collected into the PM CARES fund including Rs 3000 crore from Karnataka. But why is the government not able to offer free trains to poor migrants who want to go back to their states?” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-yediyurappa-govt-warned-against-ordinance-to-amend-labour-laws/story-aAc3ljJniqvesCZeKHFg1K.html
12-05-2020||Noida||Noida resumes construction of multiple projects amid COVID 19 pandemic||The Noida authority on Tuesday said that it has started construction of multiple projects, including laying of roads to engage daily wage labourers and revive economic activity amid lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic.Since March 25, when the government announced the nationwide lockdown, almost all construction work was halted thereby leading to a crisis of livelihood of daily wage earners, forcing many of them to head to their homes. Their movement led to a crisis as the lockdown had entailed a shutting down of the country’s transport infrastructure too.Ahead of the phase 3 of the lockdown that began on May 4, the central government announced it would allow states to relax restrictions in certain areas provided they follow social distancing and workforce norms.The UP government decided to allow construction projects with some riders and also allowed operations for industries, factories and private offices reducing staff by a third. In line with this, the Noida authority has also resumed work at its administrative building being constructed in sector 96, Chilla elevated road being built from Delhi’s Chilla to Noida’s sector 94, an underpass on Noida Expressway and also roads across the city.“We have resumed work while following social distancing at work place and construction sites. It will help in engaging the daily wage earners and also help in finishing the construction work before the onset of rainy season,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority.The authority has decided to repair drains, culverts, city roads, footpaths and central verge.“We have immediately started the work on these important projects because we want to do these works before rainy season. If these works will not be done now then residents may face issues during rainy season. Also these works are needed to do now because we can engage the daily wage labourers at different sites,” said another Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.The authority has fixed a target to finish small works immediately. And if they need to issue tenders to hire contractors then they can finish the process in May so that the work gets completed in June month before July, when rainy seasons starts. The authority was already doing working on projects such as Chilla elevated road, underpass at sector 71/51 intersection, sector 96 building, underpass at Noida Expressway and drains in sector 43. But the work was disrupted due to lockdown put into effect to contain the spread of covid 19 disease. “As we have restarted construction work at all of these projects we will be able to finish them as per the old deadline without any delay,” said official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-resumes-construction-of-multiple-projects-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-MyIjDLF2PWwNKazT1jT9tN.html
12-05-2020||Noida||Difficult to resume construction work as material is not reaching sites due to border restrictions, developers tell UP minister||Developers from Noida, Greater Noida, and Yamuna Expressway areas on Tuesday apprised the Uttar Pradesh industrial development minister Satish Mahana of the problems they are facing in resuming operations despite the relaxation in lockdown norms over a webinar.The developers said while they had received permission to start construction in their realty projects, work is yet to take off completely as construction material is not reaching the site. “The government has allowed permission to resume operations at the sites, but a lot of us are yet to restart the construction work. Construction material such as steel, cement, sand, among other equipment is not reaching the sites due to the restrictions at state or district borders Also, our staff is facing issues in reaching the sites. We can only resume work, once these things get back to normal,” said Amit Modi, vice-president of the western UP chapter CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Asociation of India), a builders’ group.The key demands that the builders put in front of the minister include waiver of electricity bills, lease rent for their housing land, reduction in rate of interest on financial dues. Asking the government to help the realty sector which has been badly hit by the lockdown, the builders also urged the minister to get the Noida and Greater Noida authorities and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) to delay the collection of financial, and also demanded an additional one year to finish the delayed housing projects apart from financial support. “In January this year, the UP government had decided not to impose interest on projects which were delayed due to court cases over housing land. They, however, only passed on this benefit to those builders who will finish their projects by June 2021. We demanded that this deadline should be extended by a year as the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the speed of all housing projects. Without the support of the state government and the Noida authority among other government agencies builders will not be able to finish the projects as per schedule,” said Prashant Tiwari president, CREDAI (Western UP). The hour-long webinar was attended by at least 400 developers from across Uttar Pradesh who said state government should not delay taking decisions on their demands. “The need of the hour is that the government takes decisions at earliest before their issues get bigger. The government may realise if the real estate sector suffers, then many allied businesses such as those which are into producing steel, cement, apart from professional and many unskilled workers will be adversely affected,” said Abhay Kumar, chief managing director, Grihapravesh Buildteck Private Limited. The industry minister and state government officials who attended the webinar, including industrial and infrastructure development commissioner Alok Tandon, however did not specify when the UP government will take a decision on the developers’ demands. “We are looking into all issues being faced by the real estate sector. The state government wants to address these issues because it is not only builders who are suffering in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, but also homebuyers and other people dependent on the sector,” said Satish Mahana UP industry minister. The webinar was also attended by chief executive officer(CEO) of Noida authority, Ritu Maheshwari, Yeida CEO Arun Vir Singh, and Greater Noida authority CEO Narendra Bhooshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/difficult-to-resume-construction-work-as-material-is-not-reaching-sites-due-to-border-restrictions-developers-tell-up-minister/story-oWlas28yeL69lg3GZdSKcI.html
12-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt scraps deferred allowances, and more||After initially deciding to defer payment of six categories of allowances to its employees and teachers for a year, the Uttar Pradesh government has scrapped them altogether.The government also scrapped some other allowances, including the one paid for promotion of e-governance in all the departments of the secretariat.A decision to scrap these allowances was taken by the state cabinet, by circulation, here on Monday and formal orders, dated May 12, have been sent to all the departments by additional chief secretary, finance, Sanjiv Mittal.“A review of the allowances stopped, or not existing, at the centre and permissible in state was carried out following decline in state government’s revenue in view of the fight against Covid-19,” said Mittal while issuing four separate orders scrapping the allowances, including one paid for maintenance of provident fund accounts.The government hopes to save an additional sum of Rs 1,500 crore per annum by scrapping these allowances. It has already decided to freeze the dearnance allowance and dearness relief paid to its employees, teachers and pensioners from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 to save about Rs 10,500 crore in 2020-2021.Quoting an order of IT and electronics department, Mittal said: “Under prevailing circumstances, there appears no justification for payment of promotional allowance to two officers of joint secretary and special secretary rank for development of e-governance in all departments of the secretariat.”Other allowances scrapped include city compensatory allowance (CCA), secretariat allowance, special allowance given to CB-CID, anti-corruption organisation, economic offences wing, vigilance establishment, security and special investigation wing, special allowance paid to junior engineers in all the departments, research allowance, orderly allowance and design allowance paid in the public works department along with investigation and planning and orderly allowance paid to officers and employees working with the irrigation department.“As the state government is committed for parity with central government in payment of salaries and allowances to its employees and teachers, there is no justification to continue with the allowances when they do not exist at the centre. The state cabinet, therefore, decided to scrap all these allowances instead of deferring them,” said a senior officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-scraps-deferred-allowances-and-more/story-JM148BU6an005gPIisKS7M.html

The wind speed may reach 70 kilometres per hour (kmph), as it had recently on Sunday, May 10.According to the weather analysts, a new western disturbance – a phenomenon that causes rains and thunder activities in the region – will have its effects till Thursday. This is the fourth western disturbance this month, they said. According to the weather scientists, 2020 has experienced more western disturbances (WD) than “usually expected” or “normally prevalent” in other years.A Western disturbance is basically the flow of high moisture air and clouds from Mediterranean sea towards east Himalayan range via Iraq , Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Strong winds and squalls are expected to affect the NCR, especially the region of eastern Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh areas of Noida and Ghaziabad. The wind speed may vary from 60kmph to 70kmph. Although the speed will not be consistent, even a minute or two of such strong wind may cause tress to fall, bring down hoardings and signboards,” Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD, said.“The number of western disturbances had been more this year -- in January, there were nine WDs while generally there are not more than six. In February, there were 7 WDs whereas the month usually sees five WDs, and in March, there were six WDs against the normal trend of four. In April, there were six while we don’t expect more than five. In the month of May, the normal expectation, assessed from the patterns so far, is of four WDs for the entire month, whereas this WD expected on Wednesday is already the fourth,”Srivastava explained.He added that it is difficult to explain the reason for more number of western disturbances this year, and said one most obvious explanation could be ‘climate change’.“It would take more time and occurrences of western disturbances to establish a connection to climate change. It is too early to say that for now,” he clarified.Commenting on the regular occurrence of strong winds this year, experts state that it’s because of the variation in the temperature.“High winds are normal for this time of the year -- it’s a pre-monsoon activity. However, with more WDs, there are more chances of strong winds or dust storm. It also happens due to the formation of cumulative cloud that happens due to temperature differences and instability in the atmospheric layers,” Mahesh Palawat, director private weather forecasting agency, Skymet, said.The IMD said that while Wednesday would see rain and squalls, its effects may continue till Thursday with patchy rain and cloudy sky.“The temperature will remain well under the season’s average till Thursday. From Friday onwards, however, the temperatures will start gradually rising,” Srivastava added.Tuesday’s maximum temperature was recorded at 37.2 degrees Celsius, two notches below the season’s average against 36 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 24.3 degrees Celsius, same as a day earlier.On Wednesday, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 34 and 26 degrees Celsius, respectively.“After rain, the temperature falls gradually. So, for it to rise gradually will take some time, because there are cumulative effects of post WD wind directions and moisture in the air,” Palawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/expect-rain-strong-wind-today-courtesy-the-fourth-western-disturbance-this-may/story-rLUGRV7nQj2DvWe0yBC1yM.html

The siblings decided to sell their most favourite possession --bicycles gifted to them on their birthdays -- to raise some money. Parth posted a video on Twitter to find a suitable buyer. Soon, a Ghaziabad resident spotted the tweet and bought the two bicycles for ₹5,200.Parth is a student of class 5 and Parikshit of class 2 at St Joseph’s School, Greater Noida, and they live with their parents in Sector Alpha 2. “A few days ago, we had met Greater Noida-based golfer Arjun Bhati. He had sold his medals and donated the money to the PM Cares fund. He inspired me and my younger brother to do something good,” Parth said.Pradeep Adhana, their father, said that he had donated money to PM Cares fund in his personal capacity. “But my children also wanted to do their bit. First they planned to sell their toys, but realised that they won’t fetch much money. Then they decided to sell their bicycles,” he said.Parth and Parikshit tweeted the video on May 9. “We want to sell our bicycles and donate the money to PM Care fund. Anyone who needs the bicycles can contact us,” their boys said in the video.Adhana said the next day a Ghaziabad resident contacted him wishing to buy the cycles. “The children fixed the deal at ₹5,200 and sold the bicycles,” he said.“I wanted to do something for the country. I donated the money on Mother’s Day. My mother is also happy with our gesture,” Parth said. Parikshit said he is also happy to have done something good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/siblings-sell-their-bicycles-donate-money-to-pm-cares-fund/story-K54jeai9duUCFe4eyKFXYM.html
12-05-2020||Noida||Corpse found outside private hospital, authorities booked for negligence||A private hospital based in Sector 33 was booked by the Noida police on Tuesday for allegedly mishandling the corpse of a security guard.On Monday afternoon, the body of a man in his late thirties was found right outside the gate of the hospital creating panic among the locals. A police team reached the spot along with personal from the health department. The body was first taken to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida after which it was taken to the mortuary for an autopsy. The reason behind the death is yet to be ascertained, the police said.The deceased was later identified as Devanand Bhagat who worked as a security guard in Noida. The 35-year-old man was from Bihar and lived in Noida by himself in a rented house.According to police officers, the district health department held an inquiry in the matter and then submitted a complaint to the police.“The district magistrate had ordered an inquiry in the matter after which the chief medical officer launched a probe. Based on the findings of the health department and the complaint submitted by them, an FIR has been registered against the hospital,” Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (zone 1), said.Police officers said Bhagat’s samples have been sent to be tested against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), but the tests report is awaited. The autopsy can be only conducted after the test report come. They added that the cause of death will be ascertained following the autopsy, though there were no external injury marks on the body.It appears that either the man had gone to the hospital for treatment and was denied aid after which he died outside the hospital or he died during treatment and his body was kept outside by the hospital staff to avoid any kind of responsibility, they said.“The incident is being probed for now. We have contacted his family members in Bihar who have confirmed that he was not keeping well for a few days. Anything beyond that can only be established after the investigation,” said DCP Sharma.The police also said as the incident was a matter of medical negligence, the CMO will further conduct an investigation to determine what action is to be taken against the hospital, and a committee has been formed for this purpose. They added that if the man is found to be positive for Covid-19, the hospital will be responsible for endangering the lives of others as well.“It seems that the man died outside the hospital in question and according to the initial inquiry, the hospital had mistreated his body after which we filed a complaint with the police,” said Dr Shachindri Mishra, medical officer, community health center (CHC), Bisrakh who is also the complainant in the case.Based on his complaint, a case was registered against the hospital administration at Sector 24 police station under sections 304A (causing death by negligence) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.Neither the administration of the hospital nor the CMO could be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/corpse-found-outside-private-hospital-authorities-booked-for-negligence/story-xuGvzc4y7GNqiLaMw3rPTP.html

The DSO, who was deployed at a shelter home in Greater Noida, is the first senior officer from the district administration to contract the infection.The DSO said she had no symptoms of the infection, and had got herself checked as a precautionary measure. “I was posted at the Malakpur Sports Stadium in Greater Noida, which is running as a shelter home for homeless people, for the last one and a half months. Currently, there are around 47 homeless persons at the shelter. I had requested the health department to get me and a colleague tested for Covid-19,” said the DSO, who is currently admitted to the isolation ward at Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida.“On Monday night, I was informed that I am positive for the infection after which I was admitted at GIMS. I had no symptoms, but I gave my sample as a precautionary measure which turned out to be positive. Doctors had suggested that I don’t need to take the test as I had no symptoms, but I was suspicious as we have been attending many people at the shelter home,” she added. The contact tracing team of the health department is now trying to identify all the people who came in contact with the DSO. All the contacts will be put under quarantine.The other patients who tested positive on Tuesday include a 35-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman from the JJ Colony in Sector 5, Harola. Officials suspect that the two are part of the Ceasefire trail, Four persons from the colony, including a domestic help of a Ceasefire employee, were found Covid-19 positive earlier. A 35-year-old woman from the JJ Colony in Sector 9 was also found positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. Around 53 persons have been found positive for the deadly virus from the JJ Colony of sectors 8, 9, and 10 till now.An 18-year-old man from Sector 31 and a 52-year-old man from Gaur City, Greater Noida were also found positive for the infection.

12-05-2020||City||Cops stuffed us like cattle on trucks, brought us to shelter home, say migrants stopped from journey home||Migrant workers who were walking back to their home towns along Ghaziabad highways and the railway tracks said they were stopped by the police in Morta, Bundled on to trucks like cattle and brought to a shelter home near Raj Nagar Extension.Several of them said they were transported in such an inhumane and congested manner that trucks doors had to be left open for them to even breathe till they reached the shelter home. They also alleged that police did not even have dedicated vehicles to ferry them and simply piled them on to whichever vehicle happened to be passing by, after flagging them to stop.The Ghaziabad police however denied that they were transporting migrants in an inhumane manner and said most migrant workers are shifted to Ghaziabad from nearby areas and then dispatched to their home towns on buses.Eighteen-year-old Munna, who used to work as a daily wager at Tila Morh in Ghaziabad, said he was walking to his home town in Chapra, Bihar, when he was picked by the police. “About 50 to 100 people were picked up by the police and then they were packed into trucks, mini-trucks and even container trucks that were passing by. The drivers were told to take us to the shelter home. I was taken in one such container truck along with dozens of others. One of truck doors was left open so that we could breathe,” he said.Rajesh Kumar, 25, had started his journey by foot from Gandhi Nagar in Delhi where he worked as tailor. “I had reached Morta where people told me that we could get buses to our home towns. But then our group of 50 to 60 people was stopped by the police. They piled us on to a truck like cattle with little concern for social distancing and brought us to this farmhouse which is now a temporary shelter,” Kumar, who hails from Kaushambi district in Uttar Pradesh, said.Most migrant workers found on the road and alongside the railway tracks were transported to shelter homes in a similar manner.“About 100 of us were made to sit on a small pick-up truck. I had come from Loni to Morta in the hopes of catching bus to my home town in Saran, Bihar. They stuffed us like they are transporting cattle. We could barely breathe till we reached the farmhouse,” Rajesh Kumar Yadav, who used to work as a daily wager in Loni, said. He and 25 others with him have been shifted to the shelter home.Jageshwar, who had come from Delhi, said he was one of about 100 people bundled into the truck.“There were three trucks that the police had stopped and then we were shifted to the shelter home. On Monday night, some trucks arrived at the shelter home and workers from Uttar Pradesh were asked to board them. The trucks took them away and we don’t know where they were taken to. I tol them that I, too, belong to UP but the driver said the truck was full and I should wait for another one. But no vehicle came after that,” Jageshwar, who hails from Kaushambi district, said.Denying these allegations, Kalanidhi Nithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad, said, “We have sent about 106 buses two days ago and another 150 more will be despatched soon. When migrant workers hear about the movement of buses, they come to Ghaziabad or are sent here from nearby areas. If our personnel at checkpoints see them coming in vehicles we make them “adjust properly” so that they can easily be taken to shelter homes where they are given food and lodging facilities.” Subdivisional magistrate Prashant Tiwari said that he will look into the issue and also talk to Ghaziabad police. He said migrant workers walking will not be allowed to walk home and that the administration is arranging them buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cops-stuffed-us-like-cattle-on-trucks-brought-us-to-shelter-home-say-migrants-stopped-from-journey-home/story-n5WNcIQyis5LHL6VuDII2H.html
12-05-2020||City||Covid patient dies after being shifted to lower category hospital on health minister’s request||An 85-year-old Covid-19 patient admitted in Sanjay Nagar Hospital, a secondary hospital, in Ghaziabad died soon after he was shifted from a tertiary hospital in Meerut on Tuesday, which, according to Uttar Pradesh health minister, was done on the request of the man’s family.The Ghaziabad health department officials said that the patient, a native of Pilkhuwa, was admitted last week to Meerut Medical College after he tested positive for the disease. He also suffered other health complications like diabetes and high blood pressure.“It came as a surprise to us that a Covid-19 patient was shifted to the lower category L2 hospital in Ghaziabad, which is for patients having moderate complications. The L3 (tertiary) hospital is meant for critical care. After he was admitted here, he succumbed within four hours of his stay. Generally, a patient is shifted to another hospital base on a doctor’s advice,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “It is only when a patient is stable that we recommend shifting him/her to a lower level hospital. After the patient arrived to Ghaziabad we had to admit him otherwise it would have stoked criticism. But he did not survive. His last rites were performed with due precautions in Ghaziabad and the patient will not be added to the Covid-19 count in Ghaziabad.” The officials did not disclose personal details of the patient so his family could not be reached for comments.The family had also approached Uttar Pradesh health minister Atul Garg, also an MLA from Ghaziabad.“His family made repeated request to me to make him shift to Ghaziabad,” said Garg. “They believed he was not getting proper treatment at Meerut. The doctors at Meerut also did not object (to the movement). So, I helped them and it was on my request that he was discharged from Meerut.The family also sent a message of thanks to me. Patient’s condition was not such that he was required to be put on ventilator.”The Meerut hospital said it would not comment on the patient’s health.“The patient had gone to Ghaziabad on insistence of his family. Putting allegations is very easy but I will not comment anything on this. Till the time he was here we tried our best and provided him the best treatment,” said Dr TS Arya, its medical superintendent.Doctors at the Ghaziabad hospital said the patient’s lungs were affected.“He was admitted at around 4.30 pm on Monday and he succumbed around 8.45pm. Besides his health complications, his lungs were also affected. About six of our staff who attended to him will now remain in active quarantine for 15 days,” said Dr Naresh Vij, hospital’s chief medical superintendent.To deal with Covid-19 cases, the UP government has created a three-tier structure of dedicated Covid hospitals.The L1 category hospitals deal with normal Covid-19 positive patients while L2 hospitals are meant for patients having moderate complications. The L3 hospitals are meant for patients requiring critical care.The Uttar Pradesh government had approved an L# hospital in Ghaziabad, but is yet to be operational.Critical Covid patients from Ghaziabad are referred to L3 hospital at Meerut.On Tuesday, two more Covid-19 positive cases were reported from Jhandapur locality in Sahibabad and took the tally to 143 cases.“One of the two is a 20-year-old woman who was under treatment at a hospital in Mohan Nagar. The other is a 42 year old security guard who worked at a factory in Sahibabad. After the factory officials got employees randomly tested, the guard turned positive,” CMO Dr Gupta said.In another direction, the district administration on Tuesday said that required permissions for opening of industrial units, constructions sites, cab/taxi services, etc. will no longer be required.“These activities were earlier permitted and permissions had to be applied for with the respective department or administration. Now, the industrial unit owners, construction sites, standalone shops/commercial establishments and private offices will have to make self declaration on www.ghaziabad.nic.in while the cab/taxi services can operate without any permission or any self declaration. However, the operations are not allowed out of hotspot/containment zones,” said a district administration spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-patient-dies-after-being-shifted-to-lower-category-hospital-on-health-minister-s-request/story-vDPGBHKWsRCsVBsWO4W6LL.html

This forced his wife to ask the authorities to perform the last rites and cremate him in their absence.The 60-year-old man, a resident of Noida’s sector 19, was admitted to Sharda Hospital on May 8, the same day the district suffered its first two deaths due to the virus. At around 9.50pm on Monday he suffered a cardiac arrest brought about by severe respiratory syndrome. Officials are still trying to trace the source of the infection.The man’s 59-year-old wife had also tested positive the same day as him, both having shown symptoms of the viral disease, and was admitted to the same isolation ward. Their daughter was in Gujarat at the time and could not attend to her parents due to the lockdown.While the previous two bodies were accepted by families, the case was different with this one.Officials said they spoke with a few relatives of the man living nearby and offered to give them passes to perform the last rites. Eventually, the wife made her request to the district magistrate: “Please perform last rites of my husband as I am myself admitted for Covid-19”“There was nobody to claim the body after which we along with the health officials performed his last rites. People are scared to come forward to claim body of Covid-19 patient. We showed the whole last rites of the man to his wife and daughter on a video call,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, joint registrar and media spokesperson, Sharda University, Greater Noida. District magistrate Suhas LY, along with authorities of the Sharda Hospital and health officials, performed the last rites of the man at the electronic crematorium in sector 94. Last week, the district had made public the protocols that were to be followed while disposing of bodies of those who tested positive for the coronavirus. This included covering the body with a bag and absolutely no physical contact with relatives. They were, however, allowed to perform the last rites and even glimpse the face, provided all social distancing norms were accepted. These are as per protocols devised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the nodal agency in India for the disease.“It is sad that people aren’t coming forward to claim the bodies of Covid-19 patients in many parts of the country. There shouldn’t be any stigma as proper protocol of sanitising the body and body bag is done before handing over the body to the relatives. Important family members should come forward to claim bodies. It is ensured that there is no chance of others getting the infection while claiming the body and performing the last rites,” said Dr Sunil Dohre, additional chief medical officer, GB Nagar. The 59-year-old woman, meanwhile, was shifted to another isolation ward as she had suffered a loss that would need special care. Her vitals were normal, doctors said.A 62-year-old man from sector 66 died on May 8 in Gautam Budh Nagar. He was under institutional quarantine at the Galgotias hostel which has been running as a government quarantine centre. The person was declared brought dead at the GIMS. A 60-year-old man from Sector 22 in Noida had also died after he developed pneumonia at GIMS during the early hours of the same day.The district suffered three deaths in total, while the cases rose to 230 with six fresh cases on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/third-covid-19-death-in-gb-nagar-wife-asks-officials-to-perform-the-last-rites/story-GLyn23sL35YRNZuoOtnqiI.html
12-05-2020||City||2 months on, GB Nagar admin yet to locate 18,000 registered labourers||NOIDA: Nearly two months have passed since the Uttar Pradesh government announced that construction workers in the state will get ₹1,000 each as financial aid amid the coronavirus pandemic, but the Gautam Budh Nagar administration has failed to locate almost half of such labourers registered with the labour department in the district.Out of 38,409 registered daily wage earners, the district administration has no clue about 18,000 of them. The monthly financial assistance of ₹1,000 is being paid to workers as a direct benefit transfer (DBT) in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. On March 21, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had ordered that ₹1,000 be provided to each of the 20.37 lakh construction workers registered with the labour department and to each of the 15 lakh self-employed cart owners, small shop owners and rickshaw pullers on an immediate basis.According to GB Nagar deputy commissioner (labour) Pradeep Kumar Singh, of 38,409 bona fide workers registered with the district labour department, the bank account numbers of only 20,643 are available. “The amount of ₹1,000 has already been transferred to each of these accounts,” he said.Singh further said that locating the remaining workers has become a tough task as such workers, mostly associated with construction companies, come once or twice in a year and return to their native places after two-three months. “We are also contacting their employers. But most of the employers said they (labourers) didn’t return to their companies after a year or two. During this lockdown, our officials who are trying to locate such labourers’ details say that less than 10% of them available on the mobile phone numbers given at the time of their registration,” he said.To locate the remaining workers, the labour department last month launched a mobile application ‘UPBOCW’ (Uttar Pradesh Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board). After downloading this application, the remaining workers will have to be registered on this portal by providing their Aadhaar numbers. Once being registered, they will get a one-time password (OTP) and after entering the OTP, they will be eligible for the DBT, Singh said.Meanwhile, the district administration has also initiated the DBT of same amount for the labourers from unorganized sectors, who are not registered with the district labour department.According to a press statement issued by the district magistrate Suhas LY, a total of 8,737 labourers from unorganized sectors have been identified. “While 3,452 of them have received the DBT of ₹1,000 in their accounts on Saturday, the amount of ₹52,85,000 was disbursed in the bank accounts of remaining 5,285 on Monday,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-months-on-gb-nagar-admin-yet-to-locate-18-000-registered-labourers/story-4IMToM4HYJYWH4CKmks2mM.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||9K med students, resident docs have not got stipend||Despite being Mumbai’s frontliners in the war against the Covid-19 pandemic, at least 9,000 medical students and post-graduate resident doctors across the city haven’t received their stipend for the past three months. The Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said the issue will be resolved in two-three days.Resident medical officers (RMO) account for almost 80% of the staff strength in Covid treatment facilities. Around 5,500 postgraduate resident doctors, along with senior medical officers, haven’t received their stipend in the past one-and-a-half months. On an average, they get around ₹54,000 for their service, but the amount differs between BMC and government medical colleges. They received their last stipend on March 15. So far 25 RMOs have contracted the infection on duty at different civic-run hospitals, while hundreds have been quarantined. After getting their MBBS degree, medical students are given internships in different hospitals. Currently, there are 3,300 such MBBS graduates in Mumbai. These doctors at government medical colleges get ₹11,000, while students studying in medical institutes under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) get ₹6,000 for their service. “We are directly involved in the treatment of Covid patients. Senior doctors hardly stay in isolation rooms. They just come and check the reports. We work around-the-clock for the patients,” said a doctor from King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital. The students are now demanding ₹30,000 as monthly stipend. “We have been working for eight -12 hours a day. Earlier, we were responsible for screening passengers at the airport. Now, we are assigned duties in Covid care centres under category 1 and 2. We also conduct contact tracing of patients’ kin and identify symptomatic patients,” said a student intern posted in SevenHills Hospital. “We have spoken to the students. We are working on it and the issue will be resolved within 2-3 days,” said Dr TP Lahane, director of DMER.Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor, Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, said, “At a time of pandemic, these students should be the first priority of the government. All other politicians are getting their salaries in time then why should these doctors, who are at the greatest risk of getting exposed to the virus, suffer?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/9k-med-students-resident-docs-have-not-got-stipend/story-GN92toY43RJOqMrmF3NmhL.html
12-05-2020||City||SIT formed to probe abduction case against ex-DGP Saini||The Punjab Police on Tuesday constituted a three-member special investigation team (SIT) to inquire into the case registered against former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in connection with disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) employee, in 1991.The SIT includes Mohali superintendent of police (SP-investigation) Harmandeep Singh Hans, deputy superintendent of police (DSP-investigation) Bikramjit Singh Brar and Rajiv Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Mataur, where the case was registered.“The SIT will be issuing notice to the ex-DGP to join investigations so that he can be questioned in connection with the case. As per the court orders, he should join investigations within seven days,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali.The constitution of SIT comes a day after additional district and sessions judge Monika Goyal on Monday granted anticipatory bail to Saini and directed him to join investigations within seven days.The police was also directed by the court to ensure social distancing norms and other precautions during his questioning.Multani was allegedly picked up by two officers after a terrorist attack on Saini, then SSP, Chandigarh, in which four policemen in his security posse were killed. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from the custody of Qadian police.A case was registered under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) in Mohali on May 6 on the basis of a complaint filed by Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani.Former DSP Baldev Singh Saini, inspector Satvir Singh, sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anoop Singh and ASI Kuldip Singh were also named in the case.The cops are also preparing to record the statements of others named in the FIR. Already, an eyewitness whose husband was Multani’s class mate had recorded her statement before the magistrate saying Multani was tortured in Saini’s presence. Based on the eyewitness account that Multani had succumbed to torture meted out to him in Saini’s presence, the cops are preparing to question the ex-DGP as to how Multani’s body was disposed of. Meanwhile, police officials said the prosecution is examining the court ruling to decide whether the state should challenge the granting of anticipatory bail to Saini or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sit-formed-to-probe-abduction-case-against-ex-dgp-saini/story-mncBA09HuKcWMFcvRKCeJM.html

12-05-2020||Lucknow||Yogi govt pays rozgar sevaks’ dues, bares focus on MNREGS||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday transferred Rs 225.39 crore dues to 35,818 Gram Rozgar Sevaks (GRS), reflecting its renewed focus on Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MNREGS) in its fight against Covid-19.A GRS plays an important role in allocation of work, distribution of job cards, marking attendance and helping social audit of the work carried out under the rural job scheme. On March 30, Rs 611 crore was transferred to 2.57 lakh MNREGS workers by state government to clear pending wages of the workers of the rural job scheme that guarantees 100 days work to every job card holder.As providing jobs to a large number of migrant labourers reaching the state poses a great challenge, the MNREGS is proving to be a useful instrument for the state government in its fight against Covid-19.“Yes, MNREGS is the most effective instrument to provide jobs to people in rural areas. The state government has set a target to provide 100-day employment to every willing job card holder. If the government is able to do so, this will be much higher against UP’s average of providing 35-day work and national average of 52-day work under MNREGS in the past few years,” said Sanjay Dixit, former member, Central Employment Guarantee Council of the union rural development ministry.The state government claims to be providing work to 20 to 22 lakh MNREGS workers every day. It has set up control rooms in every district to connect with workers willing to work and proposes to provide work to 50 lakh workers under the scheme by the end of May.“Uttar Pradesh has 1.9 crore job card holders and about 60 per cent of them have remained inactive over the years. As people are in need to get work following lockdown enforced to fight coronavirus, the number of workers being provided job has gone up three to four times,” said Dixit, who also has been pushing the cause of Gram Rozgar Sevaks (GRS), who belong to the same village panchayat where MNREGS work is carried out.A total of 35,818 ‘Gram Rojgar Sevaks’ are working in the state and honorarium was not paid to 26,012 sevaks for 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. An honorarium of Rs 3,630 per month was being paid to the sevaks earlier. This amount was revised to Rs 6,000 per month on November 1, 2016. The state government has now decided to reserve administrative charge funds for payment of honorarium to ‘Gram Rozgar Sevaks’ at the state level in an obvious bid to avoid delays.Dixit said the state government should also take care of giving the GRS social security benefits by covering them under provident fund scheme.YOGI MAKES TOKEN TRANSFER OF DUESChief minister Yogi Adityanath made the token transfer of Rs 225.39 crore dues to 35,818 ‘Gram Rozgar Sevaks’ (GRS) online at a programme at his residence.Speaking on the occasion, Yogi said the sevaks should work under guidance of senior officers to create more jobs, as a large number of migrants are coming back to the state. He said attendance of workers should be marked by using the mobile monitoring system (MMS). He also spoke to some sevaks at a video conferencing with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-govt-pays-rozgar-sevaks-dues-bares-focus-on-mnregs/story-eiacSgcLgL2saDwjbjt7LN.html
12-05-2020||City||Punjab registers record cotton production at 43 lakh quintals||Punjab has registered a record production of cotton at 43.25 lakh quintals in 2019-20 season even as the procurement of the crop is still in its last stage.According to the data procured from the Punjab State Agricultural Marketing Board, the state has witnessed a jump of over 26% over the production of 34.68 lakh quintals recorded during the 2018-19 season.Officials said cotton is generally purchased till the end of June but due to lockdown, the arrival of the cash crop is expected to culminate by May 15.“While the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) continues purchase in the cotton-growing districts at the MSP (minimum support price), lockdown restrictions have kept the private players at bay from the market. But before the lockdown, private buyers were paying farmers less than the MSP,” said state cotton coordinator Rajnish Goel.He said of the total produce, the CCI purchased 16.74 lakh quintals at MSP of Rs 5,450 per quintal whereas the private buyers had bought 26.50 lakh quintals from farmers in the cotton-growing south Malwa belt.State agriculture secretary KS Pannu credits farmers for the record production, saying they followed the advisories issued by the Punjab Agricultural University and state authorities.He said 2019-20 was the best year for the traditional crop of cotton as there was no pest attack. He said the integrated pest management plan significantly reduced cost of production by replacing chemical sprays with neem-based bio-pesticides to handle whitefly pest.The average per acre yield reached close to 800 kg lint per hectare this time, said Pannu.As per the official data, the cotton yield in 2015 had dropped to a low of 197 kg lint per hectare due to the whitefly attack. The crop yield was 756 kg in 2016, 750 kg in 2017 and 778kg in 2018.“The overall production of cotton is on the expected lines and we hope that it would touch 44 lakh quintals in the next few days. The record production and organised crop management will encourage farmers to switch over to the traditional crop in the semi-arid southern part of Punjab,” he added.State agriculture director Sutantar Kumar Airi said that after a delay of about a week due to the Covid-19 outbreak, cotton sowing has gained pace and it will be completed by the end of May.“We will chalk out a cotton purchase plan for the next season with the CCI on the basis of the total area finally covered under cotton. Besides the availability of seeds and fertilisers to farmers, the agriculture department has planned to ensure required canal water amid Covid-19 crisis,” said Airi.The department is planning to bring 5.5 lakh hectares under cotton cultivation this year, an increase of 1.5 lakh hectares over the last year, said Airi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-registers-record-cotton-production-at-43-lakh-quintals/story-cu8OkS0R0vtUq8rmrECAyN.html

12-05-2020||Mumbai||50% of inmates lodged in jails in Maharashtra to be released||In a significant move by the state, a high-powered committee headed by justice AA Sayed, along with additional chief secretary (home) Sanjay Chahande and director general of prisons SN Pandey, on Monday decided to release 50% of the total 35,239 inmates lodged in various prisons across the state.A senior IPS (Indian Police Service) officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “Of the 50% of prisoners, 9,000 are convicts who will be granted parole. The remaining are undertrials. We plan to decongest the jails within eight to 10 days.” But inmates who are facing trial will have to follow the due process of law. “The prisoners will have to get bail. This means that the due process of law will have to be followed,” said Sanjay Chahande, additional chief secretary (home). Prisoners who are eligible for a temporary bail will have to move the courts concerned and obtain an order. A parole leave, however, can be secured at prison level, Chahande added. The order, which comes a week after at least 184 positive cases were reported at the Arthur Road prison, does not give a time frame on when the prisoners will be released, nor does it state the category of prisoners who would be released. However, none of the prisoners who are charged or convicted under the provisions of special statutes, such as the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act (MCOCA), 1999; the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act; the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) or the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) will be released on temporary bail in view of the outbreak.The committee on Monday also rejected a representation by advocate SB Talekar, contending that the decision to not release prisoners who are charged or convicted under special statutes was discriminatory. Talekar argued that the blanket exclusion of prisoners charged for offences under the special Acts was arbitrary and defeated the thrust of the Supreme Court (SC) order, dated March 23, to decongest prisons in the wake of the outbreak.“In any event, the prisoners charged under the special Acts cannot claim to be released from prison as of right.The offences under MPID Act are against victims who are mostly poor depositors, and whose interests are required to be safeguarded and recoveries made from properties. The MPID Act is enacted to protect the interest of the depositors and the prisoners charged for offences under the MPID Act cannot be treated as belonging to the same class of prisoners who are to be released on interim bail or parole,” it said.However, Talekar’s representation was rejected on the grounds that the SC in a subsequent order on April 13 left it to the discretion of the high-powered panel to determine which category of prisoners can be released, depending upon the severity and nature of offence. Justice BN Srikrishna, former SC judge, said, “If this is what the high-powered committee has stated then it’s absurd. If prisoners have to follow the due process of law, then why was the high-powered committee made? How can the committee distinguish between prisoners booked for special Acts and others. It is like distinguishing between the rich and the poor prisoners. If this is how it is, the Supreme Court has done nothing to fight the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/50-of-inmates-lodged-in-jails-in-maharashtra-to-be-released/story-cqQPzcInpB7iyAQnVdIy4I.html

12-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC offers Worli fishermen soft start to fishing activities||With the onset of monsoon just a month away from leaving a small window for fishing activities, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may allow fishermen from Worli Koliwada to venture out to sea for fishing. According to preliminary discussions between BMC, Mumbai Police and a fishermen association’s in Worli Koliwada, a maximum of five boats from each of the three jetties will be allowed to venture out to sea one at a time. However, fishermen will not be allowed to sell their catch in the market. They will only be allowed to dry and stock the fish to be sold later. Alongside the five-boat daily limit, the BMC has put several conditions on the fishermen to maintain social distancing. The Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsya Vyavasay Sahkari Society confirmed that fishing is being allowed but the stock can only be sold during monsoon, but not before July. The Worli fishing community is yet to respond to the offer by BMC to allow five boats to conduct fishing activities daily.An officer from Dadar police station, under which Worli Koliwada falls, said, “Under no scenario, permission for selling of fish will be allowed, for now, considering there are containment zones in Worli Koliwada. BMC has agreed to allow fishing with several conditions, but the fishermen have not responded yet. Currently, no fishing activity is permitted.”However, Nitesh Patil of the fishermen’s association, said, “We have two associations in this area and there are around 200 fishermen owning boats. If BMC limits the number of boats that can ply daily, everyone will not get a chance to fish. Starting June 1, there will be restrictions on venturing into the sea due to the onset of monsoon.”Patil said that allowing only five boats per day from each jetty would cause internal fights among fishermen. “Several other conditions put by BMC, like only having two persons on fishing boats, are all impractical. One person is required to handle the engine; two are required to handle the fishing net.”Fishermen from Worli Koliwada said that in 2019, on two occasions they were restricted from venturing into the sea due to cyclone alerts. It was only in January 2020 when they started full-time fishing. However, starting March 24, all fishing activities were restricted, causing financial distress for a majority of the fishing families.“We could not do any business last year, this year, and even for the period during monsoon, we are not being allowed to venture into the sea. This will ruin out finances considering even small boat owners will require at least ₹50,000 in hand for dry docking and maintenance of the boats for when we start fishing post-monsoon. For this, we need money and BMC has to allow everyone to venture into the sea for fishing. We are ready to take all precautions of social distancing. If not fishing, the government should give us monetary compensation,” said Patil.Worli Koliwada and its surrounding areas like Janata Nagar, Worli Sea Face, and Prabhadevi fall under BMC’s G South ward – one of the areas most affected by Covid-19. Worli Koliwada alone has reported close to 95 coronavirus cases.When contacted, Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G South ward, was not available for comment. However, local Shiv Sena leader Sachin Ahir from Worli, said, “We have given them the option that on a rotational basis they should venture out to sea and do fishing, but it seems they have not agreed to it. It is always better to start with something rather than starting everything at one go and risking lives. If we allow movement as we did earlier, there are chances of fresh cases. Health safety is of top priority in the phase we are going through.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-offers-worli-fishermen-soft-start-to-fishing-activities/story-kYxbYdOSovhEMm9IgWonEJ.html
12-05-2020||Chandigarh||17 infected among every 1 lakh people in Chandigarh; third highest among states, UTs||Chandigarh, a state/ union territory with second highest population density in India, also ranks third — only after the national capital Delhi and worst-affected state of Maharashtra — when it comes to the number of Covid-19 confirmed cases per one lakh population.As on May 12, for every one lakh people in Chandigarh, 17 are infected, which is close to Maharashtra’s 20, while the count of Delhi is the highest at 43. These figures are based on the 2011 population statistics and data of confirmed cases released by the ministry of health and family welfare. Among the neighbouring states, Punjab has the highest six cases per lakh population, followed by Haryana and Himachal Pradesh at 2.8 and 0.8 cases respectively. “This suggests the situation in Chandigarh is grave and requires much greater attention as well as testing. The increasing number of cases also trigger the trend of increasing mortalities, which is the actual cause of concern,” a senior epidemiologist at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research said, wishing not to be named. With three deaths due to Covid-19 so far, case fatality rate in Chandigarh stands at 1.6%, more than that of Delhi (1) and almost equal to that of Punjab (1.65) and Haryana (1.5). Maharashtra has the highest, at 3.7%. According to Dr Tarundeep Singh, a community health expert at the PGIMER, denser the population, higher the chances of infection spread.“Mumbai has the highest number of cases, and the possible reason could be its high population density (20,634). Similar is the case with Chandigarh and Delhi,” said Dr Singh. According to the 2011 census, Chandigarh is the most densely populated entity (9,252 people per square kilometre) among states and union territories, only next to Delhi (11,297).UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said dense localities in the city are already under the health department’s watch, but unnecessary restrictions cannot be put in place without any evidence of spread of infection. “In Bapu Dham Colony, which is a congested locality, the infection has spread at a fast pace and around 35% samples have tested positive. In other dense localities, such as Maloya and Dhanas, we have tested the contacts and saw that the infection has not spread,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/17-infected-among-every-1-lakh-people-in-chandigarh-third-highest-among-states-uts/story-wFVF5hCg3iQRLiwkg1jXeL.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||At 426, city records May’s lowest case count on Tuesday||After a consistent spike in Covid-19 cases in the last 10 days, on Tuesday Mumbai recorded only 426 cases – the lowest daily count in May. However, on the same day, the city recorded 28 deaths – the highest number related to the coronavirus in a single day.Earlier, the lowest daily count this month was recorded on May 3, when 441 cases reported. Of the 28 deaths reported on Tuesday, 17 patients had co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Among those who died, 10 were above 60 years. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also discharged 203 patients across various hospitals in the city on Tuesday. To date, 3,313 patients have recovered and been discharged, according to data released by the BMC.Dharavi reported 46 new cases, with one death, on Tuesday, taking the tally in this slum cluster to 962 positive cases and 31 deaths. Of the 46, eight cases were detected from Matunga labor camp, seven cases from Dharavi crossroad, and three each from Dharavi main road, Rajiv Gandhi Road, and Kureshi Nagar. Dharavi currently has 213 containment zones. Assistant commissioner Kiran Dighavkar, G North ward, said, “BMC has decided to sealed boundaries of 13 high-risk zones in Dharavi to avoid further spread of the disease.”Along with Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim in G-North ward recorded 11 and six new Covid -19 cases respectively.The percentage of novel coronavirus cases compared to samples tested in Mumbai has increased to 33% on May 11, from 20% on April 30. The current Covid detection rate of the city is speeding ahead of the national average of 4.3% and the state average of 7%. This has raised questions about the way the Mumbai civic body is tackling the outbreak.The BMC tested 3,460 samples on April 30; 3,595 samples on May 1, and 3,107 samples on May 2, against which, Mumbai recorded 695, 797, and 592 Covid -19 positive cases the same day, with a detection rate of 20%, 22%, and 19%.However, the detection rate increased further by May 11. BMC tested 2,939 samples on May 10 and 2,359 samples on May 11, against which the city recorded 875 and 782 Covid-19 cases, with a detection rate of 29% and 33%.Civic officials said that this was due to the change in testing protocol targeted at containment zones. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “Detection rate is increasing because of the increased number of testing samples per day. Often, pending test results were added to a particular day’s count. Hence it did not give us proper clarity.”“If we calculated the detection rate against 124,000 samples tested with 14,521 positive cases, then the detection rate remains 11.71%. This figure is higher than the state and national average because of targeted testing conducted by BMC in contaminated zones,” added Kakani.However, civic health activists have alleged that the civic body is toying with the coronavirus figures.City-based health activist Rajan Dhage said, “Instead of dealing with the situation, civic officials were busy playing with Covid-19 figures. Hence, they are not releasing Covid testing data daily.”Meanwhile, BMC has started using a new drug ‘Injection Tociluzumab’ in Sion, Nair, KEM, and Seven Hills hospitals to treat Covid positive patients. It has been used in approximately 40 severe cases so far and encouraging results have been seen in more than 30 patients, 14 of whom have recovered and been discharged. According to civic officials, the drug has improved the condition of the patients and prevented the need for assisted breathing via a ventilator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-426-city-records-may-s-lowest-case-count-on-tuesday/story-inh76ZG4kLYqFjPZijGPlN.html

12-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra on the verge of 25000 case mark; death toll reached 921||While chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the district officials to prepare an exit plan from the lockdown in the next three days Maharashtra reached close to 25000 Covid-19 cases mark which is expected to be breached on Wednesday. The state reported 1016 new cases in the last 24 hours taking the total to 24,427. Mumbai is nearing the 15000 case mark after its total reached 14947 on Tuesday. The state government is in favour of easing the restrictions further in lesss affected or unaffected areas while continuing the lockdown in red zones such as Mumbai, Pune and Nashik areas which have been reporting maximum cases.The state has reported 5364 cases in the last four days and saw 190 deaths during this period. 53 new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours taking the death toll to 921. Of the total deaths, 28 were in Mumbai, six each in Pune and Panvel, 5 in Jalgaon, Solapur 3, Thane 2, one each in Raigad, Aurangabad city and Jalgaon city. 21 of the patients whodied on Tuesday were above 60 years of age, while 27 were in the age group of 40-59years and remaining below the age of 40 years. 35 of them had high-risk comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, heart ailments.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday directed the district officials to prepared an exit plan from the lockdown by May 15. At the same time, Thackeray emphasised strict lockdown implementation in containment zone (where cases are found in large numbers) and said that it should not spread out of these areas. The chief minister also said that those districts that have adequate health machinery should start door-to-door screening of people, which was followed in Goa, to ascertain symptoms and comorbidities.Thackeray held a video-conference with Divisional Commissioner and DistrictCollectors and asked all district authorities should submit an exit plan with their suggestions and expectations. “The plan has to come in from all the districts by May 15 based on which the state would prepare its plan and submit it to the Centre. The CMstressed that now the chain should be broken and that there should not be any transmission outside of the containment zones in the state,” a senior bureaucrat said.State saw the rise of 10514 cases in the just nine days, while the deaths reported in this period were 373. State breached its 10,000-case mark on April 30 with total of 10498 cases after having reported its first Covid-19 case on March 9. It took nearly 53 days to reach its 10,000 cases mark. It crossed 15000 cases on May 5 when the total of the cases was 15525. The state health department has added a disclaimer to the data it released stating that even Mumbai corporation has started referring to the ICMR data for the positive cases and reconciliation may lead to difference in the figures. According to the state health department, the mortality rate in the state stood at 3.71%, down from 7.21% on April 12. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 3.24%.Maharashtra has sent back over 65000 migrants in more than 50 trains departed to various states so far. “We have been feeding more than 16 lakh people including homeless, migrants, beggars for the last 50 days. It included 5.70 lakh migrants who were at the shelters in various districts. Besides those who have been sent back in trains, the same amount of the migrants have been sent back in buses or they have arranged to go back on their own. There are a whole lot of a few lakh migrant workers who have been living in their owned or rented homes in cities and go back whenever the trains start. Though we do not have the data compiled, there could be mass exodus from cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Nashik once the trains start,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.With the constant rise in the Covid-19 cases, the state government is not in the favour of the relaxation of the lockdown restrictions at least in the Red zones such as Mumbai and Pune where new cases are being reported in significant numbers. While taking review of the situation about the Covid-19 spread and the challenges that are being faced by the district administration, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also gauged the mood at the district level over the lockdown. The district authorities of the orange and green zones have been directed to push for the industrial and commercial operations in their areas. The government is expecting maximum industrial units to go operational in these areas as it would help it in revival of the economy. A statement from the CMO stated the chief minister cited the example of Goa which carried out a door-to-door survey for Covid-19. “The size of Goa is like one of our districts. They went door-to-door and screened people for symptoms. If district authorities carry out a primary check-up, not just for coronavirus, but for otherdiseases as well, people would not only get timely treatment but also get cured,” the statement said.A divisional commissioner, who was a part of the meeting said, “He (TheCM) said that some districts that have a sizeable population proportionate to health machinery should engage in door-to-door screening. It is will not only help in symptoms for Covid-19 but also help build data for other diseases such as diabetes, heart ailments, etc. Not all districts would engage in it for want of healthcare staff, a couple of districts could start.” He added that door to door screening is done in containment zones.Thackeray also discussed measures to revive the state economy. He said that though economic activities have resumed in the green zone of Maharashtra, authorities should ensure that there are no new cases. A senior bureaucrat added, “The chief minister has also asked the department concerned to prepare a plan if migrants do not come back in time. Maharashtra will also have to look at creating its new workforce.”“The authorities in the Red zones have however been asked to strictly implement the lockdown orders. State government wants the suburban railway services to be operanal in Mumbai for the essential services so that the stress on the employees in these services is relieved and a positive message is sent out. But while doing so, the stricter implementation of the restrictions in the containment zones is necessary. The district collectors and municipal commissioners have been asked to go far aggressive contact tracing and institutional quarantine of the people in containment zones,” an official from the home department said. The number of recovery of patients from the Covid-19 infections has however significantly gone up, owing to the change in the policy of discharging the patients. The number of the recovery in the state has increased significantly over the last few days taking the number to over 5000. “587 patients recovered on Monday and its a record number of recovery so far. 339 patients were discharged on Tuesday. The improvement in the recovery rate will help us in minimising the fear about the virus in the minds of the common people,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.After Gondia, Parbhani district has successfully elevated itself to Green zone from Orange zone as the district has not found any new patient in the last 14 days. Gondiya was another district to become a Green zone last week by retaining its number of cases at 1.

The move came following the state government’s decision to provide four masks and one soap bar to each family in all 8,386 gram panchayats.Principal secretary at panchayati raj department Amrit Lal Meena said the distribution of masks and soaps to families under gram panchayats would be rolled out in next 15 days. On Monday, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had directed to provide masks and soaps to rural families as a part of the government’s new focus on containing the spread of the virus in rural parts of Bihar amid the inflow of migrants from other states.The panchayati raj department has issued a detailed order which says that an amount of Rs 100 -- Rs 20 for a soap bar, Rs 80 for four masks -- would be spent on each family’s hygiene. “ We will spend nearly Rs 136 crore in purchasing masks for 1.70 crore families in rural Bihar and another Rs 34 crore on soaps. Each panchayat will spend Rs 3 lakh for the purchases. One family will get one big soap bar or small bars in multiple pieces costing not more Rs 20,” said Meena.He said there would be no purchases of mask from the open market as all items would be requisitioned from self help groups(SHGs) under Jeevika programme, state Khadi board or locally stitched in a bid to generate employment and also pump up rural economy. “ Our objective is pump up the rural economy by generating more employment and also bringing in a behavioural change among rural populace so that they start wearing masks as a precaution for containing the spread of the virus,” said the principal secretary, panchayati raj.Meena added that the SHGs and state Khadi board have already been making masks in bulk and the orders would increase for higher supply to the villages.Earlier, the state government had given permission to panchayat representatives to buy soaps and other hygiene items, including sanitisers.Sources said the state panchayat raj institutions have having adequate funds against the grants approved as per recommendation of the fifth finance commission. Each gram panchayat has Rs 6 to Rs 7 lakh at their disposal, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchayats-across-bihar-to-buy-hygiene-items-in-bulk/story-YUOVUsirav0k3iBuj6L11J.html

On the first day of production, 2,500 workers at the Manesar plant returned to work; their number is likely to increase in the next few days, the management said.The total number of employees allowed to work at this plant is 4,696. The company can produce 15.5 lakh cars per annum.A statement released by the district administration said that the company has also started preparations to start production at its Gurugram plant while taking all measures to ensure social distancing among employees.

12-05-2020||City||Manipur woman assaulted by three who accuse her of spreading coronavirus||A 19-year-old woman from Manipur has alleged that she was assaulted after being accused of spreading coronavirus by at least three people in Fazilpur Jharsa on Sunday. The police, however, said that there was no mention of any racial slur by the woman in the complaint registered by her and she was also booked for allegedly violating lockdown orders as the area is a containment zone.According to the police, the incident took place around 6.30pm on Sunday when the woman, who hails from Imphal, and has been staying in Gurugram for over three years, was walking to her rented house in Fazilpur Jharsa after visiting her former roommate who stays in the same area.“I had visited my friend’s house to pick up some luggage. At 6.30pm, as I entered a lane while walking to my house, a woman holding a wooden stick in her hand blocked my path. She hurled abuses and said racist things. She said, ‘Why do you people come here and spread corona?’ I showed her my mask and sanitiser and told her that even I am scared of being infected. I told her to not abuse me, but she started hitting me with the stick,” the woman from Manipur said. She alleged that as she tried to defend herself, the woman’s two relatives also started hitting her. “I sustained injuries on my head, neck and left arm. One of the suspects asked me to apologise. After a few minutes, I somehow went back to my friend’s house and she reported the incident to the police,” she said, adding that she was administered first aid at a private hospital in Badshahpur.The police said that acting on her complaint, an FIR was registered on Sunday against three persons under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Badshahpur police station.The FIR states that the main woman suspect told the Manipur woman, “You people do not understand. Why do you people come here?”The woman said that she had on Monday written to the station house officer (SHO) of Badshahpur police station, requesting the police to add sections under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Act to the FIR.Mukesh Kumar, SHO, Badshahpur police station, said, “The woman from Manipur had an argument with a family after the latter asked her not to enter a barricaded lane as the area is a containment zone. The lane had been closed off with bamboos on two sides. During the argument, she was allegedly assaulted. However, in her statement and FIR, there was no mention of any racial slur or accusation of spreading coronavirus.”The SHO said that on the complaint of the opposing party, the woman from Manipur was booked under Section 188 of IPC and relevant sections of Disaster Management Act as she had violated lockdown orders.“No arrests have been made in the two cases and we are verifying the allegations,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/manipur-woman-assaulted-by-three-who-accuse-her-of-spreading-coronavirus/story-nbts6qlyVyN7ci0bqHBliI.html
12-05-2020||Gurugram||Employees sweat it out in absence of central air-conditioning in offices||Private firms that are inching towards resuming operations after almost a 40-day hiatus are not only finding it difficult to contend with the new social distancing norms but also face the spectre of having to sit in swanky offices without central air-conditioning (AC). Building managers are apprehensive that the use of central AC systems could lead to the spread of Covid-19 infection among the workers.The same was stated in the standard operating procedure (SOP) released last week, with companies and industrial units told to use window/split AC units, which has compounded the matter. The result is that many office-goers in the city are confronted with the option of either returning home or sweating it out in the closed confines of their offices.In one such commercial building on Sohna Road, which has close to 2,000 small offices, the corporate executives are facing problems as the building manager has decided not to run the AC. “I don’t know what are the norms but these buildings have no ventilation and without central AC, are impossible to work in. We have been sweating continuously over the last two days,” said a corporate executive, requesting anonymity.The executive said that although the limited staff strength in around 60 offices in the building have resumed work, stale air is a major concern.Saurabh Kumar, a branch manager of GIC housing finance, whose office is located in a commercial building on MG Road that also has retail shops, said that the mall management had declined to switch on the central AC last week. However, after much deliberation, they decided to start it on Monday. “Until last week, the mall management had declined to start the central AC system. If the situation had not changed we were planning on alternative measures, such as purchasing portable coolers and table fans,” said Kumar.Some private firms said that they are working in tandem with building managers and ensuring that indoor spaces are disinfected and cleaned, and social distancing is maintained. “The AC is a cause of concern as there is a notion that it might spread the coronavirus, but we are taking all precautions. If a need arises, measures for ventilation and exhaust of stale air would be added,” said Dharmendra Jha, who runs a large office building on Sohna Road.The issue of central AC system is not limited to private offices, with even government offices, such as the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), facing issues.At the MCG office in Sector 34, the central AC system has been made non-operational. However, the effect of its absence is mixed. While officials working out of the first and second floor have no access to ACs or fans, bureaucrats and officials in the planning branch, located on the third floor, have split ACs at their respective offices.On the first floor of the MCG office is the taxation and legal branches, Swachh Bharat Mission, Geographic Information System (GIS) lab, and Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC). The engineering, accounts, establishment and audit branches are based on the second floor.“We do not have a single outlet for ventilation. It is next to impossible for us to work in this heat. After every hour or so, we step outside for a few minutes to get some fresh air and respite, and then return to work,” an MCG official said on the condition of anonymity.“We have closed the central air-conditioning system in the interim, as it carries air across all corners of the office space and thus, holds a great possibility of transmitting infections. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, the safety of our officials and those visiting the MCG office is of top priority,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.To meet the challenging situation, experts suggest that building managers in the city will have to specifically address concerns related to air quality, humidity and ventilation. They suggest that apart from ensuring social distancing and disinfecting the office space, there is need to control indoor temperature, air quality and humidity.Mansoor Ali, an air quality expert, said that the building managers must ensure that temperature inside the office remains between 24 to 30 degrees. “Research across the world suggests that maintaining this temperature inhibits the conditions for the spread of Covid-19. Although there would be some discomfort to people inside, this has to be done to prevent the spread,” he said.As India’s humidity level is on the higher side, it is also important that humidity levels inside the buildings need to monitored, as there is little or no scope for natural ventilation. “It is important that same air is not recirculated inside the buildings and adequate ventilation systems are installed to ensure fresh air enters the premises,” said HP Yadav, MD, Paltecch Cooling Systems, a Gurugram-based firm.Ali said that viruses thrive at higher humidities and the ideal humidity in an office should be between 40 and 60 RH (relative humidity). “If the humidity is high, we need to introduce dehumidification so that it remains under check,” he said, adding that air-filtration systems for AC plants need to be checked and cleaned so that the spread of the virus can be checked.KV Suresh, a Delhi-based air-conditioning expert, however, said that there was a lot of ambiguity about the situation, and conclusive advice from specialists and virologists was yet to come. “At present, neither the health experts nor air-conditioning experts have got a hang of the situation,” he said.Dhruv Chaudhary, head of department of pulmonary and critical care at PGIMS, Rohtak, said that central ACs leads to re-circulation of air, and this increases the chance of spreading coronavirus in indoor spaces. “HEPA filters can be installed at AC vents, as these acts as anti-flu filters and prevent the spread of virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/employees-sweat-it-out-in-absence-of-central-air-conditioning-in-offices/story-nz1WaXp6VTKvV9nyxPWL1K.html

They also demanded that their salary should be doubled like other frontline workers and they should be provided Rs 50-lakh insurance cover.Wearing black badges, the protesting health workers said they had raised their demands with officials concerned on several occasions, but to no avail. “We did not get enough support from the government and have to purchase mask and sanitisers ourselves,” alleged one such worker, asking not to disclose her name.The ASHAs alleged that they have to face public rage during their duty as many people do not allow them to install posters outside their houses. They also sought random testing of all ASHAs as they carry out door-to-door screening, even in the containment zones.“The monthly remuneration given to accredited social health activists is about Rs 4,000 and many of them don’t even get it on time,” claimed Sudesh Rani, Karnal district president of Asha Workers’ Union.Karnal chief medical officer Ashwini Ahuja said, “As per the government guidelines, they have been provided all the required equipment for the protection and training.” He said PPE kits were required for doctors and officials in direct contact with coronavirus patients, adding that since ASHAs were field workers, they cannot work wearing PPE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/karnal-ashas-raise-banner-of-protest-seek-protective-gear-pay-hike/story-C8GqLgYZX8CNt55tFQkfhJ.html
12-05-2020||City||Bihar cases up at 830 after 81 test +ve||PATNA: The home-coming of migrant workers led to spiralling of cases, with 81 people testing positive for the virus Tuesday, pushing the state tally to 830, with six deaths so far.Almost one-fourth the total number of cases in Bihar was attributed to the migrant workers. “A total of 190 people who had come from outside the state during lockdown 3.0 (after May 3) have so far tested positive during their random sampling,” said health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh.However, considering the spike in the number of cases due to migrant workers, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had now instructed health officials to go in for as much as possible testing of the migrant workers.He said the random testing of samples of migrant workers would not suffice anymore and that efforts should be made to test as many people as possible who were coming from outside the state.Kumar directed officials to scale up testing facility to 10,000 samples a day against the present average daily testing capacity of 1900-2000 samples, said a spokesperson of the state government.The migrant workers had somewhat spoilt the state’s Covid-19 scoresheet, as 2.21% people had tested positive for the virus against a total 37,430 samples tested at the six government testing laboratories approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research in the state. The percentage of patients testing positive was 1.79% against the total samples tested last week (on May 3), said Singh.As on Tuesday, Bihar had tested 37,430 samples through its six testing centres. It had also approved two other laboratories in the private sector to test samples for Covid-19.Of the 190 migrant workers to have tested positive for the virus after May 3, around 55 had returned from New Delhi, 46 from Gujarat, 44 from Maharashtra, 16 from West Bengal and 11 from Uttar Pradesh, said an official. “There were some who returned from other states as well, including Rajasthan (6), Haryana, Telangana (3 each), Jharkhand, Kerala, (1 each) and the source destination of four others were still unknown,” he added.“The travel history of four people—one each from Auraangabad, Begusarai, Munger and Araria is under investigation,” said a government data, which principal secretary, health, Sanjay Kumar had shared through a tweet.The number of the migrant workers testing positive for the virus had doubled in less than two days. Till May 10, only around 85 migrant workers had tested positive for the virus as against 1.02 lakh people who had returned from different states this month, as per government data. The Covid-19 cases among the migrants had risen to 190 as against 1,20,131 who had returned to Bihar till Tuesday.Six more jawans of the Bihar Military Police had tested positive from Patna’s Khajpura locality, a red zone, on Tuesday. With this, the total number of infected personnel in Bihar police had gone up to 27, including 19 from the BMP alone. Eight personnel had tested positive on Monday.Of the 81 cases Tuesday, Khagaria accounted for 16, followed by West Champaran (14), Rohtas (13), Begusarai (9), Patna (7), Madhubani (4), Muzaffarpur (3), Aurangabad, Gopalganj, Darbhanga (2 each) and Supaul, Banka, Purnea, Bhagalpur, Siwan, Katihar, Bhojpur and Arwal (1 each).Around 219 people had tested positive for coronavirus in three days.Six Covid-19 patients had recovered during the last 24 hours, taking the total recoveries to 383, with a case recovery rate of 48% in the state. Given the spike in cases, the recovery rate had now gone down from 53% on Monday to 48%.Munger 115, Patna (79), Rohtas (72), Buxar (56), Nalanda (51), Begusarai (40), Siwan (34), Kaimur (32), Madhubani (30), Khagaria (27), Bhagalpur (26), West Champaran (25), Gopalganj (22), Bhojpur (21), Aurangabad (17), Darbhanga (16), East Champaran (14), Nawada (13), Katihar, Muzaffarpur, Arwal (12 each), Saharsa (10), Madhepura, Kishanganj, Samastipur, Saran (9 each), Gaya, Sheikhpura (8 each), Sitamarhi, Banka (7 each), Jehanabad (5), Lakhisarai, Araria, Vaishali, Supaul, Purnea (4 each), Sheohar 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-cases-up-at-830-after-81-test-ve/story-ipIiWeIHDtdtJHSpmi42SP.html

12-05-2020||Mumbai||PG medical students can surrender all-India quota seats till May 18||Admissions to post-graduate medical seats have already begun but ahead of the release of the first seat allocation list in the state, the Medical Counseling Committee (MCC) on Tuesday said that students now have time till May 18 to surrender their all India quota (AIQ) seats.PG medical aspirants in Maharashtra were worried about having to surrender their AIQ seats even before being assured of the release of the state seat allocation list. The AIQ seats are15% of the total seats in each state and students from outside a particular state can apply for these places.“Keeping in view that many state counsellings have been delayed due to Covid-19 outbreak, it has been decided that students who were allotted a college in round one (of AIQ) can resign from their allotted seats by 5pm on May 18,” stated a circular released by MCC. The original date for surrendering seats was May 12, 5pm.As per rules, PG medical aspirants who have already bagged a seat through the AIQ have a choice to either stick to the institute already allotted through AIQ, or release the seat in the hope of a seat in another institute under the state quota. At present, the status of the first list by the state common entrance test (CET) cell is uncertain because CET cell authorities are still reworking the seat matrix, said an official.“As per law, the AIQ seats are allocated first and if students want to be eligible for state quota seat, they have to surrender their AIQ seat. Anyone would prefer a seat in one of the top Institutes in Maharashtra but the uncertainty of the first CET list is unnerving,” said Rishabh Jain, a PG medical aspirant from Mumbai. In a circular released late in the third week of April, the state CET cell had requested state medical and dental institutes to share contact details of staff handling admissions and also make arrangements for a payment portal online so that students can pay the fees and confirm admissions once the seat allotment list is released on April 24, after 6pm. This process was held by the Bombay high court following a petition that highlighted discrepancies in quota allocation of seats.“Once the seat matrix is ready, we will release a seat allocation list and students will have the option of completing the admission process online this time, appropriate provisions have been made accordingly,” added the CET cell official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pg-medical-students-can-surrender-all-india-quota-seats-till-may-18/story-gweJ1MQ9C5gD8Fp1qRItdK.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||Staff of government schools to be assigned Covid duties||In a letter issued on Monday, the Maharashtra education department has asked principals of all aided schools in the state to furnish information of teachers so that they can be asked to report for Covid-19 related duties if necessary.“With the rising number of cases in the state, many Covid centres are being set up in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) aided and private schools. For this, the services of teachers and non-teaching staff would be required. Principals are thus directed to furnish details of their staff,” reads the letter.Last week, BMC’s education department had asked its staff to report to work as most municipal schools have been converted into quarantine centres. Officials said that many teachers failed to report to work. “Many said that they had gone to their respective hometowns before the lockdown. We have asked them to report immediately,” said an official.While the letter does not specify the type of duties the school staff will be expected to do, sources in the education department said that the work could be related to the management of quarantine centres created in schools.Teachers said that they are willing to do Covid-related duties if safety gear is being provided by the government. “Teachers should be given PPE kits, pick up and drop facility and insurance cover. If this is given, they won’t have an issue in taking up these duties,” said Uday Nare, a teacher at Hansraj Morarji Public School in Andheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/staff-of-government-schools-to-be-assigned-covid-duties/story-N6BTkhoWIlxVvu22hpdxCP.html
12-05-2020||Lucknow||Mumbai workers riding autos, taxis to reach home in Prayagraj||Undeterred by hefty amount and long distance, migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh, living in Mumbai, are hiring auto rickshaws and even taxis to reach their native places in Prayagraj and adjoining districts.Vehicles, especially autos with registration number of Maharashtra, could be seen, carrying workers in outer areas of Prayagraj and some of them even managed to enter the city despite check points and barriers, installed at many places in the city.These migrant workers, mainly working in factories and having better economic condition, are arriving in autos. They said that they had paid hefty amounts to the auto drivers of Mumbai to persuade them to transport them to their native villages in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Some auto and taxi drivers belong to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar itself while many who are from Maharashtra are again looking for passengers to earn cash during their return journey.More surprisingly, many autos and taxis carrying migrant workers managed to cross the check points on around 1500 kilometers long route from Mumbai to Prayagraj. Majority of the workers, who have hired autos and taxis, have to spend all their savings to pay the hefty fare charged by drivers.On being questioned about their journey, many were reluctant to disclose much details but on condition of anonymity disclosed the amount they were spending to reach their village. “The auto drivers and taxi drivers are charging hefty amounts from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 from each passenger for ferrying them to their native places according to the distance covered,” claimed a worker who used to work in a printing unit in Mumbai and was returning in an auto with three others persons.The labourers when stopped at check points give different excuses to cops and most of the time, vehicles are allowed to proceed. However, in difficult situation, alternate routes were used for continuing the journey, a taxi driver said.“It took four days to cover the distance from Mumbai to Prayagraj as we covered 300 to 400 km every day while taking rest as well. Many auto drivers have also gone towards Pratapgarh”, disclosed one of the auto driver who is waiting for passengers as he has to return to Mumbai after dropping labourers in Prayagraj. ARTO Siyaram Verma said that autos and taxis from outside the state were not allowed to move here. He said autos especially were only allowed to ply on pre-decided routes locally. A team will be deployed to check movement of vehicles from outside states, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mumbai-workers-riding-autos-taxis-to-reach-home-in-prayagraj/story-iAA8udSrMTMLqpy8X27QyI.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||Work from office for a week and from home for two weeks: Scientists suggest post lockdown plan||Split the workforce into three — one group clocks in to work for a week with the remaining two remain under lockdown for two weeks. This recommendation of an asynchronous, periodic lockdown comes from a multi-institute team, which has based its post-lockdown strategies on the first pan-India INDSCI-SIM model. The model was developed by the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19 (ISRC), a voluntary group of more than 400 scientists and researchers, to reopen the economy.Researchers said the asynchronous periodic lockdown — where each group’s turn for work comes cyclically after a specific period — is shown to be more effective than synchronous periodic lockdown. In the latter, the entire workforce heads to work for a fixed number of days and gets locked down for a fixed period of time. “The duration of the infectivity of the disease is about 14 days. Even if one person catches the infection during the work week, she/he will be home for the next two weeks as per the asynchronous lockdown schedule,” said professor Bhalchandra Pujari of Savitribai Phule Pune University. “This will effectively lead to quarantining oneself as well as reducing the chance of transmitting the virus to others.”However, the scientists said they would not recommend this schedule for states or cities such as Maharashtra or Mumbai where the number of infections are significantly rising every day. “The success of this method lies in the ability to be able to trace and test the working population easily, which is easiest when the number of infections is small and the number of those at work is also small,” said Gautam Menon, professor of biology and physics, Ashoka University, and adjunct faculty at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.In areas where the spread of Covid-19 is less extensive, asynchronous periodic lockdown combined with large-scale testing, tracing and quarantine would reduce stress on healthcare infrastructure while keeping the economy moving.“The peak of hospitalised numbers is increased for the synchronous case vis-a-vis the asynchronous case resulting in more pressure on the health care system since many more people will require hospitalisation around the days when the peak occurs,” said Menon. “The number of people requiring hospitalisations is also spread over a longer period for the synchronous case. This means, more people overall requiring hospitalisation over the course of the epidemic.”Fewer people at work also translates into better physical distancing, which will bring down the R0 (R nought), a number that denotes the number of people that can be infected by one individual who is suffering CoVid19. Obeying lockdown rules while not at work will further suppress the R0. The ISRC team suggested that the feasibility of a synchronous periodic lockdown should also be examined. “Even with a synchronous lockdown, our model does indicate an improvement over relaxing the lockdown completely,” said Menon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/work-for-a-week-stay-home-for-two-weeks-scientists-suggest-post-lockdown-plan/story-JYFdOmwDrEy0wzguFNZVRL.html

The flyover is a part of Jalandhar-Panipat highway project and has been hanging fire for around nine years. Mayor Balkar Sandhu, senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra and councillors Jai Prakash and Rakesh Prashar inspected the ongoing work of the cancer hospital flyover and Sherpur Chowk flyover on Tuesday.The Sherpur Chowk flyover is expected to be complete by May 30, said the mayor, adding that its one side -- from Delhi to Jalandhar-- has already been opened for traffic.Member of the Punjab road safety council, Rahul Verma, said, “Now, residents coming from Jalandhar side would not be able to enter the city from Sherpur Chowk and will have to exit from Tibba Road exit point. With the completion of this flyover, the traffic is expected to increase at Samrala Chowk as the truckers who used to used to exit the highway from Moti Nagar point, would now have to exit from Tibba Road point and move towards Transport Nagar through Samrala Chowk.”“After the lockdown, the traffic would increase at Samrala Chowk and residents coming from Jalandhar side would have no exit point to enter the city and will have to take a u-turn from Focal Point area. We are working to find some solution for these problems,” he added.As per information, the cancer hospital flyover project had to be completed by March 31, but it was stopped after the curfew was imposed in the state. The construction work commenced amid the lockdown on April 23 after the administration gave the approval with the condition that the contractors and NHAI would have to follow the guidelines issued by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nh-44-flyover-opened-for-traffic-mayor-inspects-construction-work-at-sherpur-chowk-in-ludhiana/story-EQTqQLp1bKGbpUcnQIi7iL.html
12-05-2020||Bangalore||Record single-day spike of 63 Covid-19 cases in Karnataka; tally breaches 900 mark||A day after witnessing a dip, Karnataka on Tuesday recorded a new all-time single-day high of 63 new Covid-19 cases, most of them returnees to the state from other parts of the country, as the total breached the 900 mark, the health department said. Hassan that had remained coronavirus-free district so far, reported five cases, including two children, as the state’s tally rose to 925, including 31 deaths and 433 discharges, it said. After highest single day spike of 54 cases on Sunday, the state saw a decline on Monday with 14 people testing positive but only to clock a new record high. “Today is again it not a good day in terms of numbers...most cases are those with the travel history to Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Odisha and Chennai,” Minister S Suresh Kumar, the spokesperson for Covid-19 in Karnataka, told reporters. He said most of them were those who got stranded somewhere (outside Karnataka) and came back recently. “After their return, we placed them under quarantine. On screening and testing them during quarantine, they turned out to be positive,” he said. Deputy Commissioners of all districts have information about people who will be coming from outside in the days to come and accordingly they will make quarantine arrangements, he added. According to the health department’s bulletin, out of the 460 active cases, a total of 449 Covid-19 patients were in isolation at designated hospitals and stable while 11 were undergoing treatment in intensive care units. Seven patients who have recovered, were discharged on Tuesday. Bagalkode reported the highest of 15 cases on Tuesday followed by Davangere (12), Dharwad (9) Hassan and Kolar (5 each), Bengaluru Urban (4), Gadag (3) Dakshina Kannada, Yadgir and Bidar (2 each), and one each from Ballari, Chikkaballapura, Mandya and Kalaburagi. As amany as 32 of the new cases are with travel history to Ahmedabad in Gujarat, six to Mumbai, two to Odisha and one to Chennai. Among the others, fifteen are contacts of patients already tested positive, two are from containment zone in Bidar and one with history of Influenza Like Illness (ILI).Contact tracing was in progress for four persons. Asked whether the sharp spike in cases will make the Karnataka government reconsider its decision on relaxing lockdown, Kumar said after May 18, whatever the decision may be on lockdown, measures like quarantining, hospitalisation of specific cases, will stay with us for a long time. “Because of lockdown relaxation these people (stranded outside) were able to come to the state, but on returning they were placed under quarantine, which avoided the spread, we will not relax that,” he said. Responding to a question on those stranded in foreign countries coming back to the state, the Minister said arrangement for paid quarantine would be made at the place chosen by them. Bengaluru Urban continue to top districts in most number of Covid-19 cases with 182, followed by Belagavi 113 and Mysuru 88. Out of the total 433 patients discharged so far, maximum 91 are from Bengaluru Urban, 84 from Mysuru and 44 from Kalaburagi. A total of 1,16,533 samples had been tested so far, out of which 4,938 were on Tuesday, the bulletin said. So far 1,11,264 samples have been found negative and out of them 4,797 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the government issued orders directing that all Covid-19 suspected cases whose test reports are inconclusive should not be kept in dedicated Covid hospitals till their repeat test result and put up in dedicated health centres. Also, the Project Director of Karnataka AIDS prevention Society has issued directions to all Districts AIDS officers to utilise the contact phone numbers shared by the government for reaching out and carrying out health checkup of AIDS patients during this Covid-19 period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/record-single-day-spike-of-63-covid-19-cases-in-karnataka-tally-breaches-900-mark/story-jrOaHMv4Q2B1hQBnyPFD7J.html

12-05-2020||City||Mohali farmers urged to sow paddy directly in the ongoing Kharif season||To save the depleting water table and in view of the possibilities of labour shortage due to Covid-19 epidemic, Mohali’s district administration has urged farmers to opt for direct sowing of paddy in the ongoing Kharif season.Chief agriculture officer of Mohali, Ranjit Singh Bains said that farmers should go for direct sowing in medium or heavy soil, but should avoid this technique in sandy soil. He recommends that the field should be leveled and paddy varieties PR-121, PR 122, PR-126 and PR-127 should be sown in the first fortnight of June, while Basmati varieties Pusa-1121, Pusa-1509 and Pusa-1718 should be sown in the second fortnight of June. Direct sowing of paddy offers more advantage in the current scenario with farm labour having left for their home states. It can be done by machines such as lucky seed drill and seed sowing drill with crooked plates are used, which are available with some farmers in Mohali. Additionally, direct sowing needs no water in the first 20 days as compared to traditional methods which require large quantities of water. He further said that 8 to 10kg of paddy seed is required for direct sowing. The seed should be soaked in water for 8 hours in a mixture of 20 gm Baviston and 1 gm streptocycline in 10 litres of water to treat the seed, which is then dried and sown.The officer also suggested to farmers that since direct sowing of paddy is a new technology, so initially, especially during the first month, more attention is required. He also assured that there is no difference in yield when using this technique as compared to the traditional method of paddy transplantation. Bains has urged farmers to seek detailed information from the agriculture officer in the nearest block.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-farmers-urged-to-sow-paddy-directly-in-the-ongoing-kharif-season/story-tCZFSRjGRUeoZtIyksX0LK.html
12-05-2020||Patna||Tejashwi returns to Bihar after two months, gets scoffed at by ruling NDA||The ruling JD(U)-BJP alliance in Bihar on Tuesday heaped scorn on leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav, who has returned to the state after spending two months in the national capital where he was, apparently, “stuck” because of the lockdown.Leaders of both the parties advised the RJD leader to spend 21 days at a quarantine centre, spend some time with the migrant workers lodged therein whose cause he was professing to champion and “devote himself to the states fight against corona” thereafter.Yadav, the heir apparent of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and the partys Chief Ministerial candidate for assembly elections due in half a year, arrived here late Monday night by road and is putting up at the 10, Circular Road residence of his mother Rabri Devi.“Welcome, o bhrashtachar ke raajkumar (the prince of corruption)” quipped Information and Public Relations Department minister Neeraj Kumar, a leader in the JD(U) headed by Nitish Kumar, in a dig at the numerous cases of graft against family members of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad who is at Ranchi serving sentences in fodder scam cases.“Now that you have made it convenient to end your vacation, it is time to follow the norms. You have come from outside Bihar. So you must get yourself medically screened at a quarantine centre and stay there for 21 days”, said the minister with trademark pungency.“At the quarantine centre, you will get a chance to meet migrant workers in person and learn about the sufferings they have undergone which you can only talk about. After the quarantine period, you must get your hands dirty and devote yourself to the states fight against corona”, he added.BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand pointed out that the 30- year-old leader, who is an avid user of Twitter, returned just a day after a hashtag “Tejashwi bhagoda hai” (Tejashwi is a deserter) went viral on the social media.“While Bihar was busy battling the pandemic, Tejashwi was enjoying a vacation at an undisclosed place. So many times did our party plead with him to return and join the fight against corona, but he remained true to his reputation of running away whenever a crisis befell the state”, Anand said in a statement.Yadav, who is Lalu Prasads younger son, has been attracting criticism for his frequent and prolonged absences from Bihar during which he, nonetheless, makes it a point to comment on the happenings back home through various social media platforms.Last seen at the budget session of the state assembly, which was curtailed and ended in mid-March nearly a fortnight ahead of schedule the former Deputy CM had been frequently coming out with messages on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp and had also taken part in a meeting held via video conferencing in which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar interacted with legislators representing all political parties.Yadavs elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav, who lives a few hundred metres from their mothers residence, drove to call on the younger sibling and fumed when asked about the criticism about Tejashwis absence.“He had gone to Delhi. Nobody, including Tejashwi, had a premonition that there will be such a lockdown. So he got stuck. As I keep saying, the political battle in Bihar is like Mahabharata. “My brother is going to play the role of Arjuna while I shall be Krishna his charioteer cum advisor. Our opponents are in panic”, said the maverick RJD leader, whose effusive displays of affection for the younger brother keep alternating with political tugs of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/tejashwi-returns-to-bihar-after-two-months-gets-scoffed-at-by-ruling-nda/story-TddR2m6Fd4Z49wlSUZd5jK.html

An official of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development (KVSAD) Board said the construction work continued till March 21. The work was stopped following ‘Janata Curfew’ and subsequent lockdown to check spread of Covid-19 pandemic.These days, construction agency PSP Projects is working on construction of temple platform, passenger safety centres 1 and 2, spiritual book store and refreshment centre. The officer further said four engineers of state public works department had also been deployed to ensure the quality of the construction as per the set standards. Lockdown norms are also being followed by the workers. Vishal Singh, CEO, KVSAD Board, said, the workers wore masks, gloves and also washed their hands every now and then during their work. Their thermal screening was also done at the site every morning, he added. They also maintained social distancing. When they reached the site after the lunch break, their thermal screening was repeated, Singh said. Kashi Vishwanath Corridor is the dream project of PM Narendra Modi who laid the foundation of the project in March last year. The project is likely to be completed by June 2021.

12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Make policy on early release of life convicts in 3 months: HC to Haryana||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Haryana government to formulate a policy on premature release of convicts serving life sentences within three months.The HC bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill said till the time such a policy is finalised, the governor can consider release of convicts under Article 161 of Constitution of India (under which governor deals with cases of premature release) taking facts of each case into account. The state government too can consider cases of premature release under 2008 policy under sections 432 and 433 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which empower it to deal with such cases.The court found that the 2008 notification was issued in the name of governor, but the guidelines were framed with provisions under which the state is empowered to order premature release of life convicts. Due to this, there were guidelines for examining such cases by the state, not the governor. “Policies can be a fine tool for reducing perceptions of arbitrary treatment among identically situated persons so as to help keep the system fair and unbiased,” the bench observed ordering the formulation of fresh guidelines.The order came on the plea of one Raj Kumar convicted in a murder case by a Gurugram court in 2010. He had argued that the authorities were not processing his case for premature release on the premise that the 2008 policy made him ineligible, while his case is to be considered as per the 2002 policy. The 2002 policy makes a convict eligible for premature release after 10 years, and 2008 policy after 14 years.The court observed that the anomaly is going to show its effect all the more now (2020) as the cases of the persons convicted in 2008 and onwards would come in the consideration zone as they would have completed about 10 years of actual confinement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/make-policy-on-early-release-of-life-convicts-in-3-months-hc-to-haryana/story-64qgpSnwzZdBnR7qYFfqGM.html

NSA was invoked against him on February 13.“The NSA slapped on Dr Kafeel has been extended for six month from earlier three months as there are apprehensions that his release may lead to law and order problem,” said judicial assistant, Aligarh, Shirish Kumar.“I wonder how the release of Dr Kafeel could lead to unrest amid this lockdown,” said Dr Kafeel’s brother Adeel Ahmed.He also expressed concern over the health of Dr Kafeel as unconfirmed reports said overcrowded Mathura jail also faces danger of Covid-19 infection.Dr Kafeel shot to limelight after 2017 oxygen tragedy at BRD Medical College in which several kids had died for lack of oxygen cylinders.

One is that patients from the city who require our services should be referred from Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH-32) and Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH-16) and patients from the neighbouring state must be referred from district hospitals,” Dr Jagat Ram said. Around 10,000 patients visit the PGI in a day, most of whom travel long distances from neighbouring states for better medical services which are shut since March 20.Dr GD Puri, dean (academics) and chairman of the panel constituted for re-opening of OPDs, said they were pushing for popularising tele-medicine and tele-consultation services through which need-based appointments can be provided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-pgimer-wants-referral-system-in-place-before-starting-opd-services/story-VckhgOk2R2Ak6Tn7AS8aNN.html
12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana following Centre’s new Covid-19 guidelines, but with riders||The Haryana government is following Centre’s new guidelines on the treatment of Covid-19 patients, but with some conditions of its own.Senior doctors said the Centre has asked state governments to allow asymptomatic patients or those with mild infection to stay in isolation at their respective homes, provided they have a separate room and wash room, exclusively for them.Likewise, the new guidelines also allow the state governments to discharge a patient from the hospital after completion of his/her 14-day treatment even without conducting confirmatory tests.While these directions aim at enabling the healthcare workforce to focus on the patients requiring intensive care, the state’s senior doctors say the state health department does not want to take any chances, so it has decided to conduct at least one confirmatory test after an asymptomatic or mild patient is cured and two tests for serious patients despite the revised discharge policy. As per the earlier guidelines, a patient was required to be examined after 14-day treatment and tested. Also, another confirmatory test was required to be done 24 hours prior to discharge.Apart from testing cured patients, another addition that the state has made is geo-fencing.The doctors also said it has also been decided to make geo-fencing mandatory for the patients in home isolation. This means that aside from pasting positive case notices outside the houses of Covid-19 patients and stamping their hands, they would be required to download the Aarogya Setu mobile app. This is to ensure that such patients remain isolated in their homes and do not go out to mingle with others, the doctors said.Claiming that not all states were following the Centre’s guidelines with such riders, top doctors said Jhajjar and Faridabad are among the few districts which have allowed home isolation with the geo-fencing conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-following-centre-s-new-covid-19-guidelines-but-with-riders/story-w9RL2K2EeM0NamHcbExr9I.html

12-05-2020||Delhi||Nearly 41.2 % Delhi University students’ have not attended online classes at all, finds survey by student’s group||As many as 41.2 % of Delhi University (DU) students have not been able to attend online classes at all amid the nationwide lockdown, found a survey by a students’ group.The survey conducted by the DU unit of All India Students’ Association (AISA) also found that the major reason behind students not being able to attend classes online regularly was “poor internet connectivity”. The survey recovered was conducted over the last two weeks and covered more than 1,500 students. The University had started online classes in the last week of March, soon after the lockdown was imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. “Only 22.4 % of students are attending online classes regularly. While 41.2% of students said they are not being able to attend classes at all, the remaining 42.4 % said that they have managed to attend a few classes,” stated the survey report released on Tuesday.“As many as 72.2 % of students said poor internet connectivity is the main reason behind them not being able to attend classes online classes regularly,11.6% of students cited financial incapability as the reason, and 7.6% said that household chores are not letting them attend online classes. The remaining 8.3% cited other reasons,” the report stated.While the DU administration is thinking about conducting online exams for its final year students, around 74 percent of the surveyed students responded against the idea. “Around 32.4% of students said that they don’t even have devices such as smartphones or laptops to appear in the online exams,” said the survey report.Abhigyan (single name), member AISA (DU unit) and a student at Ramjas College, said the student’s organisation was approached by many DU students who were finding it difficult to attend online classes. “The students were also worried about the University administration’s idea of conducting online exams. So we thought we should conduct a survey to get a clear picture of students’ opinions on online exams and classes and send it to the university administration,” he said.Several students across the University are finding it difficult to attend online classes. Sandeep Kumar, a third-year student at Hindu College, said he had left for his village in Uttarakhand before the lockdown was announced and now faces connectivity issues while attending online classes. “Some of my friends who are in northeastern states have not been able to attend any classes at all until now because of poor internet connectivity. In such a situation, one cannot even think about taking online exams,” Kunar said.The University administration had recently invited suggestions from various stakeholders on how exams should be conducted in the prevailing situation. Rajesh Jha, member of University’s executive council, said the council has written to the DU administration several times against conducting online exams. “When we take an online class, usually 20 out of 45 students attend at a time. Many students call and text us explaining difficulties in attending online classes because of various reasons,” he said.A member of University’s special task force constituted to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, requesting anonymity, said, “We are closely monitoring the situation and also accessing the number of students who are equipped with technology. Any decision on exams will be taken keeping in mind the interest of students.”The University is also considering launching voice conferencing to help the students who do not have smartphones or other devices. “We are planning to start classes via audio conferencing which needs no internet or smart devices” the member added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nearly-41-2-delhi-university-students-have-not-attended-online-classes-at-all-finds-survey-by-student-s-group/story-xi6KOOiU2O5qBKNzt9YXlO.html

12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Summer begins on cooler note in Chandigarh this year, courtesy cleaner air||Even as peak summer season is round the corner, the temperature in the city is still on the lower side as compared to previous years, according to the officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), who attribute the trend to higher than average rainfall and improved air quality due to restricted vehicular movement and industrial activity amid the lockdown.As per Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) report on air pollution in city, vehicular emissions are the leading cause of pollutants entering the air. Ever since the lockdown began from March 24, the air quality has remained in the good bracket (0-50) while in previous years, it would stay in the moderate bracket (100-200). Due to this, averages of both maximum and minimum temperatures in April this year remained lower than previous (see graphic). This far in May as well, the values continue to be lower than previous years.IMD regional director Surender Paul said, “Pollutants in the air absorb heat causing temperatures to go up. Even if pollution levels start to rise as and when the lockdown is opened, some gradual rise in temperature can be expected but it is likely to stay on the lower side throughout May due to cleaner air and rain.”Paul added, “Air pollutants are known to decrease the amount of rain in the city. This year, we have received more than average rain in both April and May so far. However, it needs to be studied how much air pollution has had a bearing on this as there were other factors at play too.”Member secretary of CPCC, TC Nautiyal, said pollutant levels were less than half of what they used to be in previous years. “We have seen various benefits with better air quality. However, this is a short-term relief as pollution will go up again after industries reopen and vehicles start to ply. We need to push for concepts like carpooling and cycling to improve air quality.”Chairperson of department of environment studies in Panjab University, Suman Mor, said, “Thanks to the lockdown, greenhouse gas emissions - known to make the weather warmer - have also reduced. People need to change their habits to bring down pollution permanently.”Paul said temperature is likely to stay on the lower side throughout this week and added, “Light rain is likely this week. Light to moderate rain is also likely on Thursday and Friday as a system of western disturbances is likely to affect the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/summer-begins-on-cooler-note-in-chandigarh-this-year-courtesy-cleaner-air/story-Ar8pb0zlAe8vtBQzKCB8TJ.html

12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana to allow entry of medics from Delhi, but with e-passes||Stating that about 56% of the coronavirus cases in the national capital region (NCR) districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat — had Delhi connections, the Haryana government on Tuesday told the Delhi High Court (HC) that it will allow back and forth movement of medical professionals from Delhi on production of movement passes.Hearing a public interest litigation, the HC had on May 8 said that orders of the Sonepat district magistrate (DM) restraining the movement of doctors, nurses, court officials and trucks from Delhi to Sonepat constituted an infringement of the constitutional provisions. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) had on May 11 asked the states to ensure that interstate movement of medical professionals, nurses, paramedics was facilitated. The directions came after the issue of restrictions being imposed by some states, including Haryana, was flagged during a meeting between the cabinet secretary and state governments on Sunday. “Ensuring unhindered movement of medical professionals is essential for meeting public health requirements and saving precious human lives,” Union Home Secretary, Ajay Bhalla said in his communication to the state governments.Haryana’s additional advocate general Anil Grover told the court that in furtherance of May 11 directions of the MHA, the state government has evolved a procedure of movement passes (e-passes) which will be given to medical professionals without any hassle. “Today, we have provided about 55 passes to medical professionals living in Haryana’s NCR districts and working in AIIMS, New Delhi, to facilitate their movement,” he said.In response to a query as to why e-passes were being sought by Haryana instead of identity cards issued by central or Delhi governments or hospitals, Grover told the HC that while identity cards can be forged, e-passes issued by state government cannot be forged as they bear a bar code. He emphasised that e-passes were being issued within minutes of letters or phone calls being received from officials of the central government or hospitals. The HC, however, asked the Centre to convince the state government not to press for movement passes and resolve the issue. The matter was listed for May 14. Grover said, “Our argument is centred on the fact that majority of Covid-19 cases in four districts are an outcome of daily to and fro commute of passengers from Haryana’s NCR districts to the national capital.”The movement restriction orders are not Delhi centric, he said, adding that they applied to inter-district travel within Haryana as well as to and fro movement of commuters to Uttar Pradesh. Grover said similar notifications restricting the movement (as the one issued on April 30 by the Sonepat DM) have been issued by the district magistrates of Faridabad, Gurugram and Jhajjar. “The entire endeavour is to ensure that pandemic does not enter the rural areas of Haryana because havoc will get created if it does,” Grover told the HC.In an affidavit filed before the court, the state government said that the April 30 orders of Sonepat DM had exempted the movement of ambulances, ATM vans, LPG cylinders, oil containers and tankers from Delhi. Moreover, movement of grains, milk, poultry, cereals, lentils and other eatable items, excluding fruits and vegetables, besides green and dry fodder, medicines, medical equipment and transit logistics movement of essential and non-essential goods from Delhi was allowed by the Sonepat administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-to-allow-entry-of-medics-from-delhi-but-with-e-passes/story-MdI4tMxBCrJLrU2JGgORLI.html

But the joy was short-lived as the driver took a u-turn near Ambala, saying that his permit had expired. It was later found out that the administration had not provided any permit to the operator.Mahesh Kumar, one of the migrants, said, “We had departed from the city around 5.30pm on Monday and stopped at an eatery near Ambala around 2.30am. After a nearly hour-long halt, the driver told us that his permit had expired and that he was driving us back to the city.” All the migrants are now waiting in the bus, hoping that it will depart for the destination soon.“We have paid around Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,300 each for a seat on the bus and now we are not sure if we will even reach home,” he told Hindustan Times on Tuesday evening, adding that none of them have had anything to eat since Monday night.Ganesh Kumar, another migrant, said, “The driver stopped the bus a few kilometres away from Ambala and refused to take us further. He then brought us back to the city. Where will we go now? We have already left our quarters and cannot return.”“We reached here at 7am today and it is 6pm now but we are still waiting for the bus to move,” said Ganesh.AGENTS ROAMING AROUND INDUSTRIAL AREAS TO BOOK TICKETSThe migrants, meanwhile, said that some agents were approaching them in their localities in Focal Point, Giaspura and others with bus tickets to their native places. The migrants said they are being charged around Rs 3,300, which they are told includes medical screening expenses. Jujhar Travels manager Saroop Sharma, however, said the company is charging Rs 3000 from the migrants for Gonda. He also denied the claims that agents were approaching migrants on their behalf. About the bus that returned, he said there was some issue regarding permit due to which the bus was called back. MIGRANTS BEING CHARGED FIVE TIMES THE NORMAL RATE: BAINSMember of the Legislative Assembly Simarjeet Singh Bains also reached site in the evening and interacted with the migrants. Bains said that before lockdown, the fare for Gonda was around Rs 650 and now the company is charging five times the normal price from migrants who are already going through a tough time.Bains also contacted the deputy commissioner and said that no permission was given to the company by the administration. He added that the company was fleecing migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-left-in-lurch-as-bus-from-ludhiana-to-up-takes-u-turn-midway/story-nr7rWnatWDm8b1ogQEvA3I.html
12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab returns 46MT ‘poor quality’ pulses received under Centre’s scheme||Chandigarh As the Union and state ministers spar over the distribution of foodgrains to poor families affected by the coronavirus lockdown, the Punjab government has sent back 46 metric tonnes (MTs) of pulses received from the central government under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).The consignment of pulses was received from National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (NAFED), the nodal agency for supplying pulses under the scheme, about a fortnight ago for free distribution but has been sent back by the state food and civil supplies department as its quality was not found to be fit for consumption.“There were more than 900 bags of dal (pulses) which were wet due to rainwater and emanating foul smell. The consignment was rejected and returned,” said an official of the state food and civil supplies department. Punjab has received 7,000MT of pulses so far, out of 11,800 MTs allocated by the Union ministry of food, consumer affairs and public distribution, for 1.41 crore beneficiaries in the state.When contacted, director, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, Anindita Mitra said the department returned 46 MTs of sabut urad dal (black gram whole) to NAFED about 10 days ago because of poor quality. “There were also pigeon droppings in some of these bags received for distribution in the state,” she said. The pulses are in addition to 2.12 lakh MTs of wheat allocated under PMGKAY to give five kilograms (kgs) of wheat per person per month and one kg of dal per family for three months (April to June) to 36 lakh beneficiary families, including 1.92 lakh ‘poor of the poorest’ households, identified under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).NAFED branch manager, Chandigarh, RK Pahwa said there was some complaint regarding the quality of one consignment of pulses, and it was replaced immediately. “There has been no complaint since, but we have been having coordination issues with Punjab officials as they keep changing the delivery spots. The remaining allocated quantity will also be delivered within a week,” he said.The distribution of PMGKAY foodgrains, which was aimed at helping poor households deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, has become a bone of contention between the Centre and the state governments. Union ministers Ram Vilas Paswan and Harsimrat Kaur Badal accused the Punjab authorities of not distributing wheat and pulses allocated to them with the former even stating last week that only 1 per cent of foodgrains had been distributed. Punjab’s food minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu hit back by blaming the delay in the delivery of pulses. A state official said the food and civil supplies department had raised a demand for the supply of pulses on April 1 so that it could distribute both wheat and rice for three months in one go but received the first consignment of 42MTs on April 13 and then small quantities in subsequent consignments. On April 30, the department, which had received 2,646MTs of pulses till then, also requested the central ministry to ask NAFED to expedite supply of pulses because it (state government) was unable to start its distribution in all the districts due to the nodal agency’s slow pace of delivery. As per the latest information, the state has delivered free ration to 20 per cent beneficiaries with Rupnagar district taking the lead with 56 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-returns-46mt-poor-quality-pulses-received-under-centre-s-scheme/story-GBjE9Ej5lTUOVuEUtbokBO.html
12-05-2020||City||PSPCL demands fixed charges, industry contemplates to move court||Accusing the state government of befooling the industry on waiver of fixed charges in electricity bills, industrialists rued that Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is demanding them in instalments. In April, the government had announced that no fixed charges would be levied on large and medium units for two months starting from March 23. However, in a webinar conducted by Furnace Alliance, Ludhiana, on Sunday, PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) Baldev Singh Sran had said that fixed charges have not been waived, but deferred.“The industry feels cheated as chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had announced a relief in terms of fixed charges, but now the PSPCL is demanding them in instalments. The industry is on the brink of closure and the state government is pushing it deeper into crises”, said Tarun Jain Bawa, head of Bahadurke Road Textile and Knitwear Association.Slamming the state government for not providing any kind of relief, the furnace owners said that they would move the Punjab and Haryana high court. “We are left with no other option than to move court or we will have to hand over the keys of our factories to the government. The Punjab government has failed to provide any relief, rather hefty bills are being sent to the industry at this time of crises. The government purchases power at ₹3 per unit and provides the same at ₹ 7.5 to us. The PSPCL is claiming that the bills can be paid in instalments, but 18% interest would be imposed on the payment. We demand that the fixed charges should be waived off and some relief should be provided to the industry, which is reeling under losses”, said Mahesh Gupta, president of Furnace Alliance.National president of All Industries and Trade Forum (AITF), Badish Jindal, said, “It seems like the state government is not bothered about the industry as nothing is being done for it. Instead, more pressure is being put on the shoulders of the industries, which are facing an uncertain future.”Meanwhile, DPS Grewal, engineer-in-chief, PSPCL, said, “As no such instruction in this regard has been issued by the headquarters till now, I cannot comment on the same before that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pspcl-demands-fixed-charges-industry-contemplates-to-move-court/story-MUdTEU1BTPIwcB10Tvv2lK.html

On the frontline in the war against Covid-19, NHM employees are seeking fair wages and insurance covers.After 10 years of service as an ANM (auxiliary nursing & midwifery) nurse with the UT health department, Rishu gets ₹11,000 in hand. She has two daughters and the salary falls hopelessly inadequate. Yet, she has no choice but to carry on. A Kalka resident, Rishu is among the hundreds on the frontline placing their lives at risk in the epidemic. “I was part of the team that surveyed Bapu Dham Colony for three days. Then I was posted in the survey team of Sector 30 (containment zone), Hallomajra and Mauli Jagran,” she said.“We are deputed for night duty without any relaxation from the next day’s shift. There were days when after a 9am to 3pm shift, I work another shift from 5pm to 7am. Then without a break, I have to report for duty at 9am,” she said.Rishu, who comes from Kalka, is also finding it arduous and demanding to commute. She must hitch a ride to her work station as no public transport is available. “We give our 100% to our work, but we get no additional support from the health department. No transportation, no encouragement. Our salaries are dreadfully meagre. I joined at ₹5,500 in 2009 and today I get only ₹11,000 in hand.”Slamming the UT admin, staff nurse Babita Rawat, who is posted at the civil hospital in Sector 22, said, “They call us corona warriors, but what have they done for its warriors? Nothing. I am working as a staff nurse with the UT health department since 2010. I am paid only ₹16,000 while those employed on contract are getting around ₹28,000.”She said, “Give us suitable salaries, so we can look after our families and at least provide us insurance cover to secure our families financially in case something happens to us on duty during the epidemic.”Highlighting the issue, Amit Kumar, general secretary of CNEU (Chandigarh NHM Employees Union), said the staff will wearing black ribbons during duty hours to observe a black day on May 13. The main issue is the inadequate salaries he said, adding that a NHM nurse draws ₹9,000 to ₹11,000, while the outsourced cadre and regular employees draw ₹28,000 to ₹75,000 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-nurses-call-for-fair-wages-insurance-on-international-nurses-day/story-hqGKlyOYTWh0lDSizF2EmK.html

The lockdown that was imposed from March 25 has left a deep impact on the social and economic sectors.Director of industries and commerce department Anoo Malhotra said that the department is ensuring hassle-free operation of food processing industries, flour mills, milk product industries etc. She said that the agro-industries have been allowed to function during these times, considering the seasonal nature of the agricultural sector.“In addition to these the pharma units have also been allowed to run to ensure there is no shortage of life-saving medicines in the market. Packaging units that cater to essential commodity units are also kept functional,” she said in an official statement issued here.“As of today 4,802 units, (2,727 in Jammu division and 2,075 in Kashmir division) are functional including large scale, MSMEs and micro enterprises,” she added.The government has allowed the industries to work at 30% of their staff strength, except the pharma sector which has been allowed to function at 60% of its staff strength, she said.However, Jammu Federation of Industries on Tuesday appealed to lieutenant governor GC Murmu to save the industrial sector of J&K with a request to provide immediate financial support to the ailing sector, which is suffering due to the lockdown.Chairman of federation Lalit Mahajan said that due to the lockdown, there was a sharp decline in the sales turnover for the last 50 days due to which the unitholders were not in a position to pay salaries for April, bank interest, power dues, and other dues.Mahajan reminded L-G of a task force that has been constituted by the government to provide immediate relief to the industrial sector, tourism, hotel industry, hospitality sectors, etc with the timeline for the submission of recommendations by May 15.“But to date, no relief is provided to the industrial sector resulting in the uncertainty that prevails in the minds of unitholders. We fear that we may have to close down our units which in turn will cause mass-scale retrenchment of the workforce,” he said.He requested the L-G to announce a relief package for industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-802-industrial-units-operational-in-j-k/story-sMxzOzEr2heVEBiLp7bShL.html

The centre was to be set-up especially for the inmates of the Arthur Road prison.Both, the state government and the civic body on Tuesday sought time to take instructions and respond to public interest litigation challenging the decision of the state government to set up treatment and quarantine centre at the PAP Colony.The PIL filed is by Sharda Tevar, mother of an undertrial prisoner lodged at Arthur Road jail, and a non-governmental organisation, Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan, which is working along with the homeless, slum dwellers and marginalised communities on housing, food and water rights issues.The petitioners contended that Chembur is the most unsuitable area in the city to quarantine and treat Covid-19 patients and suspects. Mahul area is not suitable for those with severe respiratory problems, it will be counter-productive to quarantine Covid-19 patients in the area.Their PIL stated that the persons having Covid-19 already have severely compromised immunities that manifest in severe respiratory illnesses like pneumonia. In this context, sending suspected Covid-19 patients to Mahul would defeat the very purpose of quarantining them, and instead would accelerate their respiratory ailments. It could even prove to be fatal to such patients. “Indeed, others who have been rehabilitated to Mahul in the past have reported a series of severe respiratory ailments like asthma and tuberculosis within a short period of moving to Mahul,” it added.Petitioner’s counsel, advocate Ronita Bector, pointed out to the bench that three judicial forums have declared the PAP Colony to be uninhabitable because of high-level of industrial pollution and the toxic air quality. The high court had in September 2019 restrained the state government from shifting any slum dwellers or project-affected person to the PAP Colony, also known as Eversmile Complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-to-reply-on-using-vacant-mahul-buildings-as-quarantine-facility-on-friday/story-FsIrh5LD8V163M3lYFo3jP.html

On April 3, he searched for companies selling these materials on the internet and found a company which turned out to be fake.He communicated with them on the mobile number given on the website.Between April 16 to April 20 he transferred the money. Days later his bank informed him that the company he sent the money to was fake, as they had received complaints from other clients.“My bank told me that they have frozen the account of where the money was sent, but to return my money they need an FIR in English.

12-05-2020||Mumbai||HC dismisses plea seeking door-to-door screening for Covid-19||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed by right to information (RTI) activist Anil Galgali seeking directions to the authorities to conduct door-to-door screening of citizens to curb the spread of Covid-19. Though the activist cited the successful implementation of the same in Bhilwara district, Rajasthan, and Worli Koliwada in Mumbai, the bench held that it was practically impossible to screen all citizens in the city, and hence, could not allow the petition. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AA Sayed, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Galgali through advocates Arvind Tiwari, Devendra Shah, and Atal Bihari Dubey, was informed that the spread of Covid-19 in the city has continued unabated despite efforts by the authorities to restrict it. In light of this, it was necessary to conduct door-to-door screenings of citizens of Mumbai.The state opposed the same, stating that it was not possible to replicate the Bhilwara model due to the magnitude of the population in the city. After hearing the submissions, while appreciating the petitioner’s approach, the court said it was not inclined to give directions for door-to-door screening in Mumbai as the population of Mumbai could not be compared to Bhilwara and it was practically impossible to carry out the suggested screening.“The PIL petition lacks particulars of the population in Bhilwara. It does not even refer to any feature in Bhilwara that is identical or has close resemblance with Mumbai. Having regard to the testing times arising out of the pandemic, resources may be scarce for such door to door testing,” said chief justice Datta. “Even otherwise, no guidelines and/or advisory of the World Health Organization or the Indian Council of Medical Research have been brought to our notice, which requires the official respondents to carry out door-to-door testing of the residents,” he added.The court rejected the plea, stating that the PIL petition is “misconceived and is liable to be dismissed”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-door-to-door-screening-for-covid-19/story-yVUVLvgRoZVV1MK4BaWYzL.html

The government, however, said that it could not give rations to wandering tribals as they do not have ration cards.The affidavit filed by the state was in response to a petition filed by social activist Vanita Chavan from Pune to provide rations to wandering tribals during the lockdown period. The state said the petition could not be fulfilled as there was a system in place for the distribution of food grain and oil under the ration system. To avail of the same, an individual has to have a ration card issued by the local ration office or any other ration office.“As the wandering tribals do not have ration cards, during the lockdown the state is providing cooked meals for migrants, homeless and needy at specified food camps in each district, which the tribals can benefit from,” said assistant government pleader Bhupesh Samant. Samant further informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AA Sayed that the state of Maharashtra was implementing the National Food Security Act diligently. The Act stipulates that anyone holding a valid ration card is eligible to get rations. Samant said that the state had entered into an agreement with 11 states which allowed people from these states living in Maharashtra to get rations based on ration cards issued to them by their respective states.After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the petitioner to file her rejoinder to the affidavit of the state and posted the matter for hearing on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-allows-porting-of-ration-cards-state-to-hc/story-AkeyKsuyB1pj1hgd8n9rLN.html

But we are not saying that we would cut their salary too.“Some of our sponsors based in Mumbai and Delhi have not been able to operate so the salary is affected.“We just managed to pay one month’s salary to the foreigners by borrowing money from another source. All the payments would be cleared once the lockdown is eased.”The pandemic has impacted every sphere of life across the world, including bringing all sporting activities to a grinding halt.“As for the incentive, we will pay it from the prize money and it will come later only,” Bose said.The nationwide lockdown has also affected Mohun Bagan’s merger with ATK, who have acquired a majority stake of 80 per cent in the 131-year-old club.The new merged outfit was slated for a June 1 launch.“We will have to wait. There has been no development so far and everything is delayed now,” he concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/mohun-bagan-players-want-dues-to-be-cleared-at-earliest-club-says-wait-till-restrictions-are-lifted/story-jz8tmSqYNrt9erTSoHsiHJ.html

He told the police that he fell asleep and rammed the vehicle into the divider.Sadar station house officer inspector Jaspal Singh said the bus did not have a permit and at least 50 passengers were on the 52-seater bus, which means social distancing norms were not being followed. The driver told the police that he had ferried some passengers from Uttrakhand to Jammu and on his way back, he picked up these migrants.The labourers told the police that they were charged Rs 1000 each for the journey till Uttar Pradesh.

12-05-2020||Chandigarh||PRTC incurs Rs 36 crore loss during lockdown, stares at financial crisis||The state-run Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) has managed to survive a decade-long financial crisis but the ongoing lockdown has once again taken a toll on PRTC’s exchequer.The PRTC has faced revenue loss of around Rs 36 crore in the 42-day long lockdown so far. The average per day loss is pegged at around Rs 85 lakh. The PRTC only came back on track last year, both financially and institutionally, after it started recording operational profit for the first time in a decade.Just before the state government disbanded the public transport service in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic on March 20, the corporation recorded a daily income of Rs 1.40 crore. Its monthly income has been estimated to be around 42 crore.PRTC’s deputy controller (finance) Prem Chand said since the lockdown, the corporation had incurred an estimated loss of Rs 80 lakh per day.“The figure is calculated after deducting the operational cost (including maintenance and expenses on diesel) from the last generated per day income of Rs 1.40 crore,” he said.The deputy controller said since they had not generated any income for the last 40 days, they had struggled to meet committed expenses, amounting Rs 46 crore per month, during the lockdown. One of the officials, seeking anonymity, said the corporation had exhausted its savings and funds in paying salaries and pensions to its employees for the months of March and April. “The financial situation is so grim that the PRTC wil not be able to meet its committed liabilities in the coming months,” the official said. Meanwhile, PRTC chairperson KK Sharma said the current period could be termed as ‘golden era’ of the PRTC, but there were some tough days ahead for the corporation due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We will chalk out a strategy once the situation has normalised. It will be a huge challenge to bring PRTC’s finances back to where they were before the lockdown,” he said. Sharma said, at present, they were helping the government with logistics. In the past two years, besides tapping an increase in daily receipt and monopoly routes, image-building had helped the corporation generate a sizeable profit.For the first time, in past one decade, the PRTC was running its full fleet of 1,073 buses under its nine depots –Ludhiana, Kapurthala, Chandigarh, Patiala, Bathinda, Budhlada, Barnala, Faridkot and Sangrur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/prtc-incurs-rs-36-crore-loss-during-lockdown-stares-at-financial-crisis/story-Ejfr6uKjeGQWOMixYZ7T8O.html

There was no police force to control the situation. When the crowd turns frenzy it becomes tough to control it,” he said while revealing that he faced similar situation at the recent ‘Brahm bhoj’ of BJP leader when a local corporator misbehaved with him on the request of maintaining social distancing.“Huge crowd had turned up at the crematorium to pay last respect to Shukla whose body was draped in BJP flag. MPs, MLAs and ministers arrived in cars from as far as Azamgarh, Mau and Varanasi. Some were not even wearing masks,” said an attendee, not willing to be named.Barhalganj SHO, Ram Agya Singh, said “It is not so that the police did not try to enforce social distancing. On our request, many went back from the site while other stayed.”As per lockdown guidelines, a limited gathering of 20-25 people is allowed at the funeral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lockdown-notwithstanding-over-2-000-attend-last-rites-of-bjp-leader/story-clSJPqLUcWTEs0LbUSuxgM.html

Since many of them were coming from red or orange zones it is essential to ensure their proper medical checkups and that they follow the home quarantine norms,” Thakur said.He said a ‘Nigah’ programme has been launched to keep watch on people coming from other states. “Panchayat pradhans must ensure that they keep vigil on people arriving in their areas. They along with ASHA workers and health staff should visit the houses of such persons before their arrival to educate the families about social distancing,” he said.The CM also appreciated efforts of panchayat functionaries in motivating people to download ‘Aarogya Setu App’ and distribution of masks and ration to poor. He also urged them to ensure proper sanitisation of their panchayats to check outbreak of diseases.Thakur said they should also educate people not to stigmatise the Covid-19 patients. “Our fight is against the virus and not the infected person,” he said.“All panchayat pradhans must help families who have limited accommodation to ensure proper social distancing by providing them isolated accommodation in community centres, panchayat ghar and mahila mandal bhawans,” the CM said.He said proper vigil should be kept on these persons to ensure that they do not jump from home quarantine. “If a person is found not following the home quarantine norms, the matter should be brought before the district administration so that he can be kept under institutional quarantine,” he added.The CM said elected representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions must also come forward to start various developmental activities in their respective panchayats. He said work under MNREGA should be expedited but at the same time it must be ensured that proper social distancing norms were followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchayati-raj-representatives-playing-key-role-in-fight-against-covid-19-jai-ram/story-EEjhIUZLJEcWEMEyKbNuJO.html
12-05-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand invites suggestions for reviving tourism sector post Covid-19 lockdown||The Uttarakhand government is working on a strategy to revive tourism, which is one of the major revenue-earning sectors of the Himalayan state, post lockdown. The state annually attracts over 3.5 crore tourists and pilgrims.The state tourism department has invited suggestions from hoteliers and resort owners on measures that could be taken to revive the industry, officials said on Tuesday. On Monday during the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers, Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat had spoken about the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the tourism industry in the state. He had requested the PM to allow gradual restart of tourism by allowing it in certain areas of the green zones.Elaborating on this, state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said, “The government is definitely working on how to revive tourism as it is time the bread and butter sector for us. We are working on certain plans on how to do it in phases, especially in the green zone areas after the lockdown is lifted.”Maharaj said, “We have involved the people directly associated in the industry, like hotel and resort owners, by inviting suggestions from them. We have already received some suggestions which we are contemplating while chalking out our strategy.”The government has already said that it is planning to issue sanitisation certificates to hotels on the lines of Singapore to assure the guests that the hotel is sanitised and poses no health safety risk for them. “I have requested the chief minister to open the temples in green zones areas which will help in bringing daily life back on track,” said Maharaj. Earlier on Monday evening, state tourism department secretary Dilip Jawalkar , during a meeting with district tourism development officers to discuss the issue, said, “Department is planning to give some relaxations to hoteliers and resort owners considering the losses due to the pandemic.”“We may give concessions in the payment of bills for power and water to them for the lockdown period as the businesses have been totally shut down. We are also focussing on effective implementation of the state’s Veer Chandra Singh Garhwali Self-employment scheme to revive the tourism sector,” said Jawalkar. Though the Uttarakhand government is working on plans to revive tourism in state but people involved in the industry believe there will be “no business for at least next six months.”Surendra Pal, general secretary, Corbett hotel and resort association said, “Despite all the revival efforts, we can see no business for next few months, till at least September.”Pal said, “The hotel and resort industry which has been majorly affected by the pandemic will have to go under an overhaul for new infrastructure and training of staff to adhere with sanitisation measures as an effect of this pandemic. It will take time and resources and won’t be an easy task.”Pal, who is also a member of Uttaranchal hotel association, however, said, “We will not bow down and prepare accordingly to revive the industry as this is our livelihood and of all other people related to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-invites-suggestions-for-reviving-tourism-sector-post-covid-19-lockdown/story-Ici1lKotHHsWaLGnKeo4BK.html

The infected people are mainly fruit and vegetable vendors, grocery shop owners and those working in dairies and medicine shops. The first corona case among supply chain people was of a fruit vendor in Naveen Mandi of T P Nagar area in first week of May. He later died during treatment in a Delhi hospital.District surveillance officer Dr Vishwas Choudhary admitted that infection in people associated with supply chain is a matter of great concern. Citing example of positive cases in Ravindrapuri of Sadar area here, he said “Twenty-two members of a family got infected after coming in contact with the fruit seller who later died during treatment.” Moe than two dozen Covid-19 cases have been detected in Ravindrapuri alone so far. Dr Chowdhary said pool tests were conducted in Mandi and many vendors, shopkeepers and those who came in their contacts had tested positive and their numbers were still growing. A vegetable vendor in Hastinapur and an employee in a medical shop in Daurala area were also found positive along with a constable of Lisari gate police station on Monday. “We are keeping a close watch on testing of samples those associated with supply chain and making them aware of following social distancing and also asking them to use masks at their workplace,” Dr Choudhary said. Taking note of the situation, the district administration has shifted retail vegetable market to two locations on the outskirts of the city where shopkeepers are observing social distancing. Shopkeepers and vendors have also been asked to frequently use sanitiser, wear masks and follow other lockdown norms to protect themselves from the deadly virus. So far, 14 people have died of corona in the district. Dr Tanuraj Sirohi, former president, Indian Medical Association’s Meerut unit, said tracing contacts of people in supply chain was a tedious task because they dealt with a number of people everyday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/growing-covid-19-cases-among-supply-chain-people-a-big-worry-in-meerut/story-I1jVsCbJFyPORaiHtM8GXL.html

They have asked for stern action against those responsible for the alleged negligence.CPI (M) leader Sanjay Chauhan said that as per information, the victim had sustained injuries after he fell in the quarantine centre. “His life could have been saved had he been rushed to the hospital on time,” Chauhan said.“This incident shows that the quarantine facilities set up by the state government are not up to the mark and hospitals and health institutions are not ready to deal with Covid-19 and other diseases,” the CPI (M) leader said.Stating that Bilaspur didn’t have ample facilities for the MP man’s treatment, Chauhan asked, “Why was he referred to IGMCH only after his condition deteriorated and not before. He was treated inhumanely at IGMCH.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpi-m-demands-probe-into-mp-man-s-death-at-bilaspur-quarantine-centre/story-iPlzqRCtBz6X3bcbmu2muI.html

However, no casualties were reported as the building was empty due to the ongoing nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. The blaze occurred at around 9:45 am in the two top floors of the six-storey building that belongs to Kumar Infra India Limited, located near Chopda Court in the city. The fire brigade reached the spot around 10 am with four water tankers. One water tanker each was later sent by Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation and Century Rayon.“The fire was caught around 9:45 am, we reached the spot around 10am and took almost two hours to douse the fire. The fifth and sixth floor of the building had to be cooled down completely for half an hour after the fire was doused. The reason for the fire is not clear. However, the building has remained shut for a long time now,” said Sandip Asekar, Sub Officer, Fire Department, Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation.

While PG medical aspirants in Maharashtra were worried about having to surrender their all India quota (AIQ) seat even before being assured of the release of the state seat allocation list, the MCC on Tuesday afternoon clarified that students now have time till May 18 to surrender their seats. The AIQ seats is 15% of the total seats in each state and students from outside a particular state can apply for these places.“Keeping in view that many state counselling have been delayed/not completed in schedule time due to Covid-19 outbreak, it has been decided that students who were allotted a college in round one (of AIQ) to resign from their allotted seats by 5pm on May 18,” stated a circular released by MCC. The original date for surrendering seats was May 12, 5pm.As per rules, PG medical aspirants who have already bagged a seat through the AIQ) have a choice to either stick to the institute already allotted through AIQ, or release the seat in the hope of a seat in another institute under the state quota closer home. At present, the status of the first list by the state Common Entrance Test (CET) cell is uncertain because CET cell authorities are still reworking the seat matrix, said an official.“As per law, the AIQ seats are allocated first and if students want to be eligible for state quota seat, they have to surrender their AIQ seat. Anyone would prefer a seat in one of the top Institutes in Maharashtra but the uncertainty of the first CET list is unnerving,” said Rishabh Jain, a PG medical aspirant from Mumbai. In a circular released late in the third week of April, the state CET cell had requested state medical and dental institutes to share contact details of staff handling admissions and also make arrangements for a payment portal online so that students can pay the fees and confirm admissions once the seat allotment list is released on April 24, after 6pm. This process was held by the Bombay high court following a petition that highlighted discrepancies in quota allocation of seats.“Once the seat matrix is ready, we will release a seat allocation list and students will have the option of competing the admission process online this time, appropriate provisions have been made accordingly,” added the CET cell official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/pg-medical-admissions-students-in-maharashtra-have-time-till-may-18-to-surrender-aiq-seat/story-0PjmfxA9N7uTezNVXDxrzO.html
12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown came as a blessing in disguise for Punjab ex-DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in 29-year-old abduction and torture case||Former Punjab Police chief DGP Sumedh Singh Saini was on Monday granted anticipatory bail in a 29-year-old case related to the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a junior engineer at the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco), but not before the court questioned the timing of the first information report (FIR) against him and six other cops.All seven were booked after 29 years of the incident at Mataur police station in Mohali district.“The timing chosen by the complainant to appear at this time of high distress raises a serious doubt in the mind of this court,” additional district and sessions judge Monika Goyal said in the order.“The whole police force is involved in managing the Covid-19 outbreak. There are so many things to handle such as the patients, persons stranded in other states and migrant labourers leaving Punjab, but despite being busy, Punjab has hastily registered an FIR in a 29-year-old case when the matter has even once attained finality by orders of the Supreme Court,” reads the order.“Covid-19 has brought the strongest nations to their knees, but present complainant Palwinder Singh Multani, who has fear of life and safety of his family since 1991, has chosen this time to come out and lodge the FIR, when prior to this, he had not taken any step in regard with disappearance of his brother,” read the 33-page order of the court.The court said, “The Supreme Court and high court are trying their best to de-congest the jails due to Covid-19. The purpose of investigation will suffice if Saini is directed to join investigation and to cooperate properly. Thus, the present is a fit case where he is entitled to anticipatory bail.”RESTRAINED FROM LEAVING HOUSEReferring to the argument that former DGP Saini tried to flee from Chandigarh to evade his arrest during the curfew, the court said, “It is not believable that Saini had travelled from Chandigarh up to the Himachal border without being intercepted anywhere by Punjab Police.”The court said that the allegations made are only based on news reports but “still in order to restrain the applicant from leaving his place of residence, adequate conditions need to be imposed.”SAINI GOT PROTECTION FROM HC Fearing his false implication in criminal cases, Saini had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court for protection. “In October 2018, the high court had given him protection from any arrest in cases pertaining to incidents of the period when he held the posts of state vigilance head, inspector general of police, intelligence, Punjab, and director general of police, Punjab, by giving him prior notice of one week,” said Saini’s counsel.“The prosecution is trying to take the benefit of this fact as this case pertains to the tenure of Saini as SSP, Chandigarh, 29 years ago,” the court observed.WHY CASE AT MOHALI?“It is alleged that his escape has been shown only to cover up the custodial death, but still the offence alleged is committed either at Chandigarh or at Qadian. Thus, it is not understandable as to how the present case has been lodged at Mataur police station (in Mohali),” the court questioned.The case registered in Mataur was based on the disclosures made by Gurmeet Singh alias Pinki in Outlook magazine in 2015, through which complainant Palwinder Singh Multani said that he came to know about the details of torture meted out to his brother and his subsequent elimination.“The complainant had not taken any action till May 6, 2020, specially when Saini had already retired in June 2018. Thus, no explanation is coming as to why the present complainant had kept mum for such a long time,” the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-came-as-a-blessing-in-disguise-for-punjab-ex-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini-in-29-year-old-abduction-and-torture-case/story-N6viuyfxaPNxl5E5x5SLFM.html
12-05-2020||Delhi||A thrifty idea: Will flea market shopping change post lockdown?||Flea markets like Kamla Nagar and Sarojini Nagar, are always buzzing with people looking for best steals at throwaway prices, even on week days. Shopping at markets, where social distancing seems to be impossible, will never be the same again for any of us. From cheap clothing to affordable accessories, the trend of street style shopping in these markets, will be changed drastically post lockdown.Badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, market associations have been chalking out strategies to reopen after the lockdown while maintaining safety.Naresh Chawla, a member of Kamla Nagar Market association, says, “As retailers, we have to make sure that our market and the shops are well sanitized. Sanitization is the top priority for us, especially in a market like Kamla Nagar. We are planning on appointing guards as well to avoid the rush in the market and maintain some discipline. Businesses will not start before July, because it will take time for customers to get to the streets for shopping. Even after that, we do not know if there will be a demand or not. We have plans on strictly maintaining social distancing in Kamla Nagar market, but the picture will be clear once we reopen and people start coming to the markets.”Echoing similar sentiments, Rajesh Chopra, member of the Sarojini Nagar market association, has planned on keeping masks at every shop and to give to those customers, who won’t be wearing a mask.“As of now, we have planned to make different entry and exits to the market. No shopkeeper will be allowed to sell products without a mask and gloves. We are working out on maintaining a distance between customers inside the shops. Hopefully, it will all be sorted once we reopen,” says Chopra.Emphasising on the need to bring back normalcy in the market, Chawla, says, “The biggest challenge any market will face will be the fear in the minds of people. The fear factor will hold back people from visiting markets. It will take at least 1-2 months to even bring back 50 percent normalcy. But then we have to open markets at some point in time.”Another hub for shoppers, Lajpat Nagar is also all set to reopen after the lockdown while taking all the precautions to maintain social distancing.Atul Batla, member of Lajpar Nagar Market association, says, “We will be following the government’s order to maintain social distancing once the lockdown is lifted. The markets will reopen keeping in mind all the guidelines. All precautions will be taken from the part of the shopkeepers. We will inform the customers also about the directives that we will be following and ask them to follow the same in order to maintain social distancing.Wherein, shoppers on the other hand feel that they are not ready to step into crowded lanes even after the lockdown is lifted.Sonakshi Madan, a DU student, says,“Mostly after college, I used to hang out at Kamla Nagar with my friends for some street shopping as everything is pretty cheap there. Visiting street markets again will take a long time now. I don’t even know if I am ready at all to step out of the house.”Another shopper and a resident of Karol Bagh, Harjeet Kaur feels that shifting to online options as will be safer.She says, “I am scared to even step out on the road. I don’t know, how long it will take for me to get back to street shopping. There are hundreds of people that visit one single shop, touch the products and there is always going to be a fear of getting the virus. Online shopping is the best bet. Though, it cannot be compared to the fun at street markets but then we cannot risk our lives by visiting crowded spaces.”Follow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-thrifty-idea-will-flea-market-shopping-change-post-lockdown/story-LfeYaQ19TXJRSypQ8MB3UO.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects pre-arrest bail pleas of DHFL’s Wadhawan brothers||Bombay high court on Tuesday rejected two separate anticipatory bail pleas each filed by Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan of DHFL Group in the proceedings initiated against them by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Yes Bank scam and the purported diversion of funds from Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL).The Wadhawan brothers are accused of diverting about Rs 4122 crore from the General Provident Fund (GPF) and Central Provident Fund (CPF) deposits of UPPCL to their company. They are also accused of fraudulently diverting funds to the tune of Rs 12,700 crore from DHFL’s accounts to the firms or companies beneficially owned by them and further diverting the funds to other companies.The brothers are also named as accused in Yes Bank bribery case. It is alleged that former CEO of the bank, Rana Kapoor, had entered into a criminal conspiracy with the Wadhawans for extending financial assistance to DHFL through Yes Bank in return for “substantial undue benefits” to himself and his family members through companies held by them.The Wadhawans moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail in both the cases after the special courts in Mumbai rejected their pre-arrest bail pleas on April 28. Their lawyers argued that all the documents concerned are seized and there was no need for their custodial interrogation.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for ED, had opposed their pleas contending that the amount of EPF cannot be invested in any other institution except scheduled commercial banks and despite this, more than 50% of the amount was invested in DHFL. Singh strenuously opposed the pre-arrest bail pleas saying their custodial interrogation was necessary to ascertain the money trail and the properties acquired by them from proceeds of the crime. He also pointed out that there are about 79 companies formed by Wadhawans and they have misappropriated thousands of crores.As regards the Yes Bank scam, the additional solicitor had argued that the bank had invested about Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of the scam-hit DHFL and the Wadhawans had in return paid about a sum of Rs 750 crore to the Rana family.“Thus, there was layering from both sides,” Singh said opposing their pleas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-pleas-of-dhfl-s-wadhawan-brothers/story-gri4lNMzJyEJTCmjiPijbP.html

Appropriate measures, including augmented testing, isolation of all contacts, and forceful enforcement of the lockdown, are mandatory to prevent the exact scenario as seen in the west,” he said, adding that the coronavirus is exceptionally infective and highly lethal.Dr Ray, a cardiologist and cardiac electrophysiologist who has also been a Professor of medicine and public health at multiple universities in the US and India, expressed shock that instead of doctors, a committee has been asked to provide COVID-19 death certificates.“Hushing up such infection and not taking appropriate precautions like isolation would lead to death and destruction, which I certainly know that you would not like as the Chief Minister of my state,” he added.In India, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased to 67,152, after a record number of 4,213 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours till Monday 8 AM, while the death toll rose by 97 to 2,206, the Union Health Ministry said in its daily update.In West Bengal, there were at least 1,939 confirmed COVID-19 cases as on Monday.

12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Bureaucrats appointed to monitor crop procurement in Haryana: Dushyant Chautala||Senior bureaucrats have been appointed as nodal officers for monitoring procurement process for mustard and wheat, Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said on Monday. To ensure that the procurement goes on smoothly, officers of Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary level have been appointed as nodal officers for on-the-spot grievance redressal, a statement quoted him as saying. Besides, all Deputy Commissioners have deputed a procurement officer and an accounting clerk at every mandi and procurement centre for the convenience of the farmers, he added. Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, said a cash credit of Rs 22,000 crore has already been arranged to ensure timely release of payment to farmers for wheat crop. On opposition Congress alleging mismanagement in procurement process, he said that some leaders of the opposition parties are unable to digest the fact that the procurement process is going smoothly despite lockdown and are making statements in the media to mislead the farmers. Chautala said that as per the information given on ‘Meri Fasal – Mera Byora’ portal, a farmer can bring as much yield as he wants to sell in the mandis as there is no restriction. The entire 1,600 quintals of wheat produce of a farmer was purchased in Panipat mandi recently, he said, citing an example, while hitting out at the opposition which has alleged that crop lifting is slow and not entire produce of farmers is being procured. He said as soon as the wheat procured from the mandis is lifted and sent to the godowns, the payment of both the farmers and the ‘Arthiyas’ or commision agents is made on the third day of lifting. Chautala, whose party JJP is a coalition partner of the BJP in the state, said that in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, arrangements have been made for sanitizers, masks, and soaps, among others, in the mandis and social distancing norms are being followed by all. He said GPS has been installed in all the vehicles engaged in the lifting process of foodgrains. The vehicles which enter the mandi and procurement centres are sanitized first. He informed that the number of mandis for wheat, which was initially at 389, have been increased to 1,895 after addition of 1,507 new centres, while 112 new procurement centres have been added for mustard. Similarly, 30 mandis or procurement centres have been established for gram. He said that wheat is being procured at a minimum support price of Rs 1,925 per quintal, mustard at Rs 4,425 per quintal and gram at Rs 4,875 per quintal. Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, Sanjeev Kaushal said that 62.44 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of wheat has been procured from 3,99,432 farmers in the state in the last 19 days. As much as 5.69 lakh MT of mustard has been procured from 2,10,319 farmers.

We start the day by queuing up to get food donated by people. It is humiliation we face every day, which has crushed our self-respect.

12-05-2020||City||Inmates at Machhiwara quarantine home allege inhuman living conditions||Alleging inhuman conditions at the quarantine centre at Machhiwara School, the inmates there uploaded a video on social media, stating that the cops on duty had bolted the doors from outside and were not letting them out even to use the washroom. They said that as the cops did not pay heed to their repeated pleas to open the door, they were forced to urinate in the buckets placed inside the rooms. It was only after the video started widely circulating on the social media that heads started rolling. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Samrala) HS Mann, tehsildar Navdeep Singh Bhogal and Naib Tehsildar Surinder Kumar reached at quarantine centre and transferred the cops deployed there with immediate effect.They also assured the inmates that they won’t face such a problem again. “People under quarantine are under the care of the police and the administration. Cops were deployed here so that no one leaves the place. But they should be allowed to come out to use the washrooms,” the DSP said, adding that an inquiry had been marked against one the cops at the centre. As many as 29 people came from other states and those who had come in contact with Covid-19 positive people have been placed under quarantine at Shri Shankar Das Senior Secondary School in Machhiwara since May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/inmates-at-machhiwara-quarantine-home-allege-inhuman-living-conditions/story-c1Sr4Tm2MuDelPUdgwA8OP.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||No separate quarantine facility for Arthur Road inmates, as Mumbai Police says Mahul structure can’t be used||Are the authorities of the already overcrowded Arthur Road prison, which has 184 cases of Covid-19, working according to the guidelines laid down by the World Health Organization (WHO) for prisons?The WHO guidelines state, “People in prisons and other places of detention should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the outside community, without discrimination on the grounds of their legal status.”The guidelines direct prison and other detention authorities to ensure that the human rights of those in their custody are respected, that inmates are not cut off from the outside world, and most importantly that they have access to information and adequate healthcare provision.The patients who had contracted the virus were reported in three of the 16-20 barracks, each expanding in an area of 20ftx60ft. “Circle numbers 3 and 10 have been made quarantine centres to house positive patients,” said a jail official, adding that the situation looks grim. “It is not possible to maintain social distancing inside a barrack which was built to accommodate 50 inmates but now houses 200-250 inmates,” the official added.The Arthur Road prison authorities, however, said that they have been taking measures to contain the spread of the virus within the prison premises. Sanjay Chahande, principle secretary for water supply and sanitation, who is also holding the additional charge of home department (prisons and appeals), said, “We have kept the infected inmates in separate isolation circles and have been sending the symptomatic Covid-positive inmates to hospital for treatment, as per the instructions from a team of doctors from JJ Hospital, who are looking after the cases inside the jail.”However, when the city began seeing the first set of cases in March, the jail authorities had written to the courts, asking them to release the inmates involved in minor and moderate offences or grant temporary bail to those accused of heinous crimes. After the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities released 435 prisoners from 43 prisons across the state on emergency parole.The Arthur Road prison authorities had stated that the prison did not have the wherewithal to handle a situation in case of an outbreak, and that social distancing would be impossible among the inmates, as the prison was built to house only 800 people. Later, after some inmates were tested positive for coronavirus, the local arms department of Mumbai Police was asked to conduct a survey and help transfer the coronavirus-positive inmates to a vacant building build by the slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) at Mahul near Chembur.The local arms department however, refused to comply with the jail authorities, and wrote a letter (a copy of which is with HT), citing lack of proper healthcare infrastructure, electricity, food and beds, and stated that the locals in Mahul had opposed the use of the building as a treatment centre.“Inspection conducted of the empty Mhada [Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority] buildings at Mahul village, as suggested by you for treatment of the 77 corona-positive prisoners, reveals that provision for electricity and fans has been made only on the fourth and fifth floors of these buildings. But, no provision has been made for food, beds, grills on doors and windows for security purpose and doctors and other staff for treatment has not been made. Also, no appointment of the head of the centre, in whose custody these 77 inmates will be placed for treatment, has not been made,” stated the letter written by deputy commissioner of police (local arms), Nandkumar Thakur.The letter also goes on to state that there is no provision for potable water, and that doctors, paramedics and other staff have not been appointed to treat the prisoners at Mahul, nor is there any provision for medication and medical equipment.“It is extremely necessary that treatment is provided to these 77 prisoners, since they are corona-positive, immediately after they are shifted at the said place, reads the letter. But, as no basic facilities, as mentioned above, have been provided at the said place, it will result in disturbing the mental condition of the corona positive prisoners and eventually may lead to a law and order situation,” read the letter from Thakur.The letter also points out at the lack of security if the prisoners were to be lodged at Mahul. “Since the complete responsibility of providing security cover for the treatment centre is of Mumbai Police and the force is facing severe shortage of police officers and staff, with many of them being affected by the virus, there will be limited manpower available for security of the treatment centre, and is therefore necessary to have iron grills fixed on windows and the door on the fourth floor and flood lights around the entire building,” the letter stated.Sanjay Kumar, who holds the additional charge of additional chief secretary (home), said that the more cases are detected owing to mass testing. “We moved a file for mass testing, and the chief secretary too responded [in favour] for the testing. The cases are coming in large numbers because we insisted on mass testing. We have decided to shift the new Covid-19 patients cases to make-shift jails and safer places [quarantine centres].”However, until the time of going to press, the prison authorities were unaware of any such development.The first case of Covid-19 was reported on May 5 after a 45-year-old patient, who suffered a paralytic attack, was admitted to JJ Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, 350 prisoners were also tested for Covid-19 but no new swabs have been taken for testing after that, the authorities said.HT asked Chahande if contact tracing is being conducted within jail premises, to which he replied, “That’s not our priority today. The government’s priority is to provide medication to the infected inmates in the jail and also we are also taking more efforts to release maximum possible inmates on parole to de-congest the prison.”Director general (prisons) SN Pandey did not respond to repeated phone calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-separate-quarantine-facility-for-arthur-road-inmates-as-mumbai-police-says-mahul-structure-can-t-be-used/story-SAKNDUYwee6TNjWGPuneaJ.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||Sealing areas with higher Covid-19 cases or 2-day work week with lockdown can contain virus, shorten epidemic duration: Analysis||As the Centre and states discuss strategies to reopen the economy as the deadline of May 17 nears for lockdown 3.0, a two-member team of professors at the Chennai Mathematical Institute and Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have drawn up a mathematical analysis that suggests sealing areas with high number of infected individuals or introducing a two-day work week with a lockdown can suppress the transmission of the virus that causes Covid-10 and shorten the duration of the epidemic. Both these measures combined with “tracing contacts and their contacts and sealing” (TC2S) reduces the virus’ attack rate by more than 30% compared to the current contact tracing approach.With Bengaluru as the study area, V Vinay, co-author and co-founder of tech start-up Ati Motors, with Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, a professor at the department of computer science and automaton, IISc, performed simulations of different post-lockdown strategies on the multi-lattice small world mathematical model.“Lockdowns, though an effective policy for containment, imposes a heavy cost on the economy as it enforces extreme social distancing measures on the whole population. Unemployment is an inevitable outcome of economic downturn and lockdowns have resulted in significant job losses,” said Vinay. “There is now a growing view among scientists and many world leaders that rapid suppression of Covid-19 transmission must be the way forward. Our study provides alternatives to lockdown which are either more targeted or allows partial opening of the economy,” he said.Their analysis shows that sealing only the infected wards along with TC2S reduces the duration of the epidemic when compared without advanced contact tracing. For mild lockdown, the length of epidemic stands at 274 days with TC2S as against 480 days without TC2S. Additionally, the epidemic’s time frame with and without TC2S in wards where more than three persons have been infected is 65 and 124 days.TC2S is a two-tier strategy that not only involves identifying and testing all individuals who came in contact with a patient — as is the current method — but also tracing their contacts, which would subsequently result in targeting asymptomatic individuals.Similarly, a two-day work week (with stringent lockdown for remaining five days) is likely to result in 1,345 deaths per million with the epidemic lasting for 675 days. But this measure when coupled with TC2S leads to a drastic decrease of 34 deaths per million and the epidemic ending in 107 days.The most preferred strategy, according to the paper, is hotspot surveillance, which not only lowers attack rates, but is also much faster in destroying the virus. If ward level sealing and opening (WSO) is introduced early enough, it is possible that the pandemic can be suppressed in the early stages in less time than currently-practiced lockdowns.For instance, the model’s estimate on the duration of the epidemic is 115 days with 51 deaths per million during a lockdown. However, WSO along with TC2S results in a decline both in the length of the epidemic to 65 days with a death toll of 18 individuals per million.The researchers said while WSO opens the economy much more than the two-day week policy, investment in testing could prove to be a challenge, especially in densely-populated urban wards in metropolitan cities. “The success of WSO policy crucially depends on the ability to test all residents in the hotspots... If there is substantial shortage of testing kits making WSO unviable then one can consider the alternative policy of opening the economy for two days a week. For both the interventions require contact tracing,” the paper reads.Pointing out the lack of resources needed to implement TC2S that makes WSO more effective, Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist at PD Hinduja Hospital said WSO appears more feasible as compared to the two-day week alternative. Dr Pinto was not involved in the study.“The success of WSO also depends on limiting movements across wards, and this might be labour intensive and difficult to implement (as opposed to movement between cities/districts). Reports from the zoning exercises so far suggest that the red zones are also the ones contributing disproportionately more to economic activity, and I’m not sure the model accounts for this,” said Dr Pinto.On the alternative of the two-day work week, Dr Pinto said, “Our limited experience (with alcohol shops, for example) suggests that limiting access to a few hours a day (or a few days a week) is likely to lead to overcrowding during the periods in which economic activities are opened up, and will therefore be counterproductive. The model will have to take this into account.”“Suppress, and not just flatten: Strategies for Rapid Suppression of COVID19 transmission in Small World Communities” was uploaded last week on medRxiv, a preprint server for health sciences operated by US-based Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The paper has also been sent to office of the principal scientific advisor to the government of India, K VijayRaghavan.The authors have stated their conclusions are about the relative effectiveness of various strategies and not about absolute predictability. The study has also not considered issues related to civil liberties, and economic hardships of the proposed interventions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sealing-areas-with-higher-covid-19-cases-or-2-day-work-week-with-lockdown-can-contain-virus-shorten-epidemic-duration-analysis/story-4XQBmv4KaJ4yBoZmgEI51I.html
12-05-2020||City||Homeopathy pills for patients from two Mumbai wards with most cases||After hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to adopt homeopathy to prevent the outbreak of Covid-19 among the residents of two worst-affected wards in the city. The civic body said all asymptomatic patients in the red zones of G North and K West wards will be provided with Arsenicum Album 30 – homeopathy pills – free of cost. This decision comes after the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), under the ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy), recommended the use of Arsenicum Album 30 as a prophylaxis (preventive medicine) against coronavirus. Earlier, HT had reported that BMC was consulting homeopathic doctors over the proposed medicine.On Monday, Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer, BMC, issued a circular regarding the implementation of the plan. She directed the ward officers of G North and K West to give the medicine to asymptomatic patients. “States like Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have already started giving the medicines to their patients and haven’t observed any side effects. So, we too decided to administer the medicines in wards with high number of Covid cases,” she said. Arsenicum Album 30 is a known immune-modulator, widely prescribed for influenza-like-illnesses. Dr Ajit Funde, associated with Maharashtra Homoeopathic Council, said the pill was showing promising results in other states. “Just like anti-malaria drugs—hydroxychloroquine, Arsenicum Album 30 has proven to be effective,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/homeopathy-pills-for-patients-from-two-mumbai-wards-with-most-cases/story-4L0m00P3RGuADPOSNf1IzI.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||Respite for farmers: A brick-and-mortar storage for vegetables designed by IIT-B alumnus||It’s a humble, brick-and-mortar storage facility, with a covering on top, but this simple device, designed by a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B), is helping farmers beat the effects of the nationwide lockdown. The cooling unit, which only needs water and does not run on electricity, keeps vegetables fresh for longer, which means farmers don’t have to sell their produce at throwaway prices. Named the Subjee Cooler, the cooling unit has been designed by RuKart Technologies, founded by Vikas Jha. “Subjee Cooler works on the principle of evaporative cooling and does not require any utilities. However, it requires watering, once daily. The cooling chamber temperature is lower than the ambient temperature by a margin of 5-15°C (depending on ambient relative humidity) and maintains a high relative humidity of above 85-90% inside the cooling chamber. The low temperature and high humidity inside the chamber preserve the (non-tuber) vegetable crop for five to eight days,” said Jha, a 2016 graduate of IIT-B.RuKart Technologies — with the help of the trade union Self-Employed Women’s Association — has set up 66 such cooling units for farmers in Bihar, Odisha, and Maharashtra. It’s working on an order for 200 more instalments, said Jha.During the lockdown, the agricultural sector has been among the worst hit. Farmers with no storage facilities have been compelled to undersell crops at throwaway prices. However, Praphula Kido, a tomato and cabbage cultivator from Sundargarh in northwest Odisha, is among those who got good prices for his tomatoes, thanks to the Subjee Cooler at his one-acre farm. He now earns Rs 25-30 per kilogram (kg) of tomatoes as opposed to the Rs 7-8/kg that many other farmers have to settle for since their produce is not as fresh.Jha said farmers with Subjee Coolers are able to charge prices that are 20–30% higher than others. “Earlier a farmer would harvest vegetables only once in a week, the day before the weekly market. Now an adopter [farmer with Subjee Cooler] harvests the vegetable thrice a week and stores their produce. While our adopters are selling their produce to middlemen as well as consumers at the weekly market directly, non-adopters are selling their produce only to middlemen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/respite-for-farmers-a-brick-and-mortar-storage-for-vegetables-designed-by-iit-b-alumnus/story-DpfxitzP4pUNSvf6cS26ZI.html
12-05-2020||City||Why do civic-run hospitals in Mumbai keep bodies of Covid-19 patients longer than the 2-hour limit||While the state health department has ordered disposal of bodies of Covid-19 patients within two hours, a ground reality check by HT shows that the four major Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)-run hospitals are forced to hold the bodies longer in their morgues, mostly on humanitarian grounds.DIFFICULTIES, PROBEAccording to the department’s rules based on the guidelines of the Union health ministry, dead bodies need to be removed from the ward within 30 minutes and disposed of within two hours. Forensic experts claim the time limit is not feasible. Firstly, a large city like Mumbai gets patients from far-off areas in Thane and Navi Mumbai. In some cases, the families refuse to take the bodies, fearing infection. Also, the lockdown makes it difficult for relatives to find vehicles to reach hospitals in time. In some cases, relatives can’t reach hospitals as they either are in isolation centres or home quarantine. A case in point could be a 73-year-old woman, resident of Kalapani, who succumbed to her infection at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital on April 18. Around 2am, the family received a call from the hospital to take away the body, but her two sons, their wives and children were quarantined. One of their relatives agreed to claim the body, but couldn’t find a vehicle to reach the hospital.“We tried private vehicles and ambulances, but no one agreed to take my uncle to the hospital. We requested a neighbour who has an auto to ferry him, but he refused. We had to request the hospital to keep the body till morning,” said Rohit Kumar, 21, the grandson of the deceased patient.Currently, as of Monday, there are 14 unclaimed bodies of both Covid and non-Covid patients lying in the morgues of KEM, BYL Nair, Topiwala General Municipal Hospital also known as Sion hospital and Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital. Of these, six are in Cooper Hospital and Nair Hospitals each, one each in KEM and Sion hospital. “Most of them are from other districts and states. Due to the lockdown, the families asked us to hold the bodies. So, on humanitarian grounds, we held it for four-five days now,” said a forensic expert from Cooper Hospital.The hospitals have now initiated talks with the police to dispose of the bodies. “The relatives plead and cry on phones. They request us to allow them to see their beloved ones one last time,” said the officer.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) clearly states that hospitals can hand over bodies of suspected patients without waiting for swab reports. In some cases, forensic experts have to hold the bodies when they think further investigation is needed into the death.At Sion hospital, forensic resident doctors have been stationed at the casualty ward to screen bodies. On Tuesday, the body of a 32-year-old woman was taken to the hospital with bruise marks. When questioned, the family said, she had symptoms like coronavirus. “The on-duty doctor was suspicious of the marks so we held the body and we are waiting for her swab report. If the result is negative, we will have to conduct a post-mortem to confirm the cause of death,” said a senior doctor from the forensic department of the hospital.VIDEOS ON SOCIAL MEDIARecently, the BMC was criticised when videos on social media went viral showing Covid patients lying beside corpses in civic hospitals. In response to the videos, forensic experts said those are meant to defame the hospitals and extremely discouraging for staffers who work around-the-clock. “On a daily basis, we receive around five-eight Covid bodies. We try to quickly dispose of them, but it takes time to inform family and provide them the time. We have to take help from police to contact families as often, due to stigma, they give wrong addresses and phone numbers,” said a forensic expert from Nair Hospital.When the videos from Sion and KEM hospitals were circulated, Opposition leaders claimed the hospital morgues don’t have space to keep the bodies. A check done by HT shows that such claims are incorrect. In the past one month, the four civic-run hospitals have disposed of around 125 non-Covid unclaimed bodies to make space for Covid bodies. Of these, KEM hospital handed over 36 unclaimed bodies to police and 17 were shifted to the anatomy lab. Police disposed of another 30 unclaimed bodies from Sion hospital and 39 from Cooper hospital. Police have disposed of three bodies from Nair hospital. “We have also divided our cold storage into two— the hospital morgue has been turned into Covid and the morgue under the post-mortem centre has been kept as non-Covid. This has been done to curb any possible transmission,” said a forensic expert from the hospital. Similarly, Sion hospital has also divided their morgue into Covid and non-Covid.The Sion hospital which currently has over 250 Covid patients has preserved 16 cabins for Covid patients and 38 for non-Covid patients. Cooper Hospital has 36 cabinets for Covid and 70 for non-Covid. Nair Hospital has 32 boxes for Covid patients. But KEM hospital, which receives the most critically ill patients, has 27 cabinets in the morgue. On a daily basis, the hospital receives around eight bodies. “As of now, we have enough space, but we are trying to extend the facility,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.At Kasturba Hospital, the newly constructed morgue started functioning from Friday. Now, the hospital has a capacity to keep around 17 bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-do-civic-run-hospitals-in-mumbai-keep-bodies-of-covid-19-patients-longer-than-the-2-hour-limit/story-qwmosxR5vzFys2anNCndsO.html

12-05-2020||Delhi||International Nurses Day 2020: Delhi-NCR nurses go beyond call of duty to serve patients||“Log kaafi bura bhala kehte hain, par main koshish karti hoon ki bura na manoon (People say a lot of inappropriate things to me, but I try not to let those affect me),” says Noorie Masih, a nurse at a private hospital in Gurugram. While the country practices social distancing, nurses are bound, by the need of their profession, to put their duty ahead of their safety and work amid the present coronavirus pandemic. They might or might not have PPE kits or masks, but nothing has been able to deter their determination to serve. On International Nurses Day, May 12, we speak to some of the nurses, in Delhi-NCR, who have been involved in the fight against Covid-19, and what’s the cost of sacrifices they are making. “I stay alone in a PG accommodation, not far away from the hospital where I work,’’ adds Masih, who got married recently and her husband is in Dehradun, her hometown, miles away from her. What worries her, however, are the cases of assault on medical professionals, and she has herself been on the receiving end of remarks, from patients who she tries to tend to. “‘Stay away from us’, ‘Stand a little far’, ‘Don’t come to our shop’ are some of the things that I have heard multiple times over the last few weeks,” she says with a heavy heart. What keeps her morale up are her telephonic conversations with her husband, at the end of a long day at work. “He worries about my health and safety, but I have a job to do here, and I can’t leave,” says the determined nurse.   . . Game ChangerA post shared by  Banksy (@banksy) on May 6, 2020 at 9:50am PDT“This is a war zone; there are multiple issues for nurses and other healthcare professionals, but that won’t stop us from serving our nation,’’ says Vipin Krishnan, a nurse at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi. Krishnan, along with some fellow nurses, has been feeding the poor and the migrants in Delhi’s temporary shelters since the lockdown began. He informs, “We are providing them with dry rations, masks, sanitary napkins. Initially, in the 10 days of the lockdown being announced, we had sent over 5,000 packets of food to those in need.”Krishnan has previously held the post of general secretary of the AIIMS Nurses Union, and adds that “Many nurses working for some private hospitals are being sent home instead of a different accommodation, for quarantine. Many are being asked to foot their own bills in case they show symptoms of Covid-19. Discrimination on ground is rampant, but we are endeavouring to still do our duty in the best possible way.” Quite a few frontline workers are going beyond their line of duty to help those in need, during such times. A Delhi-based home nurse shares on condition of anonymity that she has been staying in Noida with an elderly patient, who is recuperating from paralysis. She shares that the patient’s family asked her to stay put since they didn’t want to risk having an outsider come home everyday, and adds, “It was a tough call since I have to stay away from my family and kids. But, I need the extra money since my husband won’t be paid in full in this period. I know many others who have continued to see patients. We chose this profession because it is honourable and helps us serve those in need; so the question of cribbing does not arise. But, there is one thing I have continued to do as a human being, ever since the lockdown began, I have been feeding stray dogs in the locality. They need me just as much as my patient does (smiles).’’ Follow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/international-nurses-day-2020-delhi-ncr-nurses-go-beyond-call-of-duty-to-serve-patients/story-YZOR8Niubys2gcrM7RYrwM.html

This was the first MP-bound train to leave from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which left Palghar on Sunday night and reached Meghnagar in Madhya Pradesh on Monday. As the online booking system couldn’t be accessed for two consecutive days, Gupta and Patel appealed to people on social media to contact them to manually make a list of migrants and then passed it over to the government authorities. The state government then got in touch with the MP government. “We got information that the online system of the government was not working, so we decided to help. We appealed to the people on social media to contact us and got a huge response,” said Gupta. “Though only 1,200 passengers could board the train, we are preparing a second list for Madhya Pradesh,” said Patel.The Madhya Pradesh government bore the fare expenses and did not charge the migrants, said Gupta. After the train reached Meghnagar on Monday, the MP government arranged buses to take the passengers to various districts, said Gupta.An officer from Palghar collector’s office confirmed that the online system was overloaded with around 1.90 lakh applications from migrants from various states and hence needed to be shut for two days. Meanwhile, on Monday afternoon, another train left for Jaunpur from Palghar carrying 1,200 migrants. However, the passengers had to pay ₹740 as fare, said Milind Kirtikar, station superintendent, Western Railway, Palghar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lawyer-activist-use-social-media-to-help-migrants-leave-for-mp/story-OEDe4PPm5eOxGtW86PmuXN.html
12-05-2020||City||Covid-19 patient survives suicide attempt||A 45-year-old Covid-19 positive man jumped from the third floor room of a hospital, where he was undergoing treatment, in Nalla Sopara on Saturday in a bid to attempt suicide. However, he landed on a heap of sand and sustained fracture on his leg. The patient was admitted to the hospital on April 30, and was later moved to the isolation after his condition improved. A hospital source said the man broke the glass window and jumped out even as a ward boy tried to get hold of him.A hospital spokesperson said the patient was recovering well and that his second swab test report is awaited, which the doctors are hoping would come negative. “We are unable to understand why the patient attempted the act as he was responding well to treatment he said and always had a positive attitude towards life,” he said.The spokesman further added doctors will have to carry out an operation for his fracture, but that will oly be done after his test report comes negative. Meanwhile, a case has been registered with the Nalla Sopara police about the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-patient-survives-suicide-attempt/story-2In0q0jdiiCKHrsx5RFLyK.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||54% parents won’t send kids to school for a month after lockdown is lifted: Survey||Nearly 54% parents from the city, who participated in the nationwide survey, said that they would not send their children to schools at least for a month after it re-opens and would first monitor the situation in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak. Nearly 24% parents said that they would not prefer sending their children to school at least for the next six months.The results are part of a nationwide survey conducted by ParentCircle, an online parenting platform with over 12,000 responses from parents across the country. The results revealed that parents are extremely anxious about sending their children to school even as governments across the country are hoping to resume schools from June-July. “Parents would not want to take any risk by sending their children to school even if there are a handful of active cases. Governments need to come up with an annual strategy to cope with this,” said Sandhya Rasal, a parent from Kandivli.Parents were also asked as to when they would be comfortable in sending their children for outdoor sports, birthday parties and other gatherings. Over 43% parents from the city said that they would not send their children for any sports activities at least for the next six months. The same number of parents said that they won’t make any visit to malls or movies for the entire remaining year.“An overwhelming majority of parents are worried and unsure. They are anxious and not ready to take any chances. Parents need assurance that their children will be safe in school, group activities and other public places. The onus is on schools and other public places to ensure that safety measures and physical distancing policies are in place before they open up for activities,” said Nalina Ramalakshmi, founder and managing director, ParentCircle.In Maharashtra, the state education department conducted a series of meetings last week to decide on a possible reopening strategy. “It is evident that one uniform policy for reopening won’t work and we would have to decide depending on the local situation. We are also working on possible solutions in case of late re-opening like reduction in the syllabus, online learning in the interim, etc,” said an official from the state education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/54-parents-won-t-send-kids-to-school-for-a-month-after-lockdown-is-lifted-survey/story-eFZXCVhhSs0W2bXb0mmKBI.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||Drone mapping of forest violations during lockdown begins at SGNP||With increasing cases of encroachments, tree felling and illegal alcohol production inside forest areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) during lockdown, the Maharashtra forest department on Monday began to monitor forest areas using drones.Using one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the department monitored 65 hectares of the Yeoor forest range of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) on Monday, and will be monitoring the boundary of the 86 square kilometre (sqkm) of Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWLS) till May 26. Thereafter the efforts will be replicated across 103 sqkm of SGNP periphery and 16 sqkm of Aarey Colony, said senior forest officials.A tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed on Monday between the forest department, NGO Yeoor Environmental Society and private company DroneAge Technologies for the provision of using three UAVs – two for TWLS and one for Yeoor – free of cost till May 26.So far, 1,500 litres of illegally produced alcohol in barrels and tin containers have been destroyed along 25 encroachments at Yeoor during lockdown. However, due to lack of evidence no arrests have been made.“Using these drones, real time photographic and video evidence of violators carrying out illegal activities in forest areas, including inaccessible zones, will be available. We will follow their movement in and out of protected areas to make arrests and increase deterrence,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest, wildlife (west region). “There was a need for such a strategy as forest violations have increased during lockdown while assistance from police is less since they are busy with Covid-19 operations.”Apart from addressing tree felling, encroachment removal and illegal country liquor production, drones will be also used to check forest fires, poaching, illegal entry into forest, illegal mining or excavation, keeping watch on water bodies, and movement of wild animals.Limaye said efforts will also be taken in Aarey Milk Colony, Goregaon, even though it is not a protected area. “Photographs of people responsible for illegal tree felling, forest fires, and encroachments have already been collated. As soon as the lockdown is over, using this evidence we will track down violators with the help of the police, Aarey and Film City administration,” said Limaye. “Based on the success in Mumbai, the strategy will be implemented across all protected areas along western Maharashtra.”A control room to monitor drone movement has been setup at Yeoor forest office near Madhuban Gate on Monday. The timing for drone operation is being withheld by the department to ensure violators are not aware of the movement of UAVs. “Apart from reducing the time spent in field surveillance by 80%, it will also ensure safety of forest personnel while catching violators on the act,” said Rohit Joshi, founder, Yeoor Environmental Society who had proposed the strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/drone-mapping-of-forest-violations-during-lockdown-begins-at-sgnp/story-ikKgMUN8LZEbh5hfPzi9hP.html

12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Karan Avtar Singh: Low key bureaucrat in high-voltage row||The news of his face-off with some senior members of the council of ministers in Punjab over the state excise policy at a meeting two days ago was greeted with disbelief by many peers and seniors of chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh.For most of them, Karan Avtar, a 1984-batch IAS officer, is a low-profile bureaucrat with flawless conversational etiquette and stolidly calm disposition. But there are also some IAS officers and journalists who were not surprised at all. They see him as a person with a mercurial temperament who is abrasive with juniors at times and recount instances where he told a senior officer to put in his papers or asked another one to leave his office in the middle of a meeting.Though opinion on his persona is divided, a few doubt the intellectual rigour of the low-profile bureaucrat who has 36 years of service under his belt and the reputation of being a stickler to the rule book. Yet, he finds himself in the crosshairs of an unsavoury and unprecedented controversy with nearly three-and-a-half months left for superannuation where senior ministers have given an ultimatum to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to sack him or they would not attend meetings as long as he is there.Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi railed in front of the chief minister against the Karan Avtar’s attitude and body language with the ministers. Before the cabinet meeting, Congress MLA Raja Amrinder Singh Warring also tried to tarnish the officer’s reputation by raking up his son’s alleged business interests in the liquor trade. Karan Avtar also holds the charge of the financial commissioner, taxation, and had the run-in with the ministers over changes proposed in the excise policy to compensate the liquor contractors for the lockdown period.A postgraduate in economics from a top US university, Karan Avtar was handpicked by Amarinder, superseding three of his seniors, and appointed to the top bureaucratic position the day he took the reins of the state in March 2017. The present row is being seen as an embarrassment for the chief minister as he is also the minister in charge of the taxation department.This is not the first time the IAS officer is in the line of fire of the ruling Congress leaders. Three months ago, several party MLAs, who were upset over denial of rooms to them at Punjab Bhawan in New Delhi, spoke out against him in the state assembly during the budget session and pressed for action against the officials for “disrespect” shown to elected representatives.On February 18 also, some ministers had targeted the chief secretary for disallowing the five-day visit of an official delegation led by cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa to Dubai despite approval from the chief minister.There has been a tug of war between the CS and the chief minister’s office (CMO) for some time which has come out in the open in the video conferences held during the curfew period. “There are disagreements over the strategy to be adopted during the lockdown. In one instance, orders had to be modified,” said an officer who did not want to be named.Though he appears to enjoy the confidence of the chief minister despite these recent controversies, the turn of events in the past three days, in particular the decision to make Karan Avtar skip Monday’s cabinet meeting, have done irretrievable damage to the institution of chief secretary. “This can never be undone. I never imagined that such a day would come,” said a retired bureaucrat who has held the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/karan-avtar-singh-low-key-bureaucrat-in-high-voltage-row/story-Hr7DyM59Y9WatJVdlfq9YO.html

Member of the Punjab road safety council, Rahul Verma, said, “One side of the highway was opened for traffic on Sunday evening and it is expected that the other side would be opened on Tuesday. Now, the residents coming from Jalandhar side would not be able to move into the city from Sherpur Chowk and will have to exit from Tibba road exit point. With the completion of this flyover, the traffic is expected to increase at Samrala Chowk, but we are also working to find a solution for the same.”As per information, the flyover project had to be completed by March 31, but it was stopped after the curfew was imposed in the state. The construction work commenced amid the lockdown on April 23 after the administration gave the approval with the condition that the contractors and NHAI would have to follow the guidelines issued by the government. The project has been hanging fire for around nine years.JAGRAON BRIDGE PROJECT MOVES AT SLOW PACEThe officials of the Jagraon bridge project said that the non-availability and irregular supply of construction material has brought down the pace of the project. One of the contractor’s staff members, requesting anonymity, said, “We are not getting proper supply of raw materials and we cannot deploy more labour at the site due to the conditions imposed by the administration regarding social distancing.”Earlier, the authorities had set April 14 as the deadline for the project, but the construction work was stopped after the curfew was imposed in the state.

Of them, 20 are in Mumbai, five in Solapur, three in Pune, two in Thane and one each in Ratnagiri, Amravati, Nanded, Aurangabad and Wardha. One patient from Uttar Pradesh died in the city on Monday.In Mumbai, the worst-hit city in the country, the case count crossed 14,000 as 782 cases were registered in a day, the second-highest single-day figure so far. The city’s case count is now 14,521. On Sunday, 875 cases were recorded. The death toll of Mumbai is 528. Between April 19 and 30, the state was getting around 500 new cases daily, but from May 1, the figures started showing a significant rise. In the past 11 days, the state has reported as many as 12,903 cases, whereas the total number of cases registered in April was 10,201.The state reported 1,233 infections on May 6, 1,216 on May 7, 1,089 on May 8, 1,165 on May 9 and 1,278 on May 10. Besides, on May 10, the state also declared an additional 665 cases, saying that they were registered in the past few days and are being declared as per the Central government’s directive to bring the data at par with the national figures on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) website. The officials indicated a further rise in cases and said that curve will flatten only after May 17, when the state will complete its fourth incubation period. They are expecting a decline in cases from this month-end.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said, “The containment areas have a huge population and are likely to affect a large number of people for various reasons. So the number of new cases is likely to increase for a few more days till May 17. After this, the curve will flatten as by then we will be completing the fourth incubation period and the number of fresh cases will start coming down by this month-end.”“By next month, we are expecting that things will be completely under control,” he added.The first case in the state was detected on March 9 and it took 30 days for the state to cross the 1,000 mark.So far, 15,192 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 2,48,301 people have been put under home quarantine. On Monday, the state also completed 49 days of lockdown that was imposed from the midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was partially lifted on April 20 in areas where there are no cases or are minimal in number.On Monday, the health department said it has conducted 2,18,914 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 1,93,457 people tested negative. This is 19,852 less than what was declared on Sunday when the state declared to have tested 2,38,766 samples. It has clarified that they have declared figures, following the ICMR website.“Today, the state government has quoted sample-testing figures posted on ICMR’s portal, which is the reason there is disparity in figures compared to Sunday. It may have happened that many laboratories have not updated their figures on the ICMR website. We will ask them to do so that the difference in the number of sample testings will be removed,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, directorate of state health services.State currently has 1,256 active containment zones. Around 12,027 survey teams comprising doctors and assisting staff have screened more than 53.71 lakh people.Meanwhile, 4,786 patients have recovered across the state, with 587 recovering on Monday.The doubling rate in the state now stands at 10 days. The state government has decided to take the rate to 20 days in the days to come, said the health minister Rajesh Tope. The state government had also resolved to bring the entire state into the green zone by this month-end.The state government has recently changed the top brass of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as the situation in Mumbai has gone bad. It transferred Praveen Pardeshi and appointed IS Chahal as new BMC commissioner. The government has also appointed Sanjeev Jaiswal and Ashwini Bhide as additional municipal commissioners, replacing AB Jarhad and Jayshree Bhoj.As of now, Gadchiroli is the only district out of Maharashtra’s 36 that does not have a single case, after a case and a death was recorded in Wardha district on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-over-1-000-cases-for-6th-day-in-a-row/story-EFc352hzCAfo2tv1BL9WjM.html
12-05-2020||Mumbai||27% increase in city’s containment zones; T and F/N wards witness over 100% hike||In one week, the number of containment zones in the city has increased by 27% on average, with more than a 100% increase in F/N (Wadala-Matunga) and T (Mulund) wards where there has been a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases.An analysis of the data released by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows that F/N ward had 48 containment zones till May 5, which have now increased to 116. Similarly, T ward had 14 containment zones, which has increased to 29. There are currently 2,643 containment zones in the city as compared to 2,083 on May 5.In 17 of the total 24 wards in the city, more than 50% of the areas have been identified as congested by the civic body, making it difficult to follow social distancing norms. The BMC defines containment zones as “places where positive (cases) have been detected and that surrounding area have been sealed to protect everyone inside and outside from further spread (of Covid-19)”.The highest number of containment zones continues to be in L ward (Kurla), where there are 278 containment zones, of which, 81% are in congested areas. G/N ward (Dadar) has 273 containment zones, of which 155 or 57% are in congested spaces.The number of containment zones has gone down by 20% and 24% in the M/E and M/W wards respectively, which consist of areas like Chembur, Govandi, Mankhurd, Shivaji Nagar, and Deonar.A recent individual analysis by a Mumbai-based urban designer notes that 25% of Mumbai’s population is now living in containment zones. Abhijit Ekbote mapped the containment zones on Google Maps based on BMC data. He noted that 1,244 hectare of slum area is under containment by overlaying the spots on the slum rehabilitation authority’s (SRA) map.“SRA identifies slums as 500 tenements per hectare. So, with an average of five people per tenement, we can say that 31 lakh people are now living in containment zones, which as per the 2011 census, makes it 25% of the city’s population,” Ekbote said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/27-increase-in-city-s-containment-zones-t-and-f-n-wards-witness-over-100-hike/story-Qf8Kr9xkPOvde9ulFEocfK.html

12-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC says new testing protocol will free up more beds when cases peak||With the Centre’s new guidelines for testing and discharge of Covid-19 positive patients being implemented, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) expects to free up more Covid-19 care beds at quarantine centres and hospitals. This will also help ration available testing kits and reduce the amount of time needed for test results after a swab is collected.The Centre on Friday revised pre-discharge testing rules for Covid-19 patients, eliminating the need for a double negative test result (two consecutive test results show negative for a patient). According to these guidelines, patients showing mild to moderate symptoms no longer need to be tested before they are discharged from the hospital, and patients showing severe symptoms need to record only one negative test result.Patients are discharged provided they show no fever for three consecutive days and oxygen saturation above 94% for four days. In the case of patients with severe symptoms, and those with co-morbidities, they will not be discharged until complete resolution of symptoms and clinical recovery.Daksha Shah, Deputy Health officer with BMC said, “These guidelines have been communicated with all hospitals and covid-care centres, and implementation is starting soon.” As per guidelines, once released, patients are required to go through mandatory isolation at home, and follow up tele-conference health check-up.“We may be able to free up beds three to four days earlier. It is reducing the stress on testing capacity. With reduced testing burden, results of those who need it are coming sooner,” said a senior civic official. Presently, it takes anywhere between 12 to 24 hours for a test result to arrive after a swab is given. Two to three weeks ago, BMC had already started testing asymptomatic patients and patients showing mild and moderate symptoms, only once before discharge.“A per the task force recommendations, BMC on May 1 had already begun discharging asymptomatic patients and those showing mild symptoms on the results of one test being negative before discharge. This has helped considerably in patient-bed management,” said Shah. Even as experts have given mixed reactions to the new development, BMC believes it will reduce the burden on Covid care centres and hospitals and will be most useful when cases peak in Mumbai and demand for beds increases.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the health department, said, “There is a scientific rationale to this decision. It is not meant for reducing the load. That is only a collateral benefit. Whatever symptoms are to be developed, in more than 70% of the patients, symptoms develop on the sixth or seventh day. As per those guidelines, if on the seventh, eighth, or ninth day no symptoms are developed, then on the 10th day, the patient can be discharged without testing.”However, Rajendra Dhage, a city-based health activist, said, “There is no proof that asymptomatic persons do not spread the virus. Without testing, if you let people go out, there is going to be a problem.”Sanjay Pattiwar, another public health expert, said, “There is a boon in this and a small catch. The government was not able to cope with the high number of tests, viz-a-viz availability of kits. There is a small issue as some patients may be positive even after 14 days, but the government is not testing them before discharge. However, the government is asking them to quarantine at home, so the responsibility of their health will be taken by the patient. In turn, the load on public beds is reduced and tests are rationed.” Experts have also pointed to the need of local governments to tweak the policy for slums and high population density areas, where patients remain in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-says-new-testing-protocol-will-free-up-more-beds-when-cases-peak/story-EtqIDM2aiKR6zUw2pPkk5L.html

12-05-2020||Chandigarh||All states told to allow opening of clinics and labs: Centre to Punjab and Haryana HC||All states have been asked to allow opening of health clinics and labs and unhindered movement of health professionals, the Centre on Monday told Punjab and Haryana high court. The information in this regard was submitted by additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain during the resumed hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL). Jain referred to a letter written by home secretary Ajay Bhalla on May 11, in which states were told that field officials should allow movement of health professionals, nurses, paramedical staff and sanitation workers, and ensure that all private clinics, nursing homes and labs resume their work. Health workers’ intersate movement too should be facilitated, the Centre’s letter says.The PIL was filed by a lawyer, Ferry Sofat, who had contended that although the government and some private hospitals are equipped to treat the Covid-19 patients, those suffering from other serious ailments/diseases are not being extended the necessary medical assistance. The state government too had denied the claims in the petition.The Centre’s communication underlines that the services of health staff is very crucial for immunisation programme and handling of vector-borne disease, other seasonal diseases and meeting other non-covid emergencies. Any restriction could lead to severe constraints in rendering Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 duties, it adds. The PIL was disposed of in view of statements from Centre and Punjab government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-states-told-to-allow-opening-of-clinics-and-labs-centre-to-punjab-and-haryana-hc/story-vjHmj3Xs9xp2t4c7A4Z7DK.html

They had installed a big tent at the railway station here to protect the migrant labourers, being sent to their native places in special trains, from the scorching heat at an exorbitant rent rate of Rs 26,000 per day, but the tent has not been in use during the past five days.Shramik trains to send the labourers to their native places in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, were started on May 5 from the railway station here.The railway station made entry arrangements for labourers from the main gate side for two days (on May 5 and 6). So the tent was also installed on this side.But sensing the large number of labourers, the station authorities chose the rear side of the station, the Guru Nanak Stadium side, for entry of labourers from May 7. So, the administration also shifted the arrangements from the Guru Nanak Stadium side, but no one bothered to remove the tent, which has been not in use since then. Hence, the mere wastage of rent money.Railway officials said they had informed the administration of change in the entry point, but they have no idea why the administration has not removed the tent from the stadium side.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, headquarters) Deepak Pareek, when reminded of the futility of the tent, said he would ask the officials to remove the tent and return it to the tent house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/costing-rs-26-000-per-day-to-admn-tent-at-ludhiana-railway-station-in-disuse-for-past-five-days/story-qkuptjFNwqFyqwIQBUTuyK.html
12-05-2020||Chandigarh||Ex-Haryana CM Hooda questions liquor trade during lockdown||Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Monday said that irregularities pertaining to liquor sale in Haryana were not limited to just one warehouse, but had larger ramifications. “The SIT formed to probe the scam should also examine how the sale of liquor was going on in Haryana even though the liquor vends were closed. Who was leading this illegal sale and whose patronage did the perpetrators enjoy?” he asked during an interaction with mediapersons. The leader of the opposition also asked the state government to withdraw restrictions on paddy cultivation. Hooda said this was a time to fight coronavirus and not raise disputes. Hooda said he strongly opposed the government’s decision to restrict paddy sowing in 19 blocks. “It is important to worry about groundwater level, but for this, the government should also take effective steps that will help solve the problem. It should restart the Dadupur Nalvi water recharge project and efforts should be made to bring SYL water. A plan should be made to bring water to Hansi-Butana canal and switch to drip irrigation systems,” he added. HARYANA FORMS PROBE TEAMMeanwhile, Haryana government on Monday constituted a special inquiry team (SET) headed by ACS, power, TC Gupta to probe the theft of liquor stored in a warehouse at Sonepat’s Kharkhauda. The probe team will submit its report by May 31. ADGP, vigilance bureau, Subhash Yadav and additional excise and taxation commissioner Vijai Singh will be the team members as per the home department orders. The SET will check the actual availability of liquor stocks in all warehouses sealed by the excise department during the last two years for any violation. It will also examine the cases of seizure of illicit/ non-excise duty paid liquor in Haryana between April 2019 and March 2020, both by the police and excise departments separately, with special reference to action and fines imposed by the excise department following recovery of liquor. The probe team will also collect and collate the results of investigation of the FIRs registered from March 15, 2020 till April 10 for pilferage of liquor from L-1 and L-13 godowns and also from the police ‘malkhanas’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-haryana-cm-questions-liquor-trade-during-lockdown/story-HJUMooAID7WgKBTbjNah2M.html

It’s a good sign things are moving back to normal,” said Ram. According to Ram, as many as 12,421 migrant workers have returned to their native places from Pune in the last few days through the Shramik Special trains.The workers, who were to board train at Daund, were among a group of of 1,172 migrants cleared to head home from the Kurkumbh industrial area.“With the MIDC area here reopening, many of these workers, originally from Madhya Pradesh, have chosen not to move,” said Sanjay Patil, tehsildar, Daund.In Pune city also, partial resumption of economic activity has slowed down requests from workers wanting to return home, said a contractor, requesting anonymity.“Many of my relatives and friends are willing to go back to their villages, but I do not want to go back. We have faced a lot of trouble in the last two months, but now slowly, work is starting. If we stay back here, we will get money and can help our family financially from here,” said Sonu Shukla, a worker from Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.Shukla, along with others from Uttar Pradesh, is employed at a construction site in Katraj.“We do the plaster of paris (POP) work at construction sites and all of us have decided not to go back. Our family members are regularly in touch with us over the phone and they also told me not to come back,” said Raghavram Prajapati, another worker from the Gonda district in UP.Similarly, a small cement factory on the Kondhwa road has nine workers staying back here in Pune.Umar Khan, one of the workers at this factory said, “We were lucky enough that our factory owner took care of us during the lockdown. He gave us money and food to survive. In fact, in the last couple of days we have started getting orders from our clients. So the work has begun.”For Narendra Mishra, a security guard working at one of the banks on Satara road, who hails from Muzaffarpur, Bihar, it’s difficult to return back home.“I want to go back home, but as I need the money, I will not go back. I am the only bread earner in my family and if I go back, there will no financial support to us, so I have decided to stay back here in Pune and work for my children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/at-least-340-workers-cleared-for-travel-back-to-home-towns-refuse-to-leave/story-muy8hAz5oYnBsvCc34ioLI.html

I immediately asked the store department head Srinivas Kandul to purchase an industrial washing machine for Naidu hospital. Despite lockdown, the administration managed to procure it from the mayor’s fund,” Mohol said. Brothers Sanjay and Sham Pardeshi landed the laundry jobs at Naidu hospital after their mother who was working with PMC passed away in 2003. “Now, I have an industrial washing machine where 50 bed sheets or blankets can be washed at a time. But I still need to physically go to each ward and collect the soiled clothes,” Sanjay Pardeshi said. The brothers are expected to clean hospital bed sheets, pillow covers and other clothes. “Since Naidu Hospital began serving people, our family is doing laundry work at the hospital. Though the hospital is run by a civic body, the business of washing clothes is with our family only. My father and mother both were serving here,” Sanjay Pardeshi said. The civic body has also added a drying machine to their inventory recently but it hasn’t been installed yet. “Every day I am going to Covid-19 wards and collecting clothes. Earlier, there was a slight fear but now I have become used to it and take necessary care to clean the clothes,” Sanjay said. According to him, as a government employee he doesn’t have an option to deny doing work during a pandemic. “I worked here during swine flu, Sars and now Covid-19, I use to even clean tuberculosis patients’ clothes regularly so there is no fear,” he added. The Pardeshi brothers wash clothes, dry it and send them to the Covid-19 wards the following day, these include clothes of resident doctors at the hospital as well. “We are 17 members in our family who are living together at the Naidu hospital quarters. We are a joint family. We were four brothers but two passed away but their family is also with us,” Sanjay Pardeshi said. When asked whether he fears for his life, Pardeshi said his family has been serving at the Naidu hospital for the last 100 years since the hospital’s foundation. “The hospital is meant to look after the sick and we are used to it. After any new disease, first patient arrives at this hospital and we are mentally prepared to carry out this work by taking necessary precautions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mayor-installs-washing-machine-at-hospital-after-laundry-men-use-bare-hands-to-wash-clothes/story-ozc0f8HQr2nsQQlLipt7jL.html
12-05-2020||Pune||Newspaper vendors resume distribution in Pune||Printing and distribution of newspapers in Pune began on Monday, after a break of two weeks. The circulation was disrupted following the myth that Covid-19 spreads via newspapers.The Pune Newspaper Vendor Association said that scientific research has proven that the virus does not survive on porous surfaces. It appealed to residential co-operative housing societies that they must open their doors for newspaper delivery executives and vendors. Vijay Parge, president, Pune Newspaper Vendor Association, said that the distribution will continue unless an order to the effect is issued by the state government. The newspaper distribution was disrupted for at least four weeks in April and May. “On Monday, 12,500 delivery persons and 2,500 vendors were involved in the circulation. We do not know till when the lockdown will continue, hence, we resumed the distribution. We received a mixed response as some residential societies did not allow the vendors to enter,” said Parge.The vendor association distributes at least 15 lakh newspapers belonging to 70 different publications in the city, according to PargeNitin Parmar, secretary, Blue Turquoise Society in Undri, said “We support newspaper distribution. The residents need to know what is happening around them and print media is still considered to be the most authentic source of information for a number of residents.”Earlier, distribution was stopped by vendors in the last week of March because of the fear of spread of Covid-19. Many housing societies also did not allow vendors on their premises. In the absence of a distribution network, newspaper owners also stopped publication. After a coordination meeting between owners and distributors, safety measures for newspaper delivery were decided and distribution had resumed from April 1. However, it was stopped again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/newspaper-vendors-resume-distribution-in-city/story-6ehe726iwOhSTUhBQyhCGJ.html
12-05-2020||Pune||Konkan farmers use direct sale to ensure mango supply is sweet during lockdown||Maharashtra’s mango crop is not going to waste. Despite lockdown restrictions across the state, farmers from the Konkan area, the heartland of mango cultivation, are now selling directly to consumers to ensure consumers do not miss out on the summer fruit.“Farming of mangoes is our traditional business and there was a system in place to send mangoes to various parts of the country. This year, due to lockdown, transport of mangoes is difficult. So we decided to take to social media and appeal to residential housing societies to order in bulk. Accordingly, mangoes will be sent directly to that particular society from us, and this model is working well now,” said Vilas Gaikwad, a farmer from Ratnagiri district.“We are getting a good response from Pune, Mumbai, Nashik and other parts of the state. It also becomes easy for us to do business during this crisis situation,” Gaikwad adds.Another mango farmer from Devgadh in Konkan, Mangesh Parchure, said, “As we are under lockdown for more than two months now, sending mangoes to our regular traders in Pune and Mumbai is not possible. At most places, the local Agricultural produce market committees (APMC) are closed. We approached our friends and relatives in these cities and started sending mangoes on individual orders to their homes in housing societies. The orders increased and now we are sending two trucks of mangoes every week to Pune and Mumbai.”Citizens from the city have also appreciated this method of selling mangoes directly to customers.Namrata Kashid, a resident of Sahakarnagar in Pune said, “There are 48 flats in our society and almost everyone wanted to buy mangoes.

The trial is likely to start in a day or two, as the administration is yet to take consent from patients, said officials. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is used to prevent meningitis.Dr Murlidhar Tambe dean, Sassoon, said, “We have not yet taken consent from the patients who will undergo this treatment.

The hospital will the first in the state to carry out trials for the treatment of Covid-19. Although the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that there is no proof that it would work to control BCG, the study at Haffkine has shown promising results.A similar study in the application of BCG in the treatment and prevention of Covid-19 is underway at Bharati hospital. Dr Sanjay Lalawani, medical director, Bharati Hospital, said, “This is a six-month trial wherein patients who have been exposed to the virus infection, health workers and close contacts of the patient would be given a dose of BCG.”“There will be two groups, one which will receive the dose while the second which will not be given the dose.

RK Yadav, general secretary, Punjab, Samajwadi Party, said, “They have demanded ₹40 lakh for victim’s family, ₹10 lakh each for the wife, mother and two minor sons. They agreed to cremate the body after the ADC assured them that the administration will help them.”He said, “The victim was unemployed since the lockdown was imposed and was making rounds of Focal Point police station since days to get ration.

12-05-2020||Delhi||Why German stuck at Delhi’s IGI airport turned down offer to go home||A 40-year-old German who has been living in the transit area of the Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport for the last 55 days turned down an offer go to his home country, and was recently served a “Leave India Notice” by authorities, according to officials familiar with the matter.The officials said that the man, Edgard Ziebat, has said he will leave India as soon as international flights resume after the national lockdown, and wants to stay at the airport until then.HT reported on Monday that Ziebat has been living in the airport since March 18, after he arrived in New Delhi from Hanoi as a transit passenger on his way to Istanbul. March 18 was the day India banned all flights to Turkey to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Four days later, India banned all international flights. Stranded, Ziebat could neither exit India, nor the airport’s transit area, because he does not have an Indian visa. Also Watch | Will PM-CMs decide on lockdown exit & the man living at airport for 2 months An airport official indicated that Ziebat, who has not applied for an Indian visa, was unlikely to get one even if he did because of a prior criminal record in Germany.A spokesman for the German embassy in New Delhi told HT on Monday that Ziebat was offered a passage back to Germany, but he declined the offer.A spokesperson for the embassy said it was “aware of the situation and in contact with relevant authorities and the person in question”. “We have repeatedly offered him a passage back to Germany but he turned down our offers,” the spokesperson added.A second official from the Delhi airport who asked not to be named said Ziebat was issued a Leave India Notice. “He was asked to make arrangements for his departure from the country,” said the officer, adding that the notice was served because an international passenger can normally stay in transit for just one day according to Indian laws.The officer said that Ziebat assured them he will leave as soon as possible, but is waiting for the flight operation to resume. They have found that he has visas of multiple countries, the officer added.Last week, Indian authorities had tried to accommodate Ziebat on a relief flight to Ankara, but Turkish authorities refused to accept him onboard since the flight was only for their citizens or permanent card holders. For the last 55 days, Ziebat has mostly spent his days reading magazines and newspapers, talking to his friends and family ones over phone, eating at some of the fast food outlets when they operational within the terminal, interacting with housekeeping and security staff, taking walks within the transit area, and using the airport’s washrooms.He has been provided with a recliner, mosquito net, toothpaste, food and other basic essentials by the authorities, a third airport official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/german-stuck-at-delhi-s-igi-airport-refused-to-go-home/story-YGHdm1PoqhYT8TVmo0DIMO.html

12-05-2020||Noida||Covid-19 lockdown: Bus union demands permission to ferry stranded migrants in Noida||All India Luxury Bus Union has demanded the government to permit them to ferry stranded people from one place to another. The union has 15,000 buses in different cities and employs over 50,000 people. The union said that, while, on the one hand, people are stranded at different places, scores of bus drivers, helpers and mechanics involved in transport business are jobless.Shyamlal Gola, president All India Luxury Bus Union, said that the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has badly affected the people and the economy. “We have seen that a number of migrant workers, students and others are stranded in different cities. In the absence of public transport vehicles, some of them are walking on foot with their family members. We have asked the government to allow the private buses to ferry these stranded people. We will sanitize the buses and adhere to the social distancing norms,” he said.Gola said that over 50,000 drivers, helpers, mechanics, etc. are associated with the transport business and they are jobless due to the lockdown. “We have supported our employees financially during the lockdown. But the financial burden on transporters is increasing. The government should relax the norms and allow us to function,” he said.Gola said the government is yet to relax norms for transporters, in terms of extending the insurance validity, fitness validity, commercial taxes, even though these vehicles are not plying. “The buses would rust and get technical problems by being grounded for months at one place,” he said. Some transporters have also financed their vehicles and are unable to pay EMIs. The Union has written a letter to the state and central government over the matter.Noida transport department said they have not received any order from government on allowing private buses as of now. Himesh Tiwari, Assistant Regional Transport Officer (enforcement) said the district administration has arranged some roadways buses and sent some stranded people to their home towns from Noida. “There are some more people in these shelter homes. The government is engaging roadways buses to ferry them. We have not received any order to allow these private buses to ply,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bus-union-demands-permission-to-ferry-stranded-migrants/story-arV13HCe564aGEdlKaAjKL.html
12-05-2020||Delhi||Mosquito-borne diseases in Capital on the rise||Mosquito-borne diseases in the national Capital are rising at an alarming rate adding to the worries of civic agencies that are struggling to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Until May 9 this year, areas under all five municipal bodies in Delhi—north, south and east corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council, and Delhi Cantonment Board—recorded a significant jump in the number of dengue, malaria and chikungunya cases as compared to the same period last year. All three diseases are transmitted by the Anopheles and Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes.Malaria cases in Delhi have more than quadrupled from four cases, reported between January 1, 2019 and May 9, 2019, to 18 cases reported between the same period this year. The number of chikungunya cases has doubled from five cases last year (till May 9) to 10 cases this year. The number of Dengue cases for the same period has also increased from nine last year to 14 cases this year.Public health experts say the hike in the number of cases can be attributed to “intermittent rain and lower temperatures this year.” “If you look at the weather records, in January and February, Delhi received more than the normal amount of rainfall this year, and in March, it received the highest amount of rainfall in the last ten years (compared to the same corresponding periods),” said Dr RN Singh, senior municipal health officer, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). “Dust storms, hails and intermittent rains in April have also kept the temperature in the city under control. This resulted in creating conducive habitats for mosquitoes, providing them not only with freshwater puddles but also giving them moisture in the air to survive,” he added.Another municipal doctor, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “Cyclical trends are also a factor to be considered here. Dengue and chikungunya return aggressively after every three or four years because of the change in the prevalent virulent strain. The last time these two diseases were a major concern in Delhi was in 2017.”The Covid-19 pandemic is also posing a challenge to the efforts of the civic bodies to contain mosquito-borne diseases. The domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) can no longer go door-to-door to check coolers and overhead tanks as many residents are not letting them in. Also, a chunk of the DBCs are engaged in disinfection drives by civic bodies wherein sodium hypochlorite is sprayed over residential and public areas to contain the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. “We are now majorly dependent on technology—we are sending over 50,000 messages over the phone every week to residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), market associations, hotels, etc., and are also circulating self-help videos on preventing breeding of mosquitoes on one’s own premises,” said a New Delhi Municipal Council official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mosquito-borne-diseases-in-capital-on-the-rise/story-dOJwY4WHj2DJBdC26ddYDN.html
12-05-2020||Delhi||Rape accused triggers Covid scare in Tihar jail||A man lodged in Tihar jail since Friday for allegedly raping a woman -- investigations are ongoing -- was tested for the coronavirus disease on Sunday after she tested positive during the routine medical examination. Two other inmates of the prison who came in touch with him were also tested. All three tested negative. Officials at the Tihar Prison Complex went into a tizzy Sunday when they were informed by Delhi Police about the woman testing positive. The man was isolated; and two others who had come in touch with him were quarantined. An alert was sounded in the complex. The three prisoners were tested on Sunday and were found negative, officials said , adding the alert in still in effect. The officials said all jail superintendents have been asked to watch for symptoms in prisoners or jail staff. So far, Tihar has not reported any Covid positive case.Tihar houses at least 18,000 prisoners and it is the most crowded prison complex in the country. In Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail where 4,000 prisoners are lodged, within a week of one prisoner contracting the virus, the infection has spread to 184 prisoners and prison staff. Tihar’s additional inspector general Raj Kumar said: “The police sent the rape survivor for the mandatory medical examination. When she tested positive for Covid-19, they alerted us. The rape accused was already in a separate ward for new prisoners. Ever since the breakout of the pandemic, all new inmates are kept in a separate, isolated section for 14 days before being shifted to barracks. The other two prisoners who had come into contact with the accused have also been tested. There is no cause for panic because they were in isolation.” With a spurt in crime cases since last week after the government relaxed norms of the lockdown, the number of new prisoners has also increased. This has prompted jail authorities to use sub-jail 2 as an isolation ward for new inmates. There are 14 jails inside Tihar. According to prison records, last Monday(May 3), 32 new inmates were brought to Tihar; 35 were brought to the prison on Tuesday; and 64 on Wednesday. Between March 25 and May 2, when the complete lockdown was in effect, only 13 new prisoners were being brought in every day on average, said senior jail officials. On some days in April, the prison received only five prisoners.To ensure social distancing and prevent the spread of infection inside the prison, family visits were suspended a week before the nationwide lockdown started on March 25.The prison department also released 2,177 inmates awaiting trial on interim bail on the orders of a court for 90 days; and 1,056 convicts have been released on emergency parole for eight weeks. Sunil Gupta who worked in Tihar jail as a law officer for around three decades, said it is important to keep the jail Covid free, given the large population of inmates in an enclosed space, which makes containment could be a nightmare. “ The prison officers have to be on alert. We have enough cells inside the prison. They must use the cells as isolation wards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rape-accused-triggers-covid-scare-in-tihar/story-5qssZfPRKgm2OH0pK2Gn8O.html
12-05-2020||Delhi||Rs 5,000 more for construction workers; Delhi govt to launch fresh registration drive||The Delhi government on Monday said it will disburse Rs 5,000 to all registered construction workers in the city -- just as it did last month -- and launch a fresh 10-day online registration drive from Friday to help more workers benefit from its schemes. The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai on Monday. At least 39,600 construction are registered with the Delhi building and other construction workers (BoCW) board.“Workers engaged in construction work in Delhi will once again get Rs 5,000 this month for their sustenance from the Delhi government,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi. The Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union welcomed the move.“Last month, the Delhi government had announced and disbursed a one-time compensation of Rs 5,000 to every worker registered with the BoCW board. Today, I took a meeting of the labour department and it has been decided that the same compensation shall be repeated this month as well. So, we will start disbursing the second round of Rs 5,000 to the account of every registered worker from Tuesday,” Rai said.While the Delhi government has allowed construction activity in the city, it has permitted operations only at in-situ projects where workers are available on site, in line with the Union government’s guidelinesThe state labour minister said the government has also decided to start a new registration drive for construction workers, and that this time it will be done online. “We had received a lot of complaints from other workers that they were not able to renew their enrolment and the new ones were finding it difficult to get registered with the Board. Hence, we are changing the registration process which was going on to date,” Rai said. “From May 15, the Delhi government will start an online registration drive for construction workers. A dedicated website for this will also be launched on the same day. With this, any one from anywhere can get register with the Board. This drive will go on till May 25,” he said. The minister explained the process will require an applicant to upload copies of all the required documents. After May 25, the labour department will begin the verification process. Those who submit their applications online will be given an appointment for physical verification of their documents by the department. The person will have to go to a labour department office nearest to him.“The department has been directed to ensure strict social distancing norms during the time when the applicants start visiting the office. A system has been devised in which only 50 applicants will be called every day for verification. At the office, a token system will be enforced to prevent overcrowding or fights,” Rai said.The Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union pointed to the need to expanding the number of registered workers. “Around four years ago, Delhi had over three lakh (300,000) registered workers but now the number has dropped to only about 40,000 because most of them do not renew their enrolment. Construction workers need to renew their enrolment with the BoCW board annually by depositing Rs 20,” said Thaneshwar Adigaur, secretary of the union. Adigaur also said that the government will have to ensure there is no pendency in the number of applications. “There are nine labour offices where applicants will be called. If each office handles even 100 cases every day, there would still be a high possibility that applications would keep pilling up. So, the verification process should be done in a timebound manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-5-000-more-for-construction-workers-delhi-govt-to-launch-fresh-registration-drive/story-LbidxRiU0f1kIOjR09ME6N.html
12-05-2020||Delhi||Street food vendors to be trained in hygiene, social distancing||Eating street food will not be the same when the lockdown is lifted. To prepare Delhi’s street food vendors for the new normal, the National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) has decided to train them in the measures they need to take while selling food.The training will focus on keeping a separate table next to the cart from where customers can collect food, keeping a water dispenser, wearing protective gear, using disinfectants to keep the cart clean, opting for online payment, home deliveries in nearby areas among other things.The training will be based on guidelines prepared by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for food businesses during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Sangeeta Singh, head of the street food programme at NASVI, said street vendors will have to get used to the “new normal to earn their livelihood”. While there were close to 1.45 lakh authorised street vendors as per government records based on surveys done in 2007 and 2011, their exact number now is not known as no survey has taken place in the recent past. According to NASVI, there are over three lakh vendors (approximately) in Delhi.The training guidelines for vendors state that high-touch points (surfaces that are touched the most number of times) have to be cleaned twice daily using disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite. “Vendors will now have to use these disinfectants to keep their carts clean. They will also have to wear proper protective gear, provide customers with water dispensers and make arrangement to regularly sanitise their hands. We will teach them about hand hygiene, social distancing, etc., which are essential today,” Singh said.Shyam Sunder (65), a street food vendor at Harkesh Nagar in Okhla, is unsure whether he can immediately go back to selling fritters near the Metro station after May 17. “I will have to buy a lot of things, such as disinfectants, to keep the cart clean. But I don’t know if people would prefer to eat on the roadside. The government should help us restart our businesses,” Sunder said.Subhash (who goes by his first name), another street food vendor near Pragati Maidan, is also uncertain about his livelihood. “We don’t know when the lockdown will be lifted and we will be allowed to put up our stalls. There is a lot of uncertainty. My brother had started selling vegetable during the lockdown to feed the family, but we discontinued it later due the rise in Covid cases in the Azadpur Mandi,” Subhash said.The training is likely to start from next week and over 500 street food vendors will be trained in the first phase, Sangeeta Singh said.She said vendors, especially those selling street food, will be the worst affected, as people will be reluctant to eat on the road fearing Covid-19. “Earlier, we would try to teach them about the importance of hygiene while cooking. But now the vendors are eager to know what they can do to revive their business. They have suffered a lot in the last one-and-a-half months,” she said.Arbind Singh, executive director of NASVI, said that the Delhi government and municipal agencies should now create dedicated vending zones as mandated in the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, and also prepare a plan for street vendors once the lockdown is lifted. “The creation of dedicated vending zones will help ensure social distancing. We will request the government to prepare a plan for street vendors, including food vendors. As and when the lockdown is lifted, street vending will need the government’s support in reviving their businesses,” he said.A senior Delhi government official looking after the issues of street vendors in the Capital said, “There can’t be a common rule for all the areas in Delhi now due to Covid-19. The plans will be area-specific. We will ask the district magistrates to ensure that social distancing is maintained whenever vendors are allowed to operate. We will prepare a detailed plan once we get some guidelines from the Centre in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/street-food-vendors-to-be-trained-in-hygiene-social-distancing/story-v1W5XZfuzFLSHKXAFxJyCP.html

The way our teachers were misbehaved with today, it will be suicide if they go back tomorrow,” said Nandini Sharma, standing committee chairperson of the education committee, SDMC.No police complaint had been lodged in this regard till evening. A female teacher, who was allegedly manhandled, told HT that the incident took place when a crowd of around 1,200 people turned restless “My five female colleagues and I reached the school premises at 7:45am for ration distribution and found that a crowd of around 1,200 people had already queued up.”“They were complaining that we are late and all of them will not get ration. Soon, they started abusing us and this led to a scuffle. There were no security guards or policemen to help us. Thankfully, our area school inspector, Ramdayal Meena, arrived on receiving our SOS messages and evacuated us to an adjacent school building,” the teacher said.Meena said, “I had to lock up the ladies to prevent them from being harmed by the crowd. A PCR van came 30 minutes later and brought the crowd under control. We realised most of the people didn’t even have the e-coupons for ration issued by the Delhi Government.”The secretary of the municipal teachers’ union, Ramniwas Solanki, said, he has written to the chief minister, municipal commissioners and even to the Prime Minister’s Office asking to either ensure security for teachers or withdraw them from the ration and food distribution duty.“One of our teachers deputed in Jahangirpuri area has already died from Covid and her husband too has the virus. It is suspected that she got the virus during ration distribution duty,” he said.“Further, there are no safeguards for us. For every packet of ration given out, we have to take signatures or thumb impressions. There is only a single register, a single pen and one inkpad at each school for this purpose. We cannot keep risking our families’ lives,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/teachers-manhandled-while-distributing-ration-at-south-delhi-school-no-case-lodged/story-x2AuFOZY6wuuSi6nyAqzmI.html
12-05-2020||Delhi||Metro stations temporarily housing CISF men to decongest barracks||Delhi’s 254 Metro stations are temporarily housing at least 2,500 Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel who have been shifted out of their barracks to decongest them and ensure social distancing in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19. A few CISF personnel have also been asked to shift from their family accommodations. These men, posted with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) Metro unit, now perform their duties, sleep, eat, spend their leisure time and bathe at these Metro stations. Senior officers say the move prevents them from the risk of exposure, from extra travel and minimises their chance of spreading the viral infection to each other or to their family members.So far, 22 CISF personnel posted at the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) have been found coronavirus positive while more than 250 have been tested for the infection so far. Of them, around 120 have been kept in isolation, senior officials said. The CISF provides security to Metro stations across Delhi.The decision to move the staff from the barracks was taken on Friday following a meeting of senior CISF officials. A senior CISF officer, who wished not to be named, said there are 12,500 personnel in the DMRC unit. Roughly, around 50% of them live with their families in their own accommodations, about 10% live with family in accommodation provided by the force and the remaining 40% occupy the barracks, he said.“The decision to move these men out of their barracks was not only important to ensure social distancing in their barracks, but also to prevent them from daily travel, which increases the risk of exposure to the virus. Because these men are reporting on duty despite the lockdown, they travel together in groups and we needed to sanitise their vehicles multiple times a day. Those living with families also get back home everyday after their duty hours, putting their loved ones at risk,” the officer said.Senior commandant, CISF, Jitender Rana said that as these men are stationed at the Metro stations, it will minimise the risk of spreading the infection within the force. “These men have been provided all basic essentials in the barracks. They will perform their duties and live within their respective Metro stations until Metro services resume. We get their food delivered. Their necessities are being taken care of,” Rana said.Another officer, who requested anonymity, said every Metro station has 8-10 CISF personnel living there. A Metro station is a huge area and these people can easily maintain a safe distance among themselves. As they’re now stationed there, their duty will also not be hampered. Their distribution varies depending on the location and the size of the station. “In areas that are highly secure, such as Rajiv Chowk, Race Course and Central Secretariat, we did not need much staff as Metro trains are currently not in operation. In the outskirts, we have deployed adequate staff,” the officer said.Officers said that all those who have moved out so far are men below 55 years of age. “We have only shifted those who are young and healthy. Others—roughly around 1,500 to 2,000—are still living in the barracks. No woman personnel has so far been detected with the virus, neither has any of them been moved into isolation. All necessary measures to disinfect the barracks and other safety guidelines are being diligently followed,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/metro-stations-temporarily-housing-cisf-men-to-decongest-barracks/story-hieiu2vqeUqJ8crRZ0ziuK.html

12-05-2020||City||2,890 traffic marshals assisting Ludhiana police in enforcing lockdown||As many as 2,890 traffic marshals are assisting Ludhiana police commissionerate in enforcing the coronavirus lockdown across the city. Of these marshals, around 240 have been deployed, along with district administration, police and municipal corporation (MC) officials, to manage the movement of migrants from pick-up points to Guru Nanak Stadium and the railway station as part of the ‘Shramik Special’ drive. As part of the drive, migrants are first brought to Guru Nanak Stadium from pick-up points set up near their houses via buses. After conducting their medical screening at the stadium, they are given rail tickets, water and food before they proceed towards the railway station for boarding trains to their respective home states.Besides, almost all the senior officials are working 24X7 to ensure that the process goes on smoothly. Police commissioner Rakesh Kumar Agrawal said the traffic marshals are playing a vital role in facilitating the migrants’ journey to their home states. “When the migrants reach Guru Nanak Stadium in buses, these marshals ensure that they form proper queues for their medical screening, tickets and food/water. These volunteers are also assisting the district administration and the police in the checking of tickets, medical screening, distribution of food and water, and scanning of barcodes on the tickets,” he said.RESIDENTS INTERESTED TO VOLUNTEER CAN REGISTER ON APPAgrawal said if any person wants to assist the Ludhiana police as a traffic marshal, he/she can register on traffic marshal mobile app after which the department would themselves contact them. “The entire Ludhiana police salute these traffic marshals for serving the society in today’s testing times,” he said.The marshals’ in-charge, Mandeep Keshav Guddu, said that around 80 volunteers are deployed for ‘Shramik Special’ drive in three shifts that go on round the clock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-890-traffic-marshals-assisting-ludhiana-police-in-enforcing-coronavirus-lockdown/story-09ELx4HkrYGotopuYsobRO.html
12-05-2020||City||Boost your immunity with a healthy diet, say experts||The coronavirus-induced lockdown has given people ample time to follow their creative pursuits. However, it has also given rise to this new wave of ‘quarantine cooking’. From trying out the now viral Dalgona (whipped) coffee to making rasgullas and baking cakes, people are constantly sharing pictures of recipes on different social media platforms, demonstrating how they are utilising their time. This quarantine cooking is not just for sustenance, but also for entertainment and stress busting.With the trend gaining followers every minute, experts have a word of caution for people. They say that as physical activity has reduced now that everyone is indoors, it is better to limit the frequency of high-calorie food items and stick to healthy options.Dr Vinu Kumar, a Ludhiana-based clean eating and lifestyle mentor, said, “In this time of global health emergency, one should try to increase their immunity by opting for healthy alternatives.”“Along with staying inside, people should keep a tab on their health. Indulging in a high-calorie diet on a daily basis with no physical activity will only lower the immunity, making one vulnerable to infections. Rather than following the trend, one should set an example by including seasonal fruits and vegetables in the diet,” she said.“Eating seasonal fruits and vegetable prepare the body to handle the extreme temperatures. Fruits such as papayas and watermelons have high water-content, causing a cooling effect on the body. Moreover, the fibre is great for the digestive system. Similarly, chutneys made from mixed seasonal fruits and herbs are also beneficial. Indian homemade drinks such as thandai and aam panna should also be included in summer diet,” she added.Dr Ritu Sudhakar, chief dietician at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), said that anything in excess can be harmful.“One of my acquaintances told me that she has been baking cakes on a daily basis since the lockdown, which is obviously harmful for health. While preparing pizza or desserts at home is a better option than ordering from outside, it should not be frequent. For healthier options, one can use jaggery or honey in place of sugar, add less cheese and more vegetables to a pizza and try different fruit smoothies. Nuts, sprouts, dry fruits and eggs should be added to one’s diet to boost the immunity,” she said.“To benefit from this trend, one can try new dishes at home rather than eating outside after the lockdown is over,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/boost-your-immunity-with-a-high-calorie-diet-say-experts/story-Su1L9q9SOu3jZxGf1dPNPN.html

Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad on May 6 ordered that essential and non-essential shops from non-containment zones will be allowed to operate for 12 hours between 7am and 7pmHowever, there were numerous complaints from various shop owners and local residents from Katraj, Hadapsar, Warje and Karvenagar areas that local police officials were not letting shops function till evening. “Orders are very clear in this regard. The orders will be enforced accordingly. If anyone is closing the shop, then it is wrong. All things are being stated to the senior inspectors of police stations,” Venkatesham said. The issue was also raised during a press conference addressed by Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram, who said, “If there is any coordination issue, I will speak to the police chief. The order clearly states that shops can remain open till 7pm.”A similar complaint was also raised by the owner of a dairy shop in Shaniwar peth area of Pune. The shop falls in Vishrambaug police station jurisdiction of Pune police which does not have containment zones.Meanwhile, in ward 23 of Hadapsar, a janta curfew was declared by local corporators representing the area. All shops will be closed for five days, as per a letter addressed to PMC commissioner by a politician from Hadapsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/all-shops-in-non-containment-zones-open-till-7pm-says-pune-police-chief/story-gJ9yNw27HXl5GAlwM5BwiI.html
12-05-2020||Pune||PMC implements new discharge protocol; 500 beds freed up for Covid cases||With the new discharge protocol coming into effect in Pune on Monday, after the Centre issued guidelines for the same on May 9, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) believes it will have 500 beds freed on an immediate basis for Covid-19 patients.According to civic commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, there are currently 1,350 Covid-19 positive patients in various Pune hospitals.“Of these 1,350 patients, 500 have completed 10 days in isolation while undergoing treatment. These patients can be released immediately if they do not have strong symptoms and can undergo isolation at home. This means PMC can have up to 500 beds freed on an immediate basis, even as we have decided to follow the protocol on a case-to-case basis,” Gaikwad said. Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “The new protocol has been implemented in the division and all the guidelines of the Centre are being followed while discharging patients with no, or mild symptoms after 10 days.”The earlier protocol demanded a Covid positive patient, irrespective of symptoms, to be isolated in hospital for 14 days and discharged after two consecutive tests, within a gap of 24 hours, returned negative.The new protocol states that those with mild symptoms can be discharged in 10 days based on a single negative test, if, there is no fever for three days. There is no repeat test.For those with moderate symptoms, if the fever is resolved within three days and the oxygen saturation is maintained without support, then, the patient can be discharged in 10 days.Those with moderate symptoms who need oxygen therapy, can be discharged only after the resolution of clinical symptoms, and the ability to maintain oxygen saturation for three days.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) changed the discharge protocol of Covid-19 patients stating that those with mild, very mild and pre-symptomatic positive patients can be discharged after 10 days since the onset of symptoms, and with no fever for three days, without a repeat test.City doctors have responded to the changed protocol by saying that while it might reduce the load on hospitals and staff, who can now focus more on severe patients, the risk of community transmission cannot be ignored. Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer (CEO) of Symbiosis University Hospital, said, “ICMR and NIV, based on their studies, state that the virus stays in the body for only 10 days. We, in our experience, have found that even on the 14th day, almost 15%-20% of patients test positive. This means we are letting 15%-20% of the carriers to go out in the community which risks community transmission. Although the viral load may be less on the 10th day leading to no symptoms, no study states that less viral load prevents transmission.” Dr Natarajan added, “Home quarantine will be extremely difficult in slums. A healthier infected person may infect someone with a comorbidity, who otherwise could have been safe.”However, Indian medical association (IMA) president for Maharashtra, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, says, “With limited testing kits and a staff crunch, the changed discharge protocol will be of great help. Also, it is not usually seen that the symptoms reoccur and if home quarantine and social distancing is strictly followed then it might help.”IMA has also written to the state government that all passengers arriving in the state should undergo a swab test RT-PCR, on arrival, and be sent into quarantine. The association has also demanded that people from the other states should be transported in a non-air conditioned vehicles, because the central AC may spread the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-implements-new-new-discharge-protocol-500-beds-freed-up-for-covid-cases/story-V8c1G3V12P2GOo0L9KSEJJ.html
12-05-2020||City||Taking cue from UP, Ludhiana industry seeks exemption from labour laws for workers||Following Uttar Pradesh (UP) government’s decision to exempt factories and businesses from the purview of a few labour laws for three years, the Ludhiana chapter of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) on Monday demanded similar steps by the Punjab government. The city-based industry body has also demanded that the factory owners be exempted from contributing to social security schemes for labour, including employees’ provident fund and employees’ state insurance, which come to around 28.5% of salaries.A delegation of CICU members met cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and demanded that an ordinance be approved by the state government exempting the industry from certain labour laws for at least three years. With the passage of ‘Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance’ passed by the UP government last week, industries in the state are now exempted from laws related to the settling of industrial disputes, occupational safety, health and working conditions of workers, and those related to contract workers. Building and Other Construction Workers Act, Workmen Compensation Act, Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act and Section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act, however, still remain in force across the state. ‘TWO MILLION LABOURERS WORKING IN CITY INDUSTRIES’In Ludhiana, over 95,000 factories are registered with the district industries centre and have obtained Udyog Aadhaar in the past. As per the industrialists, out of two million labourers working in the city, around 13 lakh are migratory.CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja and general secretary Pankaj Sharma said the Punjab government should “provide immediate relief to the industry that is facing a huge crisis.” “Exemption from the labour laws will help the industry revive in the minimal time possible,” said Ahuja, adding that they have also asked the government to waive off fixed charges in power bills. Knitwear and Textile Club president Vinod Thapar reiterated similar thoughts.‘LABOUR WILL NOT BE EXPLOITED’National president of All Industries and Trade Forum (AITF), Badish Jindal, said, “Even the employers are not socially secure at this time. How can they bear the liability of 28.5% social security schemes for labour? Rules are imposed at a time when the industry works comfortably, but now, the government should take steps to provide relief to the industrialists so the industry sails through the ongoing crisis.” He also said that the exemption from labour laws would not result in labour exploitation. “As there is a shortage of labour in the industry, the labourers will have a choice to move from one unit to another,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-ludhiana-industry-seeks-exemption-from-labour-laws-social-security-schemes-for-workers/story-CkIpv4OBpw49l0SETNJ7oN.html

Apart from the red zones, 57,745 industries have been permitted to resume business and out them 25,000 have started their operations, he said.However, Desai specified that the industries in Mumbai, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Thane have not been given permission as they were located in the red zones with high number of Covid-19 (coronavirus) cases. The minister sought co-operation from all stakeholders and said that there should be no hurry to start industries located in red zones as the fight was against the spread of the disease. “We are thankful to the industries minister, industries secretary and CEO MIDC for connecting with hundreds of industry members from the Pune region. They updated us about progressive steps being taken by the government and we shared the areas of improvement and our set of recommendations, including the need to start industries in PMC and PCMC (outside containment zone) with all the safety guidelines. Thankful to CEO, MIDC for agreeing to do periodic calls to further improve coordination,” said MCCIA director general Prashant Girbane.“Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is determined to make the entire state a green zone,” he said, and added that sops in power tariffs and loan repayment would be given to ease the burden of industries. Desai said that the industries will have to pay electricity bills for the only the units will are utilised and concessions will be granted to those industries which had borrowed loans from banks. “A special economic package for the small-scale industries will also be announced soon as the work for the same in its final stages,” he said.Desai also added that a number of foreign companies from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan have expressed keen interest in setting up in Maharashtra and talks are underway with officials from the respective countries.

12-05-2020||World||India, Denmark vow to jointly combat Covid-19, share info on testing kits and vaccines||India and Denmark on Tuesday discussed the threat posed by Covid-19 to a globally connected world and vowed to jointly fight the pandemic by exchanging information on medical research, testing kits and development of vaccines. The two countries also deliberated upon the challenges posed by the “deep global economic crisis” caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar held his first virtual joint commission with his Danish counterpart Jeppe Kofod and reviewed bilateral ties. This was the third India-Danish Joint Commission Meeting (JCM).The two ministers noted that the pandemic is posing a significant threat to a globally connected world and forcing countries to restrict travel and interaction, a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement said. “Both sides agreed to jointly fight the Covid-19 pandemic by agreeing to share best practices and exchange information on medical research, testing kits and development of vaccines,” the statement said.Jaishankar and Kofod welcomed the dialogue between the Statens Serum Institute in Denmark and the office of the principal scientific adviser in India.They noted that the challenges of a deep global economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic also creates new opportunities for green transition and provide a new sustainable way forward for societies of the two countries creating new jobs and growth, the MEA said.India and Denmark are well placed to take full advantage of such development and show global leadership, it said.Jaishankar said discussions strengthened focus on clean technology, urbanisation, renewable energy, green solutions and food processing.“Did my first virtual Joint Commission today. Couldn’t be with a better counterpart - FM @JeppeKofod of #Denmark,” Jaishankar tweeted. “Would encourage colleagues in other countries to follow suit.” “A productive review of our ties. Strengthened focus on cleantech, urbanisation, renewable energy, green solutions and food processing. And an even stronger political partnership,” he added.The two ministers agreed to work towards establishing a “green strategic partnership” between India and Denmark building on existing green and sustainable collaborations under the Joint Commission, which would focus on areas such as climate change, energy, circular economy, water, sustainable food and agriculture, the MEA said.Close government-to-government cooperation has already been established in water, urban development and animal husbandry and dairy, it said.In renewable energy, a new five-year India-Denmark Energy Partnership can build on the existing strong cooperation, the statement said. Both ministers discussed the growing participation in the International Solar Alliance and Denmark expressed its interest in joining this alliance at the earliest.The ministers reviewed the current state of bilateral relations and noted that the 70th anniversary of bilateral relations in 2019 and the 400-year anniversary of the establishment of the first trading post by Denmark in Tranquebar are being commemorated through various events and programmes. They agreed to hold Foreign Office Consultations during the second half of 2020 to discuss bilateral relations and issues of regional and global importance and a Policy Planning Dialogue to promote sharing on strategic and global trends of mutual interest at a mutually convenient date in the near future.Both sides expressed satisfaction at the progress made in the 8 Joint Working Groups (JWG) - on Renewable Energy, Environment, Agriculture & Animal Husbandry, Food Processing, Labour Mobility, Sustainable and Smart Urban Development, Science & Technology and Shipping. It was also discussed that the recently constituted Joint Working Group on Digitization would meet soon, the MEA said.Both sides also explored the possibility of establishing a Joint Working Group on Health to facilitate closer cooperation between the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, including institutional collaboration and joint research.The ministers recognised that there is immense potential for further expanding trade and investments, facilitating wider business-to-business contacts, and intensifying trade promotion and ease-of-doing-business activities, the MEA said.They agreed that a focus area could be green technologies promoting innovative solutions in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and both sides emphasized the urgent need to increase and facilitate more activities and linkages in these areas, it said.Both sides discussed the importance of innovative use of online and virtual interaction to ensure continuity of diplomatic and political contacts. Jaishankar and Kofod expressed views on multilateral issues in this context and shared the common position that there is a need to further strengthen multilateralism and work together to ensure those international organizations like the UN and WHO are strengthened and function effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-denmark-vow-to-jointly-combat-covid-19-share-info-on-testing-kits-and-vaccines/story-6pI5u3PwZ0KDUCuSdRYHsK.html
12-05-2020||World||UK court told how Nirav Modi threatened witnesses||Two videos showing witnesses recounting how they were threatened and passports confiscated allegedly at the behest of daimantaire Nirav Modi and his associates were played in the Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday as part of India’s extradition case. Judge Samuel Mark Gozee viewed the videos in which the witnesses narrated in Hindi and English how they were intimidated, insisting that they were not under any duress to make the statements. The videos are part of India’s evidence submitted to the court against Modi.The CBI has earlier filed supplementary chargesheets in an Indian court that Modi threatened to kill one of the directors of his company, Ashish Mohanbhai Lad, if he expressed a desire to return to India from Cairo.According to CBI, Lad had fled from Dubai to Cairo to avoid arrest and in June 2018, when he planned to return to India from Cairo, he was contacted Modi’s behalf by his brother, Nehal Modi, and threatened.The second day of the extradition trial began with Modi’s lawyer, Claire Montgomery, who appeared for businessman Vijay Mallya in his extradition case, set out broadly similar objections to Modi’s extradition.According to her, there is no prima facie case against Modi; he faced risk to his human rights in the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai; and he may not receive a fair trial if extradited. Modi appeared in court via video-link from the Wandsworth jail.Under the UK-India extradition treaty, the country requesting the extradition needs to establish in the requested country’s court that there is a prima facie case against the person – not a conviction – based on charges that would amount to offences in law in both countries.Montgomery blamed “incompetence” of the Punjab National Bank for the way in which credit and loans were extended to Modi and his companies. She quoted extensively from bank documents from 2004, and at one stage accused PNB of misleading the Reserve Bank of India on lending.Raising objections to documents submitted by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer Helen Malcolm, Montgomery claimed that many are inadmissible in court, she told judge Samuel Mark Goozee. There is “no underlying evidence” in India’s case, she added.She said the witness statements submitted by India had the same ‘defect’ as in the Mallya case: that they were ‘copy and paste’ examples, which raised doubts about their provenance and the ways in which theyw re secured under Section 161 of India’s Code of Criminal Procedure.The sovereign assurance given by the ministry of home affairs that Modi’s human rights would be protected in the Mumbai jail, she said, is “inadequate”, raising concerns about over-crowding, conditions, availability of medical facilities, and reminding the court that Modi faced “serious mental health issues.”Modi is now the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the CBI and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The additional offences relate to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”). They have not been joined to the CBI case, but will be dealt with at a separate later hearing likely in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-court-told-how-nirav-modi-threatened-witnesses/story-2XqmEULL6pK5U3rPOfTUfO.html

Authorities said that toll could rise.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack. The Taliban, Afghanistan’s main Islamist insurgency group which says it has halted attacks on cities under a U.S. troop withdrawal deal, denied involvement in both.The Islamic State militant group operates in Nangahar and has carried out a number of high-profile attacks in Kabul in recent months. On Monday security forces arrested its regional leader in the capital.The violence, as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic, risks derailing momentum towards U.S.-brokered peace talks between the Taliban and an Afghan government long sceptical of the insurgents’ renunciation of attacks.“If the Taliban cannot control the violence, or their sponsors have now subcontracted their terror to other entities —which was one of our primary concerns from the beginning — then there seems little point in continuing to engage Taliban in ‘peace talks,” tweeted Hamdullah Mohib, the government’s national security advisor.MOTHERS, CHILDREN, NURSESThe Kabul attack began in the morning when at least three gunmen wearing police uniforms entered the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital, throwing grenades and shooting, government officials said. Security forces had killed the attackers by the afternoon.“The attackers were shooting at anyone in this hospital without any reason. It’s a government hospital, and a lot of people bring in their women and children for treatment,” said Ramazan Ali, a vendor nearby who saw the start of the attack.The 100-bed government-run hospital hosted a maternity clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French name Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).MSF confirmed in a tweet that the hospital had been attacked. Just hours before it had tweeted a photo of a newborn at the clinic in his mother’s arms after being delivered safely by emergency caesarean section.Interior and health ministry officials said that mothers, nurses and children were among the dead and wounded.Photos from the Ministry of Interior showed two young children lying dead inside the hospital. Soldiers ferried infants out of the compound, some wrapped in blood-stained blankets. Officials said 100 people in total were rescued, including three foreign nationals.The neighbourhood is home to many members of Afghanistan’s Hazara community, a mostly Shia Muslim minority that has been attacked by Sunni militants from Islamic State in the past, including at a Kabul ceremony commemorating the death of one of its leaders in March.Rights group Amnesty International condemned both attacks.“The unconscionable war crimes in Afghanistan today, targeting a maternity hospital and a funeral, must awaken the world to the horrors civilians continue to face,” the group tweeted. “There must be accountability for these grave crimes.”Foreign powers including the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey and Pakistan released statements condemning the violence.Last week, security forces killed and arrested several members of an Islamic State cell that authorities said was responsible for several attacks in Kabul including one on a Sikh temple in March. A roadside blast in the capital on Monday, which wounded four civilians, was claimed by the group.Afghanistan is also facing violence around the country from the Taliban, even as the United States tries to usher in peace talks after signing a troop withdrawal agreement in February with the militants. The Taliban say they are holding back from attacking urban centres and their operations are aimed at government security forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-newborns-among-16-dead-in-kabul-hospital-attack-24-killed-in-funeral-bombing/story-idO6xpHy2XM88uCgR1xYyN.html

A small, poorly armed separatist group has been battling for independence since then.___Corrects that Lin was from Maryland, not Ohio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-pilot-dies-in-plane-crash-in-indonesia/story-4OFSiaXPdLuDMXHiqYtfaP.html

This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.”Fauci’s “checkpoints” are conditions laid down in guidelines for reopening prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for undoing the lockdown in phases, with clear markers for moving from one phase to the next. The White House has blocked its release.Asked specifically about his NYT remarks at the hearing, Fauci made the same argument but in different words. The “consequences could be really serious”, he said and added later that premature reopening could lead to “little spikes that might turn into outbreaks”.The immunologist testified remotely through video, along with two other top officials of the president’s task force, Stephen Kahn and Robert Redfield, who are all in self-quarantine after possible exposure to the virus.Fauci’s warning to the lawmakers came at a time when US fatalities have crossed another bleak milestone to rise to 80,684, accounting for every third death worldwide; infections rose to 1.34 million.President Donald Trump is eager to reopen the country with an eye on his re-election prospects later in the year and has called for it repeatedly, while at the same time, leaving the final decision to state governor. He has backed protests against the lockdown and publicly criticized states that are being cautious.A widely respected research model, which has been cited the White House coronavirus task force members often, has doubled its forecast to more than 134,000 deaths at the current speed and nature of the reopening. Trump has insisted the model does not take into account social-distancing.But the president himself doesn’t observe these social distancing guidelines and has continued to not use a mask or a face covering during his meetings and engagements, even as he was instructed all White House staff to it, in the aftermath of two White House personnel testing positive.“If they’re a certain distance from me or if they’re a certain distance from each other, they do,” he told reporters at a White House news briefing when asked. “In the case of me, I’m not -- I’m not close to anybody.”The president walked out of the briefing shortly, after heated exchanges with two female reporters. He had asked a Chinese American reporter to check with China in response to an unrelated question, which he went on to call “nasty”. He had then denied another reporter a chance to ask her questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-serious-consequences-of-premature-reopening-of-us-warns-white-house-scientist-fauci/story-skjCam0SFT9XKj9gvTr7BK.html

12-05-2020||World||Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman hospitalised with coronavirus||Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says he is hospitalized with the coronavirus.Peskov, a key aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin, told the Interfax news agency on Tuesday, “Yes, I’ve gotten sick. I’m being treated.”Peskov, 52, has been Putin’s spokesman since 2008, but started working him with in the early 2000s.Russians who have the virus but light or no symptoms of illness are allowed to stay home, and it wasn’t immediately clear if Peskov’s hospitalization reflects the gravity of his condition or was an extra precaution.Reporters from the Kremlin pool said on Twitter that Peskov was last seen in public on April 30 “at a meeting with Vladimir Putin.” It was not clear whether it means the two were in the same room, as Putin has been conducting all his meetings via teleconference in recent weeks.Since early in the outbreak, the Russian president minimized meetings and switched to holding daily video calls with Cabinet members and aides.Peskov’s announcement comes just a day after Putin said Russia was successful in slowing down infections and announced easing some of the nationwide lockdown restrictions.Russia has reported more than 232,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 2,100 virus-related deaths, as of Tuesday. Hours before Putin made televised remarks Monday about ending the country’s partial economic lockdown, health officials reported a daily record of over 11,600 new cases.Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin revealed on April 30 that he had tested positive for the virus and planned to self-isolate. Putin asked the prime minister to call him after checking into a hospital.Mishustin’s spokesperson said Monday that the prime minister “continues to undergo treatment in one of the state-run medical facilities” and his health was improving, but gave no details about the severity of his condition.___Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-vladimir-putin-s-spokesman-hospitalised-with-coronavirus/story-TrGAv3gi3rZ2FVW56wm0iP.html

It is the right thing to do - the cost of not acting would have been far higher - but it is not something that can continue indefinitely into the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/job-retention-scheme-expensive-should-end-by-october-uk-fm-rishi-sunak/story-7fgP81BxbIsb50D6p9LoYL.html

That is why we have helped accelerate this from the start and are proud to be home to two of the world’s most promising vaccine development programmes at Oxford University and Imperial College, supported by a globally renowned pharmaceutical sector”.“But while we hope for a breakthrough, hope is not a plan. A mass vaccine or treatment may be more than a year away. Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine. So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome”.According to the Office for National Statistics, which registers deaths on the basis of death certificates issued and the causes mentioned in it, there were 35,044 deaths in England and Wales up to May 9.Adding the latest figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland in hospital settings, the total official UK death toll now stands at 40,011, making it the worst-affected country in Europe. According to data collected by the Johns Hopkins University, Italy has recorded 30,739 deaths, Spain 26,744 and France 26,604.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-extends-job-subsidy-to-october-as-death-toll-crosses-40-000/story-c6CKemLdvLH7sEeEG13UkL.html

The scope of the investigation should include permanent residents and floating population in the jurisdiction”.Among the first to be tested are the 5,000 are residents in and around Sanmin residential community, where the cluster was discovered, and another 14,000 from the nearby market named Duoluokou.The new cluster case has triggered a fear of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the city, which was lifting restrictions in a staggered way in the past one month.Meanwhile, a laundry worker in northeast China’s Jilin province is likely to have infected a dozen others with the coronavirus after she was infected by contaminated clothes during her work, experts have told Chinese state media.According to the tabloid, Global Times, the 45-year-old woman is said to have worked at a laundry service for a local public security bureau in Shulan city where officers had close contact with visitors from Russia between April 8 and 30. The virus has now spread from the woman to her husband, three sisters, other family members and close contacts of those confirmed cases, according to the local health authority.The city of around 630000 people have been put under a partial lockdown since Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-on-10-day-battle-to-test-all-for-covid-19-after-cluster-infection/story-GaUc02JY89aDTUqmNehXdI.html

Afghan forces carried out newborn babies and their mothers as they evacuated the hospital, and at least four people were reported wounded.Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a suicide bomber targeted a funeral in eastern Nangarhar province — a hotbed of the Islamic State group — on Tuesday, killing 10 people and wounding at least 30.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Kabul attack but both the Taliban and the IS are active in the Afghan capital and its surroundings, and both frequently target the military and security forces, as well as civilians. The Taliban later denied they were involved.In Kabul, black smoke rose into the sky over the hospital in the city’s Dashti Barchi, a mostly Shiite neighborhood that has been the site of many past attacks by Islamic State militants. Interior Ministry spokesman Tareq Arian said that over 80 women and babies were evacuated by Afghan security forces as the firefight got underway.Photos shared by the ministry show newborn babies and their mothers being carried out of the hospital. “The forces are trying to eliminate the terrorists and bring the situation under control,” said Arian. He later added that at least one of the attackers was shot dead.Wahid Majroh, deputy public health minister, rushed to the site from where he said at least four people were wounded. It was unclear why the hospital in Dashti Barchi, a 100-bed facility, was targeted.In the attack in the eastern Nangarhar province, Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the suicide bomber targeted a funeral ceremony in Khewa district for a local pro-government militia commander who had died of a heart attack on Monday night.The bomber struck as mourners had gathered, killing at least 10 and wounding 30, Khogyani said.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid later tweeted that the Taliban were not involved in either the Kabul or the Nangarhar attack.The IS, meanwhile, claimed it was behind a spate of attacks on Monday in Kabul when four bombs, one placed under a garbage bin and the other three by the roadside, went off in the northern part of the city, wounding four civilians, including a child.The Afghan intelligence service said in a statement later Monday that the agency has arrested an IS leader in the region, Zia-ul Haq, also known as Shaikh Abu Omer Al-Khorasani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-gunmen-storm-maternity-clinic-in-shiite-area-of-kabul/story-YGL9978MPoRxDj295H3ubN.html

It says this can be accomplished by merging ad hoc relief allowances from 2016-2019 into the basic pay designated in 2017. “Thereafter, allowing increase in pay @20% of revised pay scales in financial year 2020-21.”Last year the military “voluntarily agreed” to cut its expenditures due to the “critical financial situation” facing the country, and skipped a routine increase in the annual defence budget. This did not include a Rs 260 billon pension bill for retired soldiers, which is covered by the federal government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-pakistan-s-austerity-drive-military-seeks-20-per-cent-pay-hike/story-Xfxpr96Ecuz2uqDw0f11eN.html
12-05-2020||World||No prima facie case against Nirav Modi, claims lawyer||The defence team of dimanataire Nirav Modi on Tuesday challenged the grounds on which India has sought his extradition to face charges of major financial offences, insisting that there is no prima facie case against him, besides raising the issue of risk to his human rights in a Mumbai jail.Under the UK-India extradition treaty, the country requesting the extradition needs to establish in the requested country’s court that there is a prima facie case against the person – not a conviction – based on charges that would amount to offences in law in both countries.Claire Montgomery, who appeared for businessman Vijay Mallya in his extradition case, set out broadly similar objections to Modi’s extradition on the second day of the five-day extradition trial in the Westminster Magistrates Court.The objections claimed include lack of a prima facie case against Modi, risk to his human rights in the Arthur Road jail, and the claim that he may not receive a fair trial if extradited. Modi appeared in court via video-link from the Wandsworth jail.According to her, the “incompetence” of the Punjab National Bank was responsible for the ways in which credit and loans were extended to Modi and his companies. She quoted extensively from bank documents from 2004, and at one stage accused PNB of misleading the Reserve Bank of India on lending.Raising objections to documents submitted by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer Helen Malcolm, Montgomery claimed that many are inadmissible in court, she told judge Samuel Mark Goozee. There is “no underlying evidence” in India’s case, she added.The sovereign assurance given by the ministry of home affairs that Modi’s human rights would be protected in the Mumbai jail, she said, is “inadequate”, raising concerns about over-crowding, conditions, availability of medical facilities, and reminding the court that Modi faced “serious mental health issues.”Malcolm told the court on Monday that loans and credit were obtained by Modi and his companies fraudulently and when the fraud was discovered, Modi allegedly began a campaign to intimidate witnesses. Mobile phones and a server were destroyed, she said.Malcolm named bank officials and cited documents to recount Modi’s alleged laundering of money and transfer of funds through accounts of members of his family, entities and properties in various countries, including in the United States.According to the CBI, Modi, brother Nehal Modi and two business associates tried to threaten witnesses and destroy evidence, which came to light after nine employees submitted details of how Modi and others took them to Cairo against their will, offered bribes and threatened them.Modi’s defence team is due to present witnesses, including expert on prisons Alan Mitchell, who also appeared in the Mallya case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-prima-facie-case-against-nirav-modi-claims-lawyer/story-CKD7G88S7jCFVRf3ASa2jN.html

Yes I’m furious”.The police said Russel Rawlingson, 50, has been charged with “using threatening/abusive/insulting words/behaviour to cause harassment/alarm/distress following an incident in which a television crew were verbally abused in Leicester city centre on Sunday”.Leicester in the east Midlands has a large population of Indian origin, many of whom settled there after being expelled from Uganda in the early 1970s. They and successive generations have rejuvenated local economy and hold senior roles in various walks of life.A BBC spokesman added: “While preparing to broadcast, our reporter, her production team and guests were subjected to racist and abusive behaviour. We will not tolerate racism or abuse of our staff.”Under UK lockdown rules, journalists are categorised as ‘essential workers’ and are able to move around in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-man-held-for-racist-abuse-of-indian-origin-journalist/story-gdnCtuXQrJK6Q4DRQjrshL.html
12-05-2020||World||China calls for coronavirus vigilance, warns against complacency||Chinese health authorities called on Tuesday called for vigilance to be maintained against the novel coronavirus as new clusters emerge, even though the peak of the epidemic has passed in the country where it first appeared.In the past two weeks, new cases have been reported in seven provinces, including Hubei, the original epicentre of the outbreak late last year.On Monday, Wuhan, capital of Hubei, reported its first cluster of infections since a lockdown on the city was lifted a month ago.The reappearance of clusters suggested that counter-epidemic measures could not be relaxed, Mi Feng, spokesman at the National Health Commission, told a media briefing. While prevention and control efforts had normalised, that did not mean measures could be eased, Mi said.As of Monday, mainland China had 115 current confirmed cases, while 5,470 people were under medical observation for signs of novel coronavirus infection.A major worry is asymptomatic cases - people who show no clinical signs of infection but spread the virus. The number of such cases is not known as they only appear on the radar of health authorities when they show up in tests.In Beijing, where just 13 cases are still being treated, health authorities also warned against complacency. “Even after the 13 patients have recovered and have been discharged from hospital, that does not mean there is zero risk afterwards,” Lei Haichao, head of the Beijing Health Commission, told a media briefing.Beijing was among the few places in China that upheld strict rules on screening, testing and quarantine. It even stopped all international flights from landing in the city directly.But now China has to strike a balance between maintaining a degree of public health control and easing restrictions where it is deemed safe to do so and returning society and the economy to some state of normalcy. “The sealing of the city was once an extremely effective method for us in dealing with the epidemic, but now we need to find a balance between economic recovery and epidemic prevention and control,” Lei said. The government has allowed cinemas, museums and other recreational venues across the country to gradually reopen, a move welcome by a virus-hit services sector.But performance venues must keep their operating capacity at no more than 30%, the China Culture Administration Association said.The operating capacity of internet bars and entertainment venues should be capped at less than 50%, it said.Shanghai Disneyland reopened on Monday for the first time in three months, but restricted daily visitor numbers to 20% of capacity.

So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome,” he said.Admitting that a vaccine or drug-based treatment is the only “feasible long-term solution”, he said the UK has accelerated this with “promising” vaccine development programmes and a collaboration between Oxford University and pharma major AstraZeneca was a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a Covid-19 vaccine when it is ready.As part of global efforts, he flagged the GBP 388 million in aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatment, including GBP 250m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.“But while we hope for a breakthrough, hope is not a plan,” he said, as he unveiled his plan for starting to lift lockdown restrictions from this week in phases.Following a televised address to the nation on Sunday night and a statement in Parliament on Monday, the guidance comes into effect in public life across England from Wednesday when people will be allowed one-to-one contact with people other than those they live with, as long as they remain outside and two metres apart. They are allowed to play sport with a friend or family member from outside their household or socialise with them in the open air for the first time in more than six weeks since the lockdown was imposed.People are still advised to work from home where possible but start heading into work where necessary, in sectors such as construction and manufacturing, keeping the social distancing norms in place.Under the step by step plan, by the start of next month non-essential shops will also reopen, with some hairdressers, pubs and cinemas to follow from July. However, as part of a Covid-19 Alert System, if infection rates are seen to be rising again, restrictions would be tightened “possibly at short notice”.Fines for breaching the new rules will also be increased to GBP 100 and will double for each repeat offence, up to a maximum of GBP 3,200.Johnson said: “I must ask the country to be patient with a continued disruption to our normal way of life, but to be relentless in pursuing our mission to build the systems we need. The worst possible outcome would be a return to the virus being out of control – with the cost to human life, and – through the inevitable re-imposition of severe restrictions – the cost to the economy. We must stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so, save lives.“Then, as vaccines and treatment become available, we will move to another new phase, where we will learn to live with Covid-19 for the longer term without it dominating our lives.” The devolved administrations of Scotland and Wales are putting their own measures in place and keeping the “stay at home” message in place, rather than switch to the new “stay alert” message.The UK government’s latest messaging has come under attack from the Opposition and other sections of society over a feared lack of clarity for the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-only-solution-but-may-never-be-found-warns-uk-pm-johnson/story-GnM5oHPadC5lHntOSm2E8I.html
12-05-2020||World||Wuhan to test whole city of 11 million after new cases emerge||Wuhan, where the global coronavirus epidemic first started, has ordered officials to prepare to test its entire 11 million population after the central Chinese city reported a handful of new infections for the first time since its lockdown was lifted, according to state media reports.All districts in the city have been told to submit a plan which should lay out how they will prepare within ten days to conduct testing of everyone under their purview, said a document cited by local media reports as being released by Wuhan’s anti-virus department. The plan should prioritize the testing of vulnerable groups and areas like residential compounds, the document said.Six locally transmitted cases, reported on May 10 and 11, were found in people already under quarantine who were asymptomatic before testing positive, according to the local government. All six cases emerged from a single residential compound and were the first new infections found in Wuhan since its lockdown was lifted on April 8.The ambitious move to test everyone in Wuhan reflects China’s anxiety over a resurgence of the epidemic, which it managed to stamp out through draconian restrictions that locked down hundreds of millions of people at its peak in February. Wuhan was sealed off from Jan. 23 until April 8 in a months-long ordeal that saw scores die as the local health system collapsed.Even as its people cautiously return to normal life, the city has come under the global spotlight again after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration charged that the virus is linked to a laboratory in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. China has denied any link and the laboratory’s director said that no staff have been infected, which he said disproves the theory.Although the new cases in Wuhan are few and appear under control, they serve as a reminder of the risk China faces as it tries to reopen an economy that has seen its worst contraction since 1992.“Seven provinces reported new infections over the past 14 days, and clustered cases were continuing to increase,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission, said on Monday. China reported only one confirmed case on Tuesday, with no new infections in Wuhan.Fears of resurgence in other parts of China were highlighted on Sunday when the northeastern city of Shulan, which borders North Korea, was partially locked down after 11 new infections were discovered. Many cities in China still don’t allow cinemas and bars to operate, and heavy restrictions against social gatherings remain in place. Face masks are required for public transport and entering stores and public facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-to-test-whole-city-of-11-million-after-new-cases-emerge/story-0UnfbTPDwWltK2DobzoLsI.html

The attacker detonated his explosives in the middle of the ceremony, said Ataullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province.“Initial information shows about 40 people killed and wounded in the attack,” he added.The attack targeted the funeral ceremony for a local police commander, according to Khogyani.Battle-weary Nangarhar near the Pakistan border has long been a stronghold for both Islamic State and Taliban militants and has witnessed some of the hardest fighting in recent years. Both international forces and the Taliban in the area have targeted IS fighters, who have largely been pushed out of the province but still retain the ability to launch attacks on urban centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-blast-at-afghan-funeral-kills-several-govt/story-Us3xZ5bMxptEk0hNug2hSL.html
12-05-2020||World||Coal burned by China power plants jumps on heat, virus recovery||An indicator of China’s coal demand surged almost a third above levels last year as hotter-than-usual weather and factories rushing to make up for lost orders boosted power demand, spurring a rebound in prices.Coal use by coastal power plants at five major utilities rose for an eighth day to 577,100 tons as of Monday, more than 30% higher than the same period last year and the most since Jan. 12, data from China Coal Transport & Distribution Association showed. The figure eased slightly to 562,300 tons Tuesday.China is recovering from the slump in February, when much of the domestic economy was shut to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Factories and companies are now back to work, but restrictions to contain the outbreak in other countries have weighed on export orders and disrupted supply chains. Meanwhile, more than 100 meteorological observatory stations across the nation tested record high temperatures in early May.“Bulls are coming back to the thermal coal contracts as demand finally shows some strength after factories and businesses resumed operations,” Wang Miao, an analyst with Huatai Futures, said by phone. “Although there are still uncertainties ahead, such as the extent of the virus impact on overseas orders, market sentiment has markedly improved.”Futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange last week climbed back above 500 yuan a ton ($70.56), the floor price of a government-preferred range deemed a good balance for both miners and power generators. Prices sank to 479.8 yuan on April 14, the lowest since Aug. 2016, after record high domestic output in March, followed by a surge in imports, outpaced the recovery in demand.On Tuesday, futures ended 1.7% higher at 518.6 yuan a ton, highest since March 27.The nation’s electricity output shrank 4.6% in March, narrowing the record 8.2% slump in the first two months. The China Electricity Council expects power consumption to grow as much as 3% this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coal-burned-by-china-power-plants-jumps-on-heat-virus-recovery/story-Szr5vCP55zQ71dZgoslQmO.html

The quarantine order can be extended jointly with possible state of emergency extensions. Spain has so far extended its restrictions four times since mid-March.The measures applied to all travellers, including Spanish citizens returning to the country. Only truck drivers, airplane and ship crews, cross-border workers and health staff who are entering Spain to work are exempt from the quarantine.Spain is one of the worst-hit countries by the pandemic with more than 26,000 fatalities recorded and more than 220,000 diagnosed cases. The country has started phasing out restrictions in the past ten days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-orders-two-week-quarantine-for-incoming-travellers-from-may-15/story-kIbwIWakWnQhhaeHwvOOlJ.html

Out of these, Punjab recorded 11,568 cases, Sindh 12,017, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 4,875, Balochistan 2,017, Islamabad 679, Gilgit-Baltistan 442 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 86 patients.A total of 28 more people died in the last 24 hours in the country (between Sunday and Monday), taking the tally of Covid-19 deaths in Pakistan to 667. Another 8,212 recovered so far.But Pakistan began to lift its lockdown despite a surge in the number of Covid-19 positive ptients.On Monday, Prime Minister Khan chaired a meeting on the crisis where he was briefed about the latest efforts to control the spread of the disease in the wake of easing lockdown.According to an official statement, Khan said that “lockdown is being eased in a phased manner according to the situation and to keep a balance between business and health needs”.Public transport remains shut, but factories and offices have been allowed to resume operations. Restrictions on mosque attendance had already been lifted.Khan, however, asked people to take precautions so that the virus doesn’t run out of control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-drugmakers-warn-against-banning-raw-material-from-india-say-it-will-weaken-covid-19-fight/story-WD8mdbbx3fMYoR5vv9GeOK.html

12-05-2020||World||Workplace worries mount as US tracks new Covid-19 cases||Even as President Donald Trump urges getting people back to work and reopening the economy, thousands of new coronavirus infections are being reported daily, many of them job-related.Recent figures show a surge of cases in meat-packing and poultry-processing plants. There’s been a spike of new infections among construction workers in Austin, Texas, where that sector recently returned to work. Even the White House has proven vulnerable, with positive coronavirus tests for one of Trump’s valets and for Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe developments underscore the high stakes for communities nationwide as they gradually loosen restrictions on business.“The people who are getting sick right now are generally people who are working,” Dr. Mark Escott, a regional health official, told Austin’s city council. “That risk is going to increase the more people are working.”Austin’s concerns will likely be mirrored in communities nationwide as the reopening of stores and factories creates new opportunities for the virus to spread.To be sure, there are plenty of new infections outside the workplace — in nursing homes, and among retired and unemployed people, particularly in densely populated places such as New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and urban parts of New Jersey and Massachusetts.Yet of the 15 U.S. counties with the highest per-capita infection rates between April 28 and May 5, all are homes to meatpacking and poultry-processing plants or state prisons, according to data compiled by The Associated Press.The county with the highest per-capita rate was Tennessee’s Trousdale County, where nearly 1,300 inmates and 50 staffers recently tested positive at the privately run Trousdale Turner Correctional Center.In the federal prison system, the number of positive cases has increased steadily. As of May 5, there were 2,066 inmates who’d tested positive, up from 730 on April 25.The No. 2 county on AP’s list is Nobles County in Minnesota, which now has about 1,100 cases, compared to two in mid-April. The county seat, Worthington, is home to a JBS pork processing plant that employs hundreds of immigrants.“One guy said to me, ‘I risked my life coming here. I never thought something that I can’t see could take me out,’” said the Rev. Jim Callahan of St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Worthington.Nebraska’s Dakota County, home to a Tyson Foods meat plant, had recorded three cases as of April 15, and now has more than 1,000. There have been at least three Covid-19 deaths, including a Muslim woman from Ethiopia who was among 4,300 employees at the Tyson plant.“These are sad and dangerous days,” the imam of a regional Islamic center, Ahmad Mohammad, told the Siouxland News.In northern Indiana’s Cass County, home to a large Tyson pork-processing plant, confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed 1,500. That’s given the county — home to about 38,000 residents — one of the nation’s highest per-capita infection rates.The Tyson plant in Logansport, Indiana, was closed April 25 after nearly 900 employees tested positive; it resumed limited operations Thursday after undergoing deep cleaning and installation of Plexiglas workstation barriers. Company spokeswoman Hli Yang said none of the 2,200 workers would return to work without being tested.Also hard hit by recent infections are counties in Virginia, Delaware and Georgia where poultry-processing plants are located.In New York, the hardest-hit state during most of the pandemic, a new survey suggests that factors other than the workplace were involved in many recent cases.The survey of 1,269 patients admitted to 113 hospitals over three recent days confounded expectations that new cases would be dominated by essential workers, especially those traveling on subways and buses. Instead, retirees accounted for 37% of the people hospitalized; 46% were unemployed.“We were thinking that maybe we were going to find a higher percentage of essential employees who were getting sick because they were going to work, that these may be nurses, doctors, transit workers. That’s not the case,” said Gov. Andrew Cuomo.In Pennsylvania, of 2,578 new cases between May 4 and May 6, more than 40% were people living in long-term care facilities. Health officials in Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County said of the 352 new cases between April 20 and May 5, 35% were residents in long-term care facilities and 14% were health care workers.Though the elderly continue to account for a disproportionate share of Covid-19 cases, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the age ratio is changing. In January-February, 76% of cases involved people 50 or older. Since March, only about half the cases are of that age range,Many health workers were among the earliest Americans to test positive. They continue to be infected in large numbers.Gerard Brogan, director of nursing practice for the California Nurses Association, says as many as 200 nurses a day tested positive in California recently. Nationwide, he says the National Nurses United had tallied more than 28,000 positive tests and more than 230 deaths among health workers.Among those recently testing positive was Dr. Pramila Kolisetty of Scarsdale, New York, who has a rehab and pain management practice in the Bronx and is married to a urologist.Even after New York imposed an extensive lockdown, she went to her office two to three times a week while trying to transition to telemedicine.“It took time for us to get ourselves organized,” she said. “We can’t just close the office and say, that’s it.”Some of her staff fell sick with Covid-19, and she started feeling symptoms a few weeks ago. After testing positive, she isolated at home and is now practicing telemedicine.Cuomo, the New York governor, said individual decisions could help slow the pace of new infections.“Much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself,” Cuomo said at a recent briefing. “Everything is closed down, the government has done everything it could. ... Now it’s up to you. Are you wearing a mask, are you doing the hand sanitizer?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/workplace-worries-mount-as-us-tracks-new-covid-19-cases/story-eNVnWE65r8u6nOKJ2mmviP.html
12-05-2020||World||US says China hacking Covid-19 vaccine research: Reports||The United States has said that hackers tied to the Chinese government are trying to steal the research on developing a vaccine against coronacvirus disease Covid-19.According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are planning to release a warning about the Chinese hacking.The hackers are also targeting information and intellectual property on treatments and testing for Covid-19, the reports further said.But the Chinese officials have rejected these allegations. “We are leading the world in Covid-19 treatment and vaccine research. It is immoral to target China with rumours and slanders in the absence of any evidence,” Chinese foreign affairs ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said.Last week in a joint message Britain and the United States warned of a rise in cyber attacks against health professionals involved in the coronavirus response by organised criminals “often linked with other state actors.”Days ago, China had issued a lengthy rebuttal of what it said were 24 “preposterous allegations” by some leading US politicians over its handling of the new coronavirus outbreak.A 30-page, 11,000-word article posted on the ministry website on Saturday night repeated and expanded on the refutations made during the press briefings.Another foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that the US accused China of not informing them about the pandemic on time, and of not doing enough but “we’ve repeatedly stated our position on these. However, since the US kept repeating these lies, we must strive to help the world see the truth through facts time and again.”The spokesperson further sharpened the attack on the US, saying it did not act fast enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-china-hacking-covid-19-vaccine-research-reports/story-EmCG3oDulhPNZP4YurV2nI.html

It’s based on the ability in this friendship to nevertheless disagree.”Peters said he did not think the issue would harm diplomatic ties with China, which is New Zealand’s biggest trading partner.Taiwan has reported only 440 coronavirus cases and seven related deaths, relatively low figures attributed to early and effective disease prevention and control work.Peters praised Taiwan’s response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and said there was a lot for other countries to learn from.“New Zealand’s position on Taiwan is about its tremendous success against COVID-19,” Peters said.When asked about China’s response later in the day, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand’s position on Taiwan was only related to its health response to COVID-19.“We have always taken a ‘One China’ policy, and that continues to be the case,” Ardern said.Ties between neighbouring Australia and China have frayed in recent months after Canberra called for an international investigation into the origins and spread of the coronavirus that was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.China has dismissed such a probe as groundless, saying the country has been open and transparent about the outbreak.(Reporting by Praveen Menon; Editing by Christopher Cushing)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-sticks-with-support-for-taiwan-at-who-despite-chinese-rebuke/story-CDlQRPNM63YNnUj1vPe0DI.html

The Opposition questioned the government’s move to ease lockdown.The criticism was led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader and former defence minister Khawaja Asif in the National Assembly.“The current situation that we are in is due to the approximately two months-long negligence showed by the government. When we had fewer deaths, the entire country was completely shut down. Now that we are seeing a dangerous spike in cases, they are easing lockdown restrictions,” he said on Monday.The National Assembly convened after a gap of nearly two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Speaker Asad Qaiser is among those who contracted the virus and is under recovery.“Two weeks ago, we were told that our testing capacity will be increased to 50,000. But now we are being told that it is only 20,000,” said Asif.Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said that the federal government was impeding efforts of the Sindh government to address the coronavirus crisis. He said that an ordinance prepared by the provincial government was not allowed by the governor.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi defended the government’s handling of the pandemic, saying the situation of Covid-19 in Pakistan was different as compared to Europe and the United States.“Our death and infection rate is 2.17 per cent.

So we have been largely spared from the larger consequences of this pandemic,” he said.Qureshi also claimed that Pakistan was ahead of other South Asian countries in handling the coronavirus crisis.Minister of Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar said hunger was as much a threat to Pakistan as the coronavirus itself. “Ours is not a western developed country where people can sit home and eat. We have to balance hunger and poverty with the virus,” he said in the National Assembly.He said that if the government continued with the lockdown, 20 million people would go below the poverty line.The number of Covid-19 cases jumped to 31,684 in Pakistan.

It also quoted the governor of Khuzestan province, where the county is located, as saying there had been a sharp rise in new cases across the province.Last Friday, prayer gatherings resumed in up to 180 Iranian cities and towns seen as being at low risk of coronavirus contagion after a two-month suspension, state media reported.The resumption of Friday prayers — still banned in the capital Tehran and some other major cities — followed the reopening last Monday of 132 mosques in areas consistently free of the virus.Schools will reopen next week, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, according to the official presidency website.Iran has already lifted a ban on inter-city trips and malls, with large shopping centres resuming activities.Iran’s coronavirus deaths rose by 45 in the past 24 hours to 6,685, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV. It has 109,286 diagnosed cases.Iran, one of the countries in the Middle East hit hardest by the novel coronavirus, has begun easing restrictions on normal life in order to support its economy, already battered by U.S. sanctions. Health officials have repeatedly warned, however, that easing restrictions could lead to a renewed spike in the number of infections. Rouhani also announced the replacement of the minister of industry, mines and trade on Monday, according to the official presidency website, a decision that appeared to be an attempt to boost the economy.Hossein Modares Khiabani will replace Reza Rahmani as the caretaker head of the ministry, the announcement said without noting why Rahmani was dismissed.Rouhani called on Khiabani to stabilise car prices, eliminate obstacles for domestic production and expand non-oil exports.In a letter addressed to Rouhani, Rahmani wrote that the reason for his removal was that the parliament had not agreed to the formation of a ministry of commerce, according to Fars news, which published a copy of the letter.Rouhani’s chief of staff had warned Rahmani that if he did not lobby parliamentarians for the formation of the ministry he would be dismissed, Rahmani wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-lockdown-all-mosques-in-iran-to-reopen-temporarily-today/story-s85VXRKRkjg7ZMVs8w9FCI.html

However, not when only the antimalarial drug was administered.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here President Trump had once promoted the antimalarial drug, by itself or in combination with the antibiotic, as a game-changer and had personally campaigned for it to be administered to patients arguing they had nothing to lose, because it had been used for decades and had been proven to be safe for humans.The US president also tried to shore up the availability of the drug in the United States and leaned on India, one of the largest producers of hydroxychloroquine in the world, to release a massive US purchase order of the drug blocked from shipping by an export ban on it and two dozen other medicines. The Modi government lifted the curbs and the US consignment was shipped shortly.Hydroxychloroquine is being used in India as a prophylaxis for health workers at the frontline of the country’s response to the epidemic.“Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with Covid-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality,” researchers behind the study wrote in a article in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association (JAMA), a weekly journal of peer-reviewed research.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage And there are side-effects of the combination, contrary to what the president had so frequently claimed. “Compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin …. but not hydroxychloroquine alone … or azithromycin alone …,” said the study.This was an observational study of severely ill hospitalized patients who had been prescribed the medicines, and not a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard for determining the efficacy and safety of a drug. They are underway separately and results are awaited. President Trump has not spoken of the medicines lately. News reports indicated that advance word of the findings were shared with the federal government two weeks ago. The US Food and Drug Administration, the regulator of medicines, that had issued allowed the antimalarial drug to be used on compassionate grounds earlier restricted its use only for the clinical trials strictly under the supervision of physicians subsequently, citing toxic after effects.But here is what Trump said last week when asked about studies questioning the use of hydroxychloroquine: “I’ve had three calls in the last three days, four days, of people that took it, and they’re giving it credit for saving their lives.” He went on to qualify it severely given new information: “Here’s -- here’s what we’ve been reduced to in this country: The Democrats, the radical left, whatever you want, would rather see people -- I’m going to be very nice. I’m not going to say “die”. I’m going to say would rather see people not get well because they think I’m going to get credit if, you know, hydroxychloroquine works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-wonder-drug-against-covid-19-does-not-work-says-us-study/story-sT9RfN8wOPHXqOLdCsGvMJ.html
12-05-2020||World||China’s Wuhan sees first new virus cases since lockdown lifted||Wuhan, where the global coronavirus epidemic first started, reported its first new infections since the Chinese city ended its 76-day lockdown on April 8.The six locally transmitted cases, reported on May 10 and 11, were found in people already under quarantine who were asymptomatic before testing positive, according to the local government. All six cases emerged from a single residential compound.Although the new cases are few and appear under control, they serve as a reminder of the risks China faces as it tries to reopen an economy that has seen its worst contraction since 1992.“Seven provinces reported new infections over the past 14 days, and clustered cases were continuing to increase,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission, said on Monday. China reported only one confirmed case on Tuesday, with no new infections in Wuhan.Wuhan will enhance the control of residential areas, expand testing among key people and strengthen the management of asymptomatic patients to contain the spread of the virus, according to a statement Sunday by the city’s health commission.Fears of resurgence were highlighted on Sunday when the northeastern city of Shulan, which borders North Korea, was partially locked down after 11 new infections were discovered. Many cities in China still don’t allow cinemas and bars to operate, and heavy restrictions against social gatherings remain in place. Face masks are required for public transport and entering stores and public facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wuhan-sees-first-new-virus-cases-since-lockdown-lifted/story-W1BWkEtWxyjH4Fgi6p1iYK.html

Having lost their H-1B job, they have to go back to India within the stipulated 60 days as required by law. The couple has two kids aged one and six years who are American citizens.In the wee hours of Monday, they had to return from Newark airport as Air India refused to give their kids a ticket to fly to India along with them, despite them having a valid Indian visa. The young mother and father are Indian citizens.They said that the officials from Air India and (Indian) Consulate (in New York) were very cooperative.But they could not do anything as their hands were tied by the latest regulation issued by the Indian government, a shocked Ratna Pandey told PTI.“I would like to urge the Indian government to reconsider their decision on the humanitarian basis,” said the Indian national who has lost her job but could not leave the US within the stipulated 60 days to avoid any future visa complications.She now plans to make an appeal to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to extend their stay.Last month, H-1B visa holders, mostly Indians, launched a White House petition urging US President Donald Trump to extend their permissible stay from 60 to 180 days after job loss. However, there has been no decision from the White House so far.While there is no official statistics of how many Indian H-1B visa holders have lost their jobs, it is believed to be substantial.The US, due to the coronavirus pandemic, is experiencing an unprecedented unemployment rate and more than 33 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last two months. Given this massive job loss, Indians, who have lost their jobs, are unlikely to get one and thus many would have no other option but to travel back home.In the case of single mother Mamta (name changed), the situation is graver as her son is just three-month old. Only she was given the ticket and the infant was not allowed to fly along with her because he carried an American passport.“I would like to request the Indian government to let us fly back home. I don’t want to stay in the US any longer,” she told PTI hours after being prevented from boarding her hometown Ahmedabad-bound flight from Newark on Sunday.“I am alone here. I don’t have a relative here. It’s a difficult situation,” she said.“Vande Bharat Mission is a humanitarian mission. But this is certainly inhuman,” said Rakesh Gupta (name changed) from Washington DC.An H-1B professional, Gupta has lost his job and needs to return to India within the stipulated 60 days. He and his wife, Geeta (name changed) being Indian citizens, received the confirmation of their seats in the flight but have been told that their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter cannot travel with them as she carried an OCI card.“I don’t believe this,” he said.Unlike the Pandey couple and Mamta, who had made the payment of USD 1,361 per ticket for their flight back home, Rakesh has not made the payment. Air India has said that the money would be refunded.All the three Indian citizens requested the Indian government to help them travel back home by making necessary changes in the current regulations.As per a recent government notification, all existing Indian visa holders, and visa-free travel facility, granted to OCI card holders who are not in India, have been suspended till restrictions on international air travel remains.New York-based community leader Prem Bhandari said that the May 5 travel advisory has created multiple painful issues for the OCI card holders in the US and also to Indian citizens who are either on Green Card or H-1B visas and want to travel back home, but cannot leave their kids who are Americans by birth.“We would like to express our disappointment with the discrimination between OCIs and citizens in respect of entering India at this critical stage when many OCIs have lawfully built their homes, families and businesses in India,” Bhandari said in a letter to Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/visa-oci-card-suspension-prevents-several-indians-in-us-from-flying-back-home/story-4eFuEXfcERoqQPR9XzX2JN.html

However, Quebec, the province worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, has started reopening several schools and has also eased some restrictions as the overall caseload appeared to be tapering in the country. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, however, has warned that moving too quickly on trying to return to some normalcy could force the country back into “confinement” this summer.Canada recorded 5,100 deaths by Monday evening, as the tally of those infected also closed in on 70,000. A significant portion of the death toll was in the province of Quebec, at over 3,000. But on Monday, some students were back in their classrooms in elementary schools with class sizes being limited to a maximum of 15. That, though, was outside the Montreal area, as that city remains under severe restrictions being the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis in Quebec. Other provinces like Ontario have also taken to gradual easing, with more businesses allowed to reopen, though the province will maintain emergency measures till June 2.These moves come as the situation seemed to be improving in the country. In a statement, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said, “We have come a long way in a short time since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared and our efforts have undoubtedly prevented wider spread of the virus across the country.”However, Trudeau has warned against a rush to ease restrictions. During a media briefing, he said, “We are still in the emergency phase”, adding that the “vast majority of Canadians will continue to need to be very careful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-still-in-emergency-phase-rush-can-force-canada-back-into-confinement-warns-justin-trudeau/story-EXHY14d2KBnzD3NwmZrjBI.html
12-05-2020||World||Will not pay China for eight million ‘substandard’ masks: Canadian PM Trudeau||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his Government will not pay for nearly eight million substandard medical grade masks that were sourced from China.These N95 masks were part of a consignment of 11 million, of which only one million were found to meet Canadian standards while another 1.6 million are still undergoing testing.During a media briefing, Trudeau was categorical on the Federal Government refusing to pay for substandard personal protective equipment, as he said the country “will not be paying for masks that do not match the standards and quality we want for our front-line workers.”This matter has further hampered relations between Canada and China, which also suffered after a senior executive of the Chinese company Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, was taken into custody by authorities in Vancouver in late 2018, and China retaliated by arresting two Canadians including a diplomat.Trudeau may have further irked China by openly thanking Taiwan for its “generous donation” of 500,000 masks to Canada. Canada is also part of a group of nations, led by the United States and Japan, seeking observer status for Taiwan at the World Health Organisation, a move strongly opposed by China, which does not recognise the existence of Taiwan as a separate nation.Trudeau also said discussions with respect to the defective masks were in progress with the Montreal-based supplier, which has not been identified. “We will not be burdened with masks that do not fit our stringent requirements,” he said.This is not the first time that Canada has faced problems with such masks from China. Last month, a million such masks imported from China were found to be faulty. Early last month, the country’s largest city, Toronto, returned nearly 62,000 masks, to a Chinese vendor. At that time, the Mayor’s office noted in a statement, “After reports of ripping and tearing, further inspection of the masks determined that the masks ordered did not meet the city’s standard and specifications. The masks are being returned, and the vendor has committed to a full refund.”Canadian officials have privately told the media in the country that Chinese vendors, backed by Beijing, have indulged in price gouging in a “competitive market” for such protective equipment, inflating the prices to five times the rate prior to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-not-pay-china-for-nearly-eight-million-substandard-masks-canadian-pm-trudeau/story-GbAAr8aQECusFv1zHx59eO.html

Don’t ask me, ask China that question, OK?”Jiang, who identifies herself in her Twitter bio as a “Chinese born West Virginian,” pushed back.“Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?” she said, implying it was due to her race.“I’m saying it to anybody who would ask a nasty question like that,” Trump said.He then attempted to move on to another reporter as Jiang continued to press him about his response.Trump called on another female reporter but then immediately called on someone else.When the woman tried to ask her question, Trump abruptly ended the press conference and walked back into the White House.The internet was quick to rally round Jiang, with the hashtag #StandWithWeijiaJiang soon trending on Twitter.“I #StandWithWeijiaJiang against Trump’s racist tantrums,” tweeted “Star Trek” actor and prominent Asian-American activist George Takei.Reporter and CNN political analyst April Ryan, who has also been on the receiving end of Trump’s words, tweeted: “Welcome to the club! This is sickening! It is his habit!”Trump, who has never been shy about his dislike for the news media, has often locked horns with journalists during his coronavirus press briefings.More than 80,000 people have died in the US from the coronavirus pandemic, out of more than 1.3 million cases, according to the latest figures on Monday from Johns Hopkins University, by far the highest death toll of any country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-abruptly-ends-press-conference-after-spat-with-reporter/story-cwr1W9viZezeGONDdIRP4K.html
12-05-2020||World||White House directs staff to wear masks after officials contract coronavirus||The White House on Monday directed all people entering the West Wing, where the daily operations of President Donald Trump’s administration are carried out, to wear masks after two aides tested positive for the coronavirus, administration officials said.The new guidelines, released in a memo to the president’s staff on Monday afternoon, reflect a tightening of procedures at the highest levels of the US government over fears that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence could be exposed to the virus.Click here fro full Covid-19 coverageTrump’s military valet and Pence’s press secretary both tested positive for the coronavirus last week.The 73-year-old president said on Monday he did not think those cases suggested the White House system had broken down.“I felt no vulnerability whatsoever,” Trump said, adding he felt the situation was controlled “very well.”Still, the president said he would discuss maintaining some distance from Pence, perhaps by communicating with him by phone, for a period of time. Pence worked at the White House on Monday but did not attend a news conference held in the Rose Garden. Officials who attended wore masks, and speakers used a different podium from the one used by Trump.ABC News first reported about the memo, which also said unnecessary visits from other parts of the White House complex to the West Wing area, which includes the Oval Office and work space for senior advisers, are being discouraged.Officials who work near the president have been getting tested for the coronavirus but previously had not been wearing masks on a regular basis.“Common sense has finally prevailed,” one senior administration official told Reuters.Trump has been resistant to wearing a mask himself and has not put one on in public, though he said he tried some on backstage during a visit to a mask factory in Arizona last week.On Saturday he met the top leaders of the US military, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and members of his national security team in the White House Cabinet Room. The officials did not wear masks but had been tested for the virus in advance, a Pentagon spokesman said, adding that social distancing measures appeared to have been met. Secret Service agents in the room wore masks.The president is in the age group that is considered high risk for complications with the coronavirus, which has killed more than 80,000 people in the United States alone and ravaged countries and economies worldwide.Staff members including Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, wore masks on White House grounds on Monday.The White House said last week it was stepping up precautions for people who spend time around Trump and Pence, both of whom have resumed travel outside of Washington. The two men are being tested for the virus daily.“In addition to social distancing, daily temperature checks and symptom histories, hand sanitizer, and regular deep cleaning of all work spaces, every staff member in close proximity to the president and vice president is being tested daily for Covid-19 as well as any guests,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.After Pence’s spokeswoman, Katie Miller, tested positive for the virus last week, Trump was asked whether people in the West Wing would begin to wear masks. He responded that people already were doing so. But he and his guests that day had not donned masks, and staff in the West Wing were not wearing them either.Miller is married to Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide and speech writer for the president.Some who had contact with Katie Miller have gone into partial quarantine. An administration official said Pence worked from the White House on Monday but would be maintaining distance from the president for the immediate future, in consultation with the White House medical unit.“We can talk on the phone,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-directs-staff-to-wear-masks-after-officials-contract-coronavirus/story-Sxu1OlyP7ysxyE3m9gT4nJ.html
12-05-2020||World||UN says 7 or 8 ‘top’ candidates for a Covid-19 vaccine exist||The World Health Organization chief said Monday there are around seven or eight “top” candidates for a vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus and work on them is being accelerated.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a U.N. Economic and Social Council video briefing the original thinking two months ago was that it may take 12 to 18 months for a vaccine. But he said an accelerated effort is under way, helped by 7.4 billion euros ($8 billion) pledged a week ago by leaders from 40 countries, organizations and banks for research, treatment and testing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe said the $8 billion will not be enough, and additional funds will be needed to speed up the development of a vaccine, but more importantly to produce enough “to make sure that this vaccine reaches everyone — (and) there’s no one be left behind.”“We have good candidates now,” Tedros said. “The top ones are around seven, eight. But we have more than a hundred candidates.”“We are focusing on the few candidates we have which can bring probably better results and accelerating those candidates with better potential,” he said.Tedros did not identify the top candidates.Since January, he said, “WHO has been working with thousands of researchers all over the world to accelerate and track vaccine development from developing animal models to clinical trial designs and everything in between.”Tedros said there is also a consortium of more than 400 scientists involved in vaccine development and diagnostics.The WHO chief stressed that Covid-19 is “very contagious and it’s a killer,” with over 4 million cases now reported to WHO and almost 275,000 lives lost.While new cases are declining in Western Europe, they are increasing in Eastern Europe, Africa, southeast Asia, the eastern Mediterranean and other regions, he said.Tedros said “the pandemic is teaching us many painful lessons,” especially the importance of having strong national and regional health systems.“And yet on current trends, more than 5 billion people will not access these essential services by 2030” — the ability to see a health worker, access essential medicine, and have running water in hospitals, he said.He stressed that as the response to Covid-19 continues, nations must also lay the foundations for a healthy, safer and fairer world.“The world spends around $7.5 trillion on health care each year, almost 10 percent of global GDP, but the best investments are in promoting health and in preventing disease at the primary health care level which will save lives and save money,” Tedros said.U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told the briefing that all nations are “in it together” but the immediate priority must be the most vulnerable countries and communities.She called for a new debt relief program for vulnerable countries so their economies can recover.And she said measures to protect and stimulate the economy, from cash transfers to credits and loans must be targeted at women “who make up the majority of those in the hardest-hit informal economy, and who are at the forefront of the community response.”The head of the International Labor Organization said the U.N. agency estimates the equivalent of 305 million full-time jobs will be lost around the world in the second quarter of this year, which ends on June 30.ILO Director-General Guy Ryder told the briefing that by comparison, only 22 million full-time jobs were lost immediately when the financial crisis hit in 2008-2009, “so you can see we’re in an entirely different place.”Ryder said it’s also often forgotten that 60 percent of the global workforce of 3.3 billion have jobs in the informal economy, most of them women.He said the ILO estimates that in the first month of the pandemic, with lock-downs and economic shutdowns, “these people have lost on average 60 percent of their income, their revenues from work.” And they are concentrated in countries with scarce resources and the weakest social protection systems, he said.Ryder called for international cooperation to help those most in need and for stepped up efforts to keep enterprises alive, retain jobs, maintain the link between enterprises and workers even when they can’t work now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-7-or-8-top-candidates-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-exist/story-STHVqwuc8xClxXcKJMEgHJ.html

With millions of Americans out of work and much of the economy at a virtual standstill, a growing number of states are ending tough restrictions on commerce and social life put in place to slow the outbreak.Some auto suppliers in Michigan, a Midwest industrial powerhouse hard hit by the pandemic and its economic fallout, reopened plants on Monday with skeleton crews to get ready for a resumption of vehicle production next week. Skilled-trades workers and salaried employees also began returning auto assembly plants themselves to prepare for the wider restart. “We’re starting up our foundry this week in anticipation of the orders coming in next week,” Joe Perkins, chief executive of Busche Performance Group, an engineering, casting and machining firm, said in a telephone interview.Factory workers will be issued face masks, checked for fever and required to submit health-screening questionnaires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/workers-in-us-auto-industry-return-to-jobs-amid-concerns-of-2nd-covid-19-wave/story-4oUtRt6LoaQK7VNCtH2TdJ.html
12-05-2020||World||‘Ready for arrest’: Tesla CEO Elon Musk reopens California plant against local order||Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday said production was resuming at the automaker’s sole US vehicle factory, in California, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested it should be him.The move comes as states and cities around the United States experiment with ways to safely reopen their economies after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work.Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory’s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from US President Donald Trump.In an email on Monday, Tesla referred to an order on Thursday by California’s governor allowing manufacturers to resume operations and said that as of Sunday, previously furloughed employees were back to their regular employment status.“We’re happy to get back to work and have implemented very detailed plans to help you keep safe as you return,” according to the email seen by Reuters and titled “Furlough Has Ended And We Are Back To Work in Production!”Musk in a tweet said production was resuming on Monday, adding that he would join workers on the assembly line. “If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,” he wrote.Health officials in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is based, late on Monday said they were aware that Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.In a statement, officials said they expected a proposal from Tesla later on Monday and “hope Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures.” The statement did not specify consequences and said officials would not comment further.The county’s lockdown order says violations are punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. A spokeswoman for the Fremont Police Department on Monday said her office was enforcing the lockdown order at the direction of the health department and had been advised that the county is working with Tesla directly.Separately on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said California should do whatever is necessary to help the electric carmaker reopen its only US vehicle factory if it wants to keep the company in its state.California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he spoke to Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder’s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week. “I have not only known that company but I have known its founder for many, many years,” Newsom said in his daily coronavirus press briefing. “I have great reverence for their technology, for their innovative spirit, for their leadership.”Tesla, which also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin, on Saturday sued the county, alleging it had violated California’s constitution by defying Newsom’s orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.Musk has discussed opening a second US factory outside California in the past. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.Since his threat to leave California on Saturday, officials from Texas, Georgia, Utah, Oklahoma and Nevada have reached out to Musk on Twitter, encouraging him to relocate to their state.A Texas official said his county was available immediately to accommodate Tesla and invited the billionaire CEO for a visit.“We have a motivated, pro-business governor,” Richard Cortez, county judge of Texas’ Hidalgo County, said on Monday. “What we no longer have is a shelter at home mandate.”Musk in response tweeted: “Note is much appreciated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-ready-for-arrest-as-he-reopens-california-plant-against-local-order/story-gowsbH7BynfogJdTcO7J7O.html
12-05-2020||World||Donald Trump faces coronavirus risk at home as echoes to ‘reopen’ nation grow louder||As he encourages the country to “reopen,” President Donald Trump is confronting cases of the coronavirus in his own home, spotlighting the challenge the White House faces in instilling confidence in a nation still reeling from the pandemic.Two known cases of Covid-19 among staffers in one of the most-protected complexes in America have sent three of the nation’s top medical experts into quarantine and Vice President Mike Pence into “self-isolation.” The scare comes as the White House this week is emphasizing to the American people the steps being taken to assure their safety — in hopes that will coax them to resume normal activities.“This week - you’ll hear the @WhiteHouse talk about preparedness & confidence,” tweeted Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications. “The Trump Admin is working around the clock to build our testing capacity, grow our PPE stockpiles, distribute therapeutics, & get $ to states to SAFELY reopen in a way Americans can have CONFIDENCE in.”Yet, that message was undercut by the exposure of senior government officials to positive cases at the White House itself.Pence on Monday led the White House’s weekly call with governors from an isolated room, after his press secretary tested positive Friday. Dr. Deborah Birx and other staffers participated as usual from a conference room in the Situation Room, Pence said, explaining the “slightly different circumstance.”“We are taking the appropriate countermeasures to protect the president’s health,” Pence added, according to a recording obtained by the AP. The White House was moving to daily testing of some staff members to detect the disease.The stepped-up protective measures comes as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Stephen Hahn, were all quarantining after exposure to the White House staffer.The three experts are scheduled to testify before a Senate panel Tuesday on “Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School.” However, they, along with committee chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., will all participate remotely. Alexander is quarantining after a staff member of his own tested positive for COVID-19.The images of top administration officials taking such precautions come as states seek to loosen economic restrictions put in place to mitigate the virus’ spread.Trump on Monday was complaining that Democratic governors were too slow in lifting restrictions in their states.“The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails,” he tweeted. “The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes. They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don’t play politics. Be safe, move quickly!”Trump was scheduled to travel to the state on Thursday, according to advisories from the Federal Aviation Administration.Decisions about how fast to reopen are being made with the general election less than six months away, and Trump and other incumbents facing it in the midst of a public health and economic crisis.“If we do this carefully, working with the governors, I don’t think there’s a considerable risk,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Matter of fact, I think there’s a considerable risk of not reopening. You’re talking about what would be permanent economic damage to the American public.”Mnuchin was one of several economic advisers the White House dispatched on Sunday to place the focus on the merits of loosening restrictions on the economy. Yet attention to possible risks of infection also turned to how the virus even found its way into the White House.Fauci’s institute said he was “taking appropriate precautions” to mitigate the risk to others while still carrying out his duties, teleworking from home but willing to go to the White House if called. Officials said both Redfield and Hahn will be self-quarantining for two weeks.Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus in the past week. A military service member who acts as a valet to the president tested positive on Thursday, the first known instance for a person in close proximity to Trump at the White House.The announced precautions contrast with a president who has declined to wear a face covering in meetings at the White House or at his public events.Kevin Hassett, an adviser to Trump and the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged Sunday it’s “scary to go to work” in the White House, calling the West Wing a “small, crowded place. It’s, you know, a little bit risky.”Hassett said he wears a mask when necessary and practices “aggressive social distancing.” Appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” he said any fears are tempered by frequent testing, access to an excellent medical team and his belief that this is a time “when people have to step up and serve their country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-faces-coronavirus-risk-at-home-as-echoes-to-reopen-nation-grow-louder/story-Y0uf3DLykOlp1vY3cL4UaM.html
12-05-2020||India||PM Modi announces stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore for Covid-hit economy. Read full speech text here||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore and a slew of financial incentives to revive Indian economy which is currently staring at the onslaught of coronavirus pandemic. The financial package, prime minister announced, will be around 10 per cent of the country’s GDP and will play an important role in India’s self-reliance campaign. The prime minister said the coronavirus crisis has presented India with an opportunity to become self-reliant and to emerge as the best across the world.Here’s the full text of the prime minister’s speech:Greetings to fellow citizens, for over four months the global community has been in the fight against Corona virus.During this period more than 42 lakh people across the world have been infected with Corona. More than 2.75 Lakh people have died tragically. In India too, people have lost their near and dear ones.I express my heartfelt condolences to all.Friends, a virus has destroyed the world. Crores of people around the world are facing a crisis. World all over is engaged in a battle to save precious lives. We have never seen or heard of such a crisis.This crisis is unthinkable as well as unprecedented for mankind.However-getting exasperated, losing heart or getting shattered, is not acceptable to the mankind. We have to remain vigilant, closely monitor it, follow the rules of engagement in such a war, save ourselves and move ahead.Today, when the world is in crisis, we must strengthen our resolve. Our great resolve will help overcome this crisis.Also read: Behind Rs 20 lakh crore package, PM Modi’s hard push for self relianceFriends, we have been hearing since the last century that the 21st century belongs to India. We have seen how the world was before Corona and the global systems in detail. Even after the infliction of the Corona crisis, we are constantly watching the situation as it unfolds across the globe. When we look at these two periods from India’s perspective, it seems that the 21st century is the century for India. This is not our dream, rather a responsibility for all of us.But what should be its trajectory?The state of the world today teaches us that a (AtmaNirbhar Bharat) “Self-reliant India” is the only path .It is said in our scriptures - EshahPanthahThat is - self-sufficient India.Friends,As a nation today we stand at a very crucial juncture. Such a big disaster is a signal for India,it has brought a message and an opportunity.I will share my perspective with an example. When the Corona crisis started, there was not a single PPE kit made in India. The N-95 masks were produced in small quantity in India. Today we are in a situation to produce 2 lakh PPE and 2 lakh N-95 masks daily. We were able to do this because India turned this crisis into an opportunity.This vision of India - turning crisis into opportunity- is going to prove equally effective for our resolve of self-reliant India.Friends,Today the meaning of the word self-reliance has changed in the global scenario. The debate on Human Centric Globalization versus Economy Centralized Globalization is on. India’s fundamental thinking provides a ray of hope to world. The culture and tradition of India speaks of self-reliance and the soul is VasudhaivaKutumbakam.India does not advocate self-centric arrangements when it comes to self-reliance. India’s self-reliance is ingrained in the happiness, cooperation and peace of the world.This is the culture which believes in the welfare of the world, for all the living creatures and the one which considers the whole world as a family. Its premise is ‘माता भूमिः पुत्रो अहम् पृथिव्यः’ - the culture that considers the earth to be the mother. And when the Bharat Bhumi, becomes self-sufficient, it ensures the possibility of a prosperous world. India’s progress has always been integral to the progress of the world.India’s goals and actions impact the global welfare. When India is free from open defecation,it has an impact on the image of the world. Be it TB, malnutrition, polio, India’s campaigns have influenced the world.International Solar Alliance is India’s gift against Global Warming. The initiative of International Yoga Day is India’s gift to relieve stress. Indian medicines have given a fresh lease of life to the people in different parts of the world.These steps have brought laurels for India and it makes every Indian feel proud. The world is beginning to believe that India can do very well, so much good for the welfare of mankind can give.The question is - how?The answer to this question is – A Combined resolve of 130 crore citizens for a self-reliant India.Friends,We have a proud history of centuries. When India was prosperous, it was called the golden goose, it was prosperous, and then it always walked tall for the welfare of the world. Then the times changed, the country was caught in the chains of slavery, we longed for development. Today, when India is making rapid strides in its progress, it is still committed to the goal of global welfare. Remember, the Y2K crisis at the beginning of this century. Technology experts from India pulled the world out of that crisis. Today we have the resources, we have the power, and we have the best talent in the world.We will make the best products, will improve our quality further, make the supply chain more modern, we can do this and we will definitely do it.Friends,I had witnessed the Kutch earthquake. There was debris everywhere. Everything was destroyed. It seemed as if Kutch had fallen asleep wearing a sheet of death. In that situation no one could have imagined that the situation would ever change. However, Kutch stood up, Kutch started moving, Kutch moved. This is the grit and determination of weIndians.If we are determined then we can reach our goals and no path will be difficult. And today there is a will and there is a way. That is to make India self-reliant. Our combined resolve is so strong that India can become self-sufficient.Friends, this magnificent building of self-reliant India will stand on five Pillars.First Pillar is Economy, an economy that brings Quantum Jump rather than Incremental change.Second Pillar is Infrastructure, an infrastructure that became the identity of modern India.Third Pillar is Our System. A system that is driven by technology which canfulfill the dreams of the 21st century; a system not based on the policy of the past century.Fourth Pillar is Our Demography. Our Vibrant Demography is our strength in the world’s largest democracy, our source of energy for self-reliant India.The fifth pillar is Demand. The cycle of demand and supply chain in our economy, is the strength that needs to be harnessed to its full potential. In order to increase demand in the country and to meet this demand, every stake-holder in our supply chain needs to be empowered. We will strengthen our supply chain, our supply system built up with the smell of the soil and the sweat of our labourers.Friends, amidst the Corona crisis, I am announcing today a special economic package with a new resolution. This economic package will serve as an important link in the ‘AtmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan” (Self Reliant India Campaign)’.Friends, in the recent past economic announcements made by the government related to the Corona crisis, which were the decisions of the Reserve Bank. The economic package that is being announced today, if added, comes to around Rs. 20 lakh crores. This package is about 10 percent of India’s GDP. With this various sections of the country and those linked to economic system will get support and strength of 20 lakh crore rupees. This package will give a new impetus to the development journey of the country in 2020 and a new direction to the Self-reliant India campaign. In order to prove the resolve of a self-reliant India, Land, Labor, Liquidity and Laws all have been emphasized in this package.This economic package is for our cottage industry, home industry, our small-scale industry, our MSME, which is a source of livelihood for millions of people, which is the strong foundation of our resolve for a self-reliant India. This economic package is for that labourer of the country, for the farmers of the country who are working day and night for the countrymen in every situation, every season. This economic package is for the middle class of our country, which pays taxes honestly and contributes to the development of the country. This economic package is for Indian industries, which are determined to give a boost to the economic potential of India. Starting tomorrow, over the next few days, the Finance Minister will give you detailed information about this economic package inspired by the ‘Self-reliant India campaign’.Friends, it is now imperative for the country to move forward with the commitment of Bold Reforms to create a self-reliant India. You have also experienced that as a result of the reforms over the past 6 years, today even in this time of crisis; India’s systems have looked more efficient. Otherwise, who could have thought that the money sent by Government of India will reach directly in the pocket of the poor farmer! But it has happened. That also happened when all the government offices were closed; the means of transport were shut down.This was just a reform related to Janadhan-Aadhaar-Mobile-JAM’s Trishakti, the effect of which we have just seen. Now the scope of the reforms has to be broadened, giving a new height. These reforms will be in the entire supply chain related to farming, so that the farmer is also empowered and will have minimal impact on agriculture in any other crisis like corona in future. These reforms will be for, rational tax system, simple and clear rules-of-law, good infrastructure, capable and competent human resources, and building strong financial system. These reforms will encourage business, attract investment and strengthen our resolve for Make in India.Friends, self-reliance is possible only through inner strength and self-belief. Self-reliance also prepares the country for a tough competition in the global supply chain. And today it is the need of the hour that India should play a big role in the global supply chain. Realizing this, many provisions have also been made in the economic package. This will increase the efficiency of all our sectors and also ensure quality.Friends, this crisis is so big, that the biggest systems have been shaken. However, under these circumstances, the country has also seen the resolve and restraint of our poor brothers and sisters, especially the street vendors, hawkers, labourers, those who are working in homes, they have done a lot of penance during this time, they have sacrificed a lot. Who would not have realized their absence? Now it is our duty to make them strong, to take some big steps for their financial requirements. Keeping this in mind, be it poor, labourers, migrant labourers, cattle rearers, be our fishermen, organized sector or unorganized sector, some important decisions will be announced in the economic package for every section.Friends, the Corona crisis has also explained to us the importance of Local manufacturing, Local market and Local supply chain. In times of crisis, this Local has fulfilled our demand, this Local has saved us. Local is not just the need, it is our responsibility also. Time has taught us that we must make the Local as a mantra of our life. The Global Brands you feel today were sometimes also very local like this. But when people started using them, started promoting them, branding them, proud of them, they became Global from Local Products. Therefore, from today every Indian has to become vocal for their local, not only to buy local products, but also to promote them proudly. I am confident that our country can do this. Your efforts have increased my reverence for you every time. I recollect one thing with pride. When I requested you and the nation to buyKhadi and said it will be a great support to our handloom workers. Today, the demand and sales of both Khadi and handloom have reached record levels in a very short time. Not only that, you also made it a big brand. It was a very small effort, but the result was very good.Friends, experts and scientists have pointed out that Corona will remain a part of our lives for a long time. But at the same time, we cannot allow this to happen that our lives will be confined only around the corona. We would wear masks, follow two yards distance and pursue our goals. Therefore, the fourth phase of lockdown, lockdown 4, will be completely redesigned, with new rules. Based on the suggestions we are getting from the states, information related to Lockdown 4 will also be given to you before 18 May. I am confident that by following the rules, we will fight Corona and move forward.Friends, In our culture, it is said ‘सर्वम् आत्म वशं सुखम्’ i.e. what is in our control, is happiness. Self-reliance leads to happiness, satisfaction and empowerment. Our responsibility to make the 21st century, the century of India, will be fulfilled by the pledge of self-reliant India. This responsibility will only get energy from the life force of 130 crore citizens. This era of self-reliant India will be a new vow for every Indian as well as a new festival. Now we have to move forward with a new resolve and determination. When ethics are filled with duty, the culmination of diligence, the capital of skills, then who can stop India from becoming self-reliant? We can make India a self-reliant nation. We will make India self-reliant. With this resolve, with this belief, I wish you the very best.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-announces-stimulus-package-of-rs-20-lakh-crore-for-covid-hit-economy-read-full-speech-text-here/story-O8xdL3lYLUGjKUSurdHvsJ.html

On May 1, the Union health ministry had listed 10 of Bengal’s 23 districts as red zones, eight as green zones and four as orange zones. Bengal, at present, has 556 containment zones, out of which 326 are in Kolkata and the rest mostly in the districts of Howrah, North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, and Hooghly.“I have asked the district magistrates, police supers and health department heads to chalk-out district-wise plan for creating the ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ zones and list the activities that could be allowed and submit the plan to me on May 15,” she said at the state secretariat. After May 21, relaxations will also be increased in districts listed as green and orange zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-plans-more-relaxations-in-red-zone-areas/story-lUU3tOeR6FfwBdYPRIGDTM.html

She is the only child of her parents.“My father has been ailing for the past 18 years. He cannot walk. My mother sells vegetables in Borbaruah market. I have been helping her for two years,” said Janmoni, who lives in a village in Bogibeel area of Dibrugarh district. After the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, she started selling vegetables door to door carrying her wares on a bicycle as it was not possible to go to Borbaruah market.Top officers of the district police, including SP Srijith T, came to know about her from mainstream and social media and asked her if she needed any help.“Her self-respect prevented her from taking monetary help. So we came up with the idea of gifting her a two-wheeler so that she can carry her vegetables more comfortably and in larger quantities,” Deputy Superintendent of Police Pallavi Mazumder said.Handing her over the two-wheeler on Monday, Mazumder said, “At a time when everyone is indoors, Janmoni came out to support her family.” Janmoni, who nurtures a dream of pursuing higher education, expressed her gratitude to the state police, the SP and the DSP. “I earn a meagre amount by selling vegetables.Sometimes I have to return home without earning anything. The two-wheeler will ease my problem of ferrying vegetables far. I am now determined to work harder,” she said.Her mother Monomoti said, “If my daughter did not sell vegetables on a bicycle, it would have been tough for us to sustain during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-police-gifts-2-wheeler-to-young-woman-who-sells-vegetables-on-bicycle/story-6gcLDkbKqfJwOWvPCljZQO.html
12-05-2020||India||In Odisha village without quarantine centre, man spends 3 days in toilet||A 30-year-old man in Odisha’s Balasore district had to spend three days in the toilet of his home before he was shifted to a school Monday night because the village does not have a quarantine centre.Kalia Bindhani of Sarkarnagar village under Saraswatipur granpanchayat of Balasore district returned home on May 9, after losing his job in Ganjam district due to the lockdown. As he did not show any symptoms of Covid-19, he was asked by the local sarpanch to stay in home quarantine for 14 days.However, with no space available in his one-room thatched house, Bindhani chose the public toilet next to his house for quarantine. “In my home there are 12 people. How can I stay with others in the house and possibly infect others? So I chose the toilet,” said Bindhani. A quarantine sticker too was pasted on the toilet wall indicating Bidhani’s date of arrival in his village and the end of quarantine date.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Bindhani would have probably stayed a few more days in the toilet had the Naib sarpanch not raised the issue with the local sarpanch and BDO. Naib sarpanch of the panchayat, Manoj Sethi said the confusion started over lack of guidelines over arrival of migrant workers from other districts. “As he had arrived from the Covid-19 epicentre of Ganjam, he wanted to be quarantined. But we had no official quarantine centre in the village. So I asked him to stay in the toilet,” said Sethi.After higher officials got to know about the matter, Bindhani was shifted to a primary school in the village on Monday night. But his woes are far from over as the school has no quarantine bed. “I have to sleep on the floor. But how would I get food on time,” he asked.Bindhani is the latest case in a long string of complaints from several quarantine centres in Odisha where migrant workers returning from other States have been kept. On Monday, several migrant workers in a quarantine centre of Ganjam’s Belguntha block threw away the rice alleging that it was overcooked while in another quarantine centre of the same block, migrant workers did not take the upma served at breakfast calling it inedible.Last week, over 150 migrant workers in Ganjam district had fled the quarantine centre alleging lack of water and low quality food.Following numerous such complaints, state panchayatiraj secretary DK Singh wrote to all district collectors on Tuesday to ensure good quality food and sanitation in the quarantine centres.Of the 437 positive cases reported in Odisha so far, more than 300 have been reported from people staying in quarantine centres. After families of the quarantined people started crowding the centres in Ganjam district, the district administration declared the quarantine centres as containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-village-without-quarantine-centre-man-spends-3-days-in-toilet/story-p2qskPJpGZNHOxmlt1JNKL.html

They were later sent to a detention centre. According to Superintendent of Police (Special Branch) Shobit Saksena, the four -- three Nigerians and one Kenyan -- have been booked for violations of the Foreigners Act. The owners of the premises where they were staying have also been booked. “They were found staying without any passport, visa or identification documents. While the three male foreigners claim to be from Nigeria and the lady from Kenya, their identities are being determined,” Saksena said. “They have been lodged at the detention centre for deportation and blacklisting,” Saksena added. This is the second such case in the state in the last two weeks. On April 30, a surveillance drive in Arambol in North Goa for those violating the lockdown found two Nigerians loitering around the beach shacks which are now shut. The duo was unable to produce any valid documents when asked. They, too, were then sent to the detention centre.Since the cessation of international travel due to restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, the foreigners registration office in Goa has been granting visa extensions to those foreigners and tourists stranded in the state apply for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-foreigners-detained-for-staying-in-goa-without-valid-documents/story-eTIh3kyGjx4qdiU3QHjtAO.html
12-05-2020||India||Goa latest state to hike excise duty on liquor||Goa on Tuesday became the latest state to hike excise duty on liquor amid the slowing down of the economy due to the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. With the increase, announced through a government notification, excise duty on the cheapest quality on Indian Made Foreign Liquor has been hiked from Rs 25 to 30 per bulk litre, while that of the highest quality liquor has been hiked from Rs 2,000 to 2,400. Excise duty has gone up from Rs 22 to Rs 30 for the cheapest quality beer and from Rs 38 to 50 per bulk litre for the more expensive versions of beer. Similarly, prices for the manufacture of milk punch, wines and other varieties of alcohol have also been hiked in varying degrees. The hiked rates will be effective from May 15.The increase in excise duty on liquor was announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant during budget earlier this year. But it wasn’t formally notified owing to pressure from the retailers and liquor traders who had, back then, said that the hike would mean liquor rates in Goa would be on par with other states which would,in turn,affect the tourism sector in the state. Liquor retailers and traders had at that time petitioned chief minister for a rollback of excise hike who then announced that the hike would be reconsidered. The Covid-19 crisis, however, forced the state government’s hand forcing it to raise the excise duty on liquor.There are over 10,000 liquor retailers in Goa and the liquor industry contributes over Rs 400 crore a year to the state exchequer in form of taxes, according to IANS.After stand alone liquor shops were recently allowed to open from May 3 by the Centre, many states including Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal decided to raise taxes on liquor to mop up revenue to fight Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-latest-state-to-hike-excise-duty-on-liquor/story-cA3nk6ecmUiO6w3xk7MA1M.html

12-05-2020||India||Kashmir’s first doctor infected by Covid-19 anxious to return to work||For 43-year-old Dr Javid Iqbal Monga, the most depressing and shocking news of his life came when he tested positive for coronavirus on April 19.He became Kashmir’s first doctor and frontline worker to test positive for the virus. Authorities promptly put him and his family in quarantine at the Medical College itself and began efforts to trace all his contacts. Fortunately, Dr Monga had already taken enough precautions as he was aware about consequences of the virus and had seen from close quarters the death of his colleagues in Saudi Arabia due to SARS while they were on duty in the city of Taif, where the doctor had spent around two decades of his life.“I had a sore throat for a couple of days before testing positive. I thought that since I am allergic to certain things it could be the fallout of that only. Once I was declared Covid positive, I started thinking where from I could have got this deadly disease.”Dr Monga suspects that he contracted Covid-19 from a patient during a 24-hour shift at the emergency of Medical College spread over April 13 and 14.“I examined many patients. I used to spend good time with my patients, especially the sick ones. It was an old man who was very sick who came to the hospital in the middle of night. I spent two hours with him and performed his intubation. But despite my efforts he passed away and it’s possible that I got the virus from him.’’Dr Monga and his wife were initially shifted to a local hotel just 100 hundred meters away from the hospital. However, after spending a few hours inside the hotel in a comfortable room while getting treatment according to protocol for his chills and throat infection, some local residents raised objections for his stay in the hotel. “I was shifted to the hospital’s isolation room during the night as my fever was shooting up and my wife too had chills and was feeling unwell. My only worry was about my young daughter and son. Next day, my wife’s report also came positive which put more stress on me and my 14- year-old daughter was also coughing. Though I was getting good treatment at Medical College but my condition wasn’t getting any better and I was in panic as I knew a lot more about this disease. Finally, I asked hospital administration to shift me to SKIMS.’’For the doctor and his wife the first good news came when their daughter tested negative. “There was congestion in my chest and fever was not subsiding. I tried to maintain extra calm but things were going from bad to worse with every passing hour. At times i thought I had developed pneumonia which is an indication of the severity of the viral load and I knew the consequences could be far worse.”Slowly efforts of doctors and his own resilience started showing impact and on April 28 his fever started to subside. “My wife got better within days as her viral load was low and had mild symptoms. And finally I was on path to recovery.’’Dr Monga was all praise for his colleagues in Baramulla and Srinagar. “My HoD, Nisar Ahmed Khan, Dr Yasir Bashir Asst Prof medicine at GMC Baramulla, Dr Afshan, consultant medicine, Dr Mushtaq Professor Medicine and Dr Zubair, Dr Farooq, Dr Mushtaq and senior resident Dr Ishrat and Dr Abdul Waheed Mir, Associate professor of ICU SKIMS who remained with me almost all the time and made me comfortable,’’ he said.The doctor is now staying at his home in Baramulla. “I used to maintain extra caution so that my children didn’t get this disease and stayed away from my aged parents,’’ he said, adding that since he has passed through this disease, now he wants to help to make people aware about this disease.He expects to return to work around May 20.“I am eager to join my duties back and could be serving my people soon.’’A graduate of the Medical College Srinagar, Dr Monga served in Kashmir for a couple of years before moving to Saudi Arabia where he worked at premier institutions. He also worked in Mecca city inside Grand Mosque Al-Haram during Hajj for one month for consecutive ten years which helped him to gain exposure and experience in critical care medicine especially in emergency situations.“I had left Kashmir because there was no job at that time but to serve my people was always my dream. Finally when the hospital in my home town was declared as Medical College, I applied for a job and got it. I had a well-paid job at Taif city which I left even took a huge salary cut to work at my native place.’’After beating the virus, Dr Monga said his commitment towards his patients will be stronger. ‘’The only thing which pained me was when I was told by some colleagues that few people had objected to my stay in the hotel which was meant for the purpose. Tomorrow, God forbid, if some of them will have any disease I will be the first person to help them,” he said adding that the disease has taught him many lessons and people who are afflicted by it should face it strongly.“We can beat this disease only if we keep calm and face it strongly.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-s-first-doctor-infected-by-covid-19-anxious-to-return-to-work/story-2cDHtXNNxQ2aUKowbhhbYI.html

Relaxation of lockdown norms has meant that districts like Kolar which were in the green zone, have now reported positive cases.“Today is again it not a good day in terms of numbers... most cases are those with the travel history to Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Odisha and Chennai,” state minister S Suresh Kumar, the spokesperson for Covid-19 in Karnataka, told reporters, according to news agency PTI. He said most of the cases were those who recently returned to the state.“After their return, we placed them under quarantine. On screening and testing them during quarantine, they turned out to be positive,” he said.According to the health department’s bulletin, out of the 460 active cases, a total of 449 Covid-19 patients were in isolation at designated hospitals and stable while 11 were undergoing treatment in intensive care units, reports PTI.Seven patients who have recovered, were discharged on Tuesday.Meanwhile, 101 migrant labourers including men, women and children who were travelling in the back of a goods truck to Rajasthan were detained on the Bangalore - Pune highway near Hirebagewadi check-post of Belgavi district.After one of them was found to be running high temperature, he was admitted to a hospital in Belgavi to check for Covid-19 symptoms. The rest of the group was sent for medical check up and later to an institutional quarantine at Nehru Nagar in the city.The state government is examining how the truck with so many people was able to evade several checkposts till it was finally caught.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-s-covid-19-tally-reaches-925-with-record-single-day-spike-of-63-cases/story-wcy2vA7rq6aNXA1k2BAtrN.html

12-05-2020||India||PM Modi announces economic package worth Rs 20 lakh crore, details to be announced in the next few days||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a special economic package worth Rs several lakh crore to assist labourers, farmers, tax payers, MSMEs and cottage industry and added that it will emphasis on land, labour, liquidity and laws.PM Modi said the details of the new package will be announced by the finance minister over the next several days beginning tomorrow.“I announce a special economic package today. This will be an important link in the self-reliant India campaign. If we add the value of the announcements made by the government recently and the decisions taken by the RBI, then this package is worth Rs 20 lakh crore. This is 10% of India’s GDP,” PM Narendra Modi said.He added that this package will provide new impetus to India’s ambition for self-reliance in the year 2020.“This package is for MSMEs and cottage industries that provide jobs to crores of people and form the foundation of a self-reliant India, it is for the labourers and the farmers who toil day and night in all sorts of difficult conditions, it is for the middle class that honestly pays its taxes, it is for the business world that is committed to further raising India’s economic heft,” said PM Modi.He added that it was essential for India to march forward with bold reforms to reach the goal of self-reliance and claimed that the reforms undertaken in the last few years such as direct cash transfers and opening of bank accounts for the poor and the women in rural India have already delivered big results.“The reforms undertaken in the last few years have ensured that every single paise meant for the poor reaches their accounts,” he said.Giving an indication that the future reforms will be wide ranging, the prime minister first mentioned the need to reform the entire supply chain linking the agriculture sector.“It will ensure that a crisis like the one started by the coronavirus has limited impact on agriculture in the future,” he said before adding, “These reforms will be for building a rational tax system, simple and clear laws, top class infrastructure, capable human resources and strong financial system.”He added that these reforms will further promote business and attract investment while strengthening the make in India initiative.Prime Minister said India will modernize its supply chain, produce products of the highest quality to mark its emergence as the new economic power house.He identified the five pillars -- economy, infrastructure, technology driven system, vibrant demography and demand—that will drive India’s vision in this respect.PM Modi said the first pillar is economy which doesn’t get caught up in incremental changes but makes a quantum jump.The second pillar, he said, is infrastructure that becomes the identity of modern India.The third pillar is system, one that doesn’t follow the rules of the past century but is based on technology-driven systems that can realize the dreams of the 21st century.Demography, he said, is the fourth pillar, “Vibrant demography of world’s largest democracy is its strength and it is also the source of the energy for a self-reliant India.”He identified the fifth pillar as demand: “The cycle of demand and supply chain needs to be leveraged to its full potential. To increase demand in the country, it is important for every stake holder of our supply chain to be strengthened.”Prime Minister’s announcement follows interventions made by the finance ministry and the RBI to mitigate the disastrouos impact of Coved-19 on all sectors of economy. While the finance ministry had announced an economic stimulus worth Rs 1.70 lakh crore, the RBI had made several policy decisions to ease liquidity pressure in the market.It also assumes significance in the light of government’s push to create necessary infrastructure to attract investors who may flee China after the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-announces-economic-package-worth-rs-20-lakh-crore-details-to-be-announced-in-the-next-few-days/story-kLbHUw5K3pfg2Yub6vfNDL.html
12-05-2020||India||Kerala expresses concern over AC coaches for special trains||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said it is not ideal to travel in air-conditioned coaches during the Covid-19 pandemic and asked the railway ministry to deploy non-AC compartments for long-distance travel.Talking to media in the state capital, Vijayan said in last two months all were talking about problems of air-conditioned environment in the present scenario and the railway move to run AC special trains was a big surprise.“We have many instances before us. In Punjab many pilgrims who travelled in AC buses during Hazur Sahib pilgrimage were tested positive. Health experts have warned that closed environ is ideal for the virus to spread. We have asked the railways to deploy non-AC coaches,” he said, adding the state has also sought more stops for special trains. Many health experts have also questioned the move to run full AC trains.“The railways said these trains will be run on the lines of the Rajdhani Express. In that case it has to ensure Rajdhani stoppages. For New Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram train there are only two stops in the state. Since the train is coming from the containment zone passengers are forced to travel a lot on road and it will pose more problems,” he said, adding the chief secretary has taken up these issues with the railways. On Tuesday the state reported five new cases--four are foreign returnees. Out of 524 cases, 32 are active cases. The CM said at least 70 per cent of cases came from outside the state and foreign countries and secondary infection rate was very low. He said cases will go up as immigrants from the middle-east and people stranded in other parts of the country started flocking the state in large numbers.“We have requested the centre to make anti-body tests compulsory for the evacuees from the middle-east. Some of them are coming with symptoms and they pose problems to other travellers. We have been insisting for tests for quite some time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-expresses-concern-over-ac-coaches-for-special-trains/story-U5WxR0fLIwFLhzt0KK6UcP.html

There might be major health complications among the victims in future and we shall work out strategies to attend to the same,” Minister for industries Mekapati Gautam Reddy told Hindustan Times.He said the victims would need periodical health check-ups for the next one year. “We shall organise health camps in the affected villages to regularly monitor their health conditions and provide them necessary treatment,” the minister said.Stating that all the affected people were brought under Arogya Sri scheme in which they would be given treatment free of cost, Reddy said the government would take complete responsibility for their treatment life long, should there be any health issues arising out of gas leakage.Meanwhile, 367 people affected by the gas leakage from LG Polymers plant were still undergoing treatment in different hospitals, while 200 others having recovered were discharged on Tuesday, agriculture minister K Kanna Babu, who is in-charge of Visakhapatnam, told reporters.“Apart from bearing the cost of treatment, the government is also extending compensation to every victim,” said Kanna Babu after calling on the people undergoing treatment at King George Hospitals. He was accompanied by Rajya Sabha member V Vijay Sai Reddy and tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao.The minister said the situation in the affected villages had come back to normal and there were no complaints from the people. “Apart from four of our cabinet colleagues, MP Vijay Sai Reddy and others also had a night stay in the affected villages. A team of five doctors would regularly visit the villages to conduct tests on the people to find out their health status,” he said.Some of the affected people refused to get discharged from KGH stating that they were yet to recover from the ill-effects of the gas. As a result, the doctors allowed them to return to the wards to stay for some more time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-to-bear-life-long-treatment-cost-of-those-hit-by-vizag-gas-leak/story-tsGVSYhIJpnX90sgboIrqN.html

The counsel for the central government said privacy of data was ensured and it will submit a detailed statement in this regard during the next hearing. He said it has been recognised as the best app in the world fighting the Covid-19 and lakhs of people have already downloaded it.“Extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures, we will come back to it in normal circumstances,” the bench observed while posting the matter for further hearing on May 18. Last month the court had also refused to stay the Kerala Government’s decision to engage a US firm ‘Sprinklr’ in vetting the data collected by health workers. Last week Thrissur District Congress Committee general secretary John Daniel had moved the court saying the Centre’s directive to download the ‘Arogya Setu’ app compulsorily violated the fundamental rights of citizens and there were also chances of misusing personal data collected through the app. He also pointed out the Centre’s guidelines made it clear that employees who do not comply with the directive will have to face prosecution under the Disaster Management Act.On April 29, the Centre had directed all officers and other employees of the government to download the ‘Arogya Setu’ app on their mobile phones immediately. Similarly it also instructed rail and air passengers to download the app for their travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-refuses-stay-on-mandatory-use-of-arogya-setu-app/story-VoW5R26b4eNR76JkDKnrwM.html
12-05-2020||India||Centre to focus on economic revival, replaces daily health briefing with bulletins||The government has decided to suspend the daily health ministry briefings on Covid-19 till Sunday and issue health bulletins instead, a government official said on Tuesday signalling that the change was being made as part of a renewed effort to put the focus back on economic revival and self-reliance.In his address, PM Modi announced a Rs 20 lakh crore financial package, underscored the need for the country to be self-reliant and also asked people to ensure that our lives do not revolve around the disease as they have been for the last 50-odd days.The decision to suspend the health ministry briefing and replace it with a ministry bulletin is linked to this effort.A government official told Hindustan Times that there had been a view that the focus should instead turn to resumption of economic activity, self-reliance and the financial package that would help the country achieve this objective.There would be briefings but the focus would be on the Prime Minister’s self reliant campaign, financial package and the many achievements of India’s science and technology sector.PM Modi had not spelt out the details of the financial package but left it to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to make the announcement over the next few days.But PM Modi, who had launched a Make in India campaign, did speak extensively on making India self-reliant and asked people to go for products that are made in India rather than abroad.A short PMO brief issued on his 33-minute address to the nation quoted PM Modi mentioning “self-reliant” and “self-reliance” no less than 10 times.PM Modi underscored how the Covid-19 pandemic had taught everyone the importance of local manufacturing, local market and local supply chains. It was seen as a double barrelled reference to people turning to local products that were available in neighbourhood shops that have taken a hit earlier due to online shopping portals such as Amazon and Flipkart.In his address, Prime Minister Modi stressed that self-reliance will prepare the country for tough competition in the global supply chain, and it is important that the country wins this competition. The package had been designed, he added, to encourage local manufacturing and will not only increase efficiency in various sectors but also ensure quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-focus-to-economic-revival-replaces-daily-health-briefing-with-bulletins/story-SP7eZ8wtgPP3OmKX5otQZP.html

Today, we manufacture two lakh PPEs in a day and two lakh N-95 masks in a day. This is because we turned the challenge into an opportunity,” he said in his address to the nation.He also said that it is the responsibility to every person of the country to make 21st century India’s century.“There is only one way to do this - to become self reliant,” the Prime Minister said.Further expanding on this, PM Modi said, “The definition of self reliance is changing in today’s world. Today, it is about self-centred approach rathern than people-centric approach. But this is not India’s philosophy. India’s culture is about becoming self-reliant whose soul is ‘World is one Family’.”PM Modi held a meeting with the chief ministers on Monday where he said that states will have greater say in determining the extent of restrictions and relaxations after May 17.He also emphasised that social distancing remains the “biggest weapon” against the virus till a vaccine is found, and suggested that the lockdown may not be lifted entirely.In his fifth interaction with chief ministers on the pandemic, according to participants at the meeting, PM Modi said that India now had a good sense of the spread of the disease.

12-05-2020||India||‘Covid-19 crisis has a message for India’: PM Modi explains in his address to nation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the path to India’s rise in the 21st Century is through self-reliance and the coronavirus crisis had given a glimpse of India’s ability to turn a crisis into an opportunity.Prime Minister Modi made the comments during his televised address to the nation on Tuesday evening, when he did not just reiterate his message of self-reliance being the mantra for success in the new world order, but also added that it was India’s responsibility to seize the moment to make the 21st century its own.“We have to further strengthen our resolve when the world is in crisis, our resolve should overpower the might of the crisis. We have been told since the last century that the 21st century belongs to India,” PM said.He then spoke about the need for self-dependence and how it was the key to transforming India.“It is not just India’s destiny to make this century its own but also its responsibility. Friends, as a nation we are at important crossroads, such a big crisis has brought a message for India, it is a sign and an opportunity,” he said.The prime minister then used an example to drive the point home.“India didn’t make any PPE kits before coronavirus crisis struck and N95 masks were made here in very little quantity but today, India manufactures 2 lakh PPE kits and 2 lakh N95 masks. We have been able to do it because India has turned a disaster into an opportunity,” the prime minister elaborated.He added that this ability to turn a crisis into an opportunity was going to be crucial for India in the post corona world.“Entire world is fighting a kind of war to save lives, we have neither seen or heard of such a crisis before. This crisis is beyond imagination for the mankind, it is unprecedented. But human beings are not known to either break or bow to challenges,” prime minister saidPM Modi qualified his statement by saying that India’s vision of leadership was based on ‘Vasudehv Kutumbkam’, the ancient Indian principle of taking the world along as one family.“India’s self-reliance addresses concerns about world’s happiness, cooperation and peace,” PM Modi said before citing the example of the help extended by India to several friends and neighbouring countries during the current crisis. He said that essential medicines supplied by India have infused new hopes in the world which was fighting the battle of life and death.Further specifying the contours of this self-reliance, the prime minister said it will be based on five pillars -- economy, infrastructure, technology-driven system, vibrant demography and demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-crisis-has-a-message-for-india-pm-narendra-modi-explains-in-his-address-to-nation/story-o4opDeV3spGpVm7hPDiE5H.html

Samant further informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice A A Sayed that the state of Maharashtra was implementing the National Food Security Act diligently. The act stipulates that anyone holding a valid ration card is eligible to get subsidised ration provided by the government. Samant said that Maharashtra had entered into an agreement with 11 states to allow their natives living in Maharashtra to draw rations based on ration cards issued in their home states. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder and posted the matter for hearing on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-has-allowed-porting-of-ration-cards-for-natives-of-11-states-govt-tells-hc/story-M4vj0AfIiuxtX0JA2ZRdPI.html

12-05-2020||India||How UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh plan to provide jobs to returning migrants||As the number of migrant workers returning to their native states begins to swell, several Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states are preparing to address the challenge of creating jobs for the returnees.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday announced that the state government is making efforts to provide jobs to 20 lakh migrant workers. In Bihar, where the BJP is in alliance with the JDU, the state has issued orders to draw up a plan to cater to a similar number, while in Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said 16 lakh workers have already been given work under the MGNREGA.According to a person aware of the details, the issue of providing employment to the workers, most of whom had to undertake harrowing journeys, was flagged at the meetings that the party high command had with the state units.“Apart from the immediate help such as cash and food for workers who have been out of jobs owing to the nationwide shutdown, states have been asked to ensure that employment avenues are tapped and that people are not left without work and means to earn their livelihood. Unemployment can lead to social unrest,” said a party functionary privy to the details.While states such as Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were criticised for amending existing labour laws, the governments in these states have defended the move on the grounds that it will pave the way for more employment avenues.“Care is being taken to ensure that while newer investment gets a boost; the rights of labourers are protected too,” the functionary quoted above said. But are states, struggling under the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, equipped to bear the strain that reverse migration will exert on their coffers?In UP, where over nine lakh migrant workers have returned so far, minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the numbers are not unrealistic as the state already has schemes that can absorb the additional workforce. He said, the UP chief minister had set up a task force under the agriculture production commissioner, which includes people from the Panchayati Raj, the MSME sector, rural development, labour and skilling ministries to work out areas, where through coordinated efforts jobs will be generated.“There are various schemes in existence already, for instance the MSME has the one district, one product scheme, there are many schemes under rural development that are linked to MGNREGA; we have also set a target of skilling about 20 lakh people and offering them stipend. Targets have been given, we are also mapping the migrant quarantining facilities and so it doesn’t seem difficult to generate jobs,” he said.In Bihar, a massive data collation exercise is underway, said minister Sanjay Jha. He said the administration is collecting details of all those who arrive at the quarantine centres set up across all blocs in the state to get a sense of the skills and proficiency of the workers.“When the workers began to arrive, the chief minister gave instructions to make a data bank of their skill sets so that as soon as avenues for investment open up, we can go all out to ensure they are gainfully employed,” he said.Jha said the scepticism over reverse migration is unfounded since a lot of workers who have returned to Bihar from other states, showed inclination to stay back. In Haryana, a party functionary said efforts are underway to ensure economic activity picks up in the industrial belt so that workers who left for their native places are encouraged to move back.“If states don’t make efforts to reboot quickly, there will be a massive labour shortfall,” the second functionary said.Prof Amitabh Kundu, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said the reverse migration is only temporary.“It is good if state governments create jobs. But reverse migration won’t last because there is massive regional inequality between the Northern and southern regions. Also, in states such as UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, etc the population growth is much above the national average; whereas the southern states have stabilised their growth. So migration will occur again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-up-bihar-madhya-pradesh-plan-to-provide-jobs-to-returning-migrants/story-WHy83ZP9OvfYjuVzXsKWHI.html

The bird is the first among our current batch of tagged birds,” WII scientist R Suresh Kumar, who is currently monitoring the route of the migratory bird, said.“Chiulon clocked 9,600 km in 15 days since leaving the Somali coast on April 23. Whether he will stop here to breed or continue to move further to the North we will have to wait and see.”Chiulon, named after a village in Manipur’s Tamenglong district and four other falcons namely Puching, Phalong-both names of villages in Tamenglong district, Irang and Barak - both names of rivers of the district, were radio tagged with satellite transmitters by the forest department in collaboration with WII scientists to study the flight route of these long-distance migratory birds and environmental patterns along the route.Though all the falcons are sharing their data during this radio tagging programme, Puching and Phalong failed to transmit any data few days after they were tagged.Irang was in the mountainous tracts of Myanmar’s Mandalay region while Barak was last located over Odisha. On the other hand Longleng, a female Amur falcon named after Nagaland’s district was radio-tagged in October 2016 in Nagaland was last located 600 km south of Beijing.“I think she will arrive at the same woodland patch to breed which is another 600 km northeast of Beijing,” Kumar said.On WMBD, he said, “Migratory birds know no boundary. They connect our planet, connect landscapes and as we know now from our Amur falcons they connect communities. It is one world for all of us.”In their annual migratory flight to South Africa from northern China, Amur falcons pass through northeast India, particularly Manipur and Nagaland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/radio-tagged-amur-falcon-reaches-breeding-ground-in-china-from-ne-india/story-pq0gompPslIASLK851iYfK.html
12-05-2020||India||2 Lashkar terrorists who shot 3 CRPF jawans identified, one was from Pak||Two terrorists who killed three CRPF jawans at a security checkpost in Handwara last week are linked to the Lashkar-e-Taiba, a senior police officer said on Tuesday. The officer said one of them was a Pakistani national Usman. The other was a Kashmiri.The two shot dead three jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force who were at a security checkpoint when they were distracted by some movement at the orchard along the road at Handwara’s Wangam. The terrorists had taken away the rifles of the soldiers after cutting the sling before escaping from the spot.A 14-year-old was killed in the crossfire.The ambush in Kupwara district had taken place just a day after five security personnel including Colonel Ashutosh Sharma and Major Anuj Sood laid down their lives in an encounter near Handwara’s Rajbhar forest in an overnight gunbattle. Two Lashkar terrorists including one Pakistani national Haider were also killed in this incident.“We are looking at the possibility that the two terrorists who killed the CRPF jawans may have had a role to play in the gunbattle that cost the security forces five lives,” a senior police officer said.“It is not certain what kind of a role these two terrorists may have played. Whether they were in the house when the security forces mounted the operation to secure the family being held hostage or had left by then.” the officer said.A top security official had told Hindustan Times after the 13-hour Handwara gunbattle that the agencies would keep an open mind on the number of terrorists involved in the encounter. “We will be led by the evidence that we find,” he said on Tuesday.Handwara falls along the route for terrorists infiltrating from the Leepa Valley, the route that has been much in use by terrorists coming into the Keran sector from Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Intelligence agencies have cautioned that north Kashmir’s Handwara, Baramulla and Sopore triangle could be the hotbed of terror activity this summer as Pakistan’s deep state looks to escalate the violence here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-lashkar-terrorists-who-shot-3-crpf-jawans-identified-one-was-from-pak/story-4WLTIbGdN8fKwfSHqxavXK.html
12-05-2020||India||India needs basic income scheme to make lockdown work: French economist||India needs to come out with a basic income scheme to make the lockdown work, noted French economist Thomas Piketty said on Tuesday.He also said that India has the potential to become the global democratic leader of the 21st century if it manages to address the issue of inequality. The government has imposed lockdown from March 25 to curb the spread of coronavirus and since then extended the restrictions twice.  “I think the government would be well advised to introduce a basic income scheme, and more generally to develop a safety net in India. I do not see how a lockdown can work without a system of income maintenance,” Piketty told PTI in an interview. Interestingly, the idea of universal basic income was mooted in Economic Survey 2016-17 by the then chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian and there was a discussion last year during the electoral campaign to introduce a basic income in India.Piketty also pitched for more equitable and progressive taxation including a wealth tax and inheritance tax in India.“India has the potential to become the global democratic leader of the 21st century, assuming the country manages to come to terms with its legacy of inequality,” the eminent economist emphasised. “The attention that was put to the reservation system was not matched by sufficient attention to other issues, including land reform and the redistribution of property, and the funding of adequate education, infrastructure and health investment through a more equitable and progressive tax system (including a wealth tax and inheritance tax),” he said. Piketty, who recently wrote a book ‘Capital and Ideology’, noted that a pandemic like Covid-19 can have contradictory effects on inequality. “On the one hand, it can raise the legitimacy of public investment in health, infrastructure and education. But on the other hand, it can also raise the fear of strangers and reinforce the preexisting trends toward sectarian conflicts,” he said. Before the pandemic, Piketty said the trend toward sectarian conflict reflected the lack of political ambition to change the economic system and to put in place a system that is truly based on economic justice. “This will be even more true after the pandemic: we need to think again about how to reconcile prosperity and equality,” he said adding that in his book, he explored the possibility of a system based upon educational justice and participatory socialism, involving private property for all and the permanent circulation of wealth and power. Asked how coronavirus pandemic will impact India’s rising inequality, Piketty said the experience of the Spanish flu of 1918-20 is frightening. “According to some studies, mortality rates were as large as 5 per cent in India or Indonesia, as compared to 0.5 - 1 per cent in Western Europe and the US (which was already very high). “It seems unlikely that things can get so bad today, but this means that we have to be very careful,” Piketty, who is currently a professor at Paris School of Economics, said. The French economist, who has worked extensively on issues like inequality and poverty, said by looking at a broader range of historical trajectories, he has also come to stress the key role of ideological and political change in the evolution of inequality. “The main determinants of inequality are not economic and technological: they are ideological and political,” he argued. Piketty’s previous book ‘Capital in the Twenty-First Century ‘ became the best-selling work in the history of Harvard University Press and made him a household name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-needs-basic-income-scheme-to-make-lockdown-work-french-economist/story-Dtz64oxSG8JbzIKqrv2JOM.html
12-05-2020||India||2G mobile internet services restored in Kashmir||The Jammu and Kashmir administration restored 2G internet connectivity across the Union Territory on Tuesday, six days after the service was snapped during an operation by security forces that resulted in the killing of militant commander Riyaz Naikoo. Last week, internet connectivity and prepaid mobile phone services across Kashmir were snapped during a gun battle in which Naikoo, the operations commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, and his aide were killed at Beighpora Gulzarpora village in South Kashmir’s Pulwama district.Prepaid mobile phone services were restored on Friday, but mobile internet connectivity remained suspended till May 11, or the 17th day of the holy month of Ramzan, due to apprehensions about possible militant attacks.Principal secretary (home) Shaleen Kabra issued an order for restoring mobile internet services across Kashmir.On Monday, the Supreme Court had refused to order the restoration of 4G services on mobile devices in Jammu and Kashmir, but issued directions for forming a special committee to address issues raised by petitioners who had challenged the snapping of internet connectivity in the region.All internet services were snapped in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir on August 4 last year, hours before the Centre announced its decision to bifurcate the state into the union territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.Since then, whenever there is a major attack by militants or a gun battle in any part of Kashmir, the government snaps mobile internet services as officials fear these developments could trigger fresh protests. For many people, the frequent disruption of internet connectivity has become a headache.“It’s now a big problem. First, we were barred from using high speed internet and now even 2G is being snapped frequently,” said a local resident who declined to be named.Officials were anticipating attacks on security forces across Kashmir on the 17th day of Ramzan, or the day of Badr, when a few hundred Muslims led by Prophet Mohammed took on their powerful opponents in Arabia and won. There was speculation about an attack as militants have targeted security forces in the Kashmir Valley on this day in the past. Last year, there were similar reports about possible attacks on the 17th day of Ramzan.However, authorities decided last week to restore 2G internet connectivity after the 17th of Ramzan passed off peacefully. As there were no incidents on the day, officials restored mobile internet services with slow speed on Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2g-mobile-internet-services-restored-in-kashmir/story-qbJDsieDjnWYSIdcJ0FWuO.html
12-05-2020||India||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh face of over Krishna river water||The bonhomie between Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his Andhra Pradesh counterpart Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in the last one year seems all but over as the two states brace for a fight over the Krishna river waters.The bone of contention between the two states is an order issued by the Andhra Pradesh irrigation department (GO Ms. No. 203) on May 5 according administrative approval to a series of schemes worth over Rs 7,000 crore aimed at drawing an additional quantity of six to eight tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of water per day from Srisailam reservoir on the Krishna river.While the Telangana government described the order as illegal, unilateral and against the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, the Andhra Pradesh government defended the same stating that the new schemes were well within the state’s rights. The AP government also accused Telangana of constructing projects like Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift scheme which was in violation of the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal.As per the latest GO, the new schemes proposed by the AP government include construction of Rayalaseema lift scheme aimed at pumping three tmc of water from Sangameshwara into Srisailam Right Main Canal, upgradation of Pothireddypadu head regulator canal system to draw 80,000 cusecs of water from foreshore of Srisailam reservoir and other upgradation various works in existing canal system of Galeru-Nagari project to draw another 70,000 cusecs of water from Srisailam.The Telangana chief minister, who held an emergency meeting with the irrigation department authorities late Monday night, regretted that the Jagan government had taken a unilateral decision at a time when the Telangana government was extending a friendly hand to its neighbour.He said river waters should be utilised for the benefit of farmers in both the states setting aside all the differences and disputes of the past.“I have taken the initiative by saying there should not be any ego or water basin problems in utilizing the water. It is very painful that despite this, the AP government declared a new scheme without even consulting with the Telangana state to lift water from Srisailam project unilaterally. This dented the very spirit with which water should be utilised by the two states with mutual cooperation,” he said.KCR said the Jagan government’s move was highly objectionable and asked the officials to file a complaint in the Krishna Water Management Board and also the apex council under the Union water resources ministry. He also instructed the officials to approach the Supreme Court, if necessary.The issue is likely to figure in the meeting of Krishna River Management Board to be held on Wednesday through video-conferencing.KCR pointed out that the AP State Reorganization Act had clearly stipulated that if new irrigation projects are planned in AP or Telangana, they should get clearance from the apex committee. “But the AP government did not get any such approval. Srisailam project is a combined project of both AP and Telangana and water from this project should be utilised by both the States and AP cannot construct new projects unilaterally,” he argued.Andhra Pradesh irrigation minister P Anil Kumar, however, clarified to reporters that the AP government was proposing the new schemes only to utilise surplus waters of Krishna river and was not trespassing into the rights of Telangana.“Because of the disputes between the two states in the past, more than 800 tmc of Krishna water had gone waste into the sea. We are only trying to utilise a part of it during the flood season,” he explained.Another senior YSRC lawmaker Malladi Vishnu said it was Telangana government which had constructed new projects like Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift irrigation scheme on Krishna waters without apex council approval. “We are taking up projects well within our rights,” he asserted.Last year, both the chief ministers had proposed to take up a joint irrigation project to divert surplus Godavari waters to Krishna basin so as to bring in more area under irrigation. Both KCR and Jagan held a few rounds of talks, followed by official-level meetings, but they have not made any headway till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tealangana-andhra-pradesh-face-of-over-krishna-river-water/story-PrTmh6t2VKvcGHhkvx6ZDN.html

The CM added that more relaxations will be given in these zones.“The red zones would be further divided into three categories. Steps would also be taken to restart the 100-day work scheme in the non-containment areas,” said Mamata Banerjee.There are at least 566 containment zones in the state. Out of them, Kolkata has 326 containment areas.Banerjee claimed that people were facing problems since the imposition of the lockdown on March 25 as the move was “poorly planned”.“Don’t think we will get relief from the Covid-19 crisis anytime soon. We should have a three-month short term plan in place to tackle the situation,” she said after a review meeting with state officials.Talking about her interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his video conference with chief ministers on Monday, Banerjee said Bengal gained nothing from the meeting and was left “empty-handed”.The Centre is yet to clear the “legitimate financial dues” of the state, she claimed.“I have raised several issues during the meeting with PM. But I must say we always return empty-handed after our meetings with the PM. We are yet to get our dues,” the chief minister said.Referring to the communal clashes that broke out in Hooghly district last week, Banerjee said action will be taken against those found guilty.“Stern action will be taken against those involved in communal clashes amid the lockdown.

12-05-2020||India||To counter RSS’ Balagokulam, Congress plans Jawahar Bal Manch for children||The Congress is launching a new organisation for children aged between 10 and 17 years to prepare them for the future and inculcate “constitutional values” in them in a bid to counter the Balagokulam initiative of the RSS.The party decided to launch Jawahar Bal Manch (JBM) nationwide following the success of a similar concept in Kerala, people familiar with developments said.The former Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president in Kerala, Ramesh Chennithala, had launched Jawahar Balajana Vedi (JBV) as part of the state unit in 2007.“The idea is to inculcate constitutional values and a spirit of nationalism and instil secular principles in children, besides developing their artistic and cultural talents,” JBV chairman GV Hari told HT.“Apart from emphatically upholding slogans of democracy, secularism and socialism, JBM seeks to sustain in children the qualities of fraternity, equality and compassion as their ideals of life,” he said.To kick-start the project, the JBM will organise an online National Dream Photography Contest on May 21, the 29th anniversary of the death of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.The JBV in Kerala was set up in response to Balagokulam initiative of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This initiative was started in the southern state in 1975 and later registered as a nationwide cultural movement in 1981.Through this, the RSS sought to inculcate moral values in children and weekly cultural and moral science classes are held for those up to 18 years of age.Hari said the JBV in Kerala currently has a membership of 250,000 children and 32 of its previous members now hold key positions in the National Students Union of India (NSUI), a frontal organisation of the grand old party.“In terms of branding, the JBM will be completely apolitical but we will aggressively promote it as a strong counter to the RSS, which runs the ‘operation catch them young’ in many parts of the country,” a senior All India Congress Committee (AICC) functionary said on condition of anonymity.He said discussions in this regard were held with Congress president Sonia Gandhi last December. “The meeting decided to keep JBM non-political, but strong emphasis was given on its position and strategic importance in terms of sending the right message to the children’s community through activities and storytelling,” he added.Hari said the Kerala model is being replicated in other states in view of its “huge success”. “We have already run pilots in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab and will start soon in Rajasthan. We were going to give it a big launch push in April but had to defer it due to the coronavirus pandemic,” said Hari, who is overseeing the project’s expansion across the country.Apart from student exchange programmes, JBM plans to hold annual cultural festivals in different states.“We are also planning to develop a unified volunteer work force that is ready to lend a helping hand in times of distress. An online newsletter in English and Hindi is also on the cards,” Hari said.“One additional language, other than English, Hindi or the mother tongue, will be taught to children, like we teach Gujarati or Punjabi in Kerala. While students can talk about any subject, we discourage political discussions,” he added.There is a view in the Congress that the JBM should become a frontal organisation to enable it to expand its footprint nationwide with the help of the parent party’s organisational structure.“But for that, the Congress Working Committee’s (CWC) approval is required,” said the AICC functionary quoted above.The Congress currently has five frontal units – Seva Dal, Youth Congress, Mahila Congress, NSUI and the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-counter-rss-balagokulam-congress-plans-jawahar-bal-manch-for-children/story-UwZB1ZmNJPkiJwxjvagkNP.html

12-05-2020||India||In Chhattisgarh, spending in govt departments cut by 30% to fight slowdown||The Chhattisgarh government has lowered the expenditure limit in the departments after the decrease in revenue receipts due to economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In an order issued on Monday, the departments will now be able to spend only 70 percent of their allotted budget.The order states that the expenditure limit in the first quarter of the financial year shall not exceed 20 percent of the total budget provision. In case of excessive need by the department, the proposal will have to be submitted to the finance department with justification for relaxing this expenditure limit.It has been directed that the departments, including construction departments, which made provision for expenditure under the capital expenditure head in the budget for the year 2020-21, the priority should be decided by the departments based on the urgency of the works.“Departments should prioritise completion of the works under construction as much as possible and in case of new tasks becoming very urgent, they should be considered for approval as per the delegation of financial rights on priority basis. The new items for which the proposal for approval is to be forwarded to the finance department should be submitted only after deciding the priority with administrative approval of the minister of the department,” a press release issued by the government said.The finance department has prepared a department-wise time schedule to discuss the economy keeping in mind the effect that the nationwide lockdown has had on the state and the economic growth.As per Additional chief secretary, finance, Amitabh Jain, the total budget allocated to all the departments this year was about Rs 95,000 crore in the budget.“By this cut of 30 percent in the allotted budget to the departments, we are hoping to save close to Rs 25,000 crore of the government’s money,” said Jain.Senior BJP leader and spokesperson Sacchinand Upasane said that the state government has done nothing on development front since coming into power.“Nothing on the development front has been done. All development works are stopped since the government was formed in 2018. Everyone in the state is facing debt.

Similarly, the registration link for migrants stranded in Delhi is not posted on the Delhi government website; rather it is on the website of Delhi Shelter Board. In other instances complicating matters, Bihar government’s portal is non-functional, it said. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn MHA’s standard operating procedures (SOP), issued on Monday, the letter states that it doesn’t detail how online and offline registrations will be coordinated and added that the logistics and the basis for allotment of passengers to trains was ‘unclear’ too.It further pointed out that there were no protocols regarding information dissemination to workers about the travel plan and schedule in an easily accessible manner. The SOPs also don’t provide any way for workers to track their application status and that the cost considerations for the workers and the protocols for intra-state travels were not clear.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The SOPs, the letter states, also don’t provide any offline registration protocol as well as any criteria for prioritising passengers such as the elderly, differently-abled etc. On a query by HT, there was no response from the ministry of home affairs till filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gaps-in-government-s-migrants-transfer-plan-highlighted-remedies-sought/story-270gp9ckUTPq8mimS6mHuK.html

It also features musical contributions from Tubby, Pandit Ravi Chari, Pandit Rakesh Chaurasiya and Ustad Faisal Qureshi.The song combines English lyrics with notes and beats of Indian classical music and spreads the message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, or the world is one family. It carries a “message of hope, joy, resilience, fighting spirit and never-say-die attitude of all in our collective fight against Covid-19”, according to a statement from the ministry.The coronavirus has had a “huge impact on humanity, cutting across all boundaries, physical and social, of nations, caste, class, colour, religion and belief systems, bringing the world to its knees”, but people have stood united, helping, sharing knowledge and coordinating with each other, cutting across boundaries in the fight against Covid-19, the statement said.“This composition is an expression of our deep appreciation and gratitude to all brave Covid warriors the world over, risking their lives to protect ours. It is a homage to all the artists and performers who represent the cultural legacy of our countries and who contribute to keep our cultural heritage vibrant and alive, especially in these difficult times,” it added.The song is also a tribute to the countless individuals silently helping neighbours, strangers and people around them in these times of distress. It is also a “message to the world that together we shall surely win the fight against the Coronavirus and many such challenges that humanity and the human race face”, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/usha-uthup-other-artists-power-india-s-new-song-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-6Hz9NR3YhfLkCIl5bG3VoJ.html
12-05-2020||India||US CDC provides $3.6 million to support Covid-19 response in India||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will provide $3.6 million to assist the Indian government’s response to the Covid-19 epidemic, including prevention and preparedness activities in the country. This initial tranche of funding from the CDC aims to strengthen and support the Indian government’s efforts to increase laboratory capacity for SARS-COV-2 testing, including molecular diagnostics and serology, said a statement issued by the US embassy on Tuesday. The funding will also be used to support the development of infection prevention and control (IPC) centres of excellence that can improve the ability of hospital networks to detect Covid-19 and strengthen local health systems through enhanced surveillance and monitoring. The CDC will work with local partners to assist in the development of a strong public health workforce to support India’s capacity to respond to the current pandemic and future threats. “The scope of support will include planning for health emergency operations centres to further strengthen public health emergency management capacities. In addition, the CDC India program will provide technical assistance for the government of India’s ongoing crisis emergency and risk communication efforts,” the statement said.Since early January, the CDC’s India office has collaborated with sub-national and national government bodies to support the Covid-19 response. These efforts have focused on laboratory strengthening, infection prevention and control, health workforce development, emergency management, risk communication, and community engagement. The CDC has conducted training courses across India for healthcare administrators, physicians, nurses, and hospital staff on preparedness and response, infection prevention, laboratory operations, and field epidemiology to equip frontline workers with skills to collect, analyse and interpret data, and contribute to evidence-based decisions.The goal of the CDC’s global health response to Covid-19 is to limit human-to-human transmission and minimise the pandemic’s impact through partnerships with country and non-governmental partners to mitigate vulnerabilities. The CDC has a long-standing technical collaboration with India’s health ministry to control HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, eradicate polio, and prepare responses to influenza and other pandemic diseases.

12-05-2020||India||Kerala nurse who survived nipah wants to care for Covid -19 patients||Two years after she became the first patient in Kerala to recover from the dreaded nipah virus, M Anjanya, now a qualified nurse, wants to work in Covid hospital as a mark of gratitude to those who had prayed for her. The nipah virus which had an 80 per cent mortality rate had put her on ventilator for more than a week. But her recovery became a story of her resistance and the resolve of a team of dedicated medical professionals. It was also dubbed as a wonder in the medical world.Ajanya who was then a nursing intern, graduated from the Government Nursing College in Kozhikkode with distinction in January is waiting for employment.The 21-year-old GNM (general nursing and midwifery) graduate said, “I am yearning to work in a Covid hospital. I am sure we will overcome this challenge also. I love my profession more now. Many prayed for my life and it is time for me to pay back,” she said.“Today is the World Nurses Day. Many frontline warriors have fallen prey to the monstrous virus. But their sacrifice inspires people like me and I am sure we will tame it soon,” she said.The daughter of a farm labourer and ‘anganwadi’ worker she was afflicted with nipah while she was doing her internship at the Kozhikkode medical college hospital in 2018. “I was in the ICU ward looking after my patients as part of my training. On May 18 I developed high fever and other ailments and got admitted at the same ward. Two days later I lost my consciousness. I was later told Lini Puthussery was in the same ward,” she said.Lini, another nurse, was not lucky like her and died. Last year the state government instituted an award in Lini’s memory and the World Health Organization also lauded her contributions.“I consider it as one of the noblest professions in the world. Becoming a nurse was my childhood dream. I feel I am nearer to my dream. I have applied at several places I am waiting for the call. As a beginner it is time for me to take challenges head on. I would love to care for Covid-19 patients,” she said.Among the 19 infected with nipah Ajanya was the first to come out of the hospital and later Ubeesh, a male nurse, was also discharged but 17 others including Lini succumbed to the disease. “After Lini’s death it was a big challenge for the medical team. A head nurse stayed at the hospital for a week noting down Ajanya’s condition every minute. It is great she is ready to take up the profession,” recalled district medical officer Dr V Jayasree. She also said that the nipah battle had made medical professionals in north Kerala bolder. Nipah was an unknown virus, with no medicine or history of treatment or carriers and health experts hit a blind alley in the initial stages of the outbreak but they fought back valiantly and contained its secondary infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/payback-time-says-kerala-nurse-who-wants-to-care-for-covid-19-patients/story-vPVWL2xClRAhmN5AffRExM.html
12-05-2020||India||Lockdown tale of Uttarakhand driver: 40 days in a truck and now 14 days in quarantine||A driver from Uttarakhand spent 40 days in his truck near the border with Rajasthan amid the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, before he reached his home district of Champawat, where he has been isolated for 14 days by local authorities.Forty-seven days after he began his journey, Sunil Kumar reached Champawat on Saturday. Kumar, a resident of Munch area of Champawat, has been driving a truck while based in Delhi for the past six years.According to Kumar, he was stuck due to the lockdown and spent 40 days in his truck near the border with Rajasthan.“I left for Hyderabad from Delhi on March 22. I reached Shahpura area near the Delhi-Rajasthan border on March 23, and I was stranded there due to the lockdown,” he said.“Rajasthan Police didn’t allow me to proceed and Delhi Police didn’t allow me to go back. So there was no way to go anywhere. I decided to wait in the truck. I had a stove and rations for a few days and I cooked food inside the truck. Later I bought food from a nearby grocery shop,” he said.Kumar added, “It was a very difficult time, waiting day in and day out. Sometimes, the difference between days and nights didn’t seem to matter. I would spend my nights counting the stars. I was hoping the lockdown would end on April 24, and then I would be able to go home or to Hyderabad. But the lockdown was extended and my difficulties continued.”He faced many problems while living in the truck – he wasn’t able to charge his mobile phone after some time and couldn’t remain in touch with his family.“Weird thoughts would cross my mind. I missed my family, especially my pregnant wife. There were times when I thought whether I would ever reach my home,” Kumar said.When the lockdown was relaxed and commercial vehicles were allowed to ply on May 3, he moved out and reached Delhi two days later.“In Delhi, l left my truck at my transport agency’s office. I registered to return on my state government’s website. My health screening was done and I boarded a bus for Uttarakhand. With the help of authorities from my state, I finally reached Champawat on the morning of May 9,” he said.“The local authorities quarantined me in a shelter and took my samples for the coronavirus test. When my report came negative on Sunday, they sent me for home quarantine for 14 days.”Kumar said he was happy to be finally home. “Now I will go to Delhi only after my wife delivers the baby. Sometimes in my sleep, I still feel I am in the truck,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-tale-of-uttarakhand-driver-40-days-in-a-truck-and-now-14-days-in-quarantine/story-cagT9fUKnDBzrLhPGTkgSO.html
12-05-2020||India||‘Covid-19 quarantine period over 14 days must be justified by authorities’: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday held that the Delhi government will have to give a reason for keeping a person in quarantine for more than 14 days, else lift the lockdown on the person, observing that the period of 14 days is “not mandatory but to serve a general guideline”.Justice C Hari Shankar said that as of now, there is no certainty of opinion regarding the extent of virulence of the Covid-19 virus, its actual period of gestation, the period taken for symptoms, in an infected person, to manifest themselves, or the period for which a person, once infected, remains a potential source of infection to others. It remarked that the medical community, the world over, is yet to come to grips with this virus, and isolate its individual characteristics.The court was hearing a plea by photojournalist Amit Bhargava, who had sought formulation of quarantine rules for the people while indicating whether the quarantine starts from the day of contact with the infected person or the date of diagnosis of the infected person.Also read: PM Modi to address nation at 8pm today, day after meeting with CMs In a judgment passed on Monday, Justice Hari Shankar said it is “unwilling to hold that in each and in every case, the period of home quarantine must stand limited to 14 days, and no more” while also observing that unjustified quarantine also has “deleterious civil consequences”.“……this court is of the opinion that, at this juncture, the interests of justice would be abundantly protected by a direction, to the effect that if any person, who does not display Covid-19 symptoms, and has not tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, is home quarantined for over 14 days, he shall have a right to represent to the authorities against such continued quarantine and, if he so represents, the authorities would be bound either to lift the quarantine forthwith or to explain, to the person concerned, as expeditiously as possible and without any undue delay, the reason for keeping him in home quarantine for over 14 days,” the court said in a 22-page judgment.Advocate Shyel Trehan, appearing for the petitioner, contended that the persons, who are under home quarantine, are unaware of the officer, who is required to be contacted, should any exigency arise during the period of home quarantine.Following this, counsel for the Delhi government, advocate Shobhana Takiar, submitted that a helpline number, on which persons, under home quarantine, can establish contact with the Ministry/Departments, would be displayed on the official website of the Government of NCT of Delhi (GNCTD).The judge also said that in formulating and implementing its policy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic the executive administration is traversing uncharted territory.“The executive must, in such a circumstance, be afforded the requisite play in the joints, so as to formulate, and implement, its policy as meaningfully and efficiently as possible. Absent any legal or constitutional infraction, therefore, courts have necessarily to be slow in subjecting executive action, taken in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, to searching judicial scrutiny,” the court said.It also said that the Delhi government should have issued a show-cause notice to anyone who is found to have breached the quarantine or the lockdown, even before the issuance of a warning to him to desist from doing so.“Besides the fact that the law does not require the issuance of any such notice before issuing a warning, any such mandate, if issued, would have the potential of seriously derailing the efforts, of the executive administration, to enforce discipline during the period of lockdown/quarantine,” the court said.The plea had contended that the petitioner was kept under quarantine beyond the necessary period of 14 days and the authorities had wrongly calculated the quarantine period. He also stated that on April 20 he got a disciplinary notice from the SDM, warning punitive action if he violated the norms. “There appears to be no basis for the calculation of a home quarantine basis for a period of over 30 days from the date of contact with the infected person, either clinically, or in law,” the plea had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unjustified-covid-19-quarantine-can-be-challenged-delhi-high-court/story-d0enRb6LhbaeuFQl5kHIDM.html

One of these four patients is a 25-year-old nursing staff from the district’s Janpigur state hospital. The rest are men, aged 30, 58 and 65 years. Murshidabad and Malda districts are among the top contributors to the migrant workforce from West Bengal. “The swab samples of these four patients were collected by Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital on May 6. The results were released on May 10. This is a cause for concern,” Dr Koushik Chaki, secretary of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, said.“The state government needs to carry out more tests. More and more doctors and nursing staff across Bengal are getting infected and frontline warriors are not getting personal protection equipment (PPE) in adequate quantity,” said Dr Chaki.The prominent body of physicians wrote its second letter in four days on Monday to chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, highlighting the issue.“Without robust testing facilities all across the state, normalisation of all healthcare facilities cannot be resolved,” said the letter. Incidentally, a train carrying 1,224 migrant workers from Kerala reached Berhampore station in Murshidabad on May 6. The administration collected swab samples from some of the passengers of this train and the test results are awaited. The three men who tested positive on Sunday night, however, came from Delhi by the road a week ago, health officials said. The patients live in different villages in the Suti-II community block area. The district administration has barricaded these villages.There are 70 quarantine centres in Murshidabad but most are lying empty, health department officials said. The number of Covid-19 patients in the district has reached five after the new detections.“We may find a quite different number if tests are carried out extensively,” said a senior doctor who did not wish to be named.Chief medical officer of health (Murshidabad), Dr Prasanta Biswas, said, “All four patients have been admitted to the Covid-19 hospital in Berhampore.”Three migrant workers, who recently returned from Ajmer in Rajasthan to Malda district, tested positive on Saturday. They came in a train that also carried a large number of pilgrims who went to Ajmer Sharif in the desert state. “Our government has made all arrangement for treatment of the patients,” Asok Das, Murshidabad district’s Trinamool Congress vice-president, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infection-among-migrant-workers-in-2-bengal-districts-trigger-demand-for-more-covid-19-tests/story-W1tME8XDTkdYOENmxZg1FP.html

12-05-2020||India||HC grants interim protection to Delhi Minorities Commission chairman||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday granted interim protection from arrest to Zafar-ul-Islam, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission till June 22 following a plea for anticipatory bail after the police booked him for sedition for his social media posts earlier this month.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri said that no coercive action should be taken against Islam till the next date of hearing (June 22) after he had moved the high court apprehending arrest in “a motivated, untenable and absolutely frivolous complaint” registered at the Lodhi Colony police station.He had also pleaded that the facts and grounds demonstrate that the registration of the FIR was a gross abuse of the process of law and also establish his innocence.On Tuesday, advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, told the court that no case was being made against their client. The plea said that Islam, in his social media posts highlighted the targeting of Muslims by “bigots” in India and expressed his thanks to Kuwait, for expressing concern on the issue harassment of Muslims in India.“It is noteworthy that his social media posts make it evident that while acknowledging the international community’s support, he has emphatically stated that Indian Muslims do not seek or require external help in India. Despite offers of solidarity from foreign countries, he (Islam) has firmly taken the position of non-interference in India’s internal affairs,” the petition said.The court sought to know from the Delhi police about the actions taken by them on the FIR. Appearing for the city police, advocate Chaitnaya Gosain, told the court that a notice has been issued to Islam under relevant section of the CrPC. He said that Islam has submitted some documents and information as sought by them.Grover told the court that her client is ready to cooperate in the investigation but prior notice should be given because of his age and the lockdown. The court then directed the Delhi police to give advance notice to Islam for questioning.The petition had contended that a substantial portion of the hate speech and attacks on the Muslim community was in the form of spreading fake and fabricated news that vilifies Muslims and portrays them as spreading coronavirus. Misinformation was spread to target Muslims as carriers and spreaders of coronavirus. Such misinformation, including that members of the Tablighi Jamaat misbehaved with doctors was refuted by the local police on more than one instance.Sedition is a non-bailable offence under the Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code and the punishment ranges from imprisonment up to three years to a life term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-interim-protection-to-delhi-minorities-commission-chairman/story-blpyIiNWHC3siPyw4Az4HN.html

Videos of KTR, son of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, frequently sneezing into his towel went viral on social media. The minister seemed in a bit of discomfort while attending a series of programmes and interacting with officials.In light of the growing number of Covid-19 cases in the state, enquiries about the minister’s health gathered pace.“@KTRTRS Sir. Disturbed to know that you were down with flu symptoms yesterday in Sircilla. Concerned about your health. You have been a Covid warrior since the virus engulfed us, unmindful of your health. Please reassure about your health. You are our hope. Please take care,” tweeted one of his followers.There were also comments in private conversations that KTR should have gone to the hospital for a Covid-19 test, as the health protocol mandates that people with symptoms of cold, flu, running nose, sore throat and fever should visit the nearest hospital.KTR, taking note of the tweet, clarified that he was perfectly well and apologised for any inconvenience he may have caused. “Many thanks for your concern sir. Perfectly well now. Developed an allergic cold (struggling for many years) en route to Siricilla. Didn’t want to cancel my visit suddenly as it would inconvenience many people. Apologies for any inconvenience I may have caused inadvertently,” he tweeted, in reply to his follower’s query.The minister inaugurated the central lighting system, administrative building, workers’ canteen and sewing training centre at the Textile Park in Baddenapalli of Thangallapalli block in Siricilla, his home constituency on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-sneezing-ktr-during-a-state-function-causes-flutter-in-telangana/story-8cJXhoFHJ3SLpCw9xYOuWP.html

12-05-2020||India||Economic stimulus by governments may be exploited by terrorists, says FATF||Global money laundering watchdog – Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – has claimed that the stimulus measures and international financial assistance announced by various countries to mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic are likely to be exploited by the terrorists and criminals by posing as genuine businesses seeking assistance, according to report released by it.It warns that terrorists and criminals will use this economic downturn to move to new cash-incentive and high-liquidity lines of business in developing countries – both for laundering of proceeds as well as fund their terror operations.“In an economic downturn, criminals may seek to invest in real estate or troubled businesses to generate cash and mask illicit proceeds. Criminal groups can also introduce illicit proceeds into the financial system by restructuring existing loans and lines of credit. In addition, corporate insolvency proceedings can free up illicit cash contained in businesses whilst masking the funds’ origins,” FATF says in the first such report since the pandemic forced worldwide shutdowns in February-March this year.Tax evasion and related crimes may increase as individuals and companies facing economic difficulties look to reduce their fiscal burdens, the report adds.Many countries are reporting an “overall” increase in banknote withdrawals, which the FATF claims is likely to be used by criminals/terrorists to cover their illicit funds with “redeposit funds” when the markets stabilise. “Banknotes can be used to purchase safe haven assets (e.g. gold), which are less easily traceable,” the FATF states.Some of the countries have also reported an increase in fundraising scams where criminals posing as international organizations or charities circulate emails requesting donations for Covid-19 related fundraising campaigns (purportedly for research, victims and/or products), according to the report.The health crisis, the Paris-based body says, is also impacting the government and private sectors’ abilities to implement anti-money laundering measures and counter terrorist financing as well as international cooperation. Formal cooperation, such as mutual legal assistance and extradition are already impacted by the crisis due to limitation or suspension of court operations, and the delayed execution of orders caused by travel restrictions.The anti-money laundering/counter terror financing (AML/CFT) ‘on-site’ inspections have been postponed or substituted with desk-based inspections. Several countries, according to the report, have even suspended their decisions to impose monetary penalties on the violators. In fact, some Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) in lower capacity countries are either significantly “reducing their operations” or even “shutting down completely”. There is also reporting of delay or postponement of prosecutions due to suspension of trials and hearings.“There are reports that diversion of law enforcement and security resources to Covid-19 responses in high-risk, poorly resourced countries, may embolden terrorists and terrorist financiers in their activities,” FATF states.While banks worldwide are trying to follow anti-money laundering measures, several countries have flagged that there is increased activity in non-banking sectors like online gambling, the insurance sector, dealers in precious metals and stones and securities, while there is decreased activity in other sectors like real estate and casinos.The movement of migrant workers in various countries – India is one of them – will particularly cause disruption for money value transfer service sector due to confinement measures and company shutdowns.“Should the current economic situation further deteriorate, there is a risk that financial institutions may re-prioritize their AML/CFL efforts and focus on broader prudential and stability measures,” FATF notes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economic-stimulus-by-governments-may-be-exploited-by-terrorists-says-fatf/story-yXL8rwK2Fhz5jRiUrzXAeJ.html
12-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Testing all those returning back pose a challenge to most NE states||Guwahati: The North-East, home to around 3.5% of the country’s population, is staring at a major challenge as thousands of stranded people are set to return to their respective native places amid the Central government’s bid to ease lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Inadequate testing facilities in the entire region, comprising seven states, have become a cause for concern, as most of them are dependent on Assam.The state governments in the region are worried about the daily spike in Covid-19 positive cases from other parts of the country from where the stranded people are trying to return home.Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu sought the Centre’s support in procuring an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved TrueNat machine during Monday’s video-conference that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had convened to seek all the CMs’ feedback on whether to ease or extend lockdown restrictions.TrueNat, which has been used to detect tuberculosis (TB) and also approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO), is a small battery-operated user-friendly machine that can conduct Covid-19 tests and the results are obtained within an hour.Khandu said that the machine is needed for conducting “faster and effective tests amid a rise in interstate travellers entering Arunachal Pradesh”.The CM’s concerns stem from the fact that Arunachal has only one Covid-19 testing laboratory in Naharlagun, whose daily capacity is around 70. The state is completely dependent on neighbouring Assam to test more swab samples.“We expect around 12,000 stranded people to return home and each one of them needs to undergo a Covid-19 test. However, we don’t have the bandwidth to conduct so many tests in such a short span of time. We’re working on setting up another laboratory in the eastern part of the state by end-May to ease the burden on the Naharlagun facility,” said Arunachal health minister Alo Libang.Arunachal has recorded only one Covid-19 positive case to date and the patient has also recovered. But, the remote and the largest state in the north-east could be staring at a healthcare emergency, as thousands of stranded people are expected to return home soon, as concerns are raised about scant testing facilities.Other states in the region are also feeling the heat due to screening and testing inadequacies, as the stranded people are headed home after the government announced the easing of lockdown restrictions.“Around 10,000 people are expected to return to Mizoram and all of them will undergo tests. However, they can’t be tested at one go. Initially, all the returnees will be quarantined and then the tests will be conducted on a priority basis. We’re working overtime to set up more laboratories,” said Mizoram CM Zoramthanga.Mizoram’s lone Covid-19 positive patient, a pastor, has also recovered. So far, the state, which has its lone laboratory in the state capital Aizawl, has conducted only 206 tests.Meghalaya is expecting around 13,000 people to return to the state. Though the state health authorities plan to screen all the returnees, tests will be conducted only on symptomatic patients.Meghalaya, too, had only one laboratory at the North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS) in the state capital, Shillong, till recently. A second laboratory, set up at Tura in the Garo Hills, however, has become functional.“The daily testing capacity at the NEIGRIHMS and Tura is over 200 and below 100, respectively,” said Meghalaya health minister AL Hek.Assam is expecting nearly one lakh people to return home and the state government is pulling out all stops to ramp up its screening and testing facilities. Plans are afoot to allow a staggered entry of returnees in a bid to ensure an effective administrative control.The state government has requisitioned five trains from Indian Railways to bring back stranded migrant workers. The trains will repatriate up to 10,000 people, who have been stranded in Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad, from Tuesday. The trains will run till May 24.Though Assam has seven testing laboratories – the highest in the region – neighbouring states such as Arunachal, Meghalaya and Nagaland are also utilising these facilities.Around 17,000 stranded people from Tripura have registered themselves on the state government portal, seeking to return home at the earliest.Tripura has a single testing laboratory at Agartala’s GB Pant Hospital, and two more are likely to become operational soon. The state government plans to conduct mandatory and random tests on symptomatic and asymptomatic people, respectively.Manipur has two testing laboratories in its state capital Imphal, but the state government is under tremendous pressure, as around 34,000 stranded people are planning to return home soon.Nagaland, which has not registered a single Covid-19 positive case yet, launched a state government-run website on May 7, urging the stranded people to register on the portal if they wish to return home. The registration closed on Monday, and around 18,000 are waiting to come back to Nagaland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-cm-seeks-centre-s-help-in-procuring-covid-19-machines-for-faster-testing/story-2thwmcDFoHmnC4YfMsbmjJ.html

12-05-2020||India||In Pompeo’s 7-nation concall, focus on China over accountability, dependency||At a 75-minute video conference initiated by United States secretary of state Mike Pompeo, foreign ministers of seven countries including India, Israel and South Korea on Monday evening discussed the coronavirus pandemic, its fallout on the world economy and the way ahead.The conference, which is being described as ‘experimental online diplomacy’, also discussed resilience in supply chains, diplomatese for dependence on only one country for supplies. In this case, China.The Trump administration has spoken about plans to move industrial supply chains out of China for some time.Beijing’s handling of the outbreak and the subsequent response appears to have amplified the urgency. As one US official recently described it, the pandemic has turned out to be the ‘perfect storm’ that crystallised the worries that countries have had about dependence on China.Mike Pompeo had alluded to Monday’s video conference on April 29 when he declared that the US government was working with Australia, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Vietnam to “move the global economy forward” and explore restructuring “supply chains to prevent something like this from ever happening again”.Monday’s video conference is seen to be the first big step, joined by India’s Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, Australia’s Marise Payne, Israel’s Yisrael Katz, Japan’s Taro Kono, Brazil’s Ernesto Araújo and South Korea’s Kang Kyung-wha.Also Read: What does the US-China rift mean for the world? | OpinionTo be sure, the video conference wasn’t a single-agenda initiative.Jaishankar tweeted the conversation covered pandemic response, global health management, medical cooperation, economic recovery and travel norms. “Look forward to continuing this engagement,” he said.People familiar with the development told Hindustan Times that more friendly countries were expected to join similar engagements in future.At the Monday conference, they said each country shared its experience in handling the outbreak and how they could help. For instance, Israel talked about the vaccine that it believes is within its grasp, Pompeo about economic recovery.The sentiment was that recovering from this pandemic - which was quite unlike previous virus outbreaks that were limited to particular parts of the world - is going to be a long haul. That the countries should prepare for long-term solutions and cooperation among friendly countries is going to be the essence of any recovery plan.Also Read: ‘Replace China’: India looks to lure more than 1,000 US businessesBut China and its response to the pandemic may have been a recurring theme through the conversation.A US state department readout of the video conference said the foreign ministers had discussed the importance of international cooperation, transparency and accountability in “combating the Covid-19 pandemic and in addressing its causes”.The United States has accused Beijing of suppressing early information about the outbreak of the virus first detected in the central city of Wuhan, and downplaying its risks. Last month, President Donald Trump also announced that Washington would hold back its $ 400 million funding to the World Health Organisation that has been blamed for playing along with Beijing.The US decision to hold back the money - it funded 15% of the WHO’s budget - has spotlighted the role of the World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and ignited calls from other countries for transparency and accountability for the pandemic.State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the seven leaders “also discussed collaboration toward preventing future global health crises and reaffirmed the importance of the rules-based international order.“The rule of law, transparency, and accountability will be key to our shared success,” Pompeo later tweeted. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne’s office also made the same point on transparency, underlining that “learning the lessons of this pandemic are critical to prevent future global health crises”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pompeo-s-7-nation-concall-focus-on-china-over-accountability-dependency/story-sCGISlbjGj0fR1btWAGcyO.html
12-05-2020||India||German man living at Delhi airport since March 18 leaves for Amsterdam on a relief flight||Edgard Ziebart, a German national who had been living in Delhi airport’s transit area for the past 55 days, on Tuesday morning left for Amsterdam in a relief flight of KLM Airlines. Ziebart was scanned for coronavirus infection before he got on to the flight around 3 am with 291 other passengers and was found to be healthy. In his self-reporting form Ziebart mentioned T3 as his house and Indira Gandhi International airport as the place of his stay in India, officials said.HT reported on Monday that Ziebart had been living in the airport since March 18, after he arrived in New Delhi from Hanoi as a transit passenger on his way to Istanbul. March 18 was the day India banned all flights to Turkey to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Four days later, India banned all international flights. Stranded, Ziebart could neither exit India, nor the airport’s transit area because he does not have an Indian visa.An airport official indicated that Ziebart, who has not applied for an Indian visa, was unlikely to get one even if he did because of a prior criminal record in Germany.A senior officer from the Delhi airport, who wished not to be named, said Ziebart had told them on Monday that he will leave India soon as a flight is available. “Around 3 am, he boarded a flight KL872. There were total 292 passengers on-board that flight. It was a special flight being operated from Delhi to Amsterdam. Because he was eligible to go to Europe, he was allowed to leave. His tickets cost him around Rs 43,000. He paid for his tickets on his own,” the officer said.In his self reporting form, that has been mandated by the ministry of health and family welfare for all international passengers, Ziebart mentioned Terminal 3 as his house and Delhi’s IGI airport as his place of stay in India. He told the medical staff that he was not feeling fever, coughing or any respiratory disorder, officer added.The Indian authorities had recently served a “Leave India Notice” to Ziebart and he had assured them that he will leave the country soon as a flight is made available, officer said.Last week, Indian authorities had tried to accommodate Ziebart on a relief flight to Ankara, but Turkish authorities refused to accept him on-board since the flight was only for their citizens or permanent card holders. When German embassy officials contacted him and offered him a passage back to his home country, he had declined their offer, a spokesman for the German embassy in New Delhi told HT on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/german-man-living-at-delhi-airport-since-march-18-leaves-for-amsterdam-on-a-relief-flight/story-eJ5KeO9muVS7uxKWPQShiN.html
12-05-2020||India||Maharashtra panel decides to release 50% of prisoners on temporary bail to prevent spread of Covid-19||A high powered committee in Maharashtra has decided to release 50% of the 35,239 prisoners in jails across the state on temporary bail as part of measures to control the spread of Covid-19. The order, which came a week after 184 prisoners at Arthur Road Central Prison in Mumbai tested positive for Covid-19, doesn’t give a timeframe for the release or state which category of prisoners will be sent home.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The committee, headed by Justice AA Sayed and comprising additional chief secretary (home) Sanjay Chahande and director general of prisons SN Pandey, has said due process will be followed and the prisoners being released will have to secure bail.No prisoners either charged or convicted under provisions of special laws, such as the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act (MCOCA) of 1999, the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), will be released on temporary bail because of the coronavirus pandemic.Chahande said, “They (prisoners) will have to get bail. That means the due process of law will have to be followed.” For temporary bail, eligible prisoners will have to approach the concerned court and obtain an order. Parole leave can be secured at the prisons, he said.While deciding to release 50% of the state’s prison population, the committee on Monday rejected a representation by advocate SB Talekar, which contended the decision to not release prisoners charged or convicted under special statutes was discriminatory. Talekar argued that blanket exclusion of the prisoners charged or convicted for offences under the special acts was arbitrary and defeated the thrust of the Supreme Court’s March 23 order to decongest prisons in the wake of the pandemic.“In any event, the prisoners charged/convicted under the special acts including MPID Act cannot claim to be released from prison as of right. It is required to be noted that the offences under MPID Act are against large number of victims who are mostly poor depositors, and whose interests are required to be safeguarded and recoveries made from properties. The MPID Act is enacted to protect the interest of the depositors and the prisoners charged/convicted for offences under the MPID Act cannot be treated as belonging to the same class of prisoners who are to be released on interim bail or parole,” the committee said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The Supreme Court had left it to the discretion of the high powered committee to determine which class or category of prisoners can be released on interim bail or parole, depending on the nature and severity of the offence or any other relevant factor, the Committee said while rejecting Talekar’s representation.The Supreme Court, in its order, said, “We direct that each State/Union Territory shall constitute a High Powered Committee comprising of (I) Chairman of the State Legal Services Committee, (ii) the Principal Secretary (Home/Prison) by whatever designation is known as, (ii) Director General of Prison(s), to determine which class of prisoners can be released on parole or an interim bail for such period as may be thought appropriate.”The apex court had cited an instance and said, “For instance, the State/Union Territory could consider the release of prisoners who have been convicted or are under-trial for offences for which prescribed punishment is up to 7 years or less, with or without fine and the prisoner has been convicted for a lesser number of years than the maximum.” In a subsequent order dated April 13, the Supreme Court clarified it had not directed states or union territories to compulsorily release prisoners from their prisons.Justice BN Srikrishna, former Supreme Court judge said, “If this is what the high-powered committee has stated then it’s absurd. If prisoners have to follow the due process of law, then why was the high-powered committee made. How can the committee distinguish between prisoners booked for special Acts and others. It is like distinguishing between the rich and the poor prisoners. If this is how it is, the Supreme Court has done nothing to fight the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-panel-decides-to-release-50-of-prisoners-on-temporary-bail-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19/story-U2yob9EHSa5TJXai12tHEI.html

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) tweeted that the address will take place at 8 pm. Shri @narendramodi will be addressing the nation at 8 PM this evening.This will be PM Modi’s third address to the nation on the Covid-19 lockdown. He had first announced the lockdown in his televised address to the nation on March 24, then announced its extension on April 14.

The Prime Minister said in the meeting that states will have greater say in determining the extent of restrictions and relaxations after May 17, within a broad national framework while underlining that India faced two challenges - reducing the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and resuming public activity gradually.He also emphasised that social distancing remains the “biggest weapon” against the virus till a vaccine is found, and suggested that the lockdown may not be lifted entirely.PM Modi also said that India now had a good sense of the spread of the disease, and urged states to carefully examine specific geographical areas to come up with a road map for the next phase of lockdown.“I am of the firm view that the measures needed in the first phase of lockdown were not needed during the second phase and similarly the measures needed in the third phase are not needed in the fourth,” PM Modi said at the meeting, according to news agency ANI.The country is in the third phase of lockdown which will end on May 17.At the meeting with chief ministers, PM Modi highlighted the importance of green zones in restarting economic activity, underlined that the full resumption of rail travel would not be possible, pointed out that India will have to use technology in imparting education and, more broadly, spoke about how the pandemic will change the world, just as the world wars did.

12-05-2020||India||Pressure mounts on MP govt, restrictions on Maha border lifted for UP and Bihar labourers||Rising temperature and death of at least 8 migrant workers in the past 20 days have driven Madhya Pradesh government to lift restrictions on the MP-Maharashtra border for labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, officials said.The influx of migrant labourers, about 25,000 per day on an average, has caused worries to the administration. These labourers are covering hundreds of kilometres travelling or walking through the state up to the UP border. Screening such a large number of workers, including the elderly, women and children, is practically not possible, officials said. Hence, this is an immediate casualty but the administration can’t stop them as they become aggressive leading to law and order problems, the officials added.Also read: Migrant worker walking back to Bihar run over by SUV on Ambala highway, killedBijasan and Khetia on MP-Maharashtra border are two entry points for people coming from the Maharashtra side. However, more than 90% of labourers enter the state via Bijasan to get to the Agra-Mumbai highway. Bijasan saw stone-pelting by agitated labourers when they were stopped by the local police on May 3. Many got injured, including at least three police personnel including a sub-inspector. Later, the police lodged an FIR against unidentified 400 migrant labourers for indulging in violence. There have been confrontations between the two sides several times in the past two weeks or so.Bijasan temple trust and the district administration have arranged food and water for the labourers at the temple premises. The village panchayats, which are situated on either side of Agra-Mumbai highway, have been instructed to set up a tent and also arrange food and water for people travelling or trekking through their areas, the officials said.An administrative official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “The restrictions were lifted as pressure was mounting with streams of labourers coming from Maharashtra side including labourers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana too. Whenever we try to stop them they become aggressive and there is a law and order problem. It’s unmanageable when thousands of workers in trucks, mini trucks, loading auto, auto-rickshaws, bicycles and even on foot converge at the border.”The officer said, “Another problem is when we try to stop the labourers they take different routes through the hilly areas and this result in dehydration and deaths in certain cases. Two labourers died on Saturday. In this scenario, proper screening of labourers for coronavirus is almost impossible. In the beginning, when we quarantined people they became aggressive and caused a lot of problems.” Sub-divisional magistrate at Sendhwa Ghanshyam Dhangar said, “The major problem that we are facing is the health of labourers affected by dehydration. Eight people died during the past 20 days. Sendhwa has hilly areas. There is a large number of labourers who trek or pedal bicycles for hundreds of kilometres braving about 40 degree Celsius temperature in Maharashtra itself. By the time they reach the border here they get dehydrated. It’s Ramzan time. There have been at least three deaths when labourers didn’t have water the whole day and continued to walk or pedal bicycles. This led to dehydration and they died.”The SDM said, “So far, we have arranged for labourers, who are walking, to be accommodated in trucks, buses and other vehicles carrying other labourers to Uttar Pradesh. But now we have decided to send such other states’ labourers in our buses to Dewas from where they would be taken to Guna and from there they would be taken to the UP border.”Superintendent of Police, Barwani district DR Teniwar said, “For four to five days we have allowed entry of people given their huge number. About 25,000 people are coming every day.”On Sunday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan issued instructions to district collectors to extend all possible facilities to the labourers like food, water and stay, among others.Chouhan instructed officials, “While trying to understand with full sensitivity the problem of a large number of people travelling on foot, they should be welcomed as guests in the districts and necessary facilities should be provided to them. These kinds of opportunities of service come occasionally in the history of human civilisation. These helpless labourers of other states should be welcomed with an open heart in the heartland of the country.”However, unlike the MP-Maharashtra border, the MP-Gujarat border in Jhabua has not been witnessing an influx of people from Gujarat after more than 25,000 workers on Dahod side, who wanted the border to be opened, were forced by the Gujarat administration to get back to their places on the assurance that they would be sent back to their destinations in trains.Collector, Jhabua district Prabal Sepaha said, “None are coming from the Gujarat side now. As far as people of Madhya Pradesh are concerned, about 1.5 lakh labourers hailing from different parts of Madhya Pradesh have come so far.”However, an administrative official who didn’t want to be named said, “Still there are labourers, though not in a large number, who enter the district through agriculture fields to find their way to Uttar Pradesh via Shivpuri or Datia.”Collector, Shivpuri district Anugraha P said, “About 5,000 people pass through the district on the highway to UP daily. The UP government opens its border at intervals to allow the labourers to enter the state.”Those who are coming from Maharashtra take different routes to UP. While a section of them head to UP via Shivpuri and Datia close to Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. There are groups of workers who prefer entering Uttar Pradesh via Sagar, Chhatarpur and Tikamgarh districts in Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh.Superintendent of Police, Chhatarpur district Kumar Saurabh said, “We have made all the arrangements for labourers like food and water. We send those labourers who are walking in buses up to the UP border.”(With input from Anupam Pateriya in Sagar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pressure-mounts-on-madhya-pradesh-govt-restrictions-on-maha-border-lifted-for-up-and-bihar-labourers/story-R4ZI2Eoq8O7WMhY8nlS7GO.html

12-05-2020||India||Chinese choppers spotted near Ladakh LAC prompt alert, IAF fighters rushed in: Report||After the scuffle between the Chinese People’s Liberation Army troops and Indian troops along the LAC in North Sikkim which led to injuries on both sides, China appears to be continuing on the path of belligerence towards India, this time along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.In what appears to be a multi-front deliberate ploy by China to keep India on its toes, the Indian Air Force was forced to rush its fighter jet patrols in Ladakh after Chinese military choppers were found to be flying close to the Line of Actual Control. This incident happened last week, around the same time the PLA troops and Indian army forces came to blows in the upper reaches of North Sikkim.“The Chinese military helicopters were flying very close to the Line of Actual Control. After their movement was picked up, the Indian Air Force fighter jets flew patrols in the area,” government sources told ANI here.Government sources who requested anonymity due to knowledge of frontline operations, informed that the Chinese choppers did not cross the LAC into Indian territory in that particular area, they said.Also Read: India, China face-off along Sikkim border, several soldiers injuredThe Indian Air Force frequently flies its Sukhoi 30MKI fighter aircraft fleet from Leh air base in Ladakh along with other planes.This latest development comes soon after the Indian security establishment noticed that Pakistani Air Force increased its patrols of F-16S and JF-17s along its Eastern Border with India, especially night sorties, after the Handwara terror attack that led to the death of 5 Indian security personnel. A fear of retaliation by Indian forces was cited as the reason by Indian security establishment sources for this ramping up of PAF air patrols.The Indian Air Force has two main bases in the Ladakh union territory including the Leh and the Thoise airbase where fighter jets are not deployed permanently but detachments from combat aircraft squadrons are operational throughout the year.There have been several occasions in the past when Chinese military helicopters have entered Indian airspace in the Ladakh sector and deliberately left behind tell-tale signs to stake claim on areas which are part of India. The LAC in this location, like in other parts of the India-China border in the country, is poorly demarcated, hence incursions sometimes are inadvertent as well.However, the scuffle with Indian troops in North Sikkim was a new front opened up by China which was a cause for concern. Ever since the outbreak of Covid-19, Chinese President Xi Jinping is under immense pressure to increase transparency in his country and reveal the real origin of the virus, which some have speculated emanated from a lab in China’s Wuhan. Trade wars with countries like USA and Australia have intensified and most multi-national companies have actively begun looking for manufacturing alternative,India being one such preferred destination.Security sources speculated that this could be the reason behind China’s new aggression. Similar muscle flexing was also seen recently when PLA Navy boats entered into disputed waters in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-choppers-spotted-near-ladakh-lac-prompt-alert-iaf-fighters-rushed-in-report/story-25Jr9bsUEPQYPieX39mSKJ.html

This surveillance will be in addition to the routine testing as per current testing guidelines,” the document titled ‘District level facility based surveillance for Covid-19’ said.The ministry did not specify when the protocol will be put into place.More than four million people have contracted the coronavirus disease and 286,330 people have died across the world, according to the Covid-19 tracker of Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-covid-19-tally-breaches-70-000-mark-3-604-cases-in-last-24-hours/story-yyNOxjnAfDP5b6yN58y78L.html

12-05-2020||India||I still feel I’m in the truck, says driver who spent 47 days in his vehicle due to lockdown||A truck driver from Uttarakhand spent more than 40 days in his vehicle due to the nationwide lockdown before reaching his home district Champawat.He reached Champawat after 47 days on Saturday where the administration put him under home quarantine for 14 days.Sunil Kumar is a resident of Munch area and has been working for a transport company based in Delhi for the last six years.According to Sunil, he was stuck in the lockdown and spent 40 days and nights in his truck near the Rajasthan border.“I left for Hyderabad from Delhi on March 22. When I reached Shahpura area near Delhi-Rajasthan border on March 23, I was stranded there due to imposition of lockdown,” said Kumar.“Rajasthan Police didn’t allow me to proceed and Delhi Police didn’t allow me to go back. So I had nowhere to go. So I decided to wait in the truck itself. We keep a stove and ration for a few days in our truck. I cooked food in the truck and later bought food items from a grocery shop nearby,” he said.Kumar said waiting for such a long time was very difficult. “The difference of day and night didn’t seem to matter anymore. Sometimes I would spend my nights by counting stars. I was hoping that lockdown would end on April 24 and then I will be able to go home or Hyderabad. But it was extended further and so did my difficulties,” said Sunil.Kumar said he faced many problems while being stuck in the truck. He said he could not charge his mobile phone after some time and so couldn’t talk to his family members.“Somehow I managed to spend 40 days and 40 nights in my truck. It was a very difficult time. Weird thoughts would cross my mind. I missed my family, especially my pregnant wife. There were times when I thought if I would someday reach my home or not,” he said.Kumar said that finally when the lockdown was relaxed and commercial vehicles like trucks were allowed to ply on May 3, he left for Delhi and reached there on May 5.“In Delhi, I left my truck in my transport office. I registered for return on the website of my state government. My health screening was conducted and I boarded a bus for Uttarakhand. With the help of the authorities from my state, I finally reached Champawat, my home district on the morning of May 9,” he said.“Here, the local authorities quarantined me in a shelter house and took my sample for the coronavirus test. When my report came negative on Sunday, they sent me for home quarantine for 14 days,” he said.“I am feeling very happy that I am finally home. Now I will go to Delhi only after my wife delivers the baby. Sometimes in the sleep, I still feel I am in the truck,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-still-feel-i-m-in-the-truck-says-driver-who-spent-47-days-in-his-vehicle-due-to-lockdown/story-6dKrR7aOeStB3FZoYimqNM.html

12-05-2020||India||With Mamata hitting out at Centre during meeting with Modi, TMC-BJP verbal duel intensifies||The war of words between Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) intensified on Monday after the West Bengal chief minister’s outburst against the Centre during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with chief ministers.Both parties sharpened attacks on each other, with the TMC targeting PM Modi for an ill-planned lockdown and late response to the Covid-19 situation and the BJP hitting out at the state government for not doing enough during the coronavirus pandemic and “a collapse of the administration.”“The PM held no meeting with the chief ministers before announcing the lockdown. The centre thought they could handle the situation in 15 days and would then alone take the credit of it all,” Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief, was heard saying in a video clip released by the party. “Meetings with chief ministers are being held before announcing the second and third phase lockdown because the situation is not in control. Why didn’t they think of and plan for the migrant workers before announcing the lockdown?” Abhishek Banerjee asked.“There are apprehensions about the fallout of letting long-distance trains run. They Centre should provide all with more clarity,” TMC secretary-general and state education minister Partha Chatterjee said.He, too, alleged that BJP was busy playing politics when the focus should have been on putting up a unit fight against Covid-19.Mamata Banerjee had hit out at Centre in the afternoon during the video-conference with Modi, alleging it was trying to gain political mileage at the expense of the state government.“We as a state doing our best to combat the virus. The Centre should not play politics in this crucial time. We are surrounded by international borders and other bigger states and have challenges to deal with… All the states should be given equal importance and we should work together as Team India,” she said adding that the federal structure should be respected.In the evening, BJP leaders targeted the state government of minority appeasement, mismanagement over bringing migrant workers back, implementing a lax lockdown and failure in managing the public distribution system.“The Centre is not playing politics. The Centre had to intervene because the state was failing its people. The state played hide and seek with data and the real Covid-19 scenario, let the lockdown be easily violated, corrupted the public distribution system and also wanted to leave the migrant workers at lurch,” BJP’s state unit president Dilip Ghosh said.“In every case, the state acted after the Centre intervened. The government has failed in most critical aspects – health and home affairs – and both portfolios are held by the chief minister,” Ghosh added.“It’s not a time for politics. It’s a national crisis and the time is for uniting under the leadership of the prime minister and fight Covid-19,” BJP national executive member Mukul Roy said.All senior leaders of the West Bengal unit of the BJP, including central observers Kailash Vijayvargiya, Shiv Prakash and Arvind Menon, Union ministers Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri and members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, also took digs at the Mamata Banerjee government for utmost failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-mamata-hitting-out-at-centre-during-meeting-with-modi-tmc-bjp-verbal-duel-intensifies/story-gD6MgxhU5gOVLUPasHidiO.html

The internet speed shall, however, remain restricted to 2G only across the Union Territory. It shall be effective from May 12,” the J-K administration said in an order.The services were snapped after top Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo and another terrorist was killed by security forces.Internet services were suspended in J-K in August last year after the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir. While the 2G services on postpaid mobile phones and broadband have been restored, 4G services still remain suspended.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court had on Monday directed immediate setting up of a high powered committee, to be headed by the MHA Secretary, to look into the contentions raised by various petitioners for the restoration of 4G internet in Jammu and Kashmir.The apex court ordered to constitute a committee of secretaries from the Centre and the Union Territory, headed by the MHA Secretary and also comprising the Secretary of Ministry of Communication and Chief Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir to look into the matterThe court was hearing various pleas for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir claiming that the 2G internet services are not sufficient enough to conduct education and other services amid the coronavirus-induced lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2g-internet-to-be-restored-in-kashmir-except-in-pulwama-shopian-districts-today/story-Gvi0L4LZOr5XMJRGI9N1zJ.html
12-05-2020||India||Is Etalin hydropower project financially viable? FAC asks power ministry||The environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) has deferred its decision on two contentious projects --- Etalin Hydropower Project of 3,097 MW in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, and the exploration of uranium in Telangana’s Amrabad Tiger Reserve.As per minutes of FAC’s meeting on April 23 uploaded on the Parivesh website late on Monday, FAC has sought comments from the power ministry on the Etalin Hydropower Project in view of the following:a) The project is delayed by six years and the country’s energy plan may have changedb) A large number of hydro-electric projects are pending due to environmental and forest clearance concernsc) Tariff structure of the project was already high when proposed in 2014.FAC has asked the power ministry to comment whether the project in its current form is viable. It has also directed Arunachal Pradesh to submit a cost-benefit analysis of the project.Earlier this month, several scientists and wildlife biologists wrote to FAC, warning about the massive loss of biodiversity if Etalin Hydropower Project was allowed to come up. Twenty-six scientists from 16 scientific institutions also flagged that a Wildlife Institute of India report on the biodiversity of Dibang Valley (based on which the Etalin Hydropower Project would be assessed) has several “scientific biases” and doesn’t reflect a true picture of the biodiversity of Dibang Valley, where the Etalin Hydropower Project of 3097 MW is planned.But FAC said the representations it got are all similar in content and add no new value or findings.The Etalin Hydropower Project will involve clearing of at least 270,000 trees in sub-tropical evergreen and rain forests and in a vital tiger area.The project is proposed to be developed by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited (JPL). The total cost of the project is about Rs 25,296.95 crore, according to FAC factsheet. When HT contacted JPL on May 5 about the biodiversity footprint of the project, a JPL senior executive said the company didn’t want to comment. On the uranium exploration in Amrabad Tiger Reserve, FAC said it wants a clear view from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-etalin-hydropower-project-financially-viable-fac-asks-power-ministry/story-U3Rj1nO8Kc94mymHAqAS4L.html
12-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India will restart train services from New Delhi to 15 other cities, and back, starting Tuesday. Of these, 16 trains will run every day, four only once a week, two thrice a week, and the rest twice a week. All the trains will stop at other stations (see pages 1 and 4).Since this is coming at a time when the number of daily cases of Covid-19 are continuing to rise (which means the curve hasn’t been flattened), it can mean one of two things: One, the government believes that it is no longer economically, politically, and socially viable to continue with a lockdown and restrictions on interstate travel; or two, the government is confident that India’s health care system is now better placed to deal with a spike in cases (than it was on March 24, when the first lockdown was announced).There are indications that rail services will be expanded over the next few weeks, and that the government could adopt a similar model for the resumption of air services, perhaps as early as next week.There’s no doubt that the resumption of rail and air services will see a further increase in the number of infections; already, some states are seeing the impact of the return of Indians stranded overseas (Kerala has registered some cases) by air, and that of migrant workers by rail (Bihar has seen a surge in daily cases largely on this score). Some cases will be asymptomatic; many will be mild; but there will be some severe ones that require hospitalisation, maybe even treatment in the critical care unit. Again, the fact that India is going ahead with its plan on the resumption of rail services despite knowing this seems to suggest that it is confident the health care system can deal with the critical cases. An advisory has already recommended that mild cases do not need any hospitalisation, merely isolation at home.India’s trajectory of cases and deaths has been unique for reasons that are still not clear. The increase in the number of cases has been slower than it has been in other countries. And the death rate is still around 3.2%, much lower than the average global death rate of 6.8% (number of deaths as a proportion of those infected). If India can maintain this trajectory in the weeks ahead, it should be alright. If it can’t, and the number of daily deaths sees a sharp rise, then it is time to revisit the strategy. I’ve said it before, but the key number to track is the number of daily deaths, not the number of cases. India is now at 13th place in terms of the number of cases, and it is only a matter of time before it breaks into the top 10. It will also overtake China in the next week. But none of this should matter as long as it can keep the number of fatalities low.As India opens up, it is also clear that it will have to significantly push the adoption of its contact tracing app, Aarogya Setu. It is increasingly becoming clear that many countries will have their own contact tracing apps, and insist, perhaps even mandate, that these be used by everyone. Concerns have been raised about the privacy and security aspects of the app, and the government on Monday released data sharing and access protocols to assuage these (see page 5).To be sure, the utility of the app is likely to be restricted in India, where just around 40% of the population is estimated to have smart phones (and since this estimate is based on the number of phones and not people, the actual proportion may be even lower because some people have more than one phone).It is equally clear that it will have to scale up testing. On Monday, the health ministry issued guidelines for district-level testing for Covid-19 – weekly pooled RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain) tests as well as blood tests of both high-risk and low-risk groups in every district in the country. If this is implemented, it will provide public health policy makers critical data on the actual prevalence and the spread of Covid-19 across the country (see page 5).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-2DybqItVuwo2J0g6oyPmaN.html
12-05-2020||India||‘Don’t bulldoze federal structure,’ Mamata Banerjee tells PM Modi||At Monday’s video conference of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee complained that “some union ministers were playing politics”, alleged “discrimination against people of Bengal” and that the state was being targeted by the Centre. She also asked the Centre not to charge migrants train fare to return home, sought 6% of national GDP for health and an immediate moratorium on repayment of loans and interest by the state and demanded that the states be allowed to borrow from the Reserve Bank at the repo rate. However, the focus of her speech, as revealed to journalists by her party Trinamool Congress (TMC), was politics in times of a pandemic. She said that the Centre was always welcome to send letters but objected to the way the communications had been leaked to the media.“I respect Mr. Amit Shah. Last time also he spoke about West Bengal and I could not counter him because I was not given a chance. But, why did Mr. Amit Shah need to write a letter and send that to the press? After it was out in the news, people were asking me. What am I supposed to do? Why don’t you speak to us directly? I request this must not happen to other states,” Banerjee said.“I don’t feel good saying this but why this discrimination against people of Bengal? Why letters are being sent to the media with rampant accusations?” she asked.“When something happens in Gujarat or an ordinance is declared to snatch away the rights of the labourers in Uttar Pradesh, why don’t you question them? Why are you targeting Bengal and its people by sending notices?” she added.Her outburst came following a string of criticism by the Centre on a wide range of issues about the handling of Covid-19 situation in Bengal. Over the past few weeks, the state faced criticism from the ministry of health, the union home ministry, the ministry of railways and the inter-ministerial central teams that visited the state. “I appeal to you to trust the state. This is not the time for ideological battle,” Banerjee told PM Modi during the videoconferencing. “My only humble request is don’t bulldoze the federal structure.”She also alleged that the Centre had “no fixed planning about the post-lockdown phase” and that meetings were being held after the Centre had already taken decisions.“We are together in this crisis; there should be no finger-pointing at states who are reporting higher numbers because it’s neither their fault nor their people’s fault.”Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued to attack Banerjee’s government. On Monday, all senior leaders of Bengal BJP, including Kailash Vijayvargiya, union ministers Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri, used social media to attack the Bengal government for alleged minority appeasement even in times of a pandemic, mismanagement over brining migrant workers back, implementing a lax lockdown and failure in managing the public distribution system.“Centre is not playing politics. Centre had to intervene because the state was failing its people. The state played hide and seek with data and the real Covid-19 scenario, let the lockdown be easily violated, corrupted the public distribution system and also wanted to leave the migrant workers at lurch. In every case, the state acted after the Centre intervened. The home and health departments proved to be utmost failure and both portfolios are held by the chief minister,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-bulldoze-federal-structure-mamata-banerjee-tells-pm-modi/story-V2h9ovxgmOUOyogCQpbDdP.html
12-05-2020||India||Sambit Patra booked for tweets against Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi||Chhattisgarh police on Monday registered a case against BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra in Raipur for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups and hurting religious feelings by his tweets against former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi.According to the FIR, the case has been registered with Civil Lines police station of Raipur on the complaint of state Youth Congress president Poornachand Padhi.“We have registered a case against Patra under various sections of IPC on the complaint of Padhi and investigation in the case is going on,” said Arif Sheikh, Raipur’s superintendent of police.The case has been registered under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc), 505(2) (statements conducing to public mischief) and 298 (uttering, words of Indian Penal Code ( IPC).Padhi claimed that Patra in his tweets had levelled false allegations against Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi in connection with the Kashmir issue, 1984 anti-Sikh riots and Bofors scam.Padhi in his complaint said that the two former PMs were never convicted in any case of corruption or riots.“Moreover when the country is going through the biggest challenges, the act of tweeting such content on social platforms is not only prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious groups, communities but is likely to disturb the public tranquillity,” Padhi said in the complaint.Padhi claimed the tweets were made with an intention to hurt religious sentiments.“There is also likelihood that the tweet may cause fear in the Sikh community and induce any person of the community to commit an offence against the state or against the public tranquility,” the FIR alleged.Padhi in his FIR further alleged Patra of using derogatory language against the former PMs that could incite any class or community of person to commit any offence against any other class or community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sambit-patra-booked-for-tweets-against-jawaharlal-nehru-and-rajiv-gandhi/story-HvDeaM8kSAaVxSYIdJFy7H.html
12-05-2020||India||Kerala to tighten norms as returning immigrants threaten to foil state’s Covid-19 track record||Kerala which is maintaining a successful disease-management protocol has decided to strengthen its tracing and quarantine norms as immigrants from the Middle-East and people stranded in other parts of the country started flocking to the state in large numbers.Among the Gulf returnees, seven people had tested positive so far and more flights are expected in the coming days. On Monday, the state reported seven new Covid-19 cases, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office said. Out of 7, four are people who returned from Mumbai, one from Chennai and another returned from Kuwait (earlier six others who returned from the middle-eastern countries had tested positive). Out of 519 Covid-19 positive cases, 489 have recovered and 27 active cases are there, his office said.With train services expected to resume in a couple of days the state is expecting more cases. It has tweaked its policies and has given strict instructions to district administrations to enforce track, trace and treat protocol ruthlessly. People with minor symptoms or those who come from red zones will have to undergo strict protocols to contain a possible third bout of infection, said health officials.Kerala is the first state to have reported a coronavirus case in the country in January, when a Wuhan-returned medical student had tested positive.The second stage of infection occurred in the first week of March when some super spreaders returned from foreign countries and transmitted the disease to many others.The state pressed the emergency button as the exodus of expatriates from middle-eastern countries and people from other states began. People coming from red zones will have to undergo mandatory 14-day home quarantine and if they show slight symptoms they will be moved to hospitals and PCR tests will have to be done, said health ministry officials. In each area a nodal officer will be appointed for a section of people under quarantine and it is his/her duty to monitor them with the help of other health officials regularly. Local police officers will have to help him.Though the state was vociferous on stranded immigrants there is a complaint that it did not do much to students and others stranded in other parts of the country-- after it became a big issue it was forced to write to the Railways and north Indian states to help run special trains for them. The opposition and rights activists alleged that it was a “deliberate ploy to keep the state records intact”.“Around 350 special trains were run in the country and not a single one came to the state. Sad that in building up a public relations exercise the CM conveniently has forgotten his own people stranded in many parts of the country,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. He said hundreds of people were stranded along state borders after the government insisted on passes from the originating destination. But the ruling CPI(M) said the opposition was playing “cheap politics” during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-tighten-norms-as-returning-immigrants-threaten-to-foil-state-s-covid-19-track-record/story-01esW0yG4IxYQYvFZRmsEL.html
12-05-2020||India||States cannot exploit labourers: Rahul Gandhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday opposed amendments to labour laws put in place by some state governments, including in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)- ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, saying the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cannot be made an excuse to exploit workers and suppress their voices.“Many states are amending labour laws. We are together fighting against corona, but this cannot be an excuse to crush human rights, allow unsafe workplaces, exploit workers and suppress their voice. There cannot be any compromise on these basic principles,” Gandhi wrote in a Twitter post.Eight political parties had earlier written to President Ram Nath Kovind protesting against the changes to labour laws, including extending the daily working hours from eight to 12 in six states. After the face-off between the government and the opposition over the return of migrant workers to their homes, the new labour laws have emerged as another contentious issue.BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, two states with substantial workforces, have frozen major labour laws, except basic ones, in the hope that businesses will recoup from the blow of the Covid-19 pandemic and create more jobs on a net basis.The changes give industries more flexibility in hiring and firing employees, determining their wages, and reducing their liabilities in terms of providing employee benefits. Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said it was a shame that BJP-ruled states were amending labour laws under the cover of a pandemic to lure foreign investors. He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deny permission to states amending labour laws in an attempt to “strip workers of their basic rights”.“This is yet another shocking but unsurprising blow to workers and labourers by BJP governments. If the Prime Minister has a little concern for workers and labourers, then he should himself tell these states to not go ahead with amending labour laws and not allow them in doing so. We would expect the prime minister to intervene today itself,” Gohil told reporters through video conferencing.He said it was “shocking and heart-breaking” that when the entire nation is dealing with an unprecedented pandemic, which has disproportionately ravaged the lives of the poor, the BJP governments had used the outbreak as opportunity to deprive them of their rights.“This is shameful and once again highlights the true nature and priorities of this ‘Suit-Boot ki Sarkar’,” the Congress leader said.Gohil said as the labour laws were in the Concurrent List so they cannot be suspended without the explicit approval of the central government.“We, therefore, ask the Prime Minister to deny any permission that strip workers of their basic rights and have the potential of diminishing their livelihood. We also ask that trade unions be consulted before such an adverse step is taken,” he said.Gohil alleged that labourers and migrants were already getting inhuman treatment in the wake of the post-Covid lockdown.“We have all seen the visuals of lakhs of our brothers and sisters attempting to make the arduous journey home without any state support, any food or medicines, left to fend for themselves by an uncaring and apathetic government,” he said.To be sure, 90% of India’s workforce, which is employed in the informal sector, won’t be affected by these changes, which apply to those who are in the organised workforce and registered companies.Former union minister Jairam Ramesh also said it would be dangerous and disastrous to loosen labour, land and environment laws in the name of economic revival and stimulus.“In the name of economic revival and stimulus, it will be dangerous and disastrous to loosen labour, land and environmental laws and regulations as the Modi govt is planning. The first steps have already been taken. This is a quack remedy like demonetisation,” he tweeted.BJP spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said labour law reforms is a long standing demand of unions and industries both. “As it is in concurrent list, Centre had earlier consolidated 40 existing laws into 4 codes to streamline compliance and help formalisation of labour force. Now some state governments are working for further streamlining the functioning of the industry and help restart the economic cycle. These amendments are for the benefit of the economy as a whole including workers,” he said.Agarwal said, “The focus of the governments has shifted towards economic revival and they are doing what is needed. Putting a spanner in the effort is completely uncalled for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-cannot-exploit-labourers-rahul/story-QOvUHmMMXQou0561ZERU9N.html
12-05-2020||India||Rush for tickets, guidelines issued for passenger trains||Passengers boarding special trains will have to arrive at stations at least 90 minutes before their journeys begin and are advised to carry their own food, the government said in fresh guidelines on Monday, a day before the gradual resumption of the services connecting New Delhi and 15 other cities after a gap of nearly two months.Indian Railways also released a timetable for these trains, which will run only with air-conditioned (AC) coaches and have full seating capacity, and specified the stoppages they will make.Bookings began at 6pm after a two-hour delay due to technical issues. The railway ministry regretted the “inconvenience”, and said data on the special trains was “being fed” into the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website.By 9.15pm, about 30,000 PNRs (passenger name records) were generated and reservations were issued to over 54,000 passengers, a railway ministry official said. It was not immediately clear how many tickets were on offer.In the fresh guidelines, the railways encouraged passengers to download the Aarogya Setu app for effective contact tracing and follow social distancing both at stations and in trains.“The passengers shall reach the station at least 90 minutes in advance to facilitate thermal screening at the station. Only passengers who are found asymptomatic (not showing symptoms of Covid-19) will be permitted to travel,” the guidelines said.Despite lockdown curbs, passengers with valid tickets will not need any additional pass to travel to railway stations. “For movement of passenger(s) as well as the driver of the vehicle transporting the passenger(s) to and fro the Railway Station shall be allowed on the basis of the confirmed e-ticket,” the guidelines said.No stalls or booths on platforms will open. Vending activity will not be permitted even as the guidelines advised passengers to “travel light”.Other major guidelines pertained to ticket bookings and cancellations.Passengers will have to book general category tickets online — on the IRCTC website and on its app. A few reservation counters will be opened for HOR (high official requisition) holders, freedom fighters, and sitting and former lawmakers, among others.The fare structure will be similar to that in the premium Rajdhani trains, and the special trains will have first, second and third AC classes. Tickets can be booked a maximum of seven days in advance, and only confirmed tickets can be bought online. RAC (Reservation against cancellation), waiting list tickets and tickets issued on board will not be allowed.Online cancellation will be permitted up to 24 hours before scheduled departure, and the cancellation charge shall be 50% of the fare. The guidelines also said the “provision for prepaid meal booking, e-catering shall be disabled”, but dry, ready-to-eat food and bottled water will be available on board at a price.“Information to this effect shall be made available to passengers during time of booking ticket. Passengers are encouraged to carry their own food and drinking water,” the guidelines said. Passengers will be given hand sanitizer at stations but will not receive blankets and linen provided by the railways on board. The government has decided to resume passenger train services, prohibited since March 22, connecting New Delhi with Dibrugarh (Assam), Agartala (Tripura), Howrah (West Bengal), Patna (Bihar), Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Secunderabad (Telangana), Bengaluru (Karnataka), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala), Madgaon (Goa), Mumbai Central (Maharashtra), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Jammu Tawi (Jammu and Kashmir).While trains travelling from New Delhi to Secunderabad and back will have the least number of stoppages (three), those going to Dibrugarh and coming back will have the most (12). Trains to Mumbai Central and back will stop at four places on their way; those going to Chennai Central will have six stoppages.The rail network of India would run nearly 14,000 passenger trains and ferry 23 million passengers a day — before the lockdown was imposed on March 25 to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The first train to run after the gap of 51 days — the first such break in the 167-year history of the railways — will begin its journey from New Delhi for Bilaspur at 4pm on Tuesday.On arrival, passengers will have to follow the health protocols put in place by the destination state/Union Territory.The guidelines said zonal railways have been instructed to ensure that there are separate entry and exit gates at stations to the extent possible so as to avoid face-to-face movement of passengers.“Zonal railways will be guided by standard social distancing guidelines on stations and trains and observe the safety, security and hygiene protocols. Passengers are advised to carry their own linen for the travel. The temperature inside AC coaches shall be suitably regulated for this purpose,” the guidelines said. The Thiruvananthapuram division of the Southern Railways said it is ready to resume passenger services. “We are all set for it...Our first priority is to check a possible spread (of the coronavirus) and we will do everything possible for this. After every trip, we will disinfect the entire train before the next run,” said VC Sudeesh, senior divisional commercial manager.Others said they are making all possible steps to ensure smooth travel for passengers. “We are making adequate arrangements so that both outgoing and inbound passengers do not face any difficulties, and the entire process is hassle-free. Adequate security personnel and railway staff will be deployed at the platforms to help the passengers,” said I Khan, the divisional railway manager of Howrah.(with inputs from HTC in Kerala and Kolkata)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rush-for-tickets-guidelines-issued-for-passenger-trains/story-g86A9r9I7xROtKyJzoOYaM.html
12-05-2020||India||347 new cases take Gujarat tally to 8,542||On Monday, Gujarat reported 347 positive cases of Covid-19, taking the toll of affected people to 8542.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), said that these cases were reported from Ahmedabad (268), Vadodra (29), Surat (19 )and the rest from other districts.“Twenty deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. A total of 2780 have been discharged. Conditions of 5218 people are stable and 31 are on ventilator. The graph of discharged people is improving and deaths are also reducing day by day. 1616471 tests have been done so far,” Ravi said.The Gujarat government on Monday also launched India’s first hot air seam sealing machine, which makes the personal protective equipment (PPE ) kit used for the protection of such doctors-paramedical staff completely secure with specialised tape.Chief minister Vijay Rupani lauded a Rajkot based company for preparing this machine. “The initiative of protecting the PPE kits with hot air seam sealing tape, which provides 100% protection against the transmission of the virus to the doctors and health workers, who are currently engaged in the treatment of Covid-19, is really appreciable,” the CM said in an official statement issued by the state government.He added that the PPE kit is prepared by a sewing needle which is about 2mm thick and thread that is 0.5mm thick. As a result, if the infected patient’s blood or fluid enters the kit through tiny apertures left on the kit, the doctor-paramedical staff treating the infected patients may also be infected. By using this machine, the holes left in the sewing process in the PPE kit are sealed using specialised tape to make the PPE kit water and air proof to resist the virus.“There is not enough availability of such hot air seam sealing machine in the country so it has to be imported from abroad. The cost of such a machine imported from China or Korea is Rs 7 to Rs 8 lakh and delivery time is 12-13 weeks. In just a short span of 20 days, a team of 100 workers have given Rajkot the pride of manufacturing the first hot air seam sealing machine in India with 80% in-house parts,” Rupani said.Dr Parthiv Mehta, pulmonologist-intensivist said that this machine would be very useful for the corona warriors. “Through this machines kits are sealed using specialised tape making it air proof and reducing chances of leakage,” he said.The Gujarat government also launched the third phase of Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyan (SSJA) in order to provide employment opportunities to the workers and labourers amid the national lockdown.Providing details of the work under SSJA, Ashwani Kumar, secretary to the chief minister, said that 3463 gram panchayats have started 18,824 works  under MNREGA, thereby providing employment to 3, 04,756 labourers and workers. “This includes 37, 519 workers from Bhavnagar, 33,800 from Narmada, 20,821 from Chhota Udepur, 20,168 from Dahod, 20,041 from Panchmahal in addition to workers from the 3463 gram panchayats. The administration is ensuring welfare of the workers in addition to following safety protocols,” he said.Kumar said the Gujarat Government has successfully sent more than 5.5 lakh migrant labourers to their respective states through 209 labour trains. The district administration of Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara all contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/347-new-cases-take-guj-tally-to-8-542/story-M2SDxbPzIfzbka4A9ZzXhI.html
12-05-2020||India||Govt defends changes in discharge policy||The Union health ministry defended on Monday its decision to drastically change the discharge policy for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) last week by saying that unless patients had a severe disease or were vulnerable, they do not need to obtain a negative test before they can be freed.“The discharge policy has been changed based on the current evidence-based trend world over. In many countries the discharge approach has changed from test-based strategy to symptom or time based strategy,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry at the daily government briefing on the crisis.“In ICMR’s lab surveillance data also that was recently reviewed it was found that RT-PCR positive patients turn negative usually after 10 days. There are other recent studies that say viral load also peaks in the pre-symptomatic period, which is two days before onset of symptoms and in next seven days starts going down. The new discharge policy was drafted keeping these trends in mind. It is meant only for patients who tested positive through RT-PCR test,” he added.The earlier criteria for discharging RT-PCR positive were that chest radiograph (image) was clear, and two consecutive negative test results on RT-PCR.At the briefing, the information and technology ministry said the government is using mobile phone tower data of migrants to trace their movement.Tower data before and during the lockdown has been analysed to trace movement of migrants, and Bihar has successfully used the mechanism to trace people from various metros to their homes in Bihar. The government said similar requests have come in from Odisha, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-defends-changes-in-discharge-policy/story-Z6k4RTgCghYdxWYTsyaUML.html
12-05-2020||India||States relax some curbs as lockdown nears deadline||Rajasthan became the first state to allow free movement of people within the state between 7 am and 7 pm, except in containment zones, as states began relaxing norms a week before the third phase of the federal lockdown draws towards its scheduled end on May 17. “No pass will be required for interdistrict and within district movement of people between 7 am and 7 pm except in areas under curfew,” announced chief minister Ashok Gehlot after a meeting with legislators and members of Parliament.Gehlot authorised the district and subordinate officers to issue passes to people to travel by bus or train to other states and containment zones. Earlier, the state home department had this power. The new travel guideline also made a 14 day quarantine mandatory for any person entering the state. The guidelines also allowed district officers to give permission to run industries.While the Telangana government has extended the lockdown till May 29, it has given additional relaxations for private companies and industries located in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area, a red zone. They resumed operations on Monday.Cyberabad Commissioner of Police, VC Sajjannar, told industry owners have been allowed to use 33% of the manpower in a phased manner. “And this 33% of strength is across all shifts, including critical operations, during night hours, contract staff etc,” he said.In Gujarat, the government decided to make the delivery of essential goods to home cashless from May 15, the first state to do so. “As a part of preparation strategy post lockdown, all retails and home deliveries agencies have been asked to get 100% screening of the staff. Those who get their staff screened would be able to run their operations without any hassle,” said an official order.The order also said that just to be abundantly cautious about the spread of the pandemic through currency notes, it has been made mandatory to accept digital mode of payment through unified payment interface and other platforms from May 15. So far, Gujarat has nearly 7,000 Covid-19 positive cases.In Uttarakhand, the government has allowed shops to function between 7 am and 4 pm, an extra three hours from this week. Government spokesperson and minister, Madan Kaushik, said, “We have increased the time limit of the opening of shops from 7 am to 4 pm in the state and more industries have been allowed to start operations.” However, Kerala, which has seen a new spurt of cases with expats returning, has decided against any relaxation for the time being. With train services also resuming, it expects more cases. Last Sunday it observed a complete shutdown, a symbolic move to strengthen its ongoing fight against the virus. In Rajasthan, a majority of MPs and MLAs welcomed the chief minister’s decision to bring stranded workers to their homes. The lawmakers suggested that additional trains and buses be arranged for them. They asked to simplify the pass process, arrange institutional quarantine for the people coming from other places to the village school or panchayat building and adding the names of new labourers to the MGNREGA list.On the demand of MPs and MLAs to remove the farmers’ welfare fee on purchases in agricultural markets, Gehlot said that the fee has not been imposed on the farmers but on the traders. The meeting was attended by speaker, Dr CP Joshi, former CM, Vasundhara Raje, leader of the opposition, Gulabchand Kataria, deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Rathore, and former Union minister, PP Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-relax-some-curbs-as-lockdown-nears-deadline/story-oQOwcSkqKRyAXhh8FxvxwK.html
12-05-2020||India||Govt issues new protocol for Aarogya Setu data collection||The government issued on Monday a set of protocols for how data collected from people through the Aarogya Setu contact tracing mobile application will be used and shared, attempting to address privacy concerns raised by activists and experts about the way the tool functions, the information it stores and the lack of clarity around who has access to it.The ‘Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020’, notified through a government order on Monday, restricts the use of data – such as the information people provide during self-assessment of their health and a record of who they came in contact with – “strictly” to purposes necessary and proportionate for the government’s “health responses”.The data can be retained for 180 days, the document says, significantly longer than the 45 days (for uninfected people) and 60 days (for infected persons) that it retains at present, according to officials in Niti Aayog who gave this information previously.A user can, however, request for their demographic data – defined as name, mobile number, age, gender, profession and travel history – to be deleted. “Demographic data of an individual that has been collected by NIC shall be retained for as long as this protocol remains in force or if the individual requests that it be deleted, for a maximum of 30 days from such request, whichever is earlier,” the document said.Officials said the protocol was necessitated by the increased criticism. “User data on the app is safe, and of the 98 million downloads, the data of only 12,000 people have been stored on the servers,” said Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov, adding that the protocol will allay concerns of privacy violations. Entrusting the National Informatics Centre for the collection, processing and managing of the data collected by the Aarogya Setu, the Centre also specified that only the data of those who are infected, are at high risk of being infected or who have come in contact with infected people are most likely to be collected. The data can be shared between any government department or ministry, which can also pass it on to third parties as long as the sharing of such information is specifically for the purpose of government’s health responses. “NIC shall, to the extent reasonable, document the sharing of any data and maintain a list of the agencies with whom such data has been shared,” the rules state, adding that any entity processing such data shall do so “in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory manner”. The protocol -- which will stay in force for six months -- also allows for data to be shared with different agencies and wings of the Central government as well as state governments in “de-identified” form to assist in the formulation or implementation of a critical health response. The app, which was launched to trace the contacts of individuals who have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has now been expanded to issue e-passes, provide telemedicine and is mandatory for travel to work. The app has been criticised by digital rights activist for its tracing of location histories and, last week, a French computer programmer said that vulnerabilities in the tool’s design could allow attackers to access data of millions of Indians. Violations of the data security protocols by any entity will be punishable under section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which invites jail term for up to two years. The protocols also allow research institutes to study the data collected by the app after it has undergone hard anonymisation – a process to scrub it of personally identifiable information. Divij Joshi, a lawyer and tech policy expert, said that while the protocol specifies the security guidelines better than the app’s privacy policy, it might not have enough legal teeth since it is not a legislative action. The protocol attempts to give a legal basis to Aarogya Setu, as required by the Supreme Court but it is not a clear legislative basis. It introduces some accountability by limiting data collection and sharing to that which is ‘strictly necessary’ and by allowing individuals to complain to Disaster Management Authorities under the law as well. However, the protocol does not address issues of efficacy of contact tracing, and the issues of discrimination and exclusion by making it mandatory,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-new-protocol-for-aarogya-setu-data-collection/story-EgPaNkP06FDOy1VGOPtKBP.html
12-05-2020||India||ICMR nod to 28 institutes for plasma therapy trials||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved 28 out of 113 institutions that showed interest in conducting convalescent plasma therapy trials for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, according to an official from the top medical body.Transfusing critically ill Covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma -- a component of blood rich in antibodies from patients who recovered from the disease -- so that they can fight of f the disease is a treatment showing promise world over.“The process for the plasma therapy trials is on; institutions are being approved and patients are being recruited. It will, however, be some time before anything conclusive can be said on the results of this therapy,” said Dr Rajni Kant Srivastava, spokesperson for ICMR.In Delhi, seven institutes, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Batra Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital and Max Hospital Saket have been approved to participate in the trials. Max Hospital in Saket had transfused plasma last month into a Covid-19 patient with good results. The patient was on ventilator, and the hospital sought approval on compassionate grounds as the family of the patient insisted.The patient recovered and was recently discharged, “but it is important that we also understand that plasma therapy is no magic bullet. During the patient’s treatment at Max Hospital, Saket, other standard treatment protocols were followed and we can say that plasma therapy could have worked as a catalyst in speeding up his recovery. We cannot attribute 100% recovery to plasma therapy only, as there are multiple factors which carved his path to recovery,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director – Max Healthcare.The ICMR earlier this month came out with a detailed document on the study model using plasma therapy. The sample size finalised for the multi-centre clinical trials is 452.Currently, no effective treatments are available for the Covid-19 disease. Scientists and Researchers are working on many aspects of treatment options for the development of vaccination and medication to combat this life-threatening problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-nod-to-28-institutes-for-plasma-therapy-trials/story-BK24kRcy1dsIzfMcsmZNeM.html
12-05-2020||India||Govt plans random testing for community surveillance||Every week, 200 people will be tested at health facilities in each of India’s 733 districts to check whether they have or have had the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union health ministry said in new guidelines released on Monday, charting out a comprehensive community surveillance strategy that experts have long said was crucial in managing the outbreak.The guidelines have been sent by the Union health ministry to all districts, which will now need to select 10 health facilities – of these six need to be run by the state – where certain sets of people will be put to swab as well as blood tests. The swab tests identify a concurrent infection while the blood tests can detect if a person has previously had the infection and is now fighting or has fought it off.“There is a need to establish systematic surveillance for Sars-CoV-2 infection in all districts of country. This surveillance will be in addition to the routine testing as per current testing guidelines,” says the document titled District level facility based surveillance for Covid-19. “The purpose of surveillance in an outbreak situation is to establish a trend on how far the disease is spreading; what is the pattern like; which areas are more affected and where the containment measures are succeeding. The preparations have already begun for this survey that will be conducted at the district level,” said a senior government official, who didn’t wish to be identified.The ministry did not specify when the protocol will be put into place.According to the document, the 200 weekly samples will be divided into high risk and low risk groups. The high risk individuals have been identified as health workers, from whom 100 samples will be collected. The remaining 100, considered in low risk, will be evenly split between out-patient department (OPD) visitors and pregnant women. The OPD patients will include people who do not show signs of an influenza-like illness (ILI), a category of people from whom samples are routinely taken for testing for Covid-19. The samples will be collected as throat and nasal swabs for an RT-PCR test, which detects the presence of the virus, and as blood for ELISA tests that detect if a person has a type of antibodies called IgG.“In subsequent rounds, IgG ELISA based testing of serum samples will replace RT-PCR based testing for surveillance purpose,” the guidelines added. The swab samples will be tested in pools – a strategy that reduces the number of tests that will actually need to be carried. According to guidelines, the 200 samples will be split into batches of 25. The strategy dictates that if a batch tests positive, only then will the individual samples need to be tested.Experts welcomed the move, saying it will be more effective to check the extent of disease spread than current measures. “This is a systematic surveillance for action, and there is high relevance of choosing pregnant women because usually pregnant women are at the least risk of getting infected because of normally not engaging in a behaviour that can make them vulnerable towards contracting an infection. So, if a pregnant woman is found to be positive it would reflect the extent of disease spread,” said Giridhara R Babu, professor and head Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.“And testing healthcare workers is necessary as these are front line workers at the highest risk, so you need to check they don’t become the vectors,” he added.“Pooling samples for testing is the best way to save precious resources but the only thing is, it needs to be done at a place where disease prevalence is low; the ICMR guidelines recommend about 2%. If it is done in a high prevalence district then you will have to test samples individually again and again for different batches, which would defeat the purpose,” said Dr Ekta Gupta, senior virologist, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which is one of the approved labs for Covid-19 testing. The move comes a day after the India’s top medical research lab – the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune – announced that it had created an ELISA test to detect antibodies.Antibody testing has been controversial in the world over since initial test kits, imported mostly from Chinese companies, turned out to be unreliable.The tests will be done in addition to the random testing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI), for which at least 250 samples are being lifted from each district as reported by HT on May 7.“The sampling will have to be done in all districts, which is going to be crucial in determining the prevalence of Covid-19 in our community. It is important,” said health minister Harsh Vardhan, while conducting review of the Covid-19 situation in one of the states on Thursday, referring to the tests on SARI and ILI patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-random-testing-for-community-surveillance/story-ge1vOF5kDRo6EOaWz3d2OI.html
12-05-2020||India||Migrant trains to take more passengers, allowed 3 stops||Indian Railways approved on Monday an increase in the number of passengers allowed on board Shramik Special trains it is running for migrant workers returning home after being stranded by the Covid-19 lockdown, and allowed the trains to make three stops en route to their destinations.Shramik Specials, which have so far been running without any stops on the way, are now allowed to carry up to 1,700 people. The special trains have 24 coaches, each with 72 seats. Until now, only 54 people have been allowed in each coach, with the middle berth left empty to maintain social distancing, meaning each train carried about 1,200 passengers. According to the new guidelines issued by Indian Railways, a copy of which was reviewed by HT, a train’s capacity should now be equal to the number of sleeper berths it has.The Union home ministry, meanwhile, asked all states and Union territories to cooperate with the railways in running more Shramik Special trains, which started on May 1 after state governments requested the Centre to facilitate the return of migrant workers stranded in various parts of the country because of the lockdown imposed on March 25 for the Covid-19 pandemic. “I urge upon you all to allow receiving of all Shramik Special trains without any hindrance and facilitate faster movement of stranded migrant workers to their native places,” a letter written by home secretary Ajay Bhalla to state and Union Territory (UT) administrations said. He also asked states and UTs to ensure that migrant workers do not resort to walking on the roads and rail tracks and use the special trains for travel home.The developments came a day after railway minister Piyush Goyal said Indian Railways had geared up to run 300 trains a day to ferry migrant labourers to their hometowns. He also appealed to the states to ramp up efforts to ensure these workers reach their destinations across the country in the next three-four days.“The minister has appealed to all states, especially states that have allowed very few trains (so far)...Same was discussed in the home secretary’s VC (video conference) with states yesterday (Sunday), and he has written a letter to them. The home minister (Amit Shah), in particular, has appealed to West Bengal, which has very low numbers (of trains that it has approved),” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Centre also said the railways will now run 100 ‘Shramik Special’ trains daily, and added that 513 such trains have been operated since May 1, carrying over 600,00 migrants to their destinations.Until Monday afternoon, 363 trains reached their destinations in Andhra Pradesh (1 train), Bihar (100 trains), Himachal Pradesh (1 train), Jharkhand (22 trains), Madhya Pradesh (30 trains), Maharashtra (3 trains), Odisha (25 trains), Rajasthan (4 trains), Telangana (2 trains), Uttar Pradesh (172 trains), West Bengal (2 trains) and Tamil Nadu (1 train). The remaining 105 were in transit, the ministry said.“This morning, I reviewed the train operations of ‘Shramik Special’ trains. Only 4 trains ran on the first day i.e 1st May which grew to 101 trains yesterday. In total, 468 trains have departed,” Goyal tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-trains-to-take-more-passengers-allowed-3-stops/story-kOWy3Iaw3DXpwV2J0nSihK.html
12-05-2020||India||Alert sounded after a swarm of locusts enters Rajasthan’s Ajmer||A swarm of locusts that travelled to the Indian border from Pakistan reached Rajasthan’s Ajmer district on Monday, and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) warned that more invasions by the insects . were likely from new areas.The Indian government’s Locust Warning Organization (LWO) claimed that the locust invasion would be controlled soon. LWO deputy director KL Gurjar said a swarm of locusts had been reported on Sunday night near Beawar, a city in Ajmer, that had since reached the district.Meanwhile, the FAO, an arm of t he United Nations (FAO), released a status update, suggesting the conditions for invasions by locus, a migratory pest, had become more worrisome in May and June. According to the update, migration from the spring breeding areas in Baluchistan has commenced, and several immature adult groups and swarms of locusts have appeared since May 2 in Rajasthan.Increased monitoring and reporting are required in desert areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border, warned the FAO, which released a global forecast according to which, in addition to the current invasion, locust swarms from new areas can cross the Indian border from June 22.According to the FAO, locusts possess the ability to change their behaviour and habits and can migrate over large distances. They can form dense and highly mobile swarms that can then fly as long as 150 kilometres a day, given favourable winds. These swarms can devour large amounts of vegetation and crops. An adult desert locust can consume its own weight in fresh food per day. Just one small swarm can eat the same amount of crops in a day as 35 000 people. If the numbers of locusts is not contained, the impact on crops and vegetation will drive up hunger in regions already struggling with high levels of food insecurity.Armies of locusts swarming across continents pose a “severe risk” to India’s agriculture this year, the UN has warned, prompting the authorities to step up vigil, deploy drones to detect their movement and hold talks with Pakistan on ways to minimise the damage, Hindustan Times reported on March 1. Locust attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. Authorities at the national plant protection office said the country was prepared and deploying a wide range of measures. But large-scale invasions could still prove challenging given that India lacks equipment like large sprayer aircraft, experts said. A moderate infestation from across the border chomped through crops in an estimated 300,000 hectares in Rajasthan and Gujarat in January. An upsurge in locust attacks since last year is being attributed to favourable breeding weather caused by a large number of cyclones in East Africa. India, China and Pakistan face the most risk in Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alert-sounded-after-a-swarm-of-locusts-enters-rajasthan-s-ajmer/story-fhI5fADtXkxoeKRSohvO9J.html
12-05-2020||India||Enzyme makes men vulnerable to coronavirus disease||Being male is a significant risk factor for severe illness and death from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) regardless of age, according to a new study that identified higher concentrations of a key enzyme in men’s blood as the reason for the increased risk of death they face compared to women.Men have higher levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a protein in the blood that Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19, uses to enter human cells, according to the study published in the European Heart Journal on Monday. Sars-CoV2 causes infection by using its crown-like spike protein, which gives the virus its name (corona is Latin for crown) to bind to ACE2 on the surface of human cells, from where it invades the air sacs in the lungs, leading to respiratory distress.ACE2 is found not only in lungs, but also the heart, kidneys and tissues lining blood vessels, and there are particularly high levels in the testes. Its regulation in the testes may partially explain higher ACE2 concentrations in men, and why men are more vulnerable to Covid-19, according to the study.“ACE2 is a receptor on the surface of cells. It binds to the coronavirus and allows it to enter and infect healthy cells after it is has been modified by another protein on the surface of the cell, called TMPRSS2. High levels of ACE2 are present in the lungs and, therefore, it is thought to play a crucial role in the progression of lung disorders related to Covid-19,” Dr Adriaan Voors, professor of cardiology at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, said in a statement.For the study, the researchers measured ACE2 concentrations in blood samples taken from 3,720 heart failure patients from 11 European countries and found that ACE2 was much higher in men than in women.Data from across the world shows that though men and women are equally likely to get infected, severe disease and death is significantly higher in men. Men are 2.4 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than women, found a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health on April 29. This study also listed older age and underlying diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and respiratory conditions, among others, high number of comorbidities with disease severity and deaths.Age was comparable between men and women in all data sets.In China, where Covid-19 originated, men accounted for close to two-thirds (64%) of deaths as compared to women, who accounted for 36% of all deaths.A similar gender gap in mortality rates has emerged from Italy, Spain, South Korea, France and Germany, with men accounting for 71% of the Covid-19 deaths in Italy. There were also disproportionately high deaths among men in other coronavirus outbreaks caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), with data from Hong Kong showing deaths among men were 50% higher even though more women got infected.Older age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease are associated with greater risk of death from Covid-19 , according to an analysisofsix retrospective studies with 22,350 Covid-19 infected patients and 741 cases of death published in the preprint server for health sciences, medRxiv, on April 11. “The early explosion of underlying comorbidities such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes and lung problems in Indians raises their risk of severe disease and death at younger ages as compared to other countries. That’s why continuing prescription medication for existing conditions is as important as washing hands and wearing masks,” said Dr G Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care, and a member of the Delhi government’s Covid-19 response committee. The European Heart Journal study also found that heart failure patients taking drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), did not have higher concentrations of ACE2 in their blood, which is contrary to some research that suggested that RAAS inhibitors might increase ACE2 in the blood to raise Covid-19 risk. “People with heart disease who have been prescribed ACE-inhibitors and ARBS should not discontinue the drugs,” said Dr Khilnani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enzyme-makes-men-vulnerable-to-disease/story-mTSvRnonr8KcunYZ69Qw1O.html
12-05-2020||India||Ensure medical workers travel unhindered: Centre||Health care services across key Delhi hospitals engaged in battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are getting impacted, administrators said on Monday, with staffers complaining of not being allowed cross-border movement from other parts of the National Capital Region amid a national lockdown implemented to contain the outbreak.The complaints by health care professionals of being stopped by the police at border check-posts come even as cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba wrote to states on Monday, directing them to ensure that medical workers can travel for work unhindered.Tanvi Grover, a postgraduate anesthesiology student who works at the Safdarjung Hospital’s intensive care unit, said travelling from and to her house in Gurugram has been a nightmare. She said has had to plead with policemen at the Delhi-Gurugram border to let her return home from the hospital.“The first day that I got stuck, I was at the border for over 1.5 hours, trying to convince the officials that I did not have any accommodation or even clothes to stay back in Delhi. The next time, I asked for a 24-hour shift that ended in the morning so that I could cross the border at about 5am when the checking is not so strict,” she said.Grover said she exchange shifts with others over the last two weeks in attempts to avoid hassles in travelling. For her next shift on Tuesday, she was not sure whether she would be allowed to cross the border into Delhi. Grover has her hospital ID card, an authorisation letter from the hospital’s medical superintendent, and now an online pass.About 35% of doctors, nurses and other health care workers at the Safdarjung Hospital live across the border in Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad and this has hampered the hospital’s functioning, said Dr Manish Kumar, president of the Safdarjung Hospital Resident Doctors’ Association. The hospital currently has 130 Covid-19 patients.“We are falling short of staff as many health care workers are unable to come to Delhi for their duties, which means those living in Delhi are pulling off more shifts and longer hours. This is not a sustainable measure and if some relief is not provided, others will get exhausted,” he said.All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) medical superintendent Dr DK Sharma said the services were being hindered at the premier hospital. “A couple of hundred staff members travel from across the borders for their duty... [they] have been unable to report for work. However, we are a big hospital with thousands of doctors, nurses and healthcare staff. So, we are able to manage for the time being.”A resident doctor who works at AIIMS said that last week, she had to plead with the police to be allowed to cross the border into Gurugram. “The person manning the border told me that the first [Covid-19] positive case reported involved a health care staffer. So till the time he is on duty at this check post, he won’t allow my car to pass,” the doctor, who was travelling to Palam Vihar in Gurugram last week, said on condition of anonymity. She returned to the hospital and was later able to cross over at a later time.An administrator of a tertiary care hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Yes, the lockdown of the Haryana and UP borders has impacted the services in the hospital; I can’t say how much, but we are running the services with the help of the staff that we have.”A senior Delhi government official said officials were trying to resolve the issue. “There have been talks and the government is planning on providing a list of those performing essential services in Delhi to allow them cross the border. The government is also looking at providing temporary accommodation till this lockdown is over.”Doctors associations have previously said the problems in travelling across state borders have led to undue pressure on those living in Delhi. “Around 15 to 20% of health care staff comes from across the border [particularly of hospitals] near the border areas such as GTB Hospital. With the closure of borders, the doctors living in Delhi have had to work more than their share,” said Dr Parv Mittal, vice president, Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association.Officials working on Covid-19 contact tracing and surveillance have also been facing problems with several on-ground health care workers being from places outside the Delhi borders. “We have had to ask administrations of the neighbouring states to allow one-time exit for the health care workers and here we are making some arrangements for their stay. However, the problem is that they have to stay away from their families for extended periods,” a Delhi official said on condition of anonymity.The interstate border closures because of Covid-19 have also hit the testing facilities. “There is a human resource shortage because staff cannot travel as the Gurgaon and other borders are sealed. There are issues with logistics as equipment is taking time to reach us by road. Our staff is getting harassed by neighbours, landlords because they work in the diagnostic sector,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder, Dr Dang’s Labs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-medical-workers-travel-unhindered-centre/story-AxFuoy1jZBTWr1JaRiDckJ.html
12-05-2020||India||Only containment areas should be red zones: Delhi CM Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider the recategorisation of Delhi’s designated Covid-19 hot spots – keeping containment areas in the city as “red zones” and declaring the rest of the city a “green zone” to restart economic activity.At the moment, all 11 revenue districts in the Capital are “red zones”, and can therefore ease the minimum lockdown restrictions as per the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry on May 1, two days before the nationwide lockdown was extended till at least May 17. These districts have 81 containment zones between them, where the restrictions are tighter, movement is restricted, and essential goods are home delivered by the administration.Kejriwal urged the Union government that only these containment zones should fall in the red category.“The Delhi government has adopted two policies now. Reviving the economy, as a priority, and focussing on containing the number of Covid-19 related deaths. The chief minister has urged the PM to consider turning Delhi into a green zone, except the containment areas, so that more relaxations can be implemented,” said an official in the chief minister’s office familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.Kejriwal raised the issue during a point the fifth meeting since the national lockdown was first imposed on March 25 between Modi and the CMs of all Indian states via video conference. On May 3, when the Delhi government issued an order to implement the restrictions and relaxations for the extended lockdown period under the Centre’s guidelines, Kejriwal made the same appeal in a video press briefing.In addition, the chief minister also asked the Union government for the release of central funds.“The finance commission has not released funds to Delhi. So, the chief minister also requested the PM to release funds to Delhi from the finance commission,” the official quoted above said. Delhi has been consistently demanding the Centre to raise its share in central taxes. As per latest audit report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, the government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) has maintained a revenue surplus over five years from 2013-14 to 2017-18.However, the grants in aid received by Delhi from the Centre decreased Rs 2,825 crore (2016-17) to Rs 2,184 crore (2017-18). This included grants from Centre in lieu of share in central taxes, which remained stagnant at Rs 325 crore since 2001-02 although the central tax collections have grown substantially since 2001-02, the report pointed out.The Centre has maintained that the amount has remained the same since 2001 because Delhi is a Union Territory and it is not covered under the Central Finance Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-containment-areas-should-be-red-zones-kejriwal/story-uqSsU2Zza79OyzwW0GTihK.html

The flight reached Hyderabad at about 9 pm.The two persons who failed the test will not be put in quarantine and provided treatment. Indian authorities had made it clear that only people who passed screening and tests and are asymptomatic will be allowed on repatriation flights being operated as part of Mission Vande Bharat.Ajaykiran Donthala, an Indian who was stranded at the airport for almost 50 days, was repatriated on the same flight. Ambassador Pavan Kapoor met Donthala and other passengers before the flight took off.India is operating 64 flights from 12 countries during the first week of the repatriation programme to bring back almost 15,000 citizens, mainly from West Asian countries.Indian officials are carrying out stringent screening and testing of all citizens being repatriated by non-scheduled flights and naval ships from different countries as part of Mission Vande Bharat. Citizens who register for the programme are told only asymptomatic people will be allowed to take flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-indians-fail-antibody-test-barred-from-boarding-repatriation-flight-from-uae/story-a9mbk1mFS3dnD1Z8X2FtXJ.html

They will be using Paharganj entry points. This is being done to avoid confusion and mixing of passengers..,” he added.All trains that will depart from the New Delhi Railway Station on Tuesday and all platforms from where they will set off are being thoroughly washed, disinfected and sanitised, the official said.“We are installing sanitiser dispensers at the entry points of the station building. Staffers with thermal scanners will also be deployed there. The passengers will have to use sanitiser and undergo thermal screening before being allowed to enter the premises. We will deploy sufficient staff to ensure social distancing is being maintained,” said Jain, adding that sanitiser dispensers will be installed in each coach of the trains.E-booking of train tickets, scheduled to start at 4 pm on Monday, was delayed because of technical glitches.Multilayered barricades were put in place at the railway station and except security personnel and sanitation staff, no one was allowed inside the compound. A few passengers who reached the barricades hoping to gain entry and spend the night on the platforms, were turned away by security personnel, who asked them to return to places where they had been staying or . to spend the night in any of the nearby shelter homes. One person said he had come to board a train to his hometown Bilaspur in Chattisgarh on Tuesday. A person he spoke to on the state helpline told him train services will resume on Tuesday and he should reach the station.“The policemen did not allow me to cross the barricades and asked for my E-ticket. I did not have the ticket since booking has not started. The policemen asked me to stay in the nearest shelter home for the night, book my ticket and come on Tuesday,” said Santanu Holkar, who had come to Delhi on February 28 for a job interview and got stuck because of the lockdown.“I was selected for the job. The company asked me to extend my stay till all the formalities were completed. However, the procedure stopped because of the lockdown and I had to stay in a PG {paying guest} accommodation in Vaishali, Ghaziabad,” added Holkar.Deputy commissioner of police (railways and metro) Harendra Kumar Singh said that the police were yet to receive any communication from railways officials on implementation of the new order and security arrangements. “As of now, we know that nobody will be allowed to enter the compound without a confirmed E-tickets of trains. All necessary arrangements will be made as and when we receive instructions from the railway officials,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paharganj-entry-platforms-1-5-for-new-passenger-trains/story-WYLeEVJr2TqDbM6Bwgs0kK.html
12-05-2020||India||Users can now request deletion of their data on Aarogya Setu app: Centre||Any user whose demographic data is stored with the government through the Aarogya Setu app can now request for its deletion, the Centre said on Monday as it issued a set of protocols to regulate the definition, collection, processing and storage of data by the contact-tracing app. Data about the user’s name, mobile number, age, gender, profession and travel history come under this ambit. The ‘Aarogya Setu Emergency Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020’, which will be applicable for the next six months, also increases the period of retention of such data from the earlier 60 days as specified in the app’s privacy policy to 180 days.The move comes as the government has faced criticism of the violation of privacy by digital rights activists as the app has evolved from a contract-tracing app when it was launched in April to take on a larger role of providing e-passes, telemedicine, as well as e-pharma facilities; critics have raised concerns over the government making it mandatory for a host of activities, especially in the movement of individuals. ALSO READ | Aarogya Setu app rule for private offices, not for domestic helps: OfficialLast week, a French hacker pointed at vulnerabilities on the app by showing that details of millions of Indians using it could be accessed within a 100-km radius. The app only provides data for a radius of 10 kilometres only for phones in India. IT ministry officials said that the protocol was necessitated by the increased criticism. The rationale for the protocol, the government said, was to ensure the effective implementation of the government’s health response to Covid-19. “There is a need to ensure efficient data and information sharing among the different Departments and Ministries of the Government of India as well as those in the State/Union Territory Governments,” the protocol said. Entrusting the National Informatics Centre for the collection, processing and managing of the data collected by the Aarogya Setu, the Centre also specified that only the data of those who are infected, are at high risk of being infected or who have come in contact with infected people are most likely to be collected. This includes demographic, contact, self assessment and location data. ALSO READ | MIT researchers examine Aarogya Setu app, here’s what they have to sayWhile contact and location data will by default remain on the device, the government may upload it to its server to formulate or implement appropriate health responses, it said. It added that the data of those infected will not be shared with any third party in usual circumstances, the government may do so if it is “strictly necessary” to formulate or implement health responses. The rules are applicable for six months, and while the app does not yet have a sunset clause, the government said that a review of the protocol will be taken up after six months. Contact, location and self-assessment data of individuals will be permanently deleted in 180 days in most cases, but demographic data will remain for as long as the protocol remains in force. If an individual requests that it be deleted, it will do so within 30 days of the request. The protocol also allows for data to be shared with different agencies and wings of the Central government as well as state governments in “de-identified” form to assist in the formulation or implementation of a critical health response. These entities, responsible for processing the data in a fair manner, will not store it for more than 180 days. However, the protocol said that the NIC will have to maintain a list of such agencies with details of when such sharing was started, people who have access, as well as the categories of the data.Abhishek Singh, CEO MyGov, said that the protocol will allay concerns of privacy violation. “User data on the app is safe, and of the 98 million downloads, the data of only 12,000 people have been stored on the servers,” he said. Violations of the data security protocols by any entity will be punishable under Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which invites jail term for up to two years. The protocols also allow research institutes to study the data collected by the app which has undergone hard anonymisation. Divij Joshi, a lawyer and tech policy expert, said that while the protocol specifies the security guidelines better than the app’s privacy policy, it might not have enough legal teeth as it is not a legislative action.“The protocol attempts to give a legal basis to Aarogya Setu, as required by the Supreme Court but it is not a clear legislative basis. It introduces some accountability by limiting data collection and sharing to that which is ‘strictly necessary’ and by allowing individuals to complain to Disaster Management Authorities under the law as well. However, the protocol does not address issues of efficacy of contact tracing, and the issues of discrimination and exclusion by making it mandatory,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/users-can-now-request-deletion-of-their-data-on-aarogya-setu-app-centre/story-S8SWdUYoRvUL0ubkxBf00L.html
12-05-2020||Today's||Sound public health policy need of hour | Opinion||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is an unprecedented global challenge for both health and economic well-being. As seen in Italy and New York City, the exponential growth of Covid-19 infections can quickly overwhelm health systems and lead to tens of thousands of deaths. Wary of the risk of a fast-spreading pandemic, the Indian government enforced arguably the strictest lockdown in the world. This has slowed the spread and saved lives – but at a heavy human and economic cost. These costs have now polarised the policy debate around the government’s next steps (and similar debates are playing out around the world). Some argue that lockdowns are excessive, hurting us more than the disease itself. Others claim that lockdowns are the only realistic option to prevent a catastrophic increase in cases and deaths. However, framing the debate around lives versus livelihoods is counterproductive because it distracts attention from the most urgent actions we need to take. Specifically, we need a strategy focused on making the public health investments required to reopen the economy safely as soon as possible.Why we need a public health-driven strategyIndia needs a strategy grounded in public health because, at its core, this is a public health crisis. What makes Covid-19 so dangerous is that it takes time for those who are infected to show symptoms, so they remain unaware and active – spreading the virus at scale. This is why governments around the world have resorted to lockdowns as the only option to contain virus spread in a setting where anyone could be a carrier and transmitter. But a lockdown only slows the spread of the virus. A worrying misconception is that the lockdown will eliminate the coronavirus problem and enable a safe reopening. Yet simply lifting the lockdown after a few weeks will likely lead to a resurgence in the number of cases. Even in green zones with zero active current cases, Covid-19 can reappear and spread rapidly through the community, as seen recently in Singapore and South Korea. Thus, a lockdown on its own does not “solve” the problem of the virus. Rather, it needs to be seen as the first step in a long-term “Hammer and Dance” strategy for a battle expected to last at least 12-18 months (which is the earliest that a vaccine may be available). The hammer (lockdown) phase aims to slow down the spread of the virus enough to buy us time to prepare for the “dance” phase, when a substantial amount of economic activity can resume but under modified guidelines and under a much stronger surveillance system – based on testing, tracing, and quarantine – to limit the health costs of reopening the economy. By ramping up testing among both symptomatic cases and in populations who are at high-risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19 (like frontline workers), we will be able to catch cases early and isolate potential spreaders. Ideally all high-risk individuals should be tested. However, given testing capacity constraints, it makes sense to test random samples of high-risk individuals – even if they show no symptoms. This testing needs to be followed up with diligent contact tracing (up to at least two degrees of contacts) and strict quarantine. Done well, such an approach could lead to sequestering 1-3% of the population, but allow the rest to prudently resume economic activity with precautions like mandatory mask wearing and social distancing in public places, frequent handwashing with soap, a continued ban on large gatherings, and modified protocols for public transport. This is clearly a much better outcome than a blanket lockdown driven by the fear that anyone may be a carrier. Thus, the main value of increased testing is in allowing us to identify and isolate only those at risk as opposed to the entire population.Across the world and in India, this comprehensive system of testing, tracing, and quarantining is the only approach that has worked to gain the confidence needed to safely lift a lockdown. For instance, Vietnam, which has a comparable GDP/capita to India and had early exposure to the virus, has had zero Covid-19 deaths largely because of a combination of aggressive testing, five degrees of contact tracing, and strict quarantine compliance. This success is now allowing Vietnam to safely open up its economy. Closer to home, Kerala has been a global role model in managing Covid-19 with a largely similar approach. Investing in a public-health strategy is highly cost-effective The deepening economic distress has led to widespread demands for a government rescue package. Some, like CII, have suggested this package be worth 15 lakh crore or 7.5% of GDP. But any economic “recovery” package will only make sense after one is able to open up the economy itself. Thus, just like the best foreign policy for India is an economic policy that delivers consistent 8% or greater growth for multiple decades, the best and most cost-effective economic policy right now is a sound public health policy. Consider the cost of scaling up four key components of the health strategy:Testing: India’s testing rate is a long way from global leaders, but even ramping it up to test at the rate of Tamil Nadu (which is conducting over 10,000 tests/day) would substantially increase our ability to identify potential super-spreaders before they spread the virus. Doing so would allow us to cover 5% of the population (70 million tests/year) at a cost of Rs 17,500 crore (at Rs 2,500/test).Contact Tracing: The most effective way to scale up Covid-19 contact tracing and surveillance would be to hire and train additional ASHA workers on a one-year contract. The average cost of an ASHA worker is around Rs 60,000/year but even increasing this to Rs 1 lakh (to augment pay and include training costs) would allow us to double India’s ASHA workforce and hire an extra one million ASHA workers for Rs. 10,000 crore/year.Safe and dignified quarantine: Studies suggest that a large fraction of Covid-19 transmission happens between family and friends, making high-quality public quarantine centres critical. These centres will be especially important for India, where most people live in packed high-density conditions and social distancing is nearly impossible. Further, the poor, whose families cannot afford the income loss, should be compensated for being put in quarantine in the public interest (for no fault of their own). Even if 2.5% of India’s population (35 million people) are put in a 14-day quarantine in a year, this would cost Rs. 35,000 crore/year (conservatively budgeting Rs. 500/day for public quarantine facilities, and Rs. 200/day for an NREGS equivalent wage payment, yields around Rs. 10,000/person for a 14-day quarantine).Universal mask wearing: Evidence suggests that universal wearing of a layered cloth mask may be one of the most cost-effective options to significantly reduce the rate of transmission). Providing two high-quality washable and reusable cloth masks to the entire population of 1.4 billion people would cost Rs 10,000 crore (at Rs 35 per mask). Put together, these investments would cost around Rs. 75,000 crore a year and will allow us to implement a Vietnam, Kerala, or Tamil Nadu model across the country. Since each week of the lockdown costs Rs 200,000 crores, these investments will pay off many times over even if they enable lifting the lockdown just a few weeks earlier. This list is not exhaustive and it would be cost effective to include other public health actions (like increased frequency of cleaning public toilets and spaces, and ensuring easy and reliable access to soap and water). But the key point is that all these investments are public goods that benefit the broader public (by reducing the risk of transmission) and not just the recipient of the benefit. Thus, they are excellent candidates for government provision, and will likely be underprovided otherwise.More broadly, Indian health expenditure is skewed substantially towards curative spending (which is a private good that only benefits the recipient and immediate family) rather than preventive investments in public health (that benefit many more people, but are less visible). Making these investments may also improve the long-term quality of health expenditure in India by strengthening public health systems. For instance, the extra ASHA workers hired for Covid-19 related surveillance could be retained (based on performance) on longer contracts to improve community health. Making it HappenSuccessfully implementing this strategy requires clarity not just on what to do, but on roles and responsibilities across national, state, and local governments. Based on principles of fiscal federalism, the national government should focus on roles that benefit from economies of scale, and require coordination. These include financing, purchasing and procurement, global coordination (especially ensuring access to vaccines and treatments), and national coordination (such as policies on inter-state travel, and sharing best practices across states). Consider testing: the current low rate of testing is partly driven by low testing capacity, but if the Govt. of India were to use its scale and commit to procuring Rs. 17,500 crore worth of test kits in the coming year, it could dramatically increase supply, reduce costs, and allow us to expand testing to catch potential super spreaders early. State governments should lead on operational matters such as doing the testing; hiring and training staff for health surveillance; contact tracing and quarantine; and transparent communication regarding public health guidelines and safety protocols. Local governments in partnership with civil society should lead in making the citizen experience as smooth as possible and securing community support for implementing national and state guidelines. Overall, the experiences of Vietnam and Kerala highlight the importance of cohesion among all parts of the government, combined with transparent communication, and community support for effectively implementing a public-health strategy. While the lockdown seems excessive to many, it is important to remember that, historically, germs and pandemics have caused many times more deaths than wars. In India, the Spanish Flu of 1918-20 is estimated to have caused over 12 million deaths, which is 75 times more than the 160,000 Indian soldier deaths in World War I and II combined. The economic cost of the lockdown is very real, but there is no conflict between prioritizing health and the economy. The two are deeply interlinked and a public-health led strategy is likely to have both the highest return on public expenditure and provide the only sustainable way out of these challenging times. It is therefore essential that we use every single day to urgently make the public health investments that will allow a safe exit from the lockdown.Karthik Muralidharan is the Tata Chancellor’s Professor of Economics at UC San Diego.

12-05-2020||Editorials||The challenge in resuming train travel| HT Editorial||Almost two months after being forced to stop due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Indian Railways has resumed passenger train operations, admittedly on a limited scale. Trains connecting major cities across the country were operationalised from Tuesday in a move to kickstart India’s economic engine. Several chief ministers cautioned Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi on the dangers of this move as India crossed a grim total of 70,000 positive cases and over 2,200 deaths. The PM acknowledged the concerns, said that rail services will be limited, and ruled out full resumption. Stopping train services was a precaution at a time when India had about 500 cases. Now, despite enforcing one of the most stringent lockdowns, India’s battle against Covid-19 is only escalating. With the need to resuscitate the economy on one hand, and protect the health of its citizens on the other, India doesn’t have many options. This newspaper has consistently argued for a graded lockdown to revive the economy, with strict health protocols. The resumption of train services (with the exception of migrant workers who were left stranded) has risks. The government has issued guidelines to ensure the safety of travellers. But there are real challenges in implementation. How do people get to the railway station? How can trains, many of which have been booked to full capacity, ensure social distancing? What protocols are in place for possibly asymptomatic travellers? Train travel can possibly lead to the spread of the disease, including in rural areas, and add to the health burden of states. The railways must do everything in its capacity to ensure that this doesn’t happen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-challenge-in-resuming-train-travel-ht-editorial/story-LBxTjMSIVLoseQ5S1xQl2N.html
12-05-2020||Editorials||A shift in labour markets| HT Editorial||In his meeting with the chief ministers on Monday, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi — for the first time — spoke about the crisis of migrant workers that has engulfed the country since the lockdown was imposed. He said that the government had urged the workers to stay where they were, but it was “human nature” to want to go home. But the PM, correctly, flagged two major challenges that will now crop up. The first is for states which the migrant workers have left. As economic activity resumes, there will be a severe shortage of labour in these regions. The second is for the home states, to which workers are returning. These regions, the PM acknowledged, did not have enough jobs — which is why migration had happened in the first place. They will now have to create opportunities. These states also will have to ensure that the return of workers does not lead to the spread of the disease, particularly in rural areas.What the PM underlined is a hugely significant moment in the political economy of labour markets in India. There is a view that these are unusual times; and workers who have gone home or are now returning will eventually come back, given economic compulsions. This may be true. But what is undeniable is that the past month has been a scarring experience for millions of workers. The relationship between businesses and workers has broken down — with the latter resentful about how employers did not provide requisite food and cash to help them tide over the crisis. The relationship between the State and workers has also got undermined — with the latter losing faith in the ability of governments to provide them a social safety net at a time of crisis. In this backdrop, all that they feel they can rely on are their families and community networks back home. They may live with less, but getting them back to cities will not be smooth.There is a clear geographical dimension to this too. It is southern and western states which have been the recipients of the workers in larger numbers. And it is the northern and eastern states which have sent these workers. This, in a way, is the key economic faultline in India, for the northern and eastern states have more exploitative agrarian relations, low industrial growth, and absence of opportunities. While this is a crisis, the north and east must use this as an opportunity to rebuild their economies even as the south and the west find new innovative ways to grow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-shift-in-labour-markets-ht-editorial/story-znSXnsiwH6FVHD8S75GflM.html
