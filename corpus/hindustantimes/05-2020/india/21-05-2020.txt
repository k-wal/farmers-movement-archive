We therefore decided to do it indigenously,” he said.  The secretary informed how the testing equipment will help the nation during the crisis: “With the acquisition of this equipment and with a concrete plan to add some more equipment as per need, we will be able to address not only the quantitative but also the qualitative requirements involved in the testing of body coveralls worn by the frontline health workers and other COVID-19 warriors”.The Textiles Committee is a statutory body established in 1963 through an Act of Parliament and is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Textiles, Government of India.  It was formed to ensure the quality of textiles and textile machinery both for internal consumption and export purpose.The committee is tasked with the functions of establishing laboratories for the testing of textiles and textile machinery and providing for their inspection and examination, besides other functions which flow from the main objective of ensuring quality of textiles products and textiles machinery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-becomes-world-s-second-largest-manufacturer-of-ppe-body-coveralls/story-f41BRGYbNL2cngM98SpkVL.html

The victim, a 73-year-old woman suffering from many ailments including high blood pressure and diabetes, had returned to the state from Mumbai two days ago by road. She died in a hospital in Thrissur on Wednesday but her samples were tested positive late on Thursday, it said.Her son, ambulance driver and another person who accompanied them from Mumbai were put under observation. Her body will be buried under the strict Covid protocol. After the latest death high alert has been sounded in Thrissur district.Earlier in the day Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said 24 new cases were reported in the state. With steady rise in cases, the state which has maintained a good recovery and low mortality rates, has decided to strengthen its surveillance measures.The 24 new cases took Kerala’s tally to 690 out of which 177 are active while 510 people have been discharged from hospitals, said the CM. He said the rising number of Cvoid-19 cases was a real concern. Cases went up sharply in the state with the arrival of expatriates and people stranded in other parts of the country. Among 24 fresh cases 14 are foreign returnees and 10 came from other states, he said.At least 78,000 have returned to the state by rail, air and road in the last two weeks and more than 90 per cent of the recent cases are imported ones. “A big relief is that not a single case was reported due to local transmission. Eight persons recovered also. Rising number is a big concern and we have to increase our surveillance,” the CM said.Vijayan warned that the state should brace itself for a situation given the rate of increase in new cases. But he reiterated that it was wrong to dub expatriates as super spreaders.With Covid-19 numbers rising, the government has asked neibghbourhood watch committees and primary health workers to increase their house-level visits to ensure that returnees are adequately isolated in their homes. The government has received several complaints that people in home quarantine interact with other family members regularly.A senior health official said the state is desperate to contain secondary infections but it was a tightrope walk between “imported cases” and all-out containment strategies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-death-toll-rises-to-5-in-kerala-24-new-cases-reported/story-gQUItgAHFXfL063f6MJEGL.html
21-05-2020||India||India junks China’s charge of sparking tension||Sutirtho Patranobis and Rezaul H LaskarBeijing/New DelhiIndia on Thursday strongly rebutted China’s contention that tensions in the Ladakh and Sikkim sectors were triggered by Indian troops crossing the Line of Actual Control (LAC), even as it accused Chinese forces of hindering patrols on the Indian side.The Indian side said it is committed to peace and tranquillity along the border, but will take all steps to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and security. The remarks by external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava came against the backdrop of continuing tensions along the LAC, especially in Galwan Valley of Ladakh, where both sides have deployed additional troops.New Delhi’s first official reaction to the tensions came a day after India was strongly supported by the US, with top American diplomat Alice Wells saying such disputes are a “reminder of the threat posed by China”.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reiterated that Indian troops had trespassed across the LAC and dismissed Wells’ remarks as “just nonsense”. India should work with China and “refrain from unilateral actions” that complicate the situation, he said.China’s foreign ministry side had first accused Indian troops of trespassing across the LAC in a statement to Hindustan Times on Tuesday, saying Beijing had to take “necessary countermeasures” after the Indian side allegedly obstructed normal patrols by Chinese troops.Asked about China’s position on the standoff in Ladakh, external affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava told an online news briefing: “Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across the LAC in the western [Ladakh] sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate.”Srivastava added: “All Indian activities are entirely on the Indian side of the LAC. In fact, it is [the] Chinese side that has recently undertaken activity hindering India’s normal patrolling patterns.”Indian troops, he said, “scrupulously” abide by the alignment of the LAC and all Indian activities “are entirely on the Indian side of the LAC”. The Indian side has a “very responsible approach towards border management”, and is “deeply committed to ensuring India’s sovereignty and security”, he added.Indian troops strictly follow procedures in bilateral agreements and protocols to resolve situations arising from differences in perception of the LAC, Srivastava said. “The two sides have established mechanisms to resolve such situations peacefully through dialogue. Both sides remain engaged with each other to address any immediate issues,” he said.In line with the consensus reached during the second India-China informal summit in Mamallapuram last year, the Indian side is firmly committed to the common objective of maintaining peace and tranquillity on the border, and this is an “essential prerequisite to the further development of...bilateral relations”, Srivastava said.During an online briefing for journalists on Wednesday, Alice Wells, the outgoing head of the US state department’s South and Central Asian bureau, had said the border tensions were a reminder that “Chinese aggression is not always rhetorical”, and China’s “provocations and disturbing behaviour” raised questions about how Beijing seeks to use its growing power.Responding to her remarks at a regular news briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao said: “The [US] diplomat’s remarks are just nonsense. China’s position on the China-India boundary issue is consistent and clear. China’s border troops firmly safeguard China’s territorial sovereignty and security and firmly dealt with the Indian side’s cross-over and infringement activities.”Zhao added, “We urge the Indian side to work together with us, abide by our leadership’s important consensus, comply with the agreements signed, refrain from unilateral actions complicating the situation.” He further said, “We hope they will make concrete efforts for peace and tranquillity in the border region. There are consultations and diplomatic channels between the two sides that have nothing to do with the US.”Earlier this month, Indian and Chinese troops were involved in clashes in the Sikkim and Ladakh sectors that left several soldiers on both sides injured. The clashes were resolved at the level of local commanders, but both sides rushed in hundreds of soldiers as reinforcements, especially in Galwan Valley.Reports have suggested that the Chinese side deployed troops and heavy equipment that were involved in an exercise to beef up positions in the Ladakh sector. China’s state-run media has described the latest tensions as the worst since the 2017 Doklam standoff, which lasted 73 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-junks-china-s-charge-of-sparking-tension/story-WPaAcuFMHdqXK8DFvvyEBP.html
21-05-2020||India||New Pentagon report says Pakistan continues to harbour Taliban, Haqqani Network||New Delhi: Pakistan continues to focus on countering Indian influence in Afghanistan and harbours the Taliban and groups such as the Haqqani Network, which have the ability to engage in violence on Afghan soil, according to a new Pentagon report.The report by the inspector general of the US department of defense for the January-March quarter, issued on Monday, pointed to a continuation of Pakistan’s efforts to achieve its strategic objectives in Afghanistan, including shutting out India from the war-torn country.The report is the first one to be issued since the US and the Taliban signed an agreement on February 29 to facilitate the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. The deal has stalled due to differences between the Taliban and the Afghan government on prisoner releases and intra-Afghan dialogue.There was no immediate response to the report from Indian officials.“According to the DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency], Pakistan’s strategic objectives in Afghanistan continue to be countering Indian influence and mitigating spillover of instability into its territory,” the report said.“The DIA reported that Pakistan likely views increased Taliban influence in Afghanistan as supporting its overall objectives and will seek to influence intra-Afghan peace talks in a direction favourable to Pakistan.”The DIA also reported to the inspector general that “Pakistan has encouraged the Afghan Taliban to participate in peace talks, but refrained from applying coercive pressure that would seriously threaten its relationship with the Afghan Taliban to dissuade the group from conducting further violence”.The DIA also told the inspector general that “Pakistan continues to harbour the Taliban and associated militant groups in Pakistan, such as the Haqqani Network, which maintains the ability to conduct attacks against Afghan interests”.Indian and Afghan officials have for long accused the Taliban, particularly its sword arm, the Haqqani Network, of having close links to the Pakistani military leadership. Most of the Taliban leadership and their families continue to be based in Pakistani cities such as Quetta.The report comes at a time when the US special envoy for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, has called on India to hold direct talks with the Taliban. However, the Trump administration’s outgoing pointperson for South Asia, Alice Wells, said on Wednesday that it was up to India to take a call on engaging with the Taliban.In his message in the report, Sean O’Donnell, the acting inspector general of the US department of defense, said: “The United States and Taliban agreed to a [one]-week reduction in violence prior to the signing of the agreement, but Taliban violence during the quarter overall was high.“In January and February, both the United States and the Taliban increased operations in order to influence negotiations. In addition, while the Taliban reduced attacks against US and coalition forces, it continued to attack the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, particularly after the signing of the agreement.”The department of defense didn’t provide information on Taliban-initiated attacks for the January-March quarter, saying this was “sensitive” as it was part of ongoing deliberations on whether the Taliban is complying with the terms of the agreement with the US....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-pentagon-report-says-pakistan-continues-to-harbour-taliban-haqqani-network/story-G5DAqBYi8gZMfHQLN5pT6O.html

This will include healthcare workers attending to Covid-19 patients and immediate family of coronavirus patients,” said Dr D Himanshu, senior faculty of the medicine department at KGMU. KGMU is the only centre in the state to have undertaken such a study. The stock of vaccine vials have arrived and the selection of people to participate in the trials has begun. “The trial, being done in association with the Serum Institute in Pune, is premised on a belief that several Indians could have been shielded by coronavirus because of BCG vaccine taken during the childhood, unlike countries such as America where the vaccine is optional. Immunity conferred through BCG vaccine may be used against Covid-19,” Dr Himanshu reasoned.Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is known to provide a broad spectrum of immunity against TB and other diseases. Himanshu said two sets of people belonging to the high-risk groups have been identified for the trials. First are the healthcare workers and second are the immediate family members of Covid-19 positive cases.For Coronavirus Live Updates“We have started identifying such healthcare workers and once the list is finalized, we hope to administer them the vaccine by the start of the next week,” said Himanshu.He added that family members of the positive cases will be administered the vaccine after consent. “Each member in both the groups will first be checked to see whether they are already infected with the virus. If so, then they shall not be included in the study as it is being done to check the preventive capacity of the BCG vaccine,” Himanshu said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The entire trial is likely to get complete in 3 months time. “In India, several medical centres are conducting similar trials. The results of all the centres will be evaluated individually and then collectively to ascertain whether this will work or not.

21-05-2020||India||KCR to take call on resumption of Telugu films shooting||Shootings for Telugu films and television serials are likely to resume soon in Telangana, but the chances of theatres and multiplexes reopening are bleak at least in the near future.This was made clear by Telangana minister for cinematography Talasani Srinivasa Yadav after meeting a delegation of Telugu film industry representatives at the residence of popular actor and former Union minister K Chiranjeevi on Thursday.Yadav told reporters later that the state government would take a decision shortly on resumption of shootings for movies and television serials in the wake of uncertainty in continuing the lockdown to prevent spread of Covid-19.“However, there is no restrictions on taking up post-production works even during the lockdown period. The representatives of the film industry requested that the shootings be allowed, while strictly following the Covid-19 norms like maintenance of physical distancing and sanitation,” the minister said.The industry delegation told the minister that a demonstration video on how indoor and outdoor shootings could resume, highlighting precautionary measures to be taken by the film cast and crew, including physical distancing, using sanitizers and face masks, would soon be submitted to the state government.“The delegation wants a meeting to be arranged with chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. The situation would be reviewed by the chief minister and a decision on lifting restrictions on the industry would be taken after that,” Yadav said.The minister discussed with the delegation on the impact of lockdown on cinema workers, including 14,000-odd daily wage workers. He said the state government, too, was positive about supporting the families of cinema workers.Apart from Chiranjeevi, other Telugu film personalities including D Suresh Babu, Allu Aravind, C. Kalyan, Akkineni Nagarjuna, Dil Raju, Gemini Kiran, Shyam Prasad Reddy, SS Rajamouli, VV Vinayak, Trivikram Srinivas, N Shankar, Koratala Siva, N Shankar and Ram Mohan Rao, were part of the delegation that met the cinematography minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-to-take-call-on-resumption-of-telugu-films-shooting/story-y7VjFtlNW0430md4os8mMJ.html
21-05-2020||India||India hopes Nepal will create ‘positive atmosphere’ for dialogue on border issues||India on Thursday called on Nepal’s leadership to create a “positive atmosphere for diplomatic dialogue” to address boundary issues, a day after the two sides sparred on a revised political map that depicted Lipulekh and Kalapani as part of Nepalese territory.The external affairs ministry delivered a sharply worded response on Wednesday after Nepal’s land management minister Padma Kumari Aryal unveiled the new map that showed Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Byas rural municipality in Sudurpaschim province.Asked about the matter during an online news briefing on Thursday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “All matters related to outstanding boundary issues will be dealt with between India and Nepal, and we hope the Nepalese leadership will create a positive atmosphere for diplomatic dialogue to resolve the outstanding boundary issues.”India’s position on Nepal’s revised map is consistent, he said. He reiterated India’s contention that the revision of the map was “a unilateral act and not based on historical facts and evidences”. He also reiterated that “such artificial enlargement of territorial claims will not be accepted by us”.Kathmandu’s move came little more than six months after New Delhi published new maps of the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh that showed Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand state.Nepal’s council of ministers had approved the new map during a meeting chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday.The diplomatic row began on May 8 after defence minister Rajnath Singh opened an 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh Pass on the border with China. The road was built so that pilgrims going to Kailash-Mansarovar in the Tibet Autonomous Region can avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.Nepal’s foreign ministry summoned the Indian envoy last week to protest against the construction of the road. New Delhi had rejected Kathmandu’s protest, saying Lipulekh is “completely within the territory of India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hopes-nepal-will-create-positive-atmosphere-for-dialogue-on-border-issues/story-3QfpyjvbUyVruutTouxo2I.html
21-05-2020||India||‘Game changer’: Assocham on army’s 3-year service proposal for civilians||After industrialist Anand Mahindra backed the army’s proposed “tour of duty” (ToD) model last week, industry body Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) on Thursday supported the proposal that seeks to allow the country’s youth to serve the military for three years, an army officer familiar with the move said.The scheme has also elicited positive response from some other industrialists. The industry body, in an email to the army on Thursday, described the ToD initiative of the government as a “game changer”, said the official cited above. He said that the Assocham has communicated to the army that it will work with the government to promote the ToD scheme not just as an “employment opportunity” but as a “nation building” initiative “where the industry will send existing employees for a three-year tour of duty with job security when they return.”Bharat Forge chairman Baba Kalyani said his company would even consider hiring candidates first and then let them do the military internship “as it will help us groom our work force in the ethos of the army.” The ToD model is similar to the short-service commission that allows officers to serve the armed forces for 10 to 14 years.If the proposal is accepted, the army could implement the ToD model - essentially an voluntary internship after military training - on a trial basis for both officers and other ranks in a limited number of vacancies.Last week, Mahindra said the ToD exposure would give young people an “added advantage” in their next workplace. In an e-mail to the army, Mahindra said his group would be happy to consider the candidature of ToD optees for corporate jobs.“I definitely think military training will be an added advantage for Tour of Duty Graduates as they enter the workplace. In fact, considering the rigid standards of selection and training in the Indian Army, the Mahindra Group will be happy to consider their candidature,” Mahindra wrote.The ToD proposal, reviewed by Hindustan Times, stressed that the internship model would result in savings for the organisation. It said it will also brighten the prospects of the ToD optees in the corporate world.“The cumulative cost of pre-commission training, pay/allowances, proposed severance packages, leave encashment and other costs is nearly Rs 5.12 crore and Rs 6.83 crore for short-service commissioned (SSC) officers released after 10 and 14 years of service. However, similar costs for those released after three years will be just Rs 80 to Rs 85 lakh,” the proposal stated. It said the ToD model would eventually result in significant reduction in salary and pension budgets, too. The proposal cites a survey that has indicated that corporate houses would prefer employing individuals who have been trained by the military and join them at the age of 26-27 after a three-year ToD rather than college graduates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/game-changer-assocham-on-army-s-3-year-service-proposal-for-civilians/story-dZ6dIjwaigCi92iUFwSXMN.html
21-05-2020||India||Covid latest: Three erroneous positive results lead to bar on Goa’s private lab||The Goa government has suspended the permission it had granted to a private laboratory to collect samples for Covid-19 testing after a string of erroneous results emanated from the lab’s testing centre.The laboratory, which used to collect swab samples and send to its headquarters in Mumbai for testing, was granted permission to collect samples after the Mumbai lab was granted a licence by the ICMR for conducting Covid-19 tests. “Three samples of industrial labourers, which the laboratory reported as positive, have tested negative in the tests conducted at the Government lab, despite being tested twice. So we have temporarily suspended their permission to collect swab samples,” Mohanan said. The laboratory, SRL Diagnostics, was the sole private laboratory in Goa that was permitted to conduct tests. Several industries that brought in their workforce from outside the state had relied on the private laboratory to conduct tests on their employees. For Coronavirus Live Updates“Henceforth, these employees will be tested for coronavirus in the government laboratory,” Mohanan said. The State has so far registered 52 cases, 45 of which are active and are among those who have travelled to the state after restricted movement between borders was allowed. Among the patients detected, only two are symptomatic. With trains and planes set to gradually resume service over the coming weeks, the state is bracing for an increase in positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-latest-three-erroneous-positive-results-lead-to-bar-on-goa-s-private-lab/story-gexfr6bmKjCNv0YTheTWYJ.html
21-05-2020||India||Day before PM Modi’s visit, Odisha says 45 lakh people affected by Amphan||A day after it barely escaped from the full fury of super cyclone Amphan that battered neighbouring West Bengal, Odisha informed the Centre that 45 lakh people in 1,500 villages were affected by the storm.At a meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) which reviewed the situation in the cyclone affected areas of Odisha and West Bengal on Thursday,Odisha chief secretary Asit Tripathy who attended through video-conferencing, told Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba said apart from bringing heavy rain and winds peaking up to 100 km per hour in some coastal areas, there was no loss of lives.“Around 44.8 lakh people in 1,500 grampanchayats were affected by cyclone Amphan,” Tripathy said at the NCMC meeting.Unofficially, three deaths have been reported in Odisha including one of a 2-month-old infant in Bhadrak district due to wall collapse. In Bengal, 72 people were killed by the cyclone.“Nearly two lakh people in Odisha were evacuated from their homes and placed safely in different shelters during the cyclone. A total of 210 medical teams and 75 teams of veterinary doctors have been sent to the affected areas,” Tripathy said, adding that collectors of the affected districts have been asked to submit the cyclone-damage report in two days.Late evening Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office announced that he would carry out aerial surveys of West Bengal and Odisha to assess the damage wreaked by the storm.“My thoughts are with the people of Odisha as the state bravely battles the effects of Cyclone Amphan. Authorities are working on the ground to ensure all possible assistance to the those affected. I pray that the situation normalises at the earliest,” PM Modi had tweeted earlier in the day.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik made an aerial survey of the affected areas of the coastal and its adjoining districts that faced the fury of Amphan.Though Odisha did not see as much damage as Bengal faced, the 100-kmph velocity winds led to uprooting of a large number of trees and flattening of kutcha houses in Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara and Balasore districts. Vehicular movement came to a standstill while power supply snapped due to uprooting of electric poles.Odisha energy minister Dibya Shankar Mishra said over 80 per cent of the 44 lakh consumers would get back power soon.National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) director general SN Pradhan said within 24-48 hours, all roads in the cyclone-hit districts would be cleared.The state government meanwhile showered praises on the India Meteorological Department (IMD) saying its accurate weather forecast caused minimal damage in the state. Thanking IMD’s Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra for accurate predictions, chief secretary Tripathy said the correct forecast of the natural calamity is a great advantage to contain the damage to life and property, “The IMD is valuable in this area and its forecast is getting better with time. “We thank Mohapatra, NDRF DG S N Pradhan and everyone in this valuable national body,” he said.Additional Chief Secretary-cum-Special Relief Commissioner P K Jena too thanked Mohapatra for re-assuring the state government to have complete faith in IMD’s prediction and forecast on cyclone ‘Amphan’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-before-pm-modi-s-visit-odisha-says-45-lakh-people-affected-by-amphan/story-u1z1g4Y4IodLmUQWdSkISM.html

The ministry has also allowed the booking of train tickets through Common Service Centers (CSCs) and agents. “ Opening of all these booking facilities once again will mark an important step in the graded restoration of passenger railway services and making the task of ticket booking easy for all prospective travelers from all parts of India in reserved trains. Zonal railways may adhere to standard social distancing guidelines and observe the hygiene protocols in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” the ministry said.Zonal Railways have been instructed to decide and notify the opening of reservation counters in a phased manner tomorrow along with dissemination of information about their locations and timings as per local needs and conditions.Booking of train tickets will resume at around 1.7 lakh common service centres across the country from Friday onward, union railway minister Piyush Goyal also said on Thursday.Railways will also allow booking at counters across the station soon, he said. This will make the service accessible to those in remote locations. The minister said bookings will also resume at counters at specific railway stations over the next two to three days.“ We will announce resumption of more trains. It is time to take India towards normalcy. We are developing a protocol to identify the stations where counters can be opened. We have to ensure that there are no large crowds gathering at counters to book tickets, so we are studying the situation and devising a protocol towards it,” Goyal said.Goyal was speaking at an interaction with BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on Thursday. Railways on Tuesday announced it will run 200 special passenger trains a day from June 1 and online ticket booking was scheduled to open Thursday.Goyal said within 2.5 hours of opening bookings for the 100 pairs of special trains on Thursday, four lakh passengers had booked tickets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ticket-reservation-counters-at-railway-stations-to-open-from-may-22/story-Dw2W8K2jG2xTJyxG6a2A7L.html
21-05-2020||India||Vande Bharat Mission in phase 3 may rope private airlines, talks on||The third phase of Vande Bharat Mission, India’s massive programme to repatriate nationals stranded across the globe due to the Covid-19 crisis, is expected to involve private airlines to increase the number of flights.The third phase is set to begin after June 13, when the second phase will end. India is bringing back about 32,000 citizens on more than 160 flights from 47 countries during the second phase, which began on May 16.“There will be a third phase of repatriation. The second phase will last till June 13,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told an online news briefing.“We are very receptive to the idea [of involving private airlines] and the ministry of civil aviation is already in discussions with private airlines to see how they can be included under the Vande Bharat Mission so that we can increase the number of flights,” he said.All flights in the first two phases were being operated by state-run Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express. The government has also used air force transport aircraft and naval warships to repatriate nationals from some countries.As of Thursday, a total of 23,475 Indians have been repatriated under Vande Bharat Mission. They include 4,883 workers, 4,196 students and 3,087 professionals.The second phase has included destinations such as Istanbul, Ho Chi Minh City and Lagos, and increased flights to the US and Europe. “We are also looking at developing Frankfurt as a hub [for Europe],” Srivastava said.Several flights from other countries, coming in to evacuate nationals of those countries, have ferried stranded Indians. A flight from Buenos Aires that arrived on Thursday morning carried 62 Indians, while a flight operated by Iran’s Mahaan Air on May 17 carried about 300 Indian pilgrims from Ladakh.Other flights have brought back Indians from Argentina, Djibouti, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Peru and South Africa. A special Tunisian military evacuation flight took off from Tunis on Thursday with 25 Indian nationals and it is expected to arrive in New Delhi on Friday morning.A total of 259,001 Indian nationals in 98 countries around the world have registered to return under Vande Bharat Mission. Most of them are workers (28%), students (25%), professionals (14.5%), and short-term visa holders such as tourists (7.6%). Fishermen, deportees and Indian nationals who benefited from visa amnesties have also registered.The government has already said priority will be given to those with compelling reasons for returning, such as loss of jobs, medical emergencies and senior citizens. Among those with compelling reasons who registered to return are 16,991 facing medical emergencies and 8,746 pregnant women and senior citizens. Following a spat between the Central and West Bengal governments over the lack of flights to the state, 169 Indian nationals were repatriated from Dhaka to Kolkata on May 18. Two more Dhaka-Kolkata flights are scheduled for May 27 and June 1, and further flights to West Bengal are planned from Europe, the UK and other destinations.Srivastava said India is also facilitating the travel of foreign nationals on outbound flights under Vande Bharat Mission. Three flights were operated to the UK on May 16, 18 and 20 and two flights to the US on May 18 and 20. Four more flights are scheduled to the US and two to Frankfurt.Wherever possible, passengers have to undergo testing before boarding flights and in a few instances, those who tested positive for Covid-19 weren’t allowed to board. “There is full medical screening and only asymptomatic passengers are allowed on board,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vande-bharat-mission-in-phase-3-may-rope-private-airlines-talks-are-on/story-VFYSpHkboI5l0tAa6jwecK.html
21-05-2020||India||India yet to hear from Pakistan on coordinated response with Iran to control desert locusts||India is yet to hear from Pakistan on a proposal for a coordinated response along with Iran to control the problem of desert locusts, people familiar with developments said on Thursday.Iran has already responded positively to the Indian proposal, which includes an offer to supply pesticides to control locust populations in Sistan-Balochistan and South Khorasan provinces, the people said on condition of anonymity.The proposal was made against the backdrop of reports that swarms of the destructive pests were making their way to Indian states such as Rajasthan after breeding and maturing in Iranian provinces and Pakistan’s Balochistan province.“It remains to be seen if Pakistan will rise above its narrow-minded approach, as was seen in the case of India’s regional initiative for dealing with Covid-19, and come forward to cooperate with India on a coordinated desert locust control operation,” said one of the people cited above.India mooted the coordinated response to control desert locust populations to Iran and Pakistan as part of efforts to further regional cooperation. India had suggested to Pakistan that the two countries could coordinate locust control operations along their border and New Delhi could facilitate the supply of the pesticide Malathion to Islamabad, the people said.“The institutionalised mechanism of the Locust Warning Organization could be energised for such cooperation. These efforts will contribute to mitigate the impact of desert locust not only in the two other countries, but also for India,” said a second person.Pakistan was the last country to pledge a contribution to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) Covid-19 Emergency Fund, which was created at India’s initiative, and it has pushed for the fund to be placed under the Saarc Secretariat.According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), hopper bands of locusts are maturing in the southwestern coastal plains of in Iran, and another generation of breeding is underway in the country’s southeast, where hatching is taking place on the coast and in the interior of Sistan-Baluchistan.In Pakistan, adult groups of locusts are migrating to the Indian border from breeding areas in Balochistan, where hopper groups are present, and from Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces.FAO reports suggest the desert locust population is expected to move from spring breeding areas in Balochistan to summer breeding along the India-Pakistan border. In India, more adult groups and small swarms have arrived from Pakistan in the past few weeks, and moved into Rajasthan, reaching Jodhpur.The agriculture ministry leads India’s efforts in locust control and also spearheads initiatives to foster regional cooperation, the people said.India has an existing institutionalised mechanism with Pakistan for such cooperation, including regular border meetings between locust officers of the two sides. Six border meetings, led by plant protection advisers of India and Pakistan, are held every year from June to November, either at Munabao on the Indian side or Khokhropar on the Pakistani side for exchanging information.Wireless communication is maintained every year during June-November between Jodhpur in India and Karachi in Pakistan for exchange of information.“There is consensus that the desert locusts could pose a grave challenge in 2020. The agriculture ministry has already started efforts to address the issue. In March, minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary participated in a virtual meeting for the southwest Asian region coordinated by FAO to discuss regional cooperation to combat the desert locust problem,” the first person cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-yet-to-hear-from-pakistan-on-coordinated-response-with-iran-to-control-desert-locusts/story-a5QgyhMKPI7TboLTxKsY0J.html

21-05-2020||India||Days after Bengal’s ‘no night curfew’ declaration, MHA asks states to strictly implement guidelines||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Thursday again nudged the states to strictly follow lockdown guidelines, particularly the night curfew - from 7 pm to 7 am – as it is mandated to make sure people observe social distancing to prevent the coronavirus disease from spreading. In his letter to the states, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said the night curfew that prohibits all non-essential activities and movement between 7pm and 7am across the country is an “important element” of the MHA guidelines, which were issued on Sunday for the fourth phase of lockdown, extended till May 31.However, Bhalla said, “it has been brought to the notice of MHA, through media reports and other sources, that there are violations at various places, in the implementation of guidelines”. He asked local authorities to issue orders in the entirety of their jurisdiction for imposition of the night curfew.Bhalla’s letter doesn’t name any particular state, however, it comes three days after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banreeje, while issuing the guidelines for the state, had ruled out the enforcement of the night curfew.“We won’t officially declare night curfew because people are already under a lot of stress. We do not want to increase their suffering. But we will request people not to venture out of their homes between 7 pm and 7 am or else police will take action,” Banerjee had said on Monday. She had said that the word ‘curfew’ had bad connotations and people should not feel suffocated.An MHA official, who did not wish to be named, said the lockdown guidelines were issued after consulting all the states. “If they don’t follow these, then it is a clear violation and the states doing so are putting their people at risk,” the officer said.On Monday, the ministry had reminded all states that they cannot dilute the lockdown guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act.Bhalla, on Thursday, also asked the states to properly delineate the containment zones and take action if the violations are reported in any of the zones – red, orange or green.The national directives, issued along with the guidelines, should also be followed throughout the country, he said. These include – wearing masks, social distancing at work, transport and public places and maintaining hygiene and sanitation etc as they are important to contain the spread of Covid-19 and protecting individuals and community, the letter adds.“I would request all chief secretaries and administrators of union territories to remain vigilant in the fight against Covid-19 and ensure all measures that have either been mandated by MHA, or laid down by the states, are scrupulously adhered to at all levels,” Bhalla added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-after-bengal-s-no-night-curfew-declaration-mha-asks-states-to-strictly-implement-guidelines/story-XYdYXWGpMu4zZX9hsGKYbI.html
21-05-2020||India||Assam begins ‘ruthless quarantine’ as Covid-19 cases double to 204 in 4 days||The Covid-19 tally in Assam doubled in just four days from 100 to 204 on Thursday even as the government announced a policy of ‘Ruthless quarantine, with human heart’ to control spread of the virus infection.Fifteen new Covid-19 cases were detected in the state on Thursday taking the tally to 204 from 100 cases on May 17. Assam recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 31 and it took another 37 days for the figure to reach 50 on May 7. It doubled to reach the 100 figure mark in 10 days on May 17.Health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that every person returning to the state will have to undergo a total 14 days of mandatory facility and home quarantine and the government would spend up to Rs 20,000 per person for their care during that period.With the lifting of the ban on inter-state movement since May 4, over 37,000 people have returned to the state by roads and railways. Out of the 204 cases detected so far, 112 were those who returned to Assam after the inter-state movement started. The state currently has 142 active cases while 55 have recovered and three migrated to other states while four have died.“We have seen a rise in cases recently after the ban on inter-state movement was lifted. The state has now entered a critical phase. This is just the tip of the iceberg as nearly 12 lakh people could return to the state in coming weeks,” Sarma said during a press conference.New quarantine policyFrom now, anyone coming back to the state will have to spend the first 7 days in an institutional quarantine facility and the next 7 days in home quarantine. The earlier policy of paid quarantine has been discarded and now the state will bear the entire cost of the quarantine period.“If we fail to implement quarantine properly, it will lead to community transmission. Hence we have decided to adopt the policy of ‘Ruthless quarantine, with human heart,” said Sarma.There will be no relaxation for the quarantine period and criminal proceedings would be initiated against violators. But at the same time the state would try to give the best possible care to everyone under quarantine.“As per the new policy, district administrations can spend up to Rs 2,000 each per person on hotel rent for their period of 7-day facility quarantine, Rs 500 daily on meals, Rs 500 for medicine and sanitizers etc. and Rs 2000 for their food during home quarantine,” said Sarma.Village level committees will be formed to monitor that once a person goes back from facility quarantine, he/she undergoes 7-days of home quarantine along with all family members.Sarma informed that the community surveillance programme launched by the state had covered 21,489 villages in Assam and found 20,832 cases of people with fever, cough and respiratory problems. Tests conducted on nearly 4,000 of them have come negative for all.“It’s a very good sign that an average of just one person per village is showing such symptoms. This could be due to use of masks and social distancing. It’s a very positive health indicator. More importantly, no one was found positive, which shows there is no community transmission in Assam,” he said.Containment and buffer zonesSarma said that Assam will focus on having containment and buffer zones to control spread of Covid-19 and will do away with declaring entire districts as red, orange or green zones unless there are 200 active cases in one district.“No district will be categorized as a red or orange zone till there are 200 active cases. Instead we would follow a policy of having containment zones where new cases are detected and a buffer zone around them,” he said.“District authorities will determine areas to be declared as containment or buffer zones. No activity will be permitted in containment zones, while there will be some relaxation in buffer zones. This will ensure that people in an entire district are not affected and normal activities can go on,” said Sarma.The minister informed that till Thursday 25 of the state’s 33 districts had recorded Covid-19 cases. Kamrup (Metro) with 37 cases leads the list, followed by Hojai with 23 cases and Kamrup (Rural) with 16 cases.Sarma said the state government has already paid Rs 72.23 cr as financial assistance of Rs 2,000 each to 3.61 lakh people from Assam staying outside, who had registered themselves in the government’s portal. The second installment of Rs 2,000 would be disbursed on Friday and the next installment in June.Similarly, another sum of Rs 25,000 each would be given to patients from the state who had gone outside for treatment of serious illnesses and got stranded due to the lockdown.

The assertiveness of political leadership is lacking and they are scared of taking decisions,” Fadnavis said.  The BJP has accused the Uddhav Thackeray government of failing to increase the number of tests to detect new coronavirus cases, retain migrant workers and provide them with food and other necessities. On Monday, CM Thackeray had urged the locals to take advantage of reverse migration and urged people to be self-reliant by resuming industrial activities. He said local residents should come forward and start working in industrial units to take Maharashtra forward.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesFadnavis,however, said migrant labourers had made a major contribution in the state , especially in the housing industry and there is an apprehension that they may not return anytime soon. “This will have a bad impact on the real estate sector. They will have to bring them back. Each sector is different, will the local labour take their place, I don’t think so,” he said. Fadnavis also blamed the state government for not testing asymptomatic people while pointing out the possibility of community transmissions in Dharavi and Worli and added that 97% of those admitted in hospitals are asymptomatic. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Maharashtra is among the most affected, 31% of all affected people in India are from the state and this number is going up. The state also accounts for 40% of the total deaths in the country,” the former CM said, adding that “strategic errors were made when the lockdown was first announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-lacks-decisive-government-fadnavis/story-uJblq9FBtKctxdrQBir3XL.html
21-05-2020||India||Air fares fixed for next 3 months, Delhi-Mumbai maximum fare Rs 10,000||The Centre has laid down the upper and lower limit of airfares for the airlines to follow over the next three months - till August - as domestic flights resume operations next Monday. Initially, only a third of operations will be allowed.The government has said it is time for India to open up following stringent measures for a nationwide lockdown for over two months.“Because the measures for lockdown were taken very early on in India, we have been able to escape the situation other countries have found themselves in. It is equally important that at some stage you will have to open up. “Two months is a very long period of time. As you have to balance between lives and livelihood, it is time to now open up,” Puri said in a press conference on Thursday.Flights in the domestic circuit will be scaled up gradually and depending upon the situation a decision on international travel will be taken, said the minister. The Centre has put limits on air fares in seven bands as per the flight durations and they would be in place till August 24, Puri said.The minister said the first band, which would have its specific lower and upper limits of air fare, will consist of flights that are of less than 40 minutes duration.Second, third, fourth and fifth bands of upper limit would be flights with durations of 40-60 minutes, 60-90 minutes, 90-120 minutes and 120-150 minutes, he said.The sixth and seventh bands, he added, would consist of flights with durations between 150-180 minutes and 180-210 minutes..According to the ministry’s order, for operations from metro to metro cities, the airlines will be allowed to run flights on one third capacity of the approved schedule. The metro cities refer to Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Airlines have been directed to submit their revised domestic schedule to the Centre.For operations from metro to non-metro cities and vice versa, where the weekly departures are less than 100 flights, airlines are free to operate any routes of the one third capacity of the approved summer schedule, the order stated, adding that for all other cities, airlines are free to operate any routes of the one third capacity of the approved summer schedule.“Earlier the air carriers could put its range (minimum to maximum) on the website...we have looked at corresponding rail fares. We want air travel to become affordable. We have set a minimum fare, and a maximum fare. For Delhi to Mumbai the minimum fare would be Rs 3,500 and maximum at Rs 10,000. Forty percent of the tickets will be sold at the mid-point of this band. These tickets will be priced at around Rs 6,700,” Puri said.The civil aviation ministry also issued detailed guidelines for both the passengers and airlines to follow inside the airports and planes. The government has advised elderly, pregnant women, and people with health issues to avoid travel. Passengers staying in the containment zone will not be allowed to travel. Also, they should not travel if they have been tested positive for Covid-19, the guidelines said.Those travelling will be required to wear the face mask and have been asked to reach the airport at least two hours before the departure. Only one check-in bag will be allowed and airlines will not provide meal services on board.Passengers have been advised to familiarise themselves about the new procedures at the airport, especially about the norms of social distancing, minimum touch, baggage limitations, filing self declaration forms, registering on Aarogya Setu app, and using digital payments for authorised cabs. The Centre has mandated the use of Aarogya Setu app for domestic air travel while children below the age of 14 have been exempted.“In case of non-availability of Aarogya Setu app, the passenger should be facilitated to go to a counter provided by the airport where Aarogya Setu can be downloaded,” it said.If a passenger does not have the Aarogya Setu app on her or his phone for some reason, she or he can give a self-declaration form, Puri said, adding that such a passenger will not be stopped from boarding the flight.Puri also said passengers taking short distance flights would not need to quarantine upon reaching the destination state. However, according to the ministry’s guidelines on arrival at the destination airport “passengers will have to adhere to such health protocols as prescribed by the destination states/UTs”. The Centre has also allowed flights to operate at full capacity. Puri said it was not possible to keep the middle seat vacant. “This is not an option being followed by any other country as well. We will keep our fingers crossed. We are also running our Vande Bharat Mission flights on full capacity and we have been managing well,” he said. Resuming domestic flight services is seen as yet another step by the government in the direction of a graded exit from the lockdown which has been extended till the end of this month.International flight operations have been suspended since March 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-fares-capped-by-govt-for-3-months-delhi-mumbai-maximum-fare-rs-10-000/story-ZV3A0IO5yxddHfy03RXJhK.html
21-05-2020||India||Rajnath Singh exhorts MSMEs to make India ‘Atma Nirbhar’ in defence tech, products||Acknowledging that defence manufacturing has been adversely affected due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday exhorted MSMEs to make India ‘Atma Nirbhar’ (self-reliant) in defence technology and products.Addressing MSMEs E-conclave via video conferencing, Singh termed micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) the backbone of the Indian economy that accelerate GDP growth, earn valuable foreign exchange through exports and provide employment opportunities.Asserting that keeping MSMEs strong is one of the priorities of the government, he said there are more than 8,000 MSMEs, tiered partners of many defence organisations - ordnance factories, DPSUs and service organisations.They contribute more than 20 per cent of the total production of these organisations, Singh said at the conclave jointly organised by Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Department of Defence Production.Citing the example of the United States where the domestic defence industry developed within a short span of two years during World War-II, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat said India should have its own defence industry. He urged the MSMEs to work for placing India among the top 10 nations in defence technologies.The defence minister hailed the role played by SIDM and other MSMEs in the nation’s fight against global coronavirus pandemic. “I am very happy to know that SIDM has accelerated the manufacturing of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) designed PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) kits, masks, ventilator parts in the field of defence industry by efficient coordination and channelisation,” Singh was quoted as saying in a statement.“Within less than two months, we have not only met our domestic demand, but we can also think of helping neighbouring countries in the coming time,” he said.Acknowledging the hardships faced by the defence industry, Singh said, “The manufacturing sector has been affected the most due to lockdown and disruption in existing supply chains and the defence sector is no exception to this.” “Rather, it can be said that the defence sector is more aggravated than other sectors as the only buyer of defence products is the government,” he said. Singh assured that the ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ campaign, inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will provide many opportunities to Indian industry and will help in restoring millions of jobs. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for being ‘vocal for local’ in this direction. I would like to say that we have to have our indigenous products, i.e. ‘vocal for local’, but before that in our own life, ‘local’ has to be focal. That is, we have to adopt ‘swadeshi’ products in our life,” he said. His comments came days after Prime Minister Modi pitched for making India self-reliant by turning the coronavirus crisis into an opportunity through sustained focus on making the Indian economy globally competitive.There is no doubt that MSMEs have a very important role in the goal of indigenous manufacturing, and in the goal of making India self-reliant, he said. Singh highlighted some of the measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman under the ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ scheme such as collateral free loan of 3 lakh crores for MSMEs - which he said will be effective in re-establishing about 45 lakh units and saving employment. Subordinate debt provision of Rs 20,000 crore has been announced for two lakh MSMEs, this will help stressed MSMEs, Singh said.Equity infusion of Rs 50,000 crore will be provided through ‘Mother-Daughter Fund’ for the purpose of benefiting the needy MSMEs, he said. A Rs 10,000 crore ‘Fund of Funds’ will be set up to help increase the capacity of these units and for marketing, he said.The theme of the E-conclave was ‘Business Continuity for MSMEs in Defence & Aerospace Sector’ in which more than 800 Defence MSMEs participated.Secretary (Defence Production) Raj Kumar, in his address, highlighted the measures taken to alleviate the hardships faced by the defence manufacturing industry due to COVID-19. He said the DPSUs have been asked to clear payments of MSMEs, and also announced that their production targets have not been scaled down. Citing the reforms recently announced by the Finance Minister, he said these measures will help realise the target of achieving a USD 25 billion defence production by 2025. SIDM President Jayant D Patil, former SIDM president Baba N Kalyani, Director General of CII Chandrajit Banerjee, senior civil and military officials of MoD, Ordnance Factory Board and DPSUs were also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-exhorts-msmes-to-make-india-atma-nirbhar-in-defence-tech-products/story-2pzpUGKDqeUPh27G8dDfkO.html
21-05-2020||India||Congress cries foul over ‘selective’ eviction notices during Covid crisis, BJP calls it ‘routine’||Madhya Pradesh Congress on Thursday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state of not sending eviction notices to those ex-ministers, who resigned as legislators and joined BJP in March, while targeting the former ministers who are in Congress and continue to remain legislators.“All the 24 ex-ministers of the then Kamal Nath cabinet who are in Congress have got eviction notices from the directorate of estate which is working under home department despite the fact that the state is facing a tragedy like Corona when shifting of belongings of an ex-minister from one place to another is an arduous task and people involved in the shifting process will be prone to the risk of contracting the virus. This is a clear case of victimisation at the instance of the state government”, said Kunal Chaudhary, sitting Congress MLA.Kunal Chaudhary alleged, “Six ex-ministers had joined the BJP. Two of them became ministers later, hence they are entitled for bungalows but remaining four have ceased to be even legislators as their resignations had been accepted by the speaker of the state assembly. But they didn’t get eviction notices. Sitting MLA and ex-minister Jitu Patwari is occupying D-type bungalow but there are certain BJP legislators who are not ministers but they are occupying B and C type bungalows. Why two yardsticks by government?”Chaudhary asked, “What was the hurry in sealing the bungalow of ex-finance minister Tarun Bhanot when he was not in his house? Was he running away from the state? Is he not a legislator who has right to remain in a government accommodation?”The directorate of estate issued notices dated May 14 to the ex-ministers after home department through its order dated May 13 conveyed to it that allotment of the ex-ministers on the bungalows they were occupying stood cancelled as the occupants were not ministers anymore. The ex-ministers were expected to submit a reply by May 20 as to why a final eviction notice be not issued against them, as per officials of the home department.On March 22 Congress legislators including six ministers had resigned from the state assembly in an act of rebellion against the then chief minister Kamal Nath. They all joined the BJP later. Tulsi Silavat and Govind Singh Rajput were inducted in Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet on its first expansion on April 21, though they are not members of the state assembly. By-polls to the 22 assembly constituencies and two other constituencies are expected to be held in coming months.On Wednesday, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha tweeted, “Shocking action of MP govt. In the midst of corona pandemic authorities issue eviction notices to 24 Cong ex-ministers. In hotspot Bhopal asking ex-ministers to vacat govt residences. @ChouhanShivraj @drnarottammisra personally ensuring. SC/HC bar coercive action in coronatime.”Despite efforts the four ex-ministers who joined the BJP couldn’t be reached for their comments. While mobile phones of Mahendra Singh Sisodia and Pradyumn Tomar were found constantly switched off the two other ex-ministers Prabhuram Chaudhary and Imrati Devi didn’t take phone calls and respond to messages.Home minister Narottam Mishra said, “I have no knowledge if any of the ex-ministers was not given any eviction notice. I will look into it. However, this is all routine administrative process that takes place when there is change in government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-cries-foul-over-selective-eviction-notices-during-covid-crisis-bjp-calls-it-routine/story-WLcKYG9RiaLltPTqA23JMJ.html

The welfare package also included three-month ration supply for free and direct cash transfer to under-privileged women, old age persons and disabled people. Under this scheme, the ministry is providing free of cost liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders to over 80 million Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) beneficiaries for three months with effect from April 1, 2020, the ministry said in a statement.PMUY was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1, 2016 in Ballia (Uttar Pradesh) to provide free cooking gas connections to 50 million poor households. Later the target was raised to 80 million households, which was achieved six months in advance on September 7, 2019. While the number of free refills under PMGKY are be limited to three for beneficiaries using 14.2 kg cylinders up to June, beneficiaries using small refills of 5 kg will be entitled to eight free refills in the three months.State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) had delivered 45.3 million cylinders to PMUY beneficiaries last month, the statement said. “As on 20.5.2020, OMCs have delivered total 679.92 cylinders [67.9 million] to PMUY beneficiaries under the package” it added.The beneficiaries were given funds in advance through direct benefit transfer (DBT) in their accounts, so that there was no difficulty in availing this facility. “The Corona Warriors- personnel working in the supply chain of LPG cylinder delivery- have not only been ensuring timely supply of cylinders, but also creating awareness amongst the beneficiaries about the hygiene and various health guidelines,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-supplied-68-million-free-cooking-gas-cylinders-free-under-pmgky/story-ncfoemAqVSvTJh0TEiH9VL.html

Ibrahim Zubair Mohammad was arrested in 2011 for providing material support to al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki two years earlier.Ibrahim Mohammad was sentenced to five years in jail after he pleaded guilty to his role in the conspiracy, His brother Yahya Mohammad was sentenced to 27 years because he had also hired a hitman to kill a judge presiding over a terror case.A government official told Hindustan Times that Ibrahim Mohammad landed in Amritsar on Wednesday along with other Indian nationals deported from the United States. He has been sent to a quarantine facility for 14 days and will be extensively questioned by Indian security officials to ascertain any possible terror links in India. Sharjah-born Zubar Mohammad graduated in engineering from Osmania University in 2001 and followed his elder brother Yahya Farooq Mohammad to the United States for higher studies. He studied engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign from 2001 through 2005, moved to Toledo in Ohio around 2006 and married.

21-05-2020||India||US pharma firm Gilead Sciences likely to seek nod to market anti-viral drug remdesivir in India||US pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences is likely to apply to India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) soon seeking marketing authorisation for its anti-viral drug remdesivir, which is being considered by many as a potential medication for Covid-19.Officials of the Union Health Ministry, along with the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) held a discussion with the representatives of Gilead Sciences on Wednesday to prepare a road map for introducing remdesivir in India, sources said. “The US-based company is keen on applying for granting of marketing authorization for its drug remdesivir in India. They were apprised about the regulatory procedures for granting of approval to a new drug in the country and were assured of total facilitation. “The company representatives said they will get back after discussion with their board of directors,” an official said.The medicine has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hospitalised Covid-19 patients.   Regulatory approval under exceptional pathway was granted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on May 7, on the basis of clinical data from the US.“On the basis of approvals granted by USFDA or any other reputed regulator, the Indian regulator can approve the drug by waiving off clinical trials in special circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules 2019,” a source in the know of the developments said.The efficacy of remdesivir was discussed in a recent meeting of the joint-monitoring group (technical committee) headed by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and the use of the drug on Covid-19 patients was not approved due to lack of enough scientific evidence at that stage.“In a recent meeting it was decided that since redmdesivir is one among the four treatment protocols that are being evaluated during the randomised controlled clinical trials under WHO’s solidarity trial to find an effective treatment for Covid-19 across several countries, we may wait for its outcome before deciding inclusion of this drug in national treatment protocol,” a source said.The other three treatment protocols are hydroxychloroquine, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, and also combination of lopinavir and ritonavir with interferon beta-1a.Gilead Sciences Inc have entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with pharma firms including three domestic majors Cipla, Jubilant Life Sciences and Hetero for manufacture and distribution of Remdesivir.It has been learnt that these companies will be able to start supplies earliest from July/August even if they are given fast-track approvals in May, the source said.The Health Ministry had earlier written to Gilead Sciences Inc to supply drugs for use on trials for 1,000 patients at AIIMS. But the company on May 12 said the best approach for India to participate in a remdesivir clinical trial is through WHO’s ‘solidarity trial’ being undertaken in multiple countries, including India, in which remdesivir is one of the five drugs being tried.The Indian Council of Medical Research had earlier said anti-viral medication remdesivir which was used during Ebola outbreak may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication and research on its efficacy in the treatment of Covid-19 is a part of the WHO’s ‘solidarity trial.’ According to a recently published study in the New England Journal of Medicine, two out of three critically ill coronavirus patients who were on oxygen support or on ventilators showed signs of improvement when they were administered remdesivir.The New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, provides for certain clauses, according to which the provision of waiver of local phase-III clinical trials of the drug is approved and marketed in certain countries (as notified from time to time) subject to certain conditions and confirming conduct of phase-IV study, a source explained.The phase four study requirement could be reduced in case of drugs of special relevance, in case of unmet need, for rare disease for which drugs are not available or available at a high cost or orphan drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-pharma-firm-gilead-sciences-likely-to-seek-nod-to-market-anti-viral-drug-remdesivir-in-india/story-3MNfVJ9Zzy9OMyTJyOCVIO.html

An online campaign has been launched by the state’s college students to stop the move.Spread over 340 square kilometres, Dibru-Saikhowa is one of the five national parks in the north-east region’s most populous state. The park, which is also a biosphere reserve, is home to 36 mammal species including tiger, Gangetic dolphin, feral horses, etc. and 382 bird species.Concerns about OIL’s drilling plan emerged on social media platforms after the company published an advertisement in newspapers recently citing the MoEFCC’s clearance for the project.OIL reacted to the growing apprehensions and issued a press release on Wednesday, clarifying that it would not operate inside the national park and the drilling would have no ecological impact.“It has been observed that post the publication of the advertisement, certain sections of the stakeholders have expressed their concern assuming that OIL will be operating inside the national park,” the release said.“OIL will not enter the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park area and operations will be conducted through extended reach drilling (ERD) technology. ERD is used to explore for hydrocarbon far from the surface or areas of the reservoir, which are otherwise difficult to access,” it added. “With the use of ERD, wells can be drilled up to a depth of 4km from the existing well plinth without entering the protected area. Through ERD, OIL will reach the target depth of around 3.5km beneath the surface of the national park without carrying out any drilling inside the park,” the release said.“This is a state of the art technology where drilling will take place around 1.5km outside demarcated area of the national park where OIL is already carrying out hydrocarbon exploration for the last 15 years in the Baghjan area,” it said.“OIL once again reiterates that no disturbance to the environment and Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is envisaged due to the use of ERD technology,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-oil-india-s-bid-to-drill-for-hydrocarbons-in-assam-national-park/story-U81IdVut8cAuZwf5Kfo8KL.html

This is a very serious concern,” he said.Pakistan has reactivated at least 20 terror camps and another 20 launch pads along the Line of Control and increased its efforts since October last year to ensure infiltration of as many terrorists as possible into Jammu and Kashmir.The camps and launch pads, with at least 50 terrorists in each, were reactivated after remaining shut for months following the bombing of a CRPF bus in Pulwama in February 2019 and the subsequent retaliatory bombing of terror camps in Balakot by the Indian Air Force.The DGP said 250 to 325 terrorists were waiting on the launchpads to cross over to Jammu and Kashmir, where over 240 terrorists are already operating in hinterlands.On Wednesday, four terrorist associates of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba were arrested in Budgam district and arms and ammunition were seized from them, police said.The police chief also said the burial process of terrorists have been changed to avoid crowds due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The bodies of terrorists are being buried away from crowds,” he said.“We don’t want a large number of the people to unnecessarily gather. That was a serious violation of Covid-19 (protocols), so we revised our drills,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-terror-camps-hit-by-coronavirus-kashmiri-trainees-may-die-of-covid-19-dgp/story-nO0S6luA0Uvxq2e1Iz56eI.html

However officials said the telecom infrastructure is largely intact.The cyclonic storm, which triggered heavy rains and accompanied high-velocity winds gusting up to 190 kmph in coastal areas, made a landfall in the Sunderbans in West Bengal on Wednesday evening. It has weakened significantly since making the landfall and moved to Bangladesh as a cyclonic storm.On Thursday, Chief Secretary Tripathy attended a video conference with Union Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba and informed him about the damage caused by Amphan (Sky).He said the cyclone has affected over 44.80 lakh people in 1,500 gram panchayats, despite the Odisha government evacuating around 2 lakh people from vulnerable areas ahead of the landfall.Tripathy said the restoration work is in underway on a war-footing, particularly in Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Bhadrak and Balasore, and road connectivity is likely to be restored shortly.But it will take a day or two to fully restore the power supply, he said.Revenue Minister Sudam Marndi said about 1 lakh hectares of standing crops have been damaged.District collectors have been asked to send submit initial damage assessment reports in two days and send detailed reports about the extent of damage to agriculture and horticulture after that, he said.Though the cyclone did not directly hit Odisha, it uprooted a large number of trees, electric poles and flattened thatched and mud houses as it hurtled towards West Bengal.Another senior official said electricity supply to 34 lakh consumers, including 1.63 lakh of power distribution company SOUTHCO, 15 lakh of NESCO and 17 lakh of CESU, has been hit. However, electricity was restored in SOUTHCO areas and in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.Special Relief Commissioner P K Jena said disaster response teams and fire department personnel were working to restore road communication on a war footing.Jena said about 90 per cent of telecom towers/infrastructure are intact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-hit-44-8-lakh-people-damaged-power-infrastructure-in-odisha/story-SXfpD1tTHVnWecMwXagZQJ.html
21-05-2020||India||Kerala’s concerns rise after 24 people who returned turn Covid-19 positive||Kerala reported 24 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, all of whom had returned either from foreign countries or other Indian states, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.Fourteen of the 24 had returned from foreign countries and 10 came from other states, he said.Out of a total of 690 cases so far, 177 are active while 510 people have been discharged from hospitals while four have died, Vijayan said, adding that the rising number was a real concern. Kerala, which has maintained good recovery and low mortality rates, is planning to strengthen its surveillance measures following a steady rise in Covid-19 cases.Cases went up sharply in the state with the arrival of expatriates and people stranded in other parts of the country. At least 78,000 have returned to the state by rail, air and road in the last two weeks and more than 90 per cent of the recent cases originated outside.“A big relief is that not a single case was reported due to local transmission. Eight people also recovered today. But the rising number is a big concern and we have to increase our surveillance,” the CM said.Vijayan warned that the state should brace itself for a situation given the rate of increase in new cases. But he reiterated that it was wrong to dub expatriates as super spreaders.With numbers rising the government has asked neibghbourhood watch committees and primary health workers to increase their house-level visits to ensure that returnees are adequately isolated in their homes. The government has received several complaints that people in home quarantine interact with other family members regularly.On Wednesday, Vijayan had made it clear that home quarantine meant room quarantine and those undergoing it will have to be barred from interacting with other family members at home.A senior health official said the state is desperate to contain secondary infections but it was a tightrope walk between “imported cases” and all-out containment strategies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-concerns-rise-after-24-people-who-returned-turn-covid-19-positive/story-PIP059ZhtKcOERLJSxaWiN.html
21-05-2020||India||Defence more aggravated than other sectors amid Covid-19, says Rajnath Singh||Amid Covid-19 lockdown, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said that the defence sector is “more aggravated” than other sectors as the only buyer of Defence products is the government.Acknowledging the hardships faced by the Defence industry, Rajnath Singh said, “Manufacturing sector has been affected the most due to lockdown and disruption in existing supply chains and the defence sector is no exception to this. Rather, it can be said that the Defence sector is more aggravated than other sectors as the only buyer of defence products is the government.”The Minister was addressing, via video conference, MSMEs E-conclave, jointly organised by SIDM, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Department of Defence Production.The Defence Minister appreciated the role played by Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM) and other Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Nation’s fight against global Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.“I am very happy to know that SIDM has accelerated the manufacturing of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) designed PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) kits, masks, ventilator parts in the field of defence industry by efficient coordination and channelisation. Within less than two months, we have not only met our domestic demand, but we can also think of helping neighbouring countries in the coming time,” he said.Singh termed MSMEs backbone of the Indian economy that accelerate GDP growth, earn valuable foreign exchange through exports and provide employment opportunities.“There are more than 8,000 MSMEs, tiered partners of many of our organisations - Ordnance factories, DPSUs and service organisations. They contribute more than 20 per cent of the total production of these organisations,” he said. The Defence Minister assured that the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ campaign, inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will provide many opportunities to Indian industry and will help in restoring millions of jobs.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for being ‘vocal for local’ in this direction. I would like to say that we have to have our indigenous products, ie ‘vocal for local’, but before that in our own life, ‘local’ has to be focal. That is, we have to adopt ‘swadeshi’ products in our life. There is no doubt that MSMEs have a very important role in the goal of indigenous manufacturing, and in the goal of self-reliant India,” he said. He also mentioned some of the measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman under ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ scheme.The theme of the E-conclave was ‘Business Continuity for MSMEs in Defence & Aerospace Sector’ in which more than 800 Defence MSMEs participated.Citing the example of the United States where domestic defence industry developed within a short span of two years during the World War-II, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat said India should have its own defence industry. He urged the MSMEs to work for placing India among the top ten nations in defence technologies.Secretary (Defence Production), Raj Kumar in his address highlighted the measures taken to alleviate the hardships faced by defence manufacturing industry due to Covid-19. He said the DPSUs have been asked to clear payments of MSMEs, and also announced that their production targets have not been scaled down.Citing the reforms recently announced by the Finance Minister, he said these measures will help realise the target of achieving a USD 25 billion defence production by 2025.

The police in Sagar registered an FIR on his complaint.Shivakumar in his letter to Yediryurappa claimed that Praveen Kumar was a BJP activist. “Smt Sonia Gandhiji being an MP and Congress President had tweeted with the intention of forcing the PM to use the Care Fund for the welfare of the people of the country. Unfortunately, this was misinterpreted by the BJP leadership and it instigated Praveen Kumar to file this complaint ...based on false information without examining its truthfulness.”The KPCC President also went onto claim that the FIR against Sonia Gandhi was a blatant misuse of the process of law with an intention to snub the right to healthy criticism and demanded that the it be withdrawn and the police officer concerned be suspended.The state government has not yet reacted to Shivakumar’s letter.The complainant Praveen Kumar acknowledged that he is a BJP member.“Yes it is true I am a primary member of BJP but I have no official party position. I have been an advocate for 14 years and have always fought against lies and injustice which is the reason why I lodged the complaint and I am happy the police have found some merit in it because an FIR has been registered.” Efforts to reach Sagar police for comments were not successful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/withdraw-fir-against-sonia-gandhi-d-k-shivakumar-tells-b-s-yediyurappa/story-byVYIk418hBFH3ZTad3KPP.html
21-05-2020||India||Rajasthan: Migrants not paid wages since lockdown started, reveal findings||The findings of the labour organisations and district legal service authorities (DLSAs) in Rajasthan have revealed that 90% of labourers have not been paid their wages since lockdown restrictions were enforced in the desert state in mid-March to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Labourers have been denied their wages, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal in a pre-nationwide lockdown address to the public on March 20.The common findings of DLSA Bikaner, Jodhpur, Ajmer, Jaipur rural, Sirohi, Baran, Alwar and Udaipur, which HT has seen, reveal that most of the labourers are facing a massive cash crunch.Rajasthan state legal service authority (SLSA), secretary, Ashok Jain, said that on March 28 all the DLSAs were instructed to help stranded migrants. On May 14, they were instructed to investigate whether migrant workers received the relief provided by the state government, he added.“Shelter, food and home are covered under Article 21 of the Constitution. There’re reports that the labourers have been badly hit, despite the state government’s efforts. In a bid to assess the ground reality, investigations are being carried out across the state,” said Jain.A senior state government official said around four lakh stranded labourers, who came back to their native places, are finding it difficult to get any employment amid the pandemic.Harkesh Bugaliya, general secretary, Rajasthan Nirman Evam General Workers’ Union, said around 2.5 lakh workers are desperately looking for an alternate source of income in Jaipur alone, as they have run of money since the lockdown started.“Labourers in Jaipur waited for 15 days and hoped to get paid at least a part of their wages. But they got nothing,” Bugaliya said.Rajesh Yagyesh, president, Bandhua Mukti Morcha, said around eight lakh labourers are living in Alwar, a major industrial corridor for Rajasthan and also neighbouring Haryana and Delhi.“The owners of factories, mines and industries in Alwar paid these labourers their wages for March and told them to leave, as they cannot afford to pay them anymore because of the losses suffered due to lockdown restrictions,” said Yagyesh.He said the humanitarian crisis involving the migrant labourers could have been averted had the central government given a prior notice of three-four days instead of only four hours before enforcing the nationwide lockdown restrictions from March 25.Rana Sengupta, chief executive of the Jodhpur-based non-profit Mine Labour Protection Campaign, said that though there are boards to safeguard the interests of construction workers, the mining sector has no such mechanism. “The labourers in the mining sector are paid wages every fortnight. In Rajasthan, the lockdown was imposed on March 15 and because of which around 30 lakh labourers, who are engaged in the mining sectors, have not been paid their wages since then,” Sengupta said.Niraj K Pawan, secretary, labour, employment, skill and entrepreneurship, said though there have been complaints that labourers have not been paid their April wages, all dues were cleared before the lockdown was imposed.“We accept that there are issues, but we’re trying to resolve them at the earliest,” said Pawan.State chief minister Ashok Gehlot had also directed officials a few days ago to set up an online employment exchange for labourers to help them get jobs during the lockdown. The CM had said that the exchange would meet industries’ requirements by providing manpower and had ordered an online mapping of both domestic and outstation workers, including those engaged in the realty sector.He had held a review meeting of the labour department and advocated the growing need to support the labourers in their hour of crisis.“The need of the hour is new projects of skill development in a bid to retool the labourers in line with the emerging trends,” Gehlot had said.Pankaj Meena, a state spokesperson for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), defended the central government’s bid to impose nationwide lockdown restrictions.“Our PM has announced relief packages for the unorganised sector,” Meena said.Archana Sharma, a state spokesperson, Congress, said though the financial condition of some industries are good, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are badly hit because of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). “Labourers should be paid their wages on humanitarian ground,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-migrants-not-paid-wages-since-lockdown-started-reveal-findings/story-S7XVfBsBa1OKJjjdlmzJaJ.html

The West Bengal government has announced Rs 2 lakh compensation for the next of kin of those killed in the devastation unleashed by the super cyclone, reported PTI.Mamata Banerjee also invited prime minister Narendra Modi to visit Bengal to witness the scale of destruction caused by the cyclone.“I would request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come and visit Cyclone Amphan-affected areas,” Banerjee was quoted as saying by PTI.Earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured that the country stands in solidarity with the state of West Bengal in this hour of grief. He added that the centre was making all efforts to help normalize the situation.“Have been seeing visuals from West Bengal on the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan. In this challenging hour, the entire nation stands in solidarity with West Bengal. Praying for the well-being of the people of the state. Efforts are on to ensure normalcy, Prime Minister had said in a tweet. Have been seeing visuals from West Bengal on the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan. In this challenging hour, the entire nation stands in solidarity with West Bengal. Praying for the well-being of the people of the state. Efforts are on to ensure normalcy.Similar assurance of cooperation was offered by home minister Amit Shah who said the centre was closely monitoring the situation while promising all possible help.The death toll has been revised by the state after it initially reported the loss of around 12 lives in the mayhem caused by the cyclone, one of the strongest to have hit Bengal in the recent memory. CM Mamata Banerjee is meeting with the state task force to make a preliminary assessment of the damage. She had earlier said that it would take at least three to four days to completely assess the destruction caused as several areas in the state are totally cut off.The storm began its landfall at 2:30 pm on Wednesday with sustained wind speeds of 155-165 kmph spiralling up to 185 kmph, causing widespread damage to people, cultivation and structures.The cylone has now crossed Bengal and is stationed over Bangladesh, however, it is expected to cause mild to heavy rains in the northeastern states of the country.The cabinet secretary held a meeting of National Crisis Management Committee to review the post-cyclone situation on Thursday. Chief secretaries of West Bengal and Odisha were present. The NCMC decided to send additional teams of the NDRF to Bengal for restoration and relief work.The Director General of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) said that soon after Cyclone Amphan hit the state of Bengal, NDRF teams fanned out and started rescue work in the eveningHe added that the situation in Odisha was under control and there was hope that life in the state will be back to normal in 24 - 48 hours.Cyclone Amphan also caused destruction and loss of at least three lives in Odisha as it brushed past the state to make a landfall between coastal West Bengal and Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-latest-72-dead-in-west-bengal-additional-ndrf-teams-being-sent/story-QAo3bk4i1NcFzInS3aXu2O.html
21-05-2020||India||Heat wave in northwest, central and south India as Cyclone Amphan exits||Most parts of the country will experience the indirect impact of Super Cyclone Amphan, which weakened into a deep depression on Thursday and sent the maximum summer temperatures soaring. India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday said there will be a two-four degrees Celsius rise in maximum temperature over northwest, central and west India in the next to three days.IMD has warned of a heatwave over Rajasthan between Thursday and Monday; western Madhya Pradesh (MP), Vidarbha, and Telangana from Thursday and Sunday; over coastal Andhra Pradesh, north interior Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal from Thursday to Saturday, over east Madhya Pradesh and Rayalseema and over Uttar Pradesh (UP) from Friday to Sunday.A feeble Western Disturbance is expected to impact Western Himalayas on Friday, which is likely to bring rain and thundershowers to Jammu and Kashmir; Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and light thundershowers to Haryana, Punjab, and Delhi but maximum temperatures are likely to rise even in the northern plains, IMD scientists said.In May, the maximum temperature Delhi recorded was on May 10 at 40.9 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal.According to Skymet Weather, “heatwave conditions are likely over Delhi and Haryana also after two to three days.”“There are two important factors — one is there is no clouding. There are clear skies almost all over the country except where the cyclone or depression is. The other reason is there is advection, wind patterns have changed after the cyclone. Hot, dry north-westerly winds are blowing even over peninsular India, which makes conditions favourable for heatwaves. Eastern MP, Rajasthan, UP, parts of peninsular India are all likely to develop heatwave like conditions now. There is no major weather system that can cause clouding. The impact of western disturbances will also gradually reduce now leading to higher temperatures in northwest India including Delhi,” said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre.The highest temperatures recorded on May 20 were in Barmer in west Rajasthan and Akola in Vidarbha at 44.2 degrees Celsius. There are two criteria for the recording of heatwaves—when the maximum temperature is at least 40 degrees Celsius and departure from normal is 4.5 degrees Celsius to 6.4 degrees Celsius. A heatwave is also declared when the maximum temperature is over 45 degrees Celsius for two stations in a sub-division for two days.“Because of cyclone Amphan, all the moisture is concentrated around it while dry, north-westerly winds are blowing over the rest of the country which causes temperatures to peak gradually,” said Sunita Devi, who is in-charge of cyclones at IMD.Not just the rest of May but even June could be very hot in many parts of the country. “If there is no western disturbance, north-west India will be hot even in June. Hot winds from desert regions will heat up the region as wind patterns have changed after Amphan,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune.Amphan led to an early onset of the southwest monsoon over the Andaman and Nicobar islands last Sunday where the low pressure before the formation of the super cyclone made conditions favourable for monsoon advancement. The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Car Nicobar. It is likely to make an onset over Kerala on June 5, a delay of four days compared to the normal onset date of June 1. “After a cyclone passes, the atmosphere is disturbed. It takes time to come back to normal. Monsoon advancement can begin normally only when normal atmospheric and wind conditions are restored. The westerly hot winds also impact most parts of the country,” said M Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heat-wave-in-northwest-central-and-south-india-as-cyclone-amphan-exits/story-mrULcjv11dfTWl2my43vMO.html
21-05-2020||India||China creating hindrance in patrolling along Line of Actual Control, says govt||India on Thursday strongly refuted China’s contention that tensions in the Ladakh and Sikkim sectors were triggered by Indian troops crossing the Line of Actual Control (LAC), even as it accused Chinese forces of hindering patrols on the Indian side.The Indian side said it is committed to peace and tranquillity along the border, but will take all steps to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and security. The remarks by external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava came against the backdrop of continuing tensions along the LAC, especially in Galwan Valley of Ladakh, where both sides have deployed additional troops.New Delhi’s first official reaction to the tensions came a day after India was strongly supported by the US, with top American diplomat Alice Wells saying such disputes are a “reminder of the threat posed by China”.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reiterated that Indian troops had trespassed across the LAC and dismissed Wells’ remarks as “just nonsense”. India should work with China and “refrain from unilateral actions” that complicate the situation, he said.Also Watch | Covid update: India’s flights to resume; Nepal PM’s remark; China shows new signs China’s foreign ministry side had first accused Indian troops of trespassing across the LAC in a statement to Hindustan Times on Tuesday, saying Beijing had to take “necessary countermeasures” after the Indian side allegedly obstructed normal patrols by Chinese troops.Asked about China’s position on the stand-off in Ladakh, external affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava told an online news briefing: “Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across the LAC in the western [Ladakh] sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate.”Srivastava added: “All Indian activities are entirely on the Indian side of the LAC. In fact, it is [the] Chinese side that has recently undertaken activity hindering India’s normal patrolling patterns.”Indian troops, he said, “scrupulously” abide by the alignment of the LAC and all Indian activities “are entirely on the Indian side of the LAC”. The Indian side has a “very responsible approach towards border management”, and is “deeply committed to ensuring India’s sovereignty and security”, he added.Indian troops strictly follow procedures in bilateral agreements and protocols to resolve situations arising from differences in perception of the LAC, Srivastava said. “The two sides have established mechanisms to resolve such situations peacefully through dialogue. Both sides remain engaged with each other to address any immediate issues,” he said.In line with the consensus reached during the second India-China informal summit in Mamallapuram last year, the Indian side is firmly committed to the common objective of maintaining peace and tranquillity on the border, and this is an “essential prerequisite to the further development of...bilateral relations”, Srivastava said.During an online briefing for journalists on Wednesday, Alice Wells, the outgoing head of the US state department’s South and Central Asian bureau, had said the border tensions were a reminder that “Chinese aggression is not always rhetorical”, and China’s “provocations and disturbing behaviour” raised questions about how Beijing seeks to use its growing power.Responding to her remarks at a regular news briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao said: “The [US] diplomat’s remarks are just nonsense. China’s position on the China-India boundary issue is consistent and clear. China’s border troops firmly safeguard China’s territorial sovereignty and security and firmly dealt with the Indian side’s cross-over and infringement activities.”Zhao added, “We urge the Indian side to work together with us, abide by our leadership’s important consensus, comply with the agreements signed, refrain from unilateral actions complicating the situation.”He further said, “We hope they will make concrete efforts for peace and tranquillity in the border region. There are consultations and diplomatic channels between the two sides that have nothing to do with the US.”Earlier this month, Indian and Chinese troops were involved in clashes in the Sikkim and Ladakh sectors that left several soldiers on both sides injured. The clashes were resolved at the level of local commanders, but both sides rushed in hundreds of soldiers as reinforcements, especially in Galwan Valley.Reports have suggested that the Chinese side deployed troops and heavy equipment that were involved in an exercise to beef up positions in the Ladakh sector. China’s state-run media has described the latest tensions as the worst since the 2017 Doklam stand-off, which lasted 73 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-side-creating-hindrance-in-regular-patrolling-by-india-along-the-line-of-actual-control-says-mea-spokesperson/story-c8dox2GtJufrHHiLjbXOvM.html

The presence of the jumbos has raised alarm bells about their safety as goods and Shramik special trains ferrying migrants pass through this stretch.According to the forest department and Rajaji Tiger Reserve officials, as well as railway train loco pilots, herds of elephants have been spotted on the Haridwar-Dehradun railway track that passes through dense forest terrain.Even local people who go for morning walk on Motichur-Raiwala line stretch and Gujjars who graze their cattle and goats in this area have reportedly spotted elephant movements frequently in the past few weeks.Taking these incidents seriously, forest and park authorities have decided to take measures to ensure the safety of elephants and avoid collisions with trains.“Constant monitoring is being done of the elephants on the railway track area with special patrolling teams deployed to monitor the movement of the wild animals on railway track,” said wildlife warden Komal Singh.The railway department has also been informed about the movement of wild animals and asked to give a full timetable of the trains scheduled to pass through this stretch, whether they be goods trains or Shramik trains.“Jumbo movement has already increased since the lockdown post March 22 as rail and road traffic were restricted along with human activities. The Motichur-Raiwlala stretch is an elephant corridor so they are often seen on this stretch. Owing to fewer trains plying on this track during the lockdown elephants have been roaming freely in this area which has led to local people spotting them several times in recent times,” said Dr Ritesh Joshi, a wildlife scientist.Uday Ram Semwal, a local resident said that in the early morning hours or during dusk, elephants herd can be seen on this stretch of forest terrain.The Rajaji Tiger Reserve is also contemplating on installing radio collar on elephants so that their movement can be monitored.A park range official on condition of anonymity said that this project is in its initial phase for which sensitive locations like Bilkeshwar, BHEL, Tibdi bypass, Matri Sadan, Jagjeetpur, Ajeetpur, Panjanhedi, Missirpura, Jeopata, Katarpur, Bishanpur Kundi, Shyampur, Chidiyapur, Rasiyabad and other areas where jumbo movement is more are being earmarked.Wildlife experts pointed out that till the monsoonal arrives, more wild animals will stray out of the forest in search of water towards residential colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-deploys-special-patrols-to-save-jumbos-from-collision-with-trains/story-6dIqj9fm5XdyzZ6Jkeo9eJ.html
21-05-2020||India||Lockdown implementation effective in keeping Covid numbers low: Health ministry||The Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) on Wednesday issued a statement and defended the nationwide lockdown restrictions enforced on March 25 in a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, “as the period has been gainfully utilised to ramp up the health infrastructure in the country”.The ministry was responding to reports that claimed that lockdown has been largely ineffective.“This is not correct to say. The idea was to work towards improving healthcare services in a bid to ensure that all those who need treatment get it in time,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymityBoth Central and state governments have earmarked 3,027 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and health centres along with 7,013 Covid-19 care centres across the country.In all the dedicated health facilities together there are 2.81 lakh isolation beds, 31,250 intensive care unit beds, and 11,387 oxygen- supported beds.“India has managed to put up a better fight against Covid-19, as compared to many other developed and developing countries. Of the one-lakh cases, we have sent a significant number (over 40,000) home after treatment, and most of the remaining 60,000 people are also on road to recovery. As far as Covid-19-related deaths are concerned, India has managed to keep the mortality rate also low, as compared to other countries. We’re doing fine,” said Union health minister, Harsh Vardhan, during an event on reaching 10 million Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries. The Centre has supplied 65 lakh personal protection equipment (PPE) coveralls, and 101.07 lakh N-95 masks to the states. From importing most of the PPE components, India has successfully identified domestic manufacturers and is producing nearly three lakh PPE coveralls and an equal number of N-95 masks in the country.“This is a remarkable achievement. It was made possible because the government had time to prepare for an infrastructure upgrade. The country is fully prepared to manage the situation if the cases were to surge. We are comfortably placed at the moment. There is no need to panic,” said the ministry official. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) constituted a National Task Force that has held 20 meetings since mid-March and is responsible for taking scientific and technical decisions in managing the viral outbreak.“A well-coordinated approach has been adopted to activate the scientific community of the country, who are contributing by working round the clock to develop new testing kits, protective equipment, respiratory devices, etc. This approach has helped in providing a common platform for sharing of best practices, a collaboration of work, development of need-based innovations, and in avoiding duplication of research work,” said the ministry in a statement.“With the help of institutions under the department of science and technology (DST) and sister ministries, DST is taking the lead in coordinating the effort to map and upscale appropriate technologies in India for addressing a plethora of issues related to Covid-19. The department of biotechnology and its public sector unit (PSU), Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) has announced a Covid-19 research consortium call to support diagnostics, vaccines, novel therapeutics, repurposing of drugs or any other intervention for control of Covid-19,” it added.Experts also agree that India’s low numbers are because of the preventive steps taken at an initial stage when the viral outbreak was reported.“The lockdown was supposed to buy us time, which it has managed to do. Now, we need to consolidate the gains. People will need to incorporate the behavioural changes for good such as avoid attending mass gatherings, wearing masks, maintaining hygiene, following cough etiquettes, staying at home if feeling unwell etc.,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of department, community medicine, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-implementation-effective-in-keeping-covid-numbers-low-health-ministry/story-aPh1r7ZOum6dOF7dKky9ZP.html

21-05-2020||India||‘Just nonsense’: China disses US official for dart over Sino-India border tension||China on Thursday said it was “just nonsense” that the US was weighing in on the recent Sino-India border tension, adding that its soldiers were within its rights to deal with what Beijing claimed, were boundary infringements by India troops..The Chinese foreign ministry said there were established communication channels between India and China and the USA should steer clear.The angry remark was directed at Alice G. Wells, an Asia-focussed US diplomat, who had cited tension at some places in Sikkim and Ladakh over the last few days that she said, signalled China’s “provocations and disturbing behaviour”.Indian and Chinese border troops have been involved in standoffs earlier this month near the Sikkim and Ladakh borders, part of the long boundary dispute involving the two neighbours.Alice G. Wells, the outgoing head of the US state department’s South and Central Asia bureau, had referenced these reports.“This is a reminder that Chinese aggression is not always rhetorical and whether it’s in the South China Sea or whether it’s along the border with India, we continue to see provocations and disturbing behaviour by China that raises questions about how China seeks to use its growing power,” the US official had said.Wells’ remarks were picked up by the Chinese foreign ministry for censure on Thursday. In the process, spokesperson Zhao Lijian also repeated that it was the Indian side that had trespassed.“The (US) diplomat’s remarks are just nonsense. China’s position on the China-India boundary issue is consistent and clear. China’s border troops (were) firmly safeguard China’s territorial sovereignty and security and firmly dealt with the Indian side’s cross over and infringement activities,” Zhao said on Thursday at the regular ministry briefing.Chinese troops, he said, “firmly” safeguard the peace and stability in the border region.“We urge the Indian side to work together with us, abide by our leadership’s important consensus, comply with the agreements signed, refrain from unilateral actions complicating the situation,” the spokesperson said.“We hope they will make concrete efforts for peace and tranquility in the border region. There are consultations and diplomatic channels between the two sides that have nothing to do with the USA,” Zhao added.In the Galwan Valley region of the Ladakh sector, China’s People’s Liberation Army had brought in reinforcements, pitched close to 100 tents and erected temporary positions as part of efforts to establish a presence there. The Indian side had responded by raising the presence of its soldiers.The latest rounds of face-off between Indian and Chinese border troops were seemingly resolved at the level of the local commanders, and were not allowed to escalate.But analysts have indicated that there may be more such incidents, particularly since both sides are expected to build more infrastructure and facilities and fortify or repair existing ones along the long border in summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-nonsense-china-disses-us-official-for-dart-over-sino-india-border-tension/story-Qso1PSmlyDfL67gg4EwKsK.html

They will no longer be at the mercy of middlemen who made profits while the farmers took home a pittance,” he said.Even as farmers’ groups associated with the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh complained of having to sell their produce at much lower rates and tonnes of milk being discarded in the absence of demand, Patel said the Mandi act amendment will boost income since the farmers now have the option of selling their produce at higher rates.“Farmers can even set up their own private mandis, warehouses and cold storages. With one licence they will be able to sell wherever they want. We have also bought milk from the farmers and made powder worth crores that will be sold once all restrictions are lifted,” the minister said.To a question on whether the government has addressed concerns of farmers who were opposed to the limits set for the purchase at mandis, he said efforts are underway to see that the interest of the farmers with smaller holdings are as protected as those of bigger farmers.He also ruled out that the agri-sector will face labour shortage as migrant workers from UP, Bihar and Jharkhand are heading back to their native places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saved-from-starvation-mp-minister-hails-farmers-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-7AQErwRk3Nhg8HwzGlykAO.html

21-05-2020||India||Odisha govt thanks IMD chief for accurate forecast of Cyclone Amphan||The Odisha government on Thursday showered praises on the India Meteorological Department (IMD), saying weather forecast is getting better with time, a day after cyclone ‘Amphan’ rolled past its coast causing minimal damage in the state. The government thanked IMD’s Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra for accurate predictions. The IMD’s predictions on the cyclone’s trajectory, wind speed as well as its character in sea and impact were “to the point” and “accurate” which helped the state in making required preparation to face the calamity, Odisha’s Chief Secretary A K Tripathy said.Also Watch | Cyclone Amphan leaves trail of destruction in Odisha & West Bengal  Stating that accurate forecast of the natural calamity is a great weapon to contain the damage to life and property, Tripathy said, “The IMD is valuable in this area and its forecast is getting better with time.” “We thank Mohapatra, the DG, and everyone in this valuable national body,” Tripathy told PTI. Odisha’s Additional Chief Secretary-cum-Special Relief Commissioner P K Jena, the officer responsible for the management of the cyclone, also acknowledged Mohapatra’s efforts. “I especially thank Mrutyunjay Mohapatra who time and again re-assured us to have complete faith in his prediction and forecast on cyclone ‘Amphan’,” he said. Noting that the Odisha administration was on its toes after getting information that a super cyclone was being formed in the Bay of Bengal, Jena said, “It was a sleepless night on Tuesday for all of us. Though IMD had given a clear picture, still we were apprehensive.” The SRC said he along with many others worked overnight monitoring the cyclone, which had gradually weakened into an extremely severe cyclonic storm in the sea. However, everyone was anxious about its movement and apprehensive whether the system would tilt towards the Odisha coast, he said. “My apprehensions were compounded when I received several telephone calls from different people that the cyclone may take a turn towards the Odisha coast instead of moving ahead on the trajectory shown by the IMD,” he said. Jena said he got anxious after Rohit Shukla, IMD’s Radar Centre in-charge at Paradip, told him that the system was taking a turn. “This information actually disturbed me further. The picture of the 1999 super cyclone came to my mind. Unable to resist my fear, I called up Mohapatra thrice between 3 am and 5 am on Wednesday morning to further verify whether the system will not change its path. He (Mohapatra) told me not to worry, the system will move exactly the path drawn by the IMD,” Jena said. Mohapatra assured the state government that the cyclone might tilt further into the sea and not towards the Odisha coast. “Finally, I stopped thinking in a negative way when Mohapatra said that the IMD has a special relationship with the Bay of Bengal and is well acquainted with its nature and character in the sea,” Jena said. After the cyclone went past several coastal districts, Jena said, “We found that IMD’s prediction was not only accurate, but exact. The impact was felt in specific blocks of certain districts as told by Mohapatra.” Happy over the IMD’s model, SRC Jena said that Mohapatra, also referred as the “cyclone man” of India, had made accurate predictions on ferocious cyclonic storms like Fani in 2019 and Phailin in 2013. The IMD had informed the state government that the wind speed at Paradip and Dhamara coast would be at around 135 kmph, he said. “We were prepared for the wind speed of 140 kmph. But actually it was within 110 kmph, which was a great relief for all of us,” Jena said. Mohapatra, who hails from Odisha’s cyclone-prone Bhadrak district, said the models used by the IMD were more accurate than others. “We had already predicted about the cyclone on May 13 and it took exactly the same trajectory and path as forecast by the IMD,” he told PTI. Apart from Mohapatra, NDRF DG S N Pradhan also swung into action as teams of the disaster response force were sent to Odisha and West Bengal for rescue and restoration operation. The SRC also thanked H R Biswas, the director of the Meteorological Centre in Bhubaneswar. Biswas is an eminent weather scientist and an expert in predicting volume of rainfall during cyclones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-thanks-imd-chief-for-accurate-forecast-of-cyclone-amphan/story-afbVMgt8fh1eLnfXMFNZGM.html

21-05-2020||India||The iftaar that never happened: BSF jawans were killed while buying bread||It was minutes before iftaar when terrorists on a motorcycle drove past a bakery in a busy market area firing bullets, instantly killing BSF constables Jia-ul-Haq and Rana Mondal while they were buying bread to break their Ramzan fast, officials said on Thursday.The attack took place on Wednesday evening, just days before Eid, in Soura on the outskirts of Srinagar. The Resistance Front (TRF), a shadow outfit of the Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility for the attack.  The terrorists pumped bullets into the two troopers at close range before disappearing into the bylanes of the congested locality, officials said. Haq and Mondal are from Murshidabad in West Bengal but their bodies can’t be sent back home because airports in the state are closed due to the havoc wreaked by Cyclone Amphan, officials said.Both Haq, 34, and Mondal, 29, received serious head injuries. The two friends from the 37th battalion of the BSF were posted in the Pandach camp, tasked with keeping a watch on the entry and exit to Srinagar from neighbouring Ganderbal district.      Recapping the events of the day, officials said Mondal and Haq were just minutes away from breaking their fast.But that never happened.They left the world without having a drop of water at the end of a long day of fasting, troopers in the 37th battalion BSF said, mourning the death of their two colleagues who went too soon.Haq, who joined the BSF in 2009, is survived by his parents, wife Nafsina Khatun and two daughters, four-year-old Zeshlin Jiul who is deaf mute, and Jennifer Jiul who is just six months old. He lived in Rezinagar, about 30 km from Murshidabad town. Mondal also leaves behind a six-month-old daughter as well as his parents and wife Jeshmin Khatun.He lived in Sahebrampur in Murshidabad   Both men had been posted in Kashmir since August 5 last year, when the Centre announced its decision to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 and to bifurcate it into the union territories of Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir. Eid will be celebrated on May 24 or 25, depending on the sighting of the moon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-iftaar-that-never-happened-bsf-jawans-were-killed-while-buying-bread/story-vkLvHsvAiNXb94qH2uIueI.html

21-05-2020||India||Ranthambore tiger reserve has 18-35 caracals, says Rajasthan forest dept||Rajasthan’s Ranthambore tiger reserve has 18 to 35 caracals aka Siyagosh, a secretive wild cat, according to a report by the state’s forest department.The Indian caracal is an endangered animal and listed as a schedule-I species in the Wildlife Act, 1972. The caracal is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and India. It has a slender build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears and long canine teeth.The report on status of species by Manoj Parashar, Field Director, Ranthambore Tiger Reserve states that the species earlier was found in drier parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kutch but its habitation has now shrunk to parts of Rajasthan (Ranthambore tiger reserve) and Kutch in Gujarat.Only few records of the species have been reported annually, mainly in the Ranthambore landscape though it was also found in Sariska until recently. The decline in its population and distribution in India is a matter of concern.Parashar said caracals were tamed and used for hunting in ancient Egypt. In India caracals and cheetahs were tamed and trained for hunting small and large game respectively. In India caracal is known as “Siyagosh”. “The main threat to the species is the loss of habitat although there have been reports of retaliatory killing of the species by shepherds in Rajasthan as they are known to kill lambs and kids,” Parashar said.Typically nocturnal, the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe. It is territorial, and lives mainly alone or in pairs. The caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon small mammals, birds, and rodents. “In Ranthambore tiger reserve seven species of wild cats are found, of which the caracal is the rarest and least known in terms of status and ecology,” states Parashar.The phase – IV monitoring in Ranthambore was conducted from January to April this year during which some of them were camera trapped.Parashar said there has been no proper attempt to estimate the abundance of caracals in any area. “It was decided that we will process our camera trap capture data to initiate some population estimation exercise and arrive at an estimate of individuals present in the area. Due to the presence of tigers outside the tiger reserve especially in Dholpur, Karauli and Bundi, camera trap data of these areas could also be included in this exercise,” he said.Based on the data from all the different camera trap stations, it was concluded that there were at least 18 different individuals and the population could range from 18 to 35 individuals.The forest department predicts that a sizeable population of caracals could be present in the adjoining forest areas of Karauli, Dholpur and Bundi as well as in the ravines of the National Gharial Sanctuary along the Chambal River.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ranthambore-tiger-reserve-has-18-35-caracals-says-rajasthan-forest-dept/story-lTvoBIgUYdhegD5tosuFYP.html

In the last two weeks, more than 1,100 new cases have been recorded in the state taking the tally to 6,146.Of these, 2,574 are active cases while 3,422 patients have recovered and 150 have died.Rajasthan was showing a decline in the number of active cases and the number of new infections were also coming down but the influx of migrants has sent it spiralling upwards and put pressure on the state’s health infrastructure, especially in rural areas, which were so far largely untouched by the disease.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has acknowledged that preventing the spread of the virus in rural areas as migrants return will be a challenge for the government.Health minister Raghu Sharma has said the government’s priority is quarantine and all those returning to the state will have to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine.“Total focus of the health department is now on strengthening quarantine facilities. The migrants have to undergo the 14-day quarantine period compulsorily so that people in the state, who have been in lockdown and kept safe, do not get infected,” he said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAccording to the health department, the number of active cases in the state on April 21 was 1,435. On April 30, this figure went up to 1,633. On May 1, there was a drop in active cases to 1,488. It continued to decrease till May 7 when the number of cases stood at 1,439. Since then the graph of active cases has shown a continual rise.Dr Ravi Prakash Sharma, additional director, rural health, said active cases refer to those patients who have excess viral load and are infected with the virus.“The rise in active cases can be attributed to the migrants who are returning home in large numbers as well as the aggressive sampling being done to identify positive cases,” he said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19He said the increase in cases is not a matter of concern as most cases are mildly infective and will get cured by themselves and do not need hospitalisation.Nine districts with the highest migrant influx have reported the highest number of new cases. They are Barmer, Bhilwara, Churu, Dungarpur, Jalore, Pali, Rajsamand, Sikar and Sirohi.In the beginning of May, several of these districts were on the verge of becoming corona-free with a majority of patients having recovered. But since then, they have been deluged with migrants.Dungarpur has been among the hardest hit by the migrant influx. Health department data shows that the district had only two active cases on May 5. But as of May 21, it increased to 258 cases with 256 migrants testing positive.Similarly, Pali had 20 active cases on May 5 which has risen to 168 with 106 migrants testing positive. Jalore had no active cases on May 5 but now, the district has 124 cases after 120 migrants were detected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus.Sirohi, too, had no active cases on May 5 but has 72 today with 69 migrants found to be infected.Cases in Rajsamand increased from five to 42 in the same period largely due to the migrants.44 migrants have tested positive in Barmer, taking its tally to 51 from two active cases on May 5.Churu had no active cases as all 37 patients had recovered. It now has 37 active cases after 35 migrants tested positive.Bhilwara’s cases have risen from two to 39 with 45 migrants testing positive and Sikar, which had three active cases on May 5, now has 55 cases with 55 migrants testing positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-drive-the-covid-19-spiral-in-rajasthan-with-1-100-cases-in-14-days/story-biBcjbSH8vkxwrfAdXf6AJ.html

21-05-2020||India||Domestic travel: Flight schedule would be made available for each airline after DGCA draws up plan||Online bookings for air tickets for domestic flights are likely to start from Thursday evening, as the government plans to resume air traffic from May 25, which was suspended since the nationwide lockdown restrictions came into effect from March 25 to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreakA senior official from the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) said on condition of anonymity that a flight schedule would be made available for each domestic carrier after the regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), draws up the plan of the routes that would be allowed to operate initially. The government plans to resume domestic travel in a phased manner from May 25 because of the pandemic.The ministry has fixed the maximum and minimum cap for airfares. For example, the lowest fare for a Delhi-Mumbai flight will be Rs3,500 and the highest at Rs10,000. And, 40% of seats on a flight have to be sold at the mid-point of this band, which works out to Rs6,700. This fare will be applicable till 11.59 pm on August 24.The ministry has capped the domestic air travel capacity, which will be applicable between May 25 and August 24.In the metro cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata, flights have been allowed to operate one-third of their capacity.While in the metro to non-metro cities and vice-versa, where the weekly departures are more than 100, each flight can operate one-third of its capacity. And, for all other cities, airlines are free to operate on any route on one-third of its capacity.However, these restrictions are not applicable for UDAN flights that operate under the regional connectivity scheme.“Airlines will decide on the frequency of the flights depending on the demand after the schedule is made available,” said a private airline official.The MoCA has urged senior citizens and pregnant women to avoid travelling because of the viral outbreak.The ministry guidelines stipulated that passengers would have to report to an airport two hours before their flight is set to depart, and only those passengers, who have checked-in online, would be allowed to enter the airport terminal building with only one check-in bag and one hand baggage of a specified size.No passenger staying in a containment zone or who tested Covid-19 positive or have not been permitted to fly should not travel or else that person would be penalised, it added.A passenger needs to give a self-declaration by using the Aarogya Setu mobile application to show that h/she doesn’t have any Covid-19 symptoms. Passengers with “red” status in the app won’t be permitted to travel. Passengers must compulsorily wear face masks and airline crew members have been instructed to use personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. Airlines will not be allowed to serve meals on flights, newspapers, and magazines are also barred.The ministry has asked air passengers to wear face masks throughout their journey and carry minimum baggage, as few trolleys will be available. Passengers have been asked to complete the check-in and baggage drop process at least an hour prior to their flight departs.A passenger, who doesn’t have Aarogya Setu application on his mobile phone, will be guided to a dedicated counter at the airport to download the app. Then, the passenger has to go to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) counter at the security checkpoint.The SOP for an air passenger states that after entering the terminal, the flier will have to download the baggage tag/baggage identification number, print it, and affix it on the bag at a prominent place. “In case the passenger is not able to print the baggage tag, then he/she should mention the PNR number and his/her name on a thick piece of paper and affix it/tag it with a strong string,” the SOP added.All biohazards will have to be disposed of in yellow bins at airports and social distancing norms must be strictly followed in the food and beverage (F&B) and retail sections. Hand sanitisers will be made available at all prominent places at airports.Passengers will have to wait in the baggage hold area until their baggage arrives in batches. Transit passengers will be allowed only in the transit hold area. The ministry has directed airlines to inform the passengers that only web check-in is allowed. All passengers’ body temperatures will be measured at airports during entry and before boarding a flight. Crew members also need to undergo frequent and random health check-ups.

FCI will also ensure adequate availability of food grains, especially rice, to West Bengal so that marooned people are provided immediate sustenance,” the statement said.The Power Ministry and Department of Telecommunications will also assist in early restoration of services in both the States. The Railways, which suffered major damages to its infrastructure, is in the process of restarting its operations at the earliest.West Bengal informed that there were major damages to agriculture, power and telecommunication facilities in Cyclone affected areas. Odisha informed that damages have been mainly limited to agriculture.“Reviewing the rescue and restoration efforts, the Cabinet Secretary directed that officers of central ministries/ agencies should remain in close touch with Odisha and West Bengal state governments and provide all required assistance expeditiously. The ministry of home affairs will be sending teams to carry out early assessment of damages and submit a report,” it said..Chief Secretaries of West Bengal and Odisha participated in the NCMC meeting through video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndrf-moves-more-teams-to-cyclone-hit-bengal-for-restoration-work/story-ZvO9Kz12N4lHd9SLpdd8AP.html

The ‘Badrinath ki Dulhania’ actor has been on a writing spree since the lockdown was announced. “I love writing poetry, as it liberates me from all negativity and pessimism. We are living in unprecedented times and none of us ever thought that life would stop like this. Whatever I see happening around, takes the shape of poetry and I put it down on paper.”Yash released his first poetry video, ‘Kaise Baat Karein Ye Kahin Sikhaya Jaaye’, recently on social media, “This is a small effort towards giving back to life and all the people who have somewhere or the other influenced and motivated me. I am thrilled with the response my video is garnering. Also, my narration is being praised and that’s so rewarding. But the biggest compliment came from my mother who complimented me on my effort and urged me to continue writing. It was truly overwhelming for me.Though this video is not Yash’s first work as a poet, he said, “I always wanted to write but never got down to it. This lockdown gave me the perfect opportunity to be myself. I penned two poems, one dedicated to my wife on Mother’s Day and the other just happened when a friend sent me a video of the prime minister’s call to light diyas, candles for 9 minutes at 9 pm. The entire city lit, as if it were Diwali. So, you could say it was all by chance that I continued getting inspiration to pen something or the other.”Talking about the work front, he said, “I have done multiple shows and films but I am a very greedy actor and can never feel content with whatever I have done in terms of acting or essaying various characters. So, as things get normal and we go back to work, I will also try to explore other mediums, especially OTT as that’s something that will be an altogether fun experience.”The ‘Code Red’ actor is happily home quarantined with his wife, actor Amrapali and their son, “Yes, I am relaxed as we are together in times of crisis and thankfully, when the lockdown was announced, we were home, so this actually proved to be a big relief for all of us.”Lucknow happens to be Yash’s in-laws house. “Yes, my wife is from the City of Nawabs and so the place holds a very important place in my life. Also, I would love to mention its food and its wonderful winter. I hope to visit the place soon when things get normal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lockdown-and-our-latent-sides-actor-brings-out-the-poet-in-him/story-NC5JwaKLpXdlZUXbfO6SeP.html

Around 130 inmates are undergoing treatment at a makeshift isolation ward in the jail and the rest have been admitted to Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Hospital.The SOP has directed the police to ensure the arrested accused are presented before magistrates in person or via videoconference facility at the earliest before taking them to custody. The accused have to be either lodged in jail or quarantined at isolation wards of district hospitals prior to conducting Covid-19 tests, it added.The state police authorities have been directed to ensure the accused security at isolation wards until their test reports are made available.If an accused is found to have tested Covid-19 positive, then action would be taken as per the prescribed norms.

He has to undergo another test after 21 days and then be put under home quarantine for 14 more days, if he is granted bail. In case his bail is denied, he needs to be lodged at a general jail ward.The SOP said the judicial custody of an accused could be only sought under exceptional circumstances.The guidelines also directed jail staff to take precautions while dealing with the accused in a bid to contain the spread of the viral outbreak.The order also suggested conducting random Covid-19 tests for jail staff and their family members and a regular check-up of prisoners, maintaining their health records along with a daily sanitisation drive on prison premises.Social distancing norms need to be strictly maintained along with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits.The overall tally in the desert state stood at 5,952 cases and 143 Covid-19 related deaths until 2pm on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wear-mask-gloves-while-making-arrest-rajasthan-govt-covid-19-sop-for-cops/story-km01C0HdOYiAia6oW14YAK.html

She tagged Telangana Information Technology minister KT Rama Rao in her tweet.Madhavi complained to the minister that her husband was admitted to King Kothi Hospital on April 27 and later taken to Gandhi Hospital on April 30.Madhavi futher claimed that the hospital authorities had not taken her permission to complete the process and hadn’t even shown the body identification. They had not shown any evidences like cremation video, photos or his belongings to her.“On May 16, when we were discharged, we questioned the hospital authorities about my husband, but they did not give proper reply. They first said he was still on ventilator but later said he was not alive. We request you to help in probing my husband’s missing case,” she said.Gandhi Hospital superintendent Dr M Raja Rao issued a statement stating that the woman’s husband, who was also suffering from bilateral pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, had succumbed to Covid-19 on May 1 evening, a day after he was admitted to the hospital.“As per the procedure, the family members were informed and following the protocol, the dead body was handed over to police and their acknowledgement was taken. On enquiry, it was known that the body was cremated by the GHMC. All due procedures were followed,” he said.While sympathising with Madhavi’s family, Rao said it was wrong to defame the hospital and doctors and other staff who were treating hundreds of Covid-19 patients risking their lives.Madhavi told reporters that she strongly believes her husband was alive. She disputes the claim of Gandhi Hospital superintendent that the family was informed about the tragedy.“Let them show evidence to whom they had informed and from whom they had obtained consent or no objection letter,” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-claims-her-covid-19-positive-husband-is-missing-hospital-says-man-cremated/story-IuZ18u1ytva4bE8Zn84oRM.html

21-05-2020||India||Antibody testing, vaccine trial: What India and the world are doing for Covid-19 vaccine||As the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the world rapidly, the race to find a vaccine has also been fast-tracked.There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, with governments, drugmakers and researchers working on around 100 vaccine programmes. Experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop.Many companies, in India as well as across the world, have made headway in vaccine development. One such company, Bengaluru-based Strides Pharma Science Ltd said on Thursday that it has got regulatory approval to conduct clinical trials of antiviral drug favipiravir, considered a potential treatment for Covid-19.Strides’ announcement comes after Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd said last month it became the first pharmaceutical company in the country to get the nod to conduct favipiravir trials. The Mumbai-based company has initiated late-stage clinical trials and expects study results by July or August.Favipiravir is manufactured under the brand name Avigan by a unit of Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp and was approved for use as an anti-flu drug in the country in 2014.Translate Bio Inc, a 100-person company based outside Boston, has joined forces with Sanofi to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. However, on Wednesday, Japan’s Kyodo News reported that so far there has been no clear evidence of efficacy for Avigan in treating Covid-19 in some clinical trials.US President Donald Trump had disclosed on Tuesday that he was taking hydroxychloroquine despite medical warnings about potential serious side effects and questions about its effectiveness in preventing the coronavirus.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was first synthesised in 1946 and is in a class of medications historically used to treat and prevent malaria. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, childhood arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. The drug is not FDA-approved for the treatment of Covid-19 but it has been identified as a possible treatment for the infection and the US government has requested its immediate availability.For treatment, patients have been getting antibody-rich plasma donated by people who recovered from Covid-19, and drugmakers are at work producing refined and concentrated versions of that serum.Menwhile, the doctors in China are seeing the virus manifest differently in its new cluster of cases, suggesting that the pathogen may be changing and complicating efforts to stamp it out.However, a leading researcher on cancer, HIV/AIDS and human genome projects said that governments should not count on a successful vaccine against Covid-19 being developed anytime soon.William Haseltine cautioned that vaccines developed for other types of coronavirus had failed to protect mucous membranes in the nose where the virus typically enters the body.Tests on animals of experimental Covid-19 vaccines had been able to reduce the viral load in organs like lungs although the infections remained, he said.However, Haseltine said the virus can still be controlled by careful tracing of infections and strict isolation measures, and urged people to wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antibody-testing-vaccine-trial-what-india-and-the-world-are-doing-for-covid-19-vaccine/story-qvNLypZHBWod20qpL9nNWJ.html

21-05-2020||India||President accepts credentials of 7 envoys via video, says it is a first||A new chapter in digital India opened in Rashtrapati Bhavan on Thursday when President Ram Nath Kovind became the first ever titular head of a state to receive and accept diplomatic credentials of seven foreign envoy digitally.“This was the first time that credentials were presented through the digital medium. The President remarked that digital technology has enabled the world to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19 and carry out its functions in an innovative manner,” the Rashtrapati Bhavan tweeted. The elaborate ceremony for presentation of credentials had to be cut short as Covid-19 restrictions are firmly in place and President Kovind has minimised his physical engagements. “But it was felt necessary to conduct the credential presentation online as it is a vital part of diplomatic culture which shouldn’t be overlooked,” said a senior official of the Rashtrapati Bhavan.This was the first time that credentials were presented through the digital medium. The President remarked that digital technology has enabled the world to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19 and carry out its functions in an innovative manner.Ambassador of DPR Korea, Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire along with the High Commissioners of Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritius Australia and Rwanda came in the South Block and stood in front of a large screen one by one. On the screen, President Kovind appeared to welcome them, even as the distance between the South Block and Rashtrapati Bhavan is not even 200 metres.Secretary (West) of the Ministry of External Affairs, Vikas Swaroop, was present along with the envoys during the ceremony.These were the first batch of envoys who presented their credentials after the Covid-19 pandemic swept India leading to a nationwide lockdown since March 25. “The envoys read out their letters of credentials and President accepted them on the TV screen. They also nodded at the President as per the protocol and some envoys even extended an invitation to the President on behalf of their head of state to visit their countries. President accepted them and at the end, he delivered a short speech welcoming them in India and also mentioned how our country is fighting against Covid-19,” said an official.The presentation of protocol involves a detailed plan with strict rules and elaborate rituals. During normal time, the envoy would come to Rashtrapati Bhavan accompanied by a foreign ministry official. He has to take a specific seat in the car and the accompanying protocol officer would be sitting next to him. Each diplomatic mission can send a specific number of people for the ceremony and when the ambassador arrives at the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Commander of the Presidential Guard would welcome him.There is also a guard of honour standing in the Middle Arc of the main entrance, while the police band would play the National Anthem of the country of the Ambassador. Then he would enter the ceremonial hall and sit two metres away from the President. According to the established protocol, the Ambassador does not shake hands or exchange any words with the President but only makes a slight bow to the President of the Republic.While all these arrangements could not be done due to Covid-19 restrictions, India did start a new beginning in, what some officials called, “digital diplomacy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-ram-nath-kovind-accepts-credentials-of-7-envoys-through-video-conference/story-US6gXdmRQ6gW746dNPtGAO.html

21-05-2020||India||BJP’s Madhya Pradesh unit readies for bypoll battle||As it begins preparations for the conduct of the bypolls in 24 assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to scale up efforts to reach to the workers and those involved in the farm sector that have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic and quell discord over ticket distribution.The date for elections has not been finalised, as all elections have been put on hold because of the pandemic.A senior state functionary said the party has been asked to reinforce its ongoing relief work to ensure that the challenges faced by the workers, many of whom struggled to make their way home, do not impact the electoral outcome.To be sure, most of the workers are not registered as voters in the state and are natives of other states. “While work done on the ground is important, so is the perception. The high command does not want the government’s performance to be measured by a weak response to any challenge,” said the functionary quoted above.Also read: Spurt in Covid-19 cases sees transfers of officials in Madhya PradeshThe bypoll was necessitated after 22 MLAs resigned from the Congress and joined the BJP and two seats fell vacant after the demise of one BJP and one Congress MLA. As per the rules for filling up vacancies, elections have to be held within six months. But since the outbreak of the pandemic, election processes have been halted.While the party is confident of winning with a comfortable majority whenever the bypoll is held, it has two major issues to cope with —discord within its ranks and the state’s response to the pandemic. State unit chief, VD Sharma downplayed the reports of internal strife and said all decisions vis-à-vis ticket distribution will be taken by the parliamentary board of the party. “It is true that the MLAs who quit the Congress have made a sacrifice, it cannot be overlooked, but the party’s central leadership will take the call on ticket distribution,” he said.The BJP was back in the straddle with Shivraj Singh Chouhan as the chief minister in March when the Kamal Nath-led Congress government was voted out after 15 months in power following senior leader and former union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and 22 MLAs walking out.According a second functionary privy to the developments, the state unit is focusing on strengthening its outreach to help migrant workers and amplifying its social security programmes so that when it goes to people for seeking votes, it has a list of accomplishments to show.“We are currently focusing only on the pandemic and meeting the needs of people. Not only are we setting up infrastructure in place to bring back those migrant workers who have moved out of MP but are also trying to encourage workers from other states to stay put,” said the functionary.In the absence of physical meetings and gatherings, the state party unit has been making good use of technology to stay connected. Last week, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held a meeting which had in attendance union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, party state president VD Sharma, general secretary (organisation) Suhas Bhagat and senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, to chalk out the election strategy.On Saturday, several senior functionaries, including Sharma, spent time at camps set up by the party along the highways to provide food, aid and even footwear to the migrant labourers who were arriving.Will the state’s response to the pandemic and the workers’ crisis determine the political outcome? Amitabh Kundu, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said,” It is hard to say how much the voices of the workers will matter in the power corridors. But there is greater awareness now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-madhya-pradesh-unit-readies-for-bypoll-battle/story-Fd8AlmPa4ErpnmqSaLwbXK.html

The Railways cited Cyclone Amphan’s landfall and technical issues for the delay and said they are working to fix it.“Firing of trains is a time consuming exercise and it means actual loading of all information on train journey, its booking parametres etc and this is done simultaneously from both the originating zone and terminating zone.

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for passenger movement are also being separately issued by the civil aviation ministry,” civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri tweeted. According to the AAI’s guidelines, all passengers will have to compulsorily register on the Aarogya Setu app and the same will be verified by CISF security at the airport. “However, Aarogya Setu is not mandatory for children below 14 years of age. State governments and local administrations will have to ensure the availability of public transport and private cabs for providing connectivity to the airport for passengers,” the AAI has said.“For commuting to and from the airport, both by staff and passengers, only the personal vehicles or select authorised taxi services/transport services with restricted seating to be permitted,” it said.Upon arrival, an announcement will be made in the aircraft by the airline on for deplaning passengers in batches sequentially to maintain social distancing norms.“At each point of interaction with the passengers, the airport operator should try to provide a glass shield or any other transparent separation as far as practically possible, for additional protection of airport personnel and passengers,” it said.Inside planes, middle seats might not be left vacant, although such a proposal was initially on the table, said an official who also informed that measures will be taken to maintain social distancing at airports. On the completion of travel, passengers will have to abide by the guidelines laid down by the destination state.Passengers may also have to quarantine upon reaching their destination depending on the norms decided by the states.“On arrival at the destination airport, passengers will have to adhere to such health protocols as prescribed by the destination states/ UTs,” the guidelines added.Domestic flight services have been put on hold since March 25, when the nationwide lockdown was first imposed. International flights have not arrived in India since March 22. Cargo flights and those evacuating foreign nationals have been operating though.Resuming domestic flight services is seen as yet another step by the government in the direction of a graded exit from the lockdown which has been extended till the end of this month. The curbs have taken a toll on the Indian economy, stalling activities across sectors, including the aviation industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airport-authority-of-india-issues-guidelines-for-domestic-air-travel-ministry-says-not-final/story-tX9fv3GQfL9hxpQGpPOQ8J.html

The coal mine workers who quickly returned to Tiryani block headquarters informed the forest officials about the tiger.According to a forest official in Asifabad, it could be the same tiger which had been seen in some other villages near the forests for the last few weeks. “We have been trying to capture it, but it has been elusive,” the official said.Apparently, the tiger had come form Kadamba forest in Asifabad district and had sneaked into Tiryani areas. “It was first spotted drinking water at Gundala river under Rebbena block. There were reports that the tiger later wandered into human habitations at Rachapalli village under Tandur block, where it killed a bull,” the forest official said.Also read: Telangana HC asks govt to allow private labs to conduct Covid-19 testsThe same tiger reportedly killed a cow at Golleti open cast mines and another bull at Tumpalli village, creating panic among the locals, five days ago. “We have sounded an alert in the villages and asked the people not to come out after sunset. We told them not to venture into the forest areas,” he said.According to the forest officials, Komaram Bheem (Asifabad) district is surrounded by wild forests belonging to Tadoba tiger reserve and Kawal wildlife sanctuary, which are home to several tigers. These wild beasts keep travelling for several kilometres from place to place in search of prey animals.“On rare occasions, tigers enter human habitations in search of cattle or sheep. They go back into the forests later,” the forest official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-spotted-near-coal-mine-in-telangana-s-asifabad-panic-among-workers/story-nmuf7oSwHTu6Ld34MJK4rI.html

Few villagers were also present,” said Dhananjay Ghanawat, superintendent of police (SP), Dhemaji.On the afternoon of May 18, some fishermen noticed the accused trying to rape the body of the girl. The accused had allegedly dug up the grave and taken out the body. He was nabbed and handed over to the police.“The accused doesn’t appear to be mentally deranged but is a psychopath. He’s a history-sheeter as well,” said Ghanawat.The accused had married twice and in 2018 one of his wives had accused him of domestic violence. He was convicted and was serving his sentence in Dhemaji jail. But he was released on parole in end-March following a Supreme Court order to decongest jails due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.“The accused appears to be promiscuous. Some have alleged that he might have sexually harassed the minor that led her to commit suicide,” Ghanawat said.The police have exhumed the body, which was reburied by the villagers, and sent it for post-mortem examination and the result is pending.“The accused has confessed to his crime in judicial custody,” the SP added.Saikia has been booked under Sections 306 and 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for abetment of suicide and unnatural sex and also under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-51-yr-old-man-arrested-for-trying-to-rape-dead-minor/story-IiXqtYLpwth5beDnHA8mkL.html
21-05-2020||India||AAI announces SOPs for flights: What is allowed at airports, what isn’t||The Airports Authority of India (AAI) issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for airports as the government announced resumption of domestic flights. The air travel was halted two months ago on account of a lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Apart from other things, the SOPs say that Aarogya Setu mobile application is not mandatory for children below 14 years of age. The app is being widely promoted by the government as it helps in tracing Covid-19 infection in the vicinity.Other passengers, however, are required to install the app on their phone and it will be verified by the airport staff or Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel stationed at the gate. Passengers who don’t show “green” on the app, won’t be allowed to enter.They have also been asked to wear masks and gloves.“Passengers must compulsorily walk through thermal screening zone on city side before entering airport terminal building. Airport operators must make appropriate arrangement for sanitisation of passengers’ baggage before entry into terminal building,” the SOPs released by AAP say.The AAI has asked parking and kerb areas to be strictly monitored in coordination with CISF and traffic police to prevent congestion and maintain social distancing. Only personal vehicles and authorised taxi services will be allowed to enter.It has also asked state governments and local authorities to ensure availability of public transport and taxis for providing connectivity the the airport for passengers as well as staff of the airlines.Passengers have been advised to reach airport two hours before the scheduled time of departure of their flights. “Passengers who have departure in next four hours will only be allowed to enter the building,” the AAI says in the document.However, the civil aviation ministry has categorically stated this will not be the final SOPs on domestic air travel. The ministry has said the final guidelines on resumption of air travel will be issued by the ministry later in the day.The government on Wednesday announced the resumption of domestic flights from May 25. “All airports and air carriers are being informed to be ready for operations from 25th May. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for passenger movement are also being separately issued by civil aviation ministry,” civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri tweeted.The government’s plan for the resumption of services may feature recommending a price band for different routes keeping in mind “the interest of both the consumer and the airline”, a civil aviation ministry official who did not want to be named said.Inside planes, middle seats might not be left vacant though such a proposal was initially on the table, according to the official, who also said measures will be taken to maintain social distancing at airports. On completion of travel, passengers will have to abide by the guidelines laid down by the destination state.In the first phase, the flights are likely to cater to all major Tier-1 cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aai-announces-sops-for-flights-what-is-allowed-at-airports-what-isn-t/story-G1ddQE7dwLGHcxFZ5bzrMM.html

21-05-2020||India||TikTok in India: To ban or not to ban? The debate heats up after sexually violent videos draw flak||Finding ways to kill lockdown boredom, people seem to be going overboard with both creating, and consuming content online. However, for TikTok users, it seems, there’s no defined norms, as some users are promoting misogynist and sexually violent content in the name of entertainment.Just a day after TikToker Faizal Siddiqui’s account was removed following a video showing him throwing liquid (suggesting acid) on a girl’s face who refused his advances, another repulsive video surfaced on the platform — this time advocating rape. It shows TikToker Mujibur Rehman and his friend, zipping up their pants as the girl sobs and adjusts her clothes.Enraged, netizens made #BanTikTok, #TikTokExposed, #TikTokDown trend on Twitter.  After promoting acid and love jihad ,Tiktok'er Mujibur rehman and co are showing off how cool is to r@pe a woman ..... scumsalso see his expression while he pulls up his pant zip in the end !!#BanTikTokInIndia pic.twitter.com/sBW6ScAyvREXPERTS SPEAKSeeking “a total ban” on the Chinese app, Reka Sharma, chairperson, National Commission for Women (NCW), tweeted: “... TikTok is pushing youngsters towards unproductive life where they are living only for few followers...”Activists and NGOs working for women safety feel that mindset is the whole problem here and that needs to change first.Yogita Bhayani, Founder, PARI (People Against Rapes in India), says, “My heart was bleeding seeing those videos. I work with rape victims and know how they suffer. I felt so bad looking at that girl in the video. Do these kids even know the meaning of rape? I’m sure their parents are clueless about the content their child is creating, and they feel proud that of them being popular on TikTok. I hold them equally responsible.” I am of the strong openion that this @TikTok_IN should be banned totally and will be writting to GOI. It not only has these objectionable videos but also pushing youngsters towards unproductive life where they are living only for few followers and even dying when no. Decline. https://t.co/MyeuRbjZAyLike many, Bhayana also blames it on the sheer lack of gender sensitisation among Indian youth. “Whenever we talk about sexual violence, it’s not related to men or women, both need to be sensitised — at homes, in schools, offices, police stations and everywhere,” she says, adding that to some extent, she also blames “Bollywood song for objectifying women that are used as background music for such videos.”CELEBS RAISE CONCERNFrequent users on TikTok, whether celebrities or not, assert that one has to take responsibility on the kind of content they are making and sharing. Actor Shilpa Shetty Kundra, who is quite active on TikTok, calls these videos “terrible”, and questions, “How can it be entertaining? There are strict community guidelines on these platforms dependent on UGC (user generated content), where anything objectionable is removed immediately. I strongly condemn such content”.Kundra also urges influencers to be “responsible for their content”, she also calls for “strictest actions when faltered”.Actor Vikrant Massey, who played an activist helping acid attack victims in Chhaapak, feels these videos somewhere show a collective psyche of most of us. “These are damn unpleasant videos to watch. Koi yeh videos bana raha hai, koi dekh raha hai, koi forward bhi kar raha hai. So, the problem is with all of us as a society that we let such TikTok videos resurface. And given that it’s happening under supervision and authority makes it more problematic. It also shows out subconscious cognizance with patriarchy and crime against women with such insensitive things,” he says. What on earth is wrong with people? This is depraved. How can you allow this kind of content on your platform @TikTok_IN This man needs to be taken to task. As for the woman in the video-do you realise what immense harm you are causing by participating in this? https://t.co/I5OLTEZGVeMassey further adds that since we know such content exists online, “Counselling is what we lack. By suspending accounts or filing an FIR, you just dust off the issue. Grassroot problem needs to be solved and parents need to be counselled.” Actor Taapsee Pannu, who played a sexual attack victim in Pink (2016) and stood up against domestic violence in Thappad, feels the age-old misogyny is so deep-rooted that “it’ll a long time for us to wash it out.”However, she says that it’s for the content creators to understand what they’re promoting. “We can’t police each and every one of them. They might stop making videos of such kind but what’s the guarantee they won’t practice it in real. If we really have to deal with it, it had to dealt from the root,” Pannu asserts.Making a rather strong point, she further adds that we should stop making these TikTokers ‘influencers’ by totally disregarding their content. “These people most of the times make stuff that they know will get eyeballs and attention towards them. It’s their few minutes of fame. We should just look through them and make them feel insignificant, so they realise that this isn’t how they are going to get our attention.”WHAT TIKTOK HAS TO SAY?As the debate raged, TikTok shared a statement with a message on social media: “TikTok is a platform that celebrates creativity & expression. We aim to create a positive in-app environment that brings people and communities together and request all our users to respect this intent.”  TikTok is a platform that celebrates creativity & expression. We aim to create a positive in-app environment that brings people and communities together and request all our users to respect this intent.A post shared by  TikTok India (@indiatiktok) on May 19, 2020 at 7:08am PDTMeanwhile, Harshal Hirve, Community Manager at Tiktok India, says it’s practically impossible to monitor each and every user’s content. “We have a moderation team that treats all creators in the same way, and it’s not that only when popular handles post something, we monitor that. We handle a lot of users and such cases on daily basis, but just because Faizal was a popular creator and the mess he created, this issue got highlighted. We have guidelines and we also train creators about how to post content and what should not be posted. And if someone is making videos of his own, we’re not responsible for it. But, if something disturbs our platform, we will definitely action.”In fact, amid the whole debate of banning the app in the Indian market, a news came out that Kevin Mayer, Chairman of International division of Walt Disney and global streaming chief of Disney+ will be Tiktok global CEO from June.SELF MONITOR THE CONTENTThe bigger question at hand remains: Is it time TikTok faces a mass ban?We reached out to several Tiktok stars, too, but since most of them are young, even minors, their parents didn’t want them to comment. However, the father of a popular TikToker and TV actor, says on the condition on anonymity, “I keep a close check on whatever content my daughter creates and posts on these platforms. I do all I can to protect her.”  Behind Every Successful Person Lies A Pack Of Haters 🔥 #manojjadhav #manojjadhavmj #dance #dancer #instagram #instagood #tiktok #tiktokindia #helo #facebook #explore #explorepage #foryou #foryoupage #likeforlikes #like4likes #likeforfollow #follow #followforfollowback #follow4followback #followers #support #hardwork #never #betrayedA post shared by  Manoj Jadhav (@manoj_jadhav_mj) on May 13, 2020 at 8:50pm PDTPointing that there are both good and bad sides to this, 27-year-old TikTok user, Manoj Jadhav feels banning the app won’t help, but the accounts of specific people need to be removed.He explains, “There are so many poor people yet so talented, and with their dancing, acting, have become so popular on TikTok. But there are some who’re spreading hate and negativity in the name of content. They need to be banned. They create offensive content only to increase their follower count, and think just by making a duet with a girl, they can become us famous.”Bhayana adds, “Of course banning these apps is an immediate solution, but what’s the surety that nothing else will pop up? How will you ban pornography which is a bigger monster and a click away?” Interact with the author at @monikarawal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiktok-in-india-to-ban-or-not-to-ban/story-ychG1b7sTqC9FqDwE2n5hN.html

21-05-2020||India||Spurt in Covid-19 cases sees transfers of officials in Madhya Pradesh; chief minister should go, says Congress||The Madhya Pradesh government on Wednesday transferred Khandwa district collector and superintendent of police, a day after the small border town with Maharashtra saw 90 new Covid-19 patients in a span 24 hours.The Collector, 2010-batch IAS officer Tanvi Sundriyal, was replaced with another 2010-batch IAS officer Anay Dwivedi and was posted as a deputy secretary in the state secretariat, chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains ordered.A 2012-batch IPS officer, Shiv Dayal, was replaced by another 2012-batch officer and commander of Special Armed Force’s 7th battalion Vivek Singh. Dayal will be new commander of the battalion, a Home department order said.These officers are not alone to have faced axe for spike in Covid-19 cases.On May 4, collector of Ujjain, Shashank Mishra, and on May 7, SP Sachin Atulkar were shifted when the city became a Covid-19 hotspot with the death rate being highest among big cities.Indore, the neighbouring district of Ujjain, saw a similar situation earlier when its collector Lokesh Jatav was shifted and replaced with Manish Singh on March 28. Three days later, Indore police chief deputy inspector general (DIG) of police Ruchivardhan Mishra was shifted to a smaller district in the region. However, when Indore collector was shifted, the city had not become a Covid-19 hotspot but virus was spreading fast in certain localities.A day after he took oath as chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan shifted chief secretary Gopal Reddy. However, it had nothing to do with any Covid-19 situation. Reddy was replaced with Iqbal Singh Bains, Chouhan’s trusted officer, who had been the principal secretary during his previous term as the CM. Reddy was shifted barely a week after his appointment.Then commissioner, health services, Prateek Hajela, was shifted on April 1 - an unusual instance of the state government making public the CM’s displeasure with an officer for not able to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.A tweet from the state government on April 1 evening said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan instructed immediate removal of Prateek Hajela from the post of commissioner, health services on his extreme carelessness towards his duties amid the Covid-19 pandemic.”The other notable transfers in health department include that of principal secretary, health department, Pallavi Govil Jain and National Health Mission (NHM)’s integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) director, Swati Meena Nayak. The chief medical and health officers of Bhopal, Ujjain and Khandwa were also transferred. All these officers were involved in tackling Covid-19 situation. Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “Frequent transfers are no solutions. Indore has become one of major Covid-19 hotspot in the country despite transfers. In Bhopal there are no transfers of collector and DIG police but it is still a major Covid spot in the country. Integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) team in health department has seen changes at least thrice. The government must think beyond transfers to see where the problem lies. The fact is the government relies more on bureaucrats than the doctors and those officials who have knowledge of medicines. It’s pandemic, not a riot situation.”The state Congress has launched an attack on the government.State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja asked, “If inefficiency is the reason behind these transfers then why chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should not go from his post under whose leadership the state government failed to control coronavirus in the state and almost entire state has been affected by the disease except five districts? The entire state has earned a bad name as it is one of the worst managed states in the country. Either Chouhan should step down or the Prime Minister Narendra Modi should remove him immediately.”Despite efforts chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains and director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri couldn’t be reached for their comments. They didn’t take phone calls and didn’t respond to messages.However, former chief secretary of Madhya Pradesh KS Sharma said, “Though transfers of officials from any district may not appear a solution immediately, it all depends on the perception of the state government about the particular situation. If a government feels that any officer or officers have failed to control any situation it sends other officers to address the particular situation. The government might have felt that the lockdown restrictions were not complied with strictly in these districts and protocol followed, hence the transfers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spurt-in-covid-19-cases-sees-transfers-of-officials-chief-minister-should-go-says-congress/story-cMJsQRiMzA97BrMbFelBFL.html
21-05-2020||India||State-wise variations in new rules leave citizens puzzled||Can you go to office? Can you drive your car across to the next state, or the next city? Can you take public transport? Can you even get a haircut? On March 25, the day India imposed the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, the answer to all these questions was a resounding no. There was one rule, and all citizens had to abide by the restrictions. Today, even as lockdown 4.0 has got officially extended to May 31, the answer to the questions is — depends; depends on where you are and which state jurisdiction has adopted what rules. So if you are in Delhi, you can’t get a hair cut and will have to live with that long beard or unkempt look for some more time, but if you are in Thiruvananthapuram, you can walk into a salon. If you are in Gurugram or Noida, you can drive down to Delhi — but if you are in Delhi, you may not be able drive back to Gurugram or Noida. If you are in Bengaluru, you can work in office at full capacity. But if you have an office in Mumbai, your office can only have one-third of the staff. If you are in Kolkata and need to take a quick auto ride with your spouse, both of you can hop in to one auto rickshaw. But if you are in Delhi, both of you will have to take two separate autos. This, often bewildering, set of rules symbolises lockdown 4.0. Advocates say it is a better reflection of local realities, with states now having the power to decide zones and extent of activity in each area; others believe that this creates confusion for individuals, companies, and even local government authorities. Take companies. A company’s office in Delhi or Bengaluru may have started functioning from Tuesday but its office in Mumbai has remained closed, due to the lockdown. Maharashtra government has decided to enforce lockdown 3.0 regulations in Mumbai, in which only 33% of workers are allowed in non-containment areas. Eighteen of the 27 municipal corporations in the state, including all in and around Mumbai, are in the red zone.“It (restrictions in Mumbai) has created some functional problems for us, as our head office is in Mumbai,” said a Bengaluru-based systems analyst, Srinivasa Murthy, working with a multinational information technology company. Most companies had to introduce city-specific working protocols as lockdown norms are not same in all cities. “It has added to our work but we have to deal with it,” commented an HR manager in a second Bengaluru-based IT company, requesting anonymity. Or take public transport. After 56 days, public transport — buses, cabs and auto rickshaws — returned to many cities, with different city norms. In Kolkata, only 20 passengers per bus are allowed. In Bengaluru, buses can run up to half of its capacity. Autos in Bengal can carry two passengers and in Delhi only one. But the ease in curbs has often not translated into passengers, for there appears to be caution.Or take inter-state travel.While Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments have allowed inter-state travel, the administrations in Noida and Gurugram have prohibited it. In Maharashtra, even inter-district travel is difficult. There is an even bigger issue with long-distance travel, with citizens at a loss in the absence of clarity. KC Jain, a cancer survivor, living in Vishal Khand area of Lucknow, wanted to drive down to Jodhpur to bring his wife back. He applied for an e-pass, which was rejected. “My wife is stuck in Rajasthan for nearly two months,” he said.Kerala and Punjab have allowed barber shops. Delhi and Mumbai have not. Uttarakhand and Rajasthan have come up with strict conditions — only one person is to be allowed inside a barber shop at a time and there must be proper provision of masks, sanitisers and thermal scanners. UP and MP will allow salons and barber shops from Thursday.And the experience of a hair cut itself has changed, for both the customer and the barber. Joseph Mathew walked into a salon in Thiruvananthapuram carrying his own towel, for a haircut, his first during the lockdown, and was surprised to find his barber was covered from head to toe in a protective gear. “I never imagined such a scene,” he said, as two customers got their hair done in distant corners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-wise-variations-in-new-rules-leave-citizens-puzzled/story-TU6JqF7qQfr69TxrXSyJ0N.html
21-05-2020||India||After a lull, two more Covid-19 containment zones added in Delhi||The Delhi administration on Wednesday added two more areas to its list of Covid-19 containment zones. This comes after nearly 3 weeks since any new zone was added as a containment zone in Delhi. Both areas, Zamrudpur in Greater Kailash and Dakshinpuri, are in South Delhi.   The South Delhi district administration on Wednesday issued the orders on the two containment zones after the health department directed all district magistrates to create such zones as per the existing guidelines.The department’s direction came after a mismatch between the number of coronavirus cases in the national capital and the number of containment zones was observed. While the Covid-19 cases in Delhi recently breached the 10,000-mark in Delhi, the number of containment zones have seen a falling trend. According to government data, the number of Covid-19 containment zones in the city stood at 76 on Monday, 70 on Tuesday and 69 on Wednesday.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, earlier this week, urged the residents of the national capital to show discipline during the fourth phase of the coronavirus lockdown. The chief minister said that people must learn to live with coronavirus while protecting themselves and others around them. This came as economic activities and public transport, other than Delhi Metro, resumed in the national capital this week amid lockdown 4. The number of coronavirus cases in Delhi crossed the 11,000 mark on Wednesday with 534 more people testing positive, while the death toll climbed to 176, news agency PTI reported.

21-05-2020||India||‘More worrying than Covid-19’: Chaos as Cyclone Amphan strikes Bengal, Odisha||Cyclone Amphan roared into West Bengal around 20 kilometre east of Sagar Island in the Sunderbans on Wednesday, packing winds gusting to a top speed of 185 kmph, triggering torrential rain and leaving a trail of devastation across a wide swath of the state, from deltaic regions to the urban neighbourhoods of Kolkata.It brought a storm surge - a wall of ocean water that is often one of the main killers in major weather systems - that roared inland. Watch| Vikram Chandra on Cyclone Amphan landfall, resumption of domestic flights“The situation is more worrying than the coronavirus pandemic. We don’t know how to handle it,” West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee told reporters late on Wednesday. “Almost everything is destroyed in the coastal villages of the state.”Banerjee, who was assessing the situation from the state secretariat, said at least 10-12 people have died.“The losses will be at three levels - loss to life and property because the storm was tremendous; loss to basic infrastructure, which will take months to leap back to normalcy, and thirdly, loss to livelihoods due to saline water intrusion and large-scale inundation. I have received reports of embankment breaks from Sagar Island, Ramganga, Hingalganj and a few other places. Many embankments are seeing overtopping of water because the rivers have swelled up, these will break in days,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.Amphan, the most severe storm in the Bay of Bengal since the Odisha super cyclone of 1999, made landfall between 3.30 pm and 5.30 pm.In neighbouring Odisha, at least two deaths were reported till Wednesday night. A two-month-old baby was killed in a wall collapse in the morning after heavy overnight rains in Bhadrak district. In another incident, a woman died in Balasore after an electric pole, uprooted by the storm, fell on her.In Bangladesh, officials confirmed six deaths including a five-year-old boy and a 75-year-old man, both hit by falling trees, and a cyclone emergency volunteer who drowned.Some three million people were left without power, Bangladesh officials said.About 224.6 millimetres (0.7 feet) of rain fell from early Wednesday and winds up to 113 kmph (70 mph) lashed Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal.Video shared on social media showed electricity transformers sparking and exploding in the wild weather. Some reports said that 5,500 houses were damaged in one West Bengal district.The cyclone is expected to weaken as it moves north and northeast, and recede to a tropical depression by Thursday afternoon, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said.In southwestern Bangladesh, a five-feet-high storm surge broke an embankment and swamped farmland.Bangladesh officials were particularly concerned about the damage to the Sunderbans, a UNESCO world heritage site famed for its mangrove forest and tiger population, which they said bore the brunt of the cyclone.Houses “look like they have been run over by a bulldozer”, said Babul Mondal, 35, a villager on the edge of the Indian side of the Sunderbans.The 1999 super cyclone left nearly 10,000 dead in Odisha, eight years after a typhoon, tornadoes and flooding killed 139,000 in Bangladesh.In 1970, half a million perished due to Cyclone Bhola.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-cyclone-amphan-made-landfall-and-left-a-trail-of-destruction-in-bengal-odisha/story-YmZLdCVgbTvLaMn7rbctML.html
21-05-2020||India||Delhiwale | A priest in the pandemic||The Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place is closed. So is the St James Church in Kashmere Gate. Ditto with Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya’s Sufi shrine in Nizamuddin basti. Who could have imagined this would happen?Sounding astonished on phone, temple priest Santosh Bhardwaj insists that this is a most extraordinary time. “I had never thought that a day would come when houses of gods would shut their doors to devotees.”Indeed, the world has turned upside down. The coronavirus pandemic has upset everybody’s routines. But the virus hasn’t dented the daily schedule of Mr Bhardwaj, the in-house priest at Radha Krishna Temple in Ghata village in Gurugram’s Sector 55, very close to the swish Golf Course Road.“I live in the mandir, my life is simple, and has so far remained unaffected,” says the priest this evening on WhatsApp. The photos are taken through the screen that connects him to this reporter.In his 40s, Mr Bhardwaj has been living in the temple for many years. His wife and three children live in their native town of Rewari. “They know I’m alone and they worry about me. They call me often,” he says in the contended tone of a man who is certain of the affection of his family.Wearing an orange scarf around his head, the cheery-natured priest with a beatific smile clarifies that the temple has been closed to visitors since the lockdown began. “Earlier, villagers would come to me all the time to ask me to help them with their personal problems, but now they call me on WhatsApp.” He says that most of his yajman (followers) in the village are former farmers, who now thrive by renting out their lands for residential use to migrants who decided to settle here.Despite the absence of regular devotees inside the temple, Mr Bhardwaj still wakes up at 4am sharp. After undertaking his snan (bath), he begins the thorough cleaning of the temple floor. Back in the BC (Before Corona) era, the task was performed by a woman “but she went back to her village in MP with her sons, who were working as labourers in Delhi,” says Mr Bhardwaj. The priest reveals that the aforementioned lady and her family covered most of the way to their village by walking on the highway, like many other migrants returning home. “She called me on mobile after reaching home... she is fine.”These days Mr Bhardwaj gets help in the cleaning from Yash, a young man from Punjab living nearby, who used to work in a salon until the lockdown began.Later, the priest performs the ritual of jyoti batti, in which he lights up 14 diyas. The next few hours are exhausted in a series of devotional engagements including aarti, jaap, kirtan, satsang, and the reading of Bhagwad Puran.One of Mr Bhardwaj’s most cherished activities in the morning is to clean the idol of Laddu Gopalji, a name used affectionately for infant lord Krishna. “I give Laddu Gopalji a shower, put new clothes on him, mark his forehead with sandalwood paste, comb his hair and finally tuck in the peacock feather on his head.”Only after executing his morning duties does the priest help himself to chai. But currently he is observing a month-long fast “to pray that our country and the world get out of this mahamari (pandemic).” Consequently, Mr Bhardwaj consumes only one simple meal daily, around 3pm, consisting of meethi (sweet) roti and meethi lassi.The daily life in the temple winds down with the evening aarti at 7pm. The curtains are drawn to all the shrines by 9. Only then the priest settles down on a string cot by the temple entrance, and indulges himself in looking at the world outside through the grills of the barred gate. He goes to sleep by 11pm and is again up at 4am.“This is how my life in the mandir goes on, come what may,” says Mr Bhardwaj modestly as he conducts a WhatsApp tour of the temple, starting from the sanctum sanctorum to the yard outside. There, he turns his phone screen towards the temple’s tall shikhar (spire), rising defiantly high into the sky—as if setting a straight connection with the higher powers above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-priest-in-the-pandemic/story-T6x95kXNtjLppdk4EomKAN.html
21-05-2020||India||Chhattisgarh to launch cash transfer scheme for farmers today||The Chhattisgarh government will on Thursday launch a scheme named after Rajiv Gandhi on the late former Prime Minister’s 19th death anniversary for direct cash transfers to around 2 million farmers in four instalments, officials aware of the matter said. The officials said a five-member committee was constituted to study how Rs 2,500 per quintal for paddy could be ensured for the farmers as per the Congress pledge in its manifesto ahead of the 2018 assembly elections. The panel was constituted after the government procured paddy from farmers at the rate fixed by the Centre--~1,835 per quintal--in November 2019 and promised to pay the balance amount later.“The committee recommended that ~10,000 per acre should be given to farmers, who sold the paddy at the Centre’s rate and added the benefit should also be provided for maize and sugarcane crops,” said an official in chief minister Bhupesh Baghel’s office on condition of anonymity.The beneficiaries of the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna, which was approved by the Chhattisgarh cabinet on May 14, will be chosen on the basis of registered land under cultivation during the kharif crop season 2019. ~10,000 per acre will be deposited in the bank accounts of each beneficiary as agriculture assistance grant for cultivation.Baghel said Congress leadership has been advocating direct transfer. “We have decided to put money in the farmers’ pockets again. I am confident that this will help in the revival of economy post-Covid-19 pandemic.” Congress leaders like Rahul Gandhi have repeatedly asked the government to provide direct cash assistance instead of loans to tide over the Covid-19 crisis while criticising the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore package that includes cheaper loans. Gandhi on Saturday said the government should not be a “sahukar [money lender]” while arguing in favour of the cash assistance.Activist Alok Shukla said, “If the government is claiming it as Nyay Yojna, why have not the state’s all 3 million paddy farmers been covered under the scheme?”The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party dismissed the scheme as “Anyay Yojna”. “The money is being given to the farmers in four instalments which will be of no use,” BJP spokesman Sacchinand Upasane said. He added the government had promised to give the remaining amount of the price it had pledged to procure paddy at in one instalment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-launch-cash-transfer-scheme-for-farmers-today/story-TrS0ksKBNeX088mCiDlFRO.html

21-05-2020||India||3 dead as Cyclone Amphan crosses Odisha before making landfall in Bengal||Three deaths were reported including that of a 2-month-old girl in Odisha as extremely severe cyclonic storm Amphan, the strongest storm since the 1999 Super Cyclone, barrelled along the Odisha coast this morning before making landfall near Sunderbans in West Bengal late on Wednesday afternoon.In Odisha, the maximum wind speed of 120 km per hour due to Cyclone Amphan was clocked in Dhamra coast in Bhadrak district while in Paradip it was around 100 km per hour. The cyclone uprooted trees and bent electric poles in coastal Odisha districts of Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Bhadrak and Balasore. Nearly 34 lakh power consumers in the state were affected as 65 units of 33 KV feeders were affected due to the cyclone. However, more than 90 per cent of telecom infrastructure was not affected, Special Relief Commissioner Pradip Jena said.In Bhadrak district, a two-month-old infant died after the wall of his family’s kutcha house collapsed early on Wednesday morning. The newborn son of farmer Balaram Das in Kannada village of Bhadrak’s Tihidi block was sleeping when the wall of the house gave in due to overnight rain. In Kendrapara district, a woman who had gone out fishing this morning was drowned to death.A woman of Bhogarai block in Balasore district died after an electric pole fell on her. The woman had stepped outside for some work when the pole uprooted due to the winds.“We have received reports of a child’s death at Tihidi in the Bhadrak district. The District Collector has sent a team, comprising the tehsildar, medical and police officials. The exact cause will be ascertained after autopsy,” Jena said. Officials, however, did not clarify why the family of the deceased newborn could not be shifted to a cyclone shelter.Jena said after the cyclone passed by Odisha, road clearance started in Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Bhadrak districts by NDRF, ODRAF, Fire Service and workers of Odisha Forest Development Corporation. Early in the morning, the port town of Paradip faced Cyclone Amphan’s fury as winds of over 100 kmph uprooted scores of trees, electric poles, blew away asbestos and tin roofs of several houses accompanied by over 200 mm of rain. At Paradip port, over 100 truck drivers have taken shelter inside their vehicles, waiting for the storm to blow over.Officials had evacuated over 1.5 lakh people from the coastal and adjoining districts into cyclone shelters till Tuesday evening. Around 1,585 pregnant women were also brought to safety by authorities in the coastal districts.In a village of Kendrapara district, a woman delivered her baby in a fire service vehicle while being taken to a government hospital. The woman and her newborn girl were later admitted to the hospital and were said to be out of danger. Janaki Sethi (20), wife of Hatim Sethi (25) of Janhara village under Mahakalapada police station area of Kendrapara district went into labour this morning. Her family tried to contact the ambulance but the service could not be made available to them due to adverse weather conditions and due to roads being blocked by fallen trees.Later, two fire service teams equipped with tree cutting machinery cleared the road blockade and carried Sethi in the fire tender to hospital. However, she delivered a baby girl midway in the vehicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-dead-as-cyclone-amphan-crosses-odisha-before-making-landfall-in-bengal/story-DvIAOCX2kG6L4IJtjzaurO.html

21-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This is the 60th edition of a column on Covid-19 I’ve written pretty much everyday since March 19. Perhaps because I write it, I get asked a lot of questions. I have tried to answer some of the common ones here – with data support, wherever possible, so that everyone knows exactly where India stands.Have we flattened the curve in terms of number of cases?No. India saw 5,314 new infections on Tuesday, which marked the end of eight weeks since the lockdown was imposed. The daily numbers have continued to rise. The daily average in Week 1 of the lockdown was 153; in the seven seeks since it has risen, to 531, 876, 1228, 1611, 2560, 3541, and 4494 (the last in Week 8 ended Tuesday). The chart here maps daily cases since March 25 till May 19, and also weekly averages.Have we flattened the curve in terms of number of deaths?No. India saw 5,314 new infections on Tuesday, which marked the end of eight weeks since the lockdown was imposed. The daily numbers have continued to rise. The daily average in Week 1 of the lockdown was 153; in the seven seeks since it has risen, to 531, 876, 1228, 1611, 2560, 3541, and 4494 (the last in Week 8 ended Tuesday). The chart here maps daily cases since March 25 till May 19, and also weekly averagesIs there no good news at all?No; there is good news. The number of people who recover from the coronavirus disease on a daily basis grew steadily – in terms of both weekly averages over the eight weeks and the cumulative number. The recovery rate (number of those recovered expressed as a proportion of the total number of cases) too rose steadily over the eight weeks. The chart here maps all three metrics.What about the death rate?That too has inched down in recent weeks (although this needs caveating).Death rates can be calculated in different ways. This column has taken the so-called Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths expressed as the number of cases. Some experts suggest that a better way to calculate this would be to take the number of cases two weeks back. Indeed, with 53.25% of the cases seen in India being recorded in the past two weeks, this seems logical. But we have stuck to the traditional way of calculating death rates. The chart here maps the death rate on a daily basis since March 25.What’s driving the growth of the pandemic in India?Right now, the states of Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. Indeed this has been the case since March 25. The charts below show the contribution of these four states to the total number of cases in India over these eight weeks; and the growth of infections in these four states and the rest of India over the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-JwfMiWXWUYeKCspJsesyTO.html
21-05-2020||India||Radio operators seek ₹300 crore package||Having received little support from the Centre’s measures to revive the economy reeling under COVID-19 effect, private FM radio operators have appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to approve an economic survival package to keep the severely hit sector afloat.In a letter to the prime minister, signed by AROI president, Anuradha Prasad, the body said: “... we are deeply pained to note that none of these measures [announced by the FM] has any effect, whatsoever, on the private FM radio sector,” said the letter AROI said that the only measure that could provide some relief is the extra credit facility for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and that, too, would benefit only a few radio operators.“Only 31 out of 371 stations are MSMEs, while 340 do not fall into the MSME segment. However, even the 31 out of 371 stations that fall in MSME, cannot avail the benefit, as being heavily dependent on government advertising which has dried up over last one year, they will have no revenue forecasts for repayment to avail the facility,” said the radio operators in the letter.They requested the government to consider an economic survival package for FM Radio.“As FM Radio will pay, over next 12 years or so, about Rs 15,000 crore to the government through migration, license fees, rentals, GST etc, a survival package of Rs 300 crore to keep this media sector alive, is of interest to the nation,” said AROI president, Anuradha Prasad, in the letter.The letter from the radio operators comes at a time when the different segments of the media industry, including the print media and the entertainment industry, have been reeling under losses.The Indian Newspaper Society (INS) had also raised the issue pertaining to the losses suffered by the print industry with the government.The print media industry has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 4500 crore during the months of March and April, the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) had earlier said and sought a stimulus package.A senior government official, when contacted, said the ministry had received a number of requests and representation and they were being looked into.Former Prasar Bharati member V A M Hussain said that even as the people continued to consume news and entertainment there was a definite case as to the effect the present situation would have on their revenues. In case of radio, the restrictions on the movement of vehicles would also deprive them of a number of regular listeners, who would otherwise turn on radio sets while driving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/radio-operators-seek-300-crore-package/story-FW9LT2kj9zL6z2tEX4FKOM.html

21-05-2020||India||3k tested for Covid under Ayushman Bharat: NHA||In the month-and-a-half since treatment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was made free under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (AB-PMJAY), at least 2,000 people have either been treated or are being treated for the viral disease under the world’s largest public health insurance scheme.The number of people who have availed of AB-PMJAY since its launch in September 2018 has, meanwhile, reached 10 million. At least 3,000 people have also been tested cashless for Covid-19 under the scheme.The National Health Authority (NHA), which is the implementing authority of the scheme, has empanelled about 1,500 more hospitals under AB-PMJAY in the past one month to treat Covid-19 patients, the NHA said on Wednesday.“We want to be prepared in case there is a surge in cases. As of now, public sector is taking care of much of the load but if there’s an unusual increase then we would need private sector hospitals also to chip in. We are currently on a drive to add more hospitals to the list. We have created separate Covid treatment packages also as treating these patients requires isolation, PPE [personal protection equipment] kits, extra manpower etc,” said Indu Bhushan, chief executive officer, NHA. The authority is in the process of adding private laboratories for Covid-19 testing that have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research. The rate packages are being used from the already existing category-related to respiratory illnesses, severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness with aggravated symptoms. Responding to the outbreak of Covid-19, the Union ministry of health and family welfare has made the testing and treatment for Covid-19 free of cost under AB-PMJAY scheme for all its 53 crore [530 million] beneficiaries… 2,132 people have availed or are currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 under AB PM-JAY in the country,” NHA said in a statement. NHA teams are also reaching out to its elderly -- those above 60 years of age -- and other high-risk category beneficiaries (who recently received treatment) to check if any of them has Covid symptoms and needs testing through its call entre, which is staffed by about 700 dedicated operators. Close to 30 million such calls have already been made.“Our aim was to call up all of beneficiaries who are above 60 years, recently received treatment and those who have co-morbidities because these are the people at high risk. Our call centre is running 24x7,” said Bhsuhan.The call centre is also being used to get in touch with people identified at potential risk of contracting the infection by the Arogya Setu mobile application, to caution them so that they strictly follow preventive measures. Close to 600,000 people have been contacted and 15,000 tele-consultations facilitated with doctors in the past couple of months.NHA has empanelled 21,565 hospitals under the scheme, of which 1,385 hospitals have been empanelled across the country since April 1. Of the total new hospitals, nearly 58% per cent are private hospitals.The authority is also launching a hospital-ranking dashboard to rank empanelled hospitals on the basis of beneficiaries’ feedback. “The ranking will help NHA to take evidence-based decision-making for enhancing the quality measures and indicators of healthcare delivery across all empanelled facilities to further improve the beneficiaries’ experience,” it said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3k-tested-under-ayushman-bharat-nha/story-0Q5diLoGlDUqdtt7SfP9jN.html
21-05-2020||India||Centre gives nod to Class 10, 12 board exams with social distancing norms||: The Union home ministry on Wednesday gave the go-ahead for conducting pending board exams with preventive measures like social distancing in place while granting them exemption from the ambit of the nationwide lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 pandemic in late March. The move came two days after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) released its revised timetable for examinations of pending papers of Class 10 and 12 between July 1 and 15.The ministry is the nodal agency for disaster management in the country. It is responsible for giving permissions for any activity when the Disaster Management Act, under which the lockdown has been imposed, is in force. Union home minister Amit Shah made the announcement about the permission on Twitter. “Taking into consideration the academic interest of large number of students, it has been decided to grant exemption from the lockdown measures to conduct Board examination for classes 10th & 12th, with few conditions like social distancing, face mask etc, for their safety,” he tweeted.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla separately wrote a letter to all states and Union territories informing them about the conditional exemption citing requests for conducting the examinations. “Taking into consideration the academic interest of large number of students, it has been decided to grant exemption from lockdown measures to conduct Board Examinations for Class 10th and 12th,” the letter said. It added the exemption for exams will be subject to the condition that students, as well as the staff and teachers conducting them, will mandatorily wear face masks and follow social distancing. The letter said that everyone involved will be subject to thermal screening and will use sanitisers. The examinations will be conducted in a staggered manner and that local governments will arrange for transportation of students to the exam centres, it added. The pandemic forced the closure of schools in March and resulted in the suspension of board exams across the country.CBSE will conduct the exams for 12 subjects of Class 12 across the country. The examinations for six subjects of Class 10 will be held in north-east Delhi, where they were postponed because of the communal violence in February. The board had announced a revised schedule in March but the papers could not be conducted due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-gives-nod-to-class-10-12-board-exams-with-social-distancing-norms/story-vx09fGrYZoY3V2qK1LB62M.html
21-05-2020||India||Lockdown 4.0: Is it open? Confusion prevails in states over easing of restrictions||Can you go to office? Can you drive your car across to the next state, or the next city? Can you take public transport? Can you even get a haircut? On March 25, the day India imposed the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, the answer to all these questions was a resounding no. There was one rule, and all citizens had to abide by the restrictions. Today, even as lockdown 4.0 has got officially extended to May 31, the answer to the questions is — depends; depends on where you are and which state jurisdiction has adopted what rules. So if you are in Delhi, you can’t get a hair cut and will have to live with that long beard or unkempt look for some more time, but if you are in Thiruvananthapuram, you can walk into a salon. If you are in Gururgram or Noida, you can drive down to Delhi — but if you are in Delhi, you may not be able drive back to Gurugram or Noida. If you are in Bengaluru, you can work in office at full capacity. But if you have an office in Mumbai, your office can only have one-third of the staff. If you are in Kolkata and need to take a quick auto ride with your spouse, both of you can hop in to one auto rickshaw. But if you are in Delhi, both of you will have to take two separate autos. This, often bewildering, set of rules symbolises lockdown 4.0. Advocates say it is a better reflection of local realities, with states now having the power to decide zones and extent of activity in each area; others believe that this creates confusion for individuals, companies, and even local government authorities. Take companies. A company’s office in Delhi or Bengaluru may have started functioning from Tuesday but its office in the business capital of India, Mumbai, has remained closed, due to the lockdown. Maharashtra government has decided to enforce lockdown 3.0 regulations in Mumbai, in which only 33% of workers are allowed in non-containment areas. Eighteen of the 27 municipal corporations in the state, including all in and around Mumbai, are in the red zone, thereby restricting movement of people.“It (restrictions in Mumbai) has created some functional problems for us, as our head office is in Mumbai,” said a Bengaluru-based systems analyst, Srinivasa Murthy, working with a multinational information technology company. Most companies had to introduce city-specific working protocols as lockdown norms are not same in all cities. “It has added to our work but we have to deal with it,” commented an HR manager in a second Bengaluru-based IT company, who was not willing to be quoted as she was not authorised to speak to media. Or take public transport. After 56 days, public transport — buses, cabs and auto rickshaws — returned to many cities, with different city norms. In Kolkata, only 20 passengers per bus are allowed. In Bengaluru, buses can run up to half of its capacity. Autos in Bengal can carry two passengers and in Delhi only one. But the ease in restrictions has often not translated into passengers, for there appears to be caution.Or take inter-state travel.While Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments have allowed inter-state travel, the administrations in Noida and Gurugram have prohibited it. In Maharashtra, even inter-district travel is difficult. One cannot enter Mumbai from the neighbouring areas of Navi Mumbai and Thane. Given the dense interlinkages that exist between these urban centres, life for many has come to a standstill even if one has to hop across to an adjacent area for work, medical purposes, or family visits. There is an even bigger issue with long-distance travel, with citizens at a loss in the absence of clarity. KC Jain, a cancer survivor, living in Vishal Khand area of Lucknow, wanted to drive down to Jodhpur to bring his wife back. He applied for an e-pass, which was rejected. He does not know whom to approach and whether he will be allowed to travel without a pass in lockdown 4.0. “My wife is stuck in Rajasthan for nearly two months and I want to get her back,” he said.Or take those whose importance in keeping up appearances has firmly got established in this era of lockdown and social distancing — barbers and salons.Kerala and Punjab have allowed barber shops. Delhi and Mumbai have not. Uttarakhand and Rajasthan have come up with strict conditions — only one person is to be allowed inside a barber shop at a time and there must be proper provision of masks, sanitisers and thermal scanners. Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh will allow salons and barber shops from Thursday. Where salons are open, hair cuts are allowed — but not facial services. And the experience of a hair cut itself has changed, for both the customer and the barber. Joseph Mathew walked into a salon in Thiruvananthapuram carrying his own towel, for a haircut, his first during the lockdown, and was surprised to find his barber was covered from head to toe in a protective gear. “I never imagined such a scene,” he said, as two customers got their hair done in distant corners. In normal days, he would have entered the packed air-conditioned saloon and waited for his turn on a sofa watching local Malayalam entertainment channels.Abhay Girdhar, owner of a Ludhiana based salon, said they are not providing services related to “skin and body” to avoid direct contact with the customers. “The customers are also not allowed to enter without masks and shoe covers. Also no one is allowed to accompany the person who gets the appointment,” he said, laying out his own sub set of rules to a state wide rule within a broad national framework. And that is why, in this new phase of lockdown 4.0, if you want to get a hair cut, if you want to visit a friend, if you want to go to work, if you want to drive across a few states to meet your parents, check the rules first. Your location will determine your freedom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-wise-variations-in-new-rules-leave-citizens-puzzled/story-j3GZOsbkPNGmZuwy1opl7K.html
21-05-2020||India||Domestic flight services to resume from May 25||India will resume domestic flights beginning May 25, the government said on Wednesday, announcing a gradual reboot of air travel that was halted two months ago on account of a lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“All airports and air carriers are being informed to be ready for operations from 25th May. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for passenger movement are also being separately issued by civil aviation ministry,” civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri tweeted. The guidelines for air travel are expected on Thursday.The government’s plan for the resumption of services may feature recommending a price band for different routes keeping in mind “the interest of both the consumer and the airline”, a civil aviation ministry official who did not want to be named said.Inside planes, middle seats might not be left vacant though such a proposal was initially on the table, according to the official, who also said measures will be taken to maintain social distancing at airports. On completion of travel, passengers will have to abide by the guidelines laid down by the destination state.In the first phase, the flights are likely to cater to all major Tier-I cities.A draft SOP by the civil aviation ministry earlier this month suggested that cabin luggage will be barred and those above 80 might not be allowed on board for now. It also said passengers’ identity checks will not be required so as to minimise the crowd at terminal gates. But the government was quick to clarify that these were just draft proposals, and that a final call was yet to be taken.Last week, the Airports Authority of India (AAI), which manages 100-odd airports in India, released its own guidelines for passengers, citing the “possibility of domestic flights”. AAI asked travellers to maintain a distance of four feet, wear a mask and other protective gear, wash or sanitise their hands frequently, and carry a 350 ml bottle of sanitiser all the time. Downloading the contact-tracing Aarogya Setu app in mobile phones will be mandatory, and passengers will have to do a web check-in before the journey and a carry a printout of the boarding pass, according to the AAI guidelines.Domestic flight services have been put on hold since March 25, when the nationwide lockdown was first imposed, and international flights have not arrived in India since March 22. Cargo flights and those evacuating foreign nationals have been operating though.Opening the skies for domestic flight services is seen as yet another step by the government in the direction of a graded exit from the lockdown, which has been extended till the end of this month. The curbs have taken a toll on the Indian economy, stalling activities across sectors, including the aviation industry.“We have been prepared for resuming domestic flights for a while and made all necessary arrangements, but states expressed some reservations on resuming the operations in a meeting held a day before the home ministry guidelines were issued,” a second civil aviation ministry official said, referring to the Centre’s May 17 order on the lockdown that listed air travel as a banned activity across the country. Shortly after the announcement on the resumption of flights, the home ministry amended its order, removing domestic air services from the list. A meeting with the chief executive officers (CEOs) of airlines is scheduled to be held on Thursday and the SOP on air travel could be made public after that, according to the second official. The Centre will also issue guidelines for the movement of passengers for reaching airports. On Tuesday, civil aviation minister Puri said state governments should be ready to allow civil aviation operations “in the spirit of cooperative federalism”. “It is not up to the civil aviation ministry or the Centre alone to decide on resuming domestic flights,” he said. Airlines welcomed the government’s move to resume air services.“While the SOP for the resumption of operations and details of flights to be operated is still awaited, we are sure that this much-awaited move will help a large number of passengers by providing them access to the safest and quickest means of transport… We will strictly adhere to social distancing norms and SOPs laid down by the government to ensure the best, the cleanest and the most sanitised flying experience,” said Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, SpiceJet. IndiGo said it is fully prepared for the resumption of flights in a phased manner. “We will share further details and guidelines for passengers, in line with the advisory from the authorities over the next few days,” the private airline said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-flight-services-to-resume-from-may-25/story-Hd8VxgozNWpFqQB4LjnNgO.html
21-05-2020||India||Destruction in Odisha, West Bengal as cyclone Amphan strikes||Cyclone Amphan roared into West Bengal around 20km east of Sagar Island in the Sunderbans on Wednesday, packing winds gusting to a top speed of 185 kmph, triggering torrential rain and leaving a trail of devastation across a wide swath of the state, from deltaic regions to the urban neighbourhoods of Kolkata.Amphan, the most severe storm in the Bay of Bengal since the Odisha super cyclone of 1999, made landfall between 3.30pm and 5.30pm, flattening houses, uprooting trees and electric pylons, causing rivers to swell and breach their embankments, and killing at least three people in two states according to initial reports. Two women died in West Bengal; both crushed by falling trees in Howrah district and in the Minakhan area of North 24 Parganas. Earlier in the day, a two-month-old baby was killed in a wall collapse on Wednesday morning after heavy overnight rains in neighbouring Odisha’s Bhadrak district. “It’s an intense and devastating storm. It is a multi-hazard scenario with heavy rain, strong winds and tidal surge all at the same time. It must have inundated large areas,” said M Mohapatra, director general of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).At least 658,000 people were evacuated in West Bengal and Odisha before the cyclone struck. The destruction may be massive, which cannot be assessed at the moment, as the storm will remain in West Bengal as a cyclone until Thursday morning. It crossed the state and Bangladesh coasts by 7pm on Wednesday and moved north-northeastwards, IMD said in a bulletin.“The losses will be at three levels — loss to life and property because the storm was tremendous; loss to basic infrastructure, which will take months to leap back to normalcy, and thirdly, loss to livelihoods due to saline water intrusion and large-scale inundation. I have received reports of embankment breaks from Sagar Island, Ramganga, Hingalganj and a few other places. Many embankments are seeing overtopping of water because the rivers have swelled up, these will break in days,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said a task force constituted to assess the damage will meet on Thursday. She advised people in shelter homes not to step out for the next 12 days, saying there has been a “huge devastation”. “Bridges and embankments in the Sunderbans have been damaged,” she said.Described by weather scientists as a very severe cyclonic storm bordering on an extremely severe cyclonic storm, Amphan packed winds with a speed of 155 to 165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph. A storm is described as an extremely severe cyclone when wind speeds reach between 167 and 221 kmph. A super cyclone of the 1999 Odisha kind, which killed 9,000 people, packs a wind velocity of more than 222 kmph.“If you consider Amphan’s intensity during its lifetime, then it is the most intense since the 1999 super cyclone. But the 1999 cyclone made landfall as a super cyclone; this one weakened marginally during landfall,” said Mohapatra.IMD had forecast a storm surge of 4 to 5 metres above the astronomical tide that was expected to inundate low- lying areas of South and North 24 Parganas and parts of East Midnapore district during landfall. Extremely strong winds of 100 to 120 kmph lashed Kolkata, Howrah and Hooghly, according to IMD.Experts said residents of the deltaic areas of the Sunderbans could face an impact on their livelihoods for years to come because of large-scale inundation and saline water intrusion onto their lands.“Saline intrusion will make soil infertile and damage crops. The soil may not be suitable for agriculture for three to five years. After cyclone Aila (in 2009), there a layer of salt had settled on the soil,” Ghosh added.Meteorologists and climate scientists had said on Monday the intensity of Amphan was 145 knots or 270 kmph. The wind speed makes it the strongest cyclone ever in Bay of Bengal, passing the 1999 Odisha cyclone’s wind speed of 260 kmph, tweeted meteorologist Eric Holthous, based on data from the US-based Joint Typhoon Warning Centre.Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said the Bay of Bengal recorded sea surface temperature of 32 to 34 degrees Celsius prior to the formation of cyclone Amphan. Record warming of the ocean surface may have led to very rapid intensification of Amphan from a category 1 to category 5 cyclone in just 18 hours.Subol Maity, a resident of Rakshas Khali in South 24 Parganas, said thousands of mud-brick houses had been razed and that his family had lost everything — “ our farms, our homes, our cattle”. “I don’t think there is anything left to survive with,” he said.Cyclone Amphan struck the country at a time it is struggling to control the spread of the coronavirus disease. Rescue workers in both Odisha and West Bengal said the fear of being infected by Covid-19 in cyclone shelters made many people refuse to be evacuated, with the authorities having to resort to force to move them to safety. In West Bengal, some evacuees said they would rather die in their own houses than risk infection in cyclone shelters. “There were some people who refused to move to cyclone shelters. We first tried to convince them. When it didn’t work we used force,” said a block development officer in South 24 Parganas.National Disaster Response Force chief SN Pradhan told a press conference in New Delhi that 20 teams of the federal force had already begun road clearing operations in Odisha while the 19 units deployed in West Bengal were shifting people to safety.Quoting figures made available by the two states, Pradhan said over 500,000 people were evacuated in West Bengal and 158,000 in Odisha, where the rains and high-velocity winds is expected to weaken by late Wednesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/destruction-in-odisha-wb-as-amphan-strikes/story-bjWpSNfAbeU5oZo55M3EkO.html
21-05-2020||India||Hizbul man wanted for multiple murders held||A Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist allegedly involved in the killing of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, his brother, and a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary in Jammu & Kashmir Kishtwar was arrested on Tuesday in a fresh setback to the outfit that has lost its top commanders this month.Senior police superintendent (Kishtwar) Harmeet Singh Mehta said Rustam Ali was involved in the killings of BJP leader Anil Parihar, his brother, as well as RSS’s Chandrakant Sharma and his guard. The Parihar brothers were killed in November 2018 and Sharma and his bodyguard five months later in April 2019. Mehta said Ali has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency, which took him to Jammu. The cases were handed over to the federal anti-terror agency last year.Police said Ali was a close associate of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo, 35, who carried a bounty of Rs 12 lakh on his head and was killed in Pulwama district on May 6. Another top commander of the group, Junaid Ashraf Khan, was among two terrorists killed in an overnight gunbattle with security forces in Srinagar’s Nawakadal area on TuesdayTahir Bhat, an alleged Hizbul Mujahideen recruiter, was killed in Doda district on Monday. Bhat was allegedly assigned the task of carrying out fresh recruits while Ali was doing the same in the adjoining Kishtwar district. He is also believed to have had a role in Sharma and his guard’s murder.Security forces have now launched a manhunt for the region’s oldest surviving terrorist, Jehangir Saroori. “This militant is hiding in the upper reaches of Marwah and Dachhan belt in Kishtwar district adjoining Doda district. He is the oldest surviving terrorist in Jammu & Kashmir and carries an award of around Rs 50 lakh on his head...,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity.He added security forces have intensified operations to nab the terrorist but a difficult terrain and lack of technical intelligence has allowed him to remain at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hizb-man-wanted-for-multiple-murders-held/story-aPpwPMorn8W7jsof9B5cdN.html
21-05-2020||India||Govt asks Assam to probe PM-KISAN fraud charges||The Union agriculture ministry has asked the Assam government for a report and a probe into a potential fraud in PM-KISAN, the federal cash-transfer programme for farmers, which allowed non-farmers to get cash in the state as authorities halted further payments, an official said, requesting anonymity. Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal has ordered investigations under the watch of a top state bureaucrat, who will give his report in a month, the chief minister’s office said in a statement on Monday. The Centre is likely to advise a category of states with more relaxed enrolment norms to clean up beneficiary lists, the official added. “The responsibility of identification of beneficiary rests with the states,” this person said. “It is for the state to then initiate criminal proceedings and recover the money.” The possibility of ineligible people posing as farmers and enrolling in the scheme heightened after a software that manages the programme found sampling errors of land records not adding up, according to a second official familiar with the matter. Field officials in Assam are scrambling to vet beneficiaries. “We have been able to identify 9,000 ineligible beneficiaries in our district,” Prabin Saikia, an agriculture department official scrutinising records in northern Assam’s Lakhimpur, a tea-growing district, said. There has been communication between the Centre and the state on the issue, the first official said. In Guwahati, Pushpadhar Das, a farm expert, said it appeared that people who got counted in “include pensioners, non-farmers, income-tax payers” and that “names of more than one person from each family” are on the list. Under PM-KISAN, the government provides income support of Rs 6000 a year to farmers with a valid enrolment, paid in three equal cash transfers of Rs 2000 -- one every four months. It was launched on 24 February 2019, when the first instalment was paid. In the last tranche, paid in April amid the lockdown, nearly 70.7 million farmers were given Rs 16000 crore under the programme.Cash support under PM-KISAN is given to “a farmer family comprising husband, wife and minor children who own cultivable land as per land records,” according to the programme’s manual.In all states, barring the Northeast and Jharkhand, farmers need to offer four sets of documents to be eligible for cash: updated land records, the 12-digit biometric Aadhaar, phone number with know-your-customer-proof and bank details. These are then converted into data and “triangulated” (or cross-linked and verified) through a software, known as the public financial management system (PMFS), that enables automatic transfer of cash into bank accounts. The PMFS, the backbone of direct benefit transfers, is designed to reject any claim if the “triangulation” doesn’t match. Not all of the above-cited documents however are mandatory for northeastern states, where Aadhaar penetration is below 6%, according to the Union government’s Report on Doubling Farmers’ Income. “In some of the northeastern states, land ownership rights are community based and it might not be possible to assess the quantum of land-holder farmers,” the second federal official said. This could have allowed the breach, he said. “Human errors have occurred where data-entry operators failed to match names of beneficiaries and their villages correctly, but most others were intentional inclusion of names of ineligible persons,” Das said in Guwahati.Scamsters gained advantage of a hurried roll-out of the scheme in 2019 and relaxed norms, Das added. “Unintentional errors as well as falsification of records took place. Some say there was a competition among officials on who could enter more names.”The Assam government had already ordered re-verification of beneficiaries before a probe was announced. The deadline for it is mid-June.“These things are bound to be caught eventually because as and when records are updated, the software is designed to do its job of spotting fraud and rejecting claims. The largest rejections have happened in Uttar Pradesh,” said KS Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. Mani cautioned that northeast could see problems in future too because the PFMS is an Aadhaar-based platform and disbursal for northeast and Jharkhand is made through the PFMS without the authenticity-ascertaining process of triangulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-assam-to-probe-pm-kisan-fraud-charges/story-TfONI4yZT3kgmQ78ZuCZiL.html
21-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan: Rescue operations hampered because of Covid fears||Rescuers had a tough time convincing many people to move to shelters in Odisha and West Bengal before Cyclone Amphan tore into eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday because of fears of contracting Covid-19. Authorities in West Bengal said they were even forced to resort to force in some cases to evacuate people as some of them insisted they would rather die in their own houses than risk contracting the infection in the shelters. “There were some people who refused to move to cyclone shelters. We first tried to convince them. When it did not work, we used force,” said an official in South 24 Parganas district.Officials said there were hardly any Covid-19 patients in remote coastal villages in the state from where around 300,000 people have been were evacuated. They added enforcing the directives to avoid Covid-19 spread in the shelters will be challenging. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday warned officials would try to enforce social distancing in the shelters, but it may not be possible as the priority will be to save lives from the cyclone.Some cyclone shelters are being used exclusively as quarantine centres for migrant workers returning from other states. The administration has also earmarked hundreds of school and colleges to accommodate the evacuees and stocked them with masks and sanitizers. South 24 Parganas district magistrate P Ulaganathan said nodal officers have been deputed for each shelter and frontline workers have been equipped with personal protection equipment in view of the pandemic. His East Midnapore counterpart, Partha Ghosh, said to ensure that social distancing is maintained, they spread the evacuees across over nearly 600 schools and colleges.The evacuation process was particularly challenging in Odisha, which has reported a surge in Covid-19 infections with 70-80 fresh cases daily. The government initially estimated that 1.1 million people across 12 districts needed to be relocated, but it revised its figures after India Meteorological Department said only Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur may be affected. The authorities had earlier turned some multi-purpose cyclone shelters into quarantine centres. But as the cyclone approached, suspected patients with no symptoms were asked to stay under home quarantine. “Those shelters were then sanitised and used for cyclone evacuees,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Odisha has earmarked about 600 cyclone shelters and 7,000 other buildings for the evacuees from coastal areas. Officials said many resisted evacuation in Covid 19 red zone of Balasore citing concerns over social distancing measures. “Some families in the Talasari area, where the cyclone was initially expected to land, did not want to move. We had to advice them to at least shift to a neighbour’s concrete house,” said an official.Bhadrak district collector Gyana Ranjan Das said they managed to shift over 31,000 people to over 500 shelters with social distancing measures in place with great difficulty. “We also had to ensure that no migrant workers returning from various states were walking when Cyclone Amphan moved across the Odisha coast.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescue-operations-hampered-because-of-covid-fears/story-SrZG2QVNrVKxjjp8eV6mMP.html
21-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan ravages Odisha, Bengal; leaves behind trail of destruction||Cyclone Amphan, which hit India’s eastern coast with winds gusting up to 185 kph on Wednesday, first barrelled along the Odisha coast with a maximum speed between 100-120 kph in Paradip and Dhamra in Bhadrak district before hitting Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, and Balasore. It uprooted trees, traffic signals, electric police and left nearly 3.4 million people without electricity, officials said.Special relief commissioner Pradip Jena said over 90% of the state’s telecom infrastructure, however, remained unaffected. He added the administration has begun clearing roads in the four affected districts with the help of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams. Jena said the state government’s target is to clear the stretches where trees have been uprooted and restore road communication in 12 hours. Efforts are on to restore power supply as soon as possible, he added.NDRF chief S N Pradhan told a press conference in New Delhi that 20 teams of the federal disaster response force had begun the road clearing operations in Odisha, while the 19 units deployed in West Bengal were shifting people to safety.Jena said the Odisha government has asked collectors of the affected districts to submit preliminary assessment reports on the damage caused within two days. He added the cyclone has caused damage to some government buildings and structures, affected agriculture and horticulture sectors, houses and power infrastructure.Jena said a crop advisory, prepared by the Directorate of Agriculture for protection of matured and harvested paddy as well as non-paddy, had been issued for wide circulation among the field functionaries and farmers. “Awareness camps and mike announcements were also taken up in different villages to shift the harvested crops and grains to a safer place,” he added. A 20-year old woman delivered her baby in a fire service vehicle while being taken to a hospital in Kendrapara district. Officials said an ambulance was unable to reach her village because of the adverse weather and closure of a road due to uprooted trees. A fire service team used tree-cutting machinery to clear the road and transport the woman. The mother and infant were later admitted to the hospital and said to be out of danger.The cyclone made landfall in Digha in coastal West Bengal with a sustained wind speed of 155-165 kph. The speed weakened to 130 kph when it reached Kolkata and uprooted trees, traffic signals and blocked arterial roads. Some portions of dilapidated buildings in the city collapsed.Reports from coastal Bengal indicated that thousands of mud houses had collapsed and embankments were breached with saline water gushing into villages in several districts in the Sundarbans region. West Bengal chief Mamata Banerjee told reporters that several areas were totally cut off and cannot be reached yet. “We have no information yet. It will take at least 3-4 days to assess the damage,” Banerjee said. She added South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas districts were “totally devastated”. “There are 500,000 people in relief centres,” Banerjee said. Banerjee will remain at the state secretariat, where she has been camping since Tuesday to oversee relief operations and take stock of the damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amphan-ravages-odisha-bengal-leaves-behind-trail-of-destruction/story-IIQHROEtAmSje4KJX3uN2K.html

21-05-2020||India||Don’t wait for last leg of service to probe govt officials: CVC directive||In his first major directive since taking over the new Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) last month, Sanjay Kothari has instructed all ministries and government departments to conduct internal investigations or disciplinary proceedings against public servants much before they are due to retire. The Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs) and administrative authorities have also been asked to send requests for investigation of such officers to CVC by the first week of the month in which they are supposed to retire. CVC, the apex vigilance body that vets complaints related to corruption or disciplinary action against government employees, has been reminding ministries and departments since 2007 to prioritize the cases against officers “due to retire shortly”. The last time such a reminder was sent was in July 2019 -- and it went along with a warning that action will be taken against erring CVOs, as first reported by HT.“There is no progress and ministries/CVOs continue to delay disciplinary proceedings/actions or investigations against public servants. This benefits that particular public servant as CVC is not usually able to give its advice in time. Some references are sent to us a few days before the retirement,” said a CVC official who didn’t wish to be named.He added that central public sector units (CPSUs) and public sector banks (PSBs) are the worst offenders wen it comes to this -- sending vigilance and investigation cases to the commission seeking its advice at the last moment.“Disciplinary proceedings at the fag end of a public servant’s career are of no use. If there is a complaint much before, CVOs should act so that action can be taken while the person is still in service,” said another CVC officer who asked not to be named.CVOs posted in every government department are responsible for finalising a disciplinary proceeding against officials indulging in any activity in violation of the norms or forwarding serious corruption complaints to CVC so that a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) can be requested if required.In its letter to all the government departments last week, which has been reviewed by HT, CVC said: “The Commission, vide its letters in 2007, 2011 and 2019, had directed CVOs of all ministries/departments/organizations to ensure expeditious finalization of disciplinary proceedings/action, particularly in respect of officials likely to retire shortly”.“The Commission had specifically impressed upon the vigilance functionaries as well as administrative authorities concerned the need to prioritize the activities of conducting investigations and completion of disciplinary action well in advance so as to avoid such late references to the Commission,” it added.Departments and ministries have been asked to send all retirement cases for its advice by 5 pm on the 10th of every month.  CVC is a statutory body and derives its powers from Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2013. It is free of control from any executive authority and has the responsibility of monitoring all vigilance activities in the federal government besides advising various authorities on planning, executing, reviewing and reforming their vigilance work. A major part of its work is to refer important corruption activities to CBIR S Sharma, former Chairman and Managing Director of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said: “A public servant gets all his provident fund or gratuity benefit when he is retiring. If any complaint pertaining to disciplinary proceedings against him/her is not processed in time, CVC may not be able to complete its investigation in time and minor or major penalty cannot be given.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-wait-for-last-leg-of-service-to-probe-govt-officials-cvc-directive/story-3NkXXWOR73nv8t6PVoqETN.html
21-05-2020||India||Lok Sabha Speaker suggests ideas for parl panels||The average refilling rate of gas cylinders under the Ujwala Scheme vis-à-vis the normal cylinders, identifying villages along India’s international borders where no government authority has ever visited, the transmission and distribution losses and leakages of electricity in different states, and the renaming of a standing committee—Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, in a rare move, has suggested a host of ideas for parliamentary committees to consider.During a performance review of 16 department-related standing committees under the Lok Sabha on May 12 and 13, the Speaker also emphasized that the panels should work with an eye on the last people in line and keep them at the centre of their recommendations.It is unusual for the Lok Sabha Speaker to suggest topics for discussion for panels but experts pointed out that the Speaker or the Rajya Sabah chairman are within their rights to give constructive suggestions for panels to consider. “The Lok Sabha Speaker and the Rajya Sabha chairman constitute the panels under their respective houses, and these panels also work largely under the guidance of the presiding officers” said a senior functionary of the Lok Sabha who asked not to be named.A second official of the Lok Sabha added on condition of anonymity that these are “not directions of the Speaker but ideas for the panels to consider.”Indian Parliament has 24 department related standing panels out of which 16 belong to Lok Sabha and the remaining come under the purview of the Upper House.During the performance review of the panels for the last financial year, Birla also sought a report on the attendance of MPs in panel meetings. According to an official, Birla is also open to shifting MPs with low attendance to other panels to maximize their contribution.Birla even suggested a discussion between the chairman of the agriculture panel and ministry officials on Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana, a key crop insurance scheme for the farmers. He wanted the Committee on Urban Development to be renamed as panel on Housing and Urban Development in line with the ministry’s name.For the railways panel, the Speaker suggested looking into the use of land along railway lines to develop horticulture, floriculture and solar power plants, privatization in Railways, and a review of historical hikes in passenger and freight fares. “The committee should also discuss increasing transporting goods through railways, the location of rail corridors, modernisation of rail godowns and use of machines for loading and unloading of goods etc,” Birla suggested at the meeting.This was the first comprehensive review of the panels in many years, said the two officials, and it is part of efforts to improve the efficiency of Parliamentary panels. The parliamentary committees, established in 1993, are seen as an extension of the house and are responsible for handling matters that can’t be taken up due to time constraints. Birla, who is envisaging structural reforms in the functioning of Indian Parliament, has also asked for detailed background notes for panels, a compilation of major recommendations of all committees which have had a significant impact on common citizens, and a report on recommendations which have an impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-speaker-suggests-ideas-for-parl-panels/story-py2xFwQkol3ti6BAFS8q3K.html
21-05-2020||India||Reach of locusts wider due to lack of crops||Locusts coming from Pakistan to Rajasthan are travelling far and wide into the state because of a lack of crops in fields, officials said on Wednesday. According to the officials, swarms were now reported from districts such as Bundi, Sikar, Pratapgarh and Chittorgarh, hundreds of kilometres from the border.“There’s no crop in the fields. Unable to find settling grounds and crops to devour, locust swarms are travelling far in search of food. The insects...fly at the sound of tractors or at sight of light when we launch control operations at night,” said Om Prakash, agriculture commissioner.Locusts are large grasshoppers with strong flight ability. They are usually solitary, but when there is a significant rise in population, they travel in vast swarms for food, causing extensive damage to vegetation. The species found in India are known as desert locust.Locust outbreak was reported in Rajasthan in May 2019 after a gap of 26 years and the attack continued until this February, damaging crop on at least 670,000 hectares across 12 districts, according to the state government. The state pegged the loss at ~1,000 crore.The Locust Warning Organization (LWO) of the Union ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare warned of another attack in May-June 2020. It began in Ganganagar, a north Rajasthan district bordering Pakistan, on May 11. In 2019, the swarms were first spotted in Jaisalmer, another border district.The agriculture commissioner said locusts generally settle on vegetation after sunset and fly again at around 9-10 am the next day, giving control teams enough time to spray pesticides.“This year, we are able to launch control efforts only around midnight because they are settling late. The current breed of locusts unsettles on hearing sound of tractors, making our job more difficult. An unsettled swarm is highly mobile and can as much as 150km a day if winds are favourable. These swarms can devour large amounts of vegetation and crops. The saving grace is, there’s no crop. So there’s no damage,” LWO deputy director KL Gurjar said.Many districts that didn’t report swarms last year – such as Sirohi, Ajmer, Bhilwara, Pali, Pratapgarh, Sikar and Jhunjhunu – are reporting such attacks this year. So far, locusts have been reported from 16 of Rajasthan’s 33 districts.Officials said the desert locust has always been a major threat and just one small swarm can eat the same amount of crops in one day as 35,000 people. “Currently, they are settling on babool and khejdi trees,” Prakash said. The state agriculture department has controlled the outbreak on around 40,000 hectares, he added. Agriculture minister Lal Chand Kataria said the state government provided 45 vehicles to LWO for their sprayers and deployed 70 more for field surveys. He said 600 tractor-mounted sprayers were also involved in control operations. “We have also invited bids for drones to spray pesticides in areas inaccessible to the vehicles,” he said.LWO sprayers can reach up to 7-8 feet from the ground level, and those on tractors go up to 15-20 feet. The department has engaged fire tenders to reach greater heights. “Around 150 teams are working in 14 districts to identify places where control operations need to be launched,” the minister said.The department, he said, has provisioned Rs 5 crore for vehicles and Rs10 crore for providing plant protection chemicals to farmers at 100% grant.According to a status report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), hopper groups, bands, and adult groups are present on the India-Pakistan border on both sides. “Migration from the spring breeding areas in Baluchistan has commenced, and several immature adult groups and swarms have appeared in Rajasthan,” it said in the report published on its website.FAO has also released a global forecast, which says locust swarms from new areas can also enter the Indian border from June 22, worsening the current outbreak.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice in April and in May to seek the Centre’s help in dealing with locust attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reach-of-locusts-wider-due-to-lack-of-crops/story-9SFlw3ZkrLMqCtEoPh4AyI.html
21-05-2020||India||‘Lockdown announced without any planning,’ says Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel speaks to Hindustan Times on cash-transfer scheme Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna that is expected to benefit 1.9 million farmers, the Centre’s response to the Covid-19 crisis and how his state is dealing with migrant labourers. Edited excerpts: Firstly, most of the land in Chhattisgarh is non-irrigated, and most of the farmers are marginal and face the possibility of drought in their region. Secondly, about 40% population of the state lives below poverty line. Last year, we initiated many measures to help paddy farmers. This year, we decided to extend the benefits to sugarcane and maize farmers as well [the new scheme will benefit paddy, maize and sugarcane farmers]...The aim is to increase the income of the farmers and people...It [scheme] includes 90% of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and state’s marginal farmers.We are launching one more scheme for landless labourers to benefit more people. I have constituted a committee today [Wednesday]. In the next two months it will submit a report; on the basis of that [report] a scheme for these landless labourers will also be framed by the government. We are working on the numbers and structure of that scheme, and we hope that more people will be benefitted.The central government always believes in ‘events’. The government announced demonetisation [of high-value banknotes in 2016] and launched the GST (goods and services tax) in the night. Similarly, the central government announced the lockdown in the country without any planning...There was no strategy or management before or after the lockdown.If the central government was aware that the whole world was suffering due to the pandemic..., it should have been prepared... There are millions of migrants in different states. Why did the central government not start trains before the lockdown? They should have sent the migrant labourers or anyone stranded home before the lockdown... Migrants are dying and the kind of suffering everyone is facing should have been controlled.The central government announced a package of Rs 20 lakh crore, which includes Rs 1.7 lakh that was announced earlier...We, as a state, got some direct benefits. They announced that 5kg rice will be given to people for two months, but this should be extended for a year… I have asked twice to provide Rs 30,000 crore to our to encourage economic activity and give direct cash to the poor, but the Centre has not responded…We have arranged for buses, food, and medical facilities for the labourers passing through our state. We have deployed buses to ferry them to their states and are very empathetic towards them. Officials have been instructed to take care of them.Everything could not go smooth in this situation... which other state is doing what we are doing for the migrants of our country? We are ferrying migrants of seven states. Every day, over 12,000 people are reaching Chhattisgarh [from different states], and we are ferrying them to their home states. There are incidents in other states of police beating migrants. Tell me [about] one [such] incident in my state. We are very empathetic towards migrants and poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-announced-without-any-planning-bhupesh-baghel/story-kBlbUFFyZLw9cuWe9HuYnI.html
21-05-2020||India||Only 6% cases need hospitalisation, over 40,000 have recovered: Govt||Just about 6.39% of active coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India need hospitalisation, according to the latest government data that indicates the outbreak has not been as severe in the country as in certain other countries. Only 0.45% of Covid-19 patients in India need ventilator support currently, compared to the estimated 2-3% globally. Intensive care treatment was being provided to about 3% cases as of Wednesday.Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health, said the recovery rate of patients has also improved from the earlier 7.1% in late March when the lockdown to check the pandemic spread was imposed to the current 39.62%. “It is a positive sign to see that more than 40,000 positive cases have recovered, and those needing hospitalisation are much less than global figures,” said Agarwal at a briefing on Wednesday.Agarwal said 15 worst-hit countries with over 1.4 billion population have reported 3.6 million cases. He added India has a population of 1.37 billion population but has reported just around 100,000 cases so far.“[The] 15 countries have reported at least 34 times more cases and 83 times more deaths as compared to India, which says a lot about measures taken by us to manage the situation. India’s focus has always been on taking preventive action,” said Agarwal.India has only 7.9 cases per 100,000 population compared to 62.3 globally. The global average rate is 4.2 deaths per 100,000 population while in India, it is 0.2. The government has attributed this to timely case identification and clinical management.India’s testing capacity has also been strengthened. Over 100,000 tests have been conducted daily since Monday. With 1,07,609 Covid-19 tests since Tuesday, their number has gone up to over 2.5 million in 555 labs.“Of all the labs active for Covid testing in India, 391 are part of the Indian Council of Medical Research [ICMR] network and 164 are private... Of all the samples tested in a single day, 89,466 were tested in government labs and 18,143 in private laboratories,” said Dr RR Gangakhedkar, who heads ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable disease division. He confirmed the government was in the process of reviewing the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis and treatment modality for Covid-19. Dr Jugal Kishore, who heads the community medicine department at Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi, said the Covid-19 lockdown was supposed to buy time, which it has managed to do. “...and to consolidate the gains, people will now need to incorporate the behavioural changes for good such as avoiding mass gatherings, wearing masks, maintaining hygiene, following cough etiquettes, and staying at home if feeling sick,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-6-cases-need-hospitalisation-over-40-000-have-recovered-govt/story-4jTOt7S5TNhKpPzaBZ0YQI.html
21-05-2020||India||After weeks of discussions, govt clears air travel||On May 11, Indian Railways announced it would run special trains to 15 destinations from Delhi, and back. By then, the union government had already started discussing the resumption of flight services, top government officials involved in the process said on condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, the government announced the resumption of limited flight services, starting Monday, May 25. As a first step, the officials said, the ministry of home affairs and health started initial discussions with the civil aviation ministry, the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and airlines in the last week of April. The brief was that only limited flights should be considered.“But as complex negotiations involving private airlines took a long time, the standard operating procedure could not be finalized before the union government announced Lockdown 4.0 on May 17,” said one of the officials cited in the first instance. Running the special trains for workers or even the trains to and from Delhi was relatively easier as only government agencies, the union government and the states were involved, a second official said. “The private airlines were keen to resume services as they were incurring heavy losses, but at the same time , they were aware that they had to balance safety and health concerns. We too, had to factor in the business aspect; many other sectors were slowly being opened up to restart operations,” said the first official.The airlines sent dozens of queries pertaining, at time, to even minute details such as what are the safety measures to be adopted for different types passengers and the pilots and air hostesses. The airport authority of India was entrusted to come up with a plan on how social distancing and other health norms could be ensured in an airport.The Prime Minister’s Office, a third official said, was clear that only select routes would be opened and that planes would not fly to capacity . This person added that the norms that the airlines and airports will have to follow have factored in inputs from the home and heath ministries. According to the officials, discussions with the states started soon after; many were open to the idea, although two large states were sceptical . “Even as aviation is completely managed by the union government, states too, have an important role to play. And in this situation of pandemic, the top brass of the Centre would be reluctant to open new transport facilities without taking the states on board,” said the third official.On Wednesday, aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted: “Domestic civil aviation operations will recommence in a calibrated manner from Monday 25th May 2020. All airports and air carriers are being informed to be ready for operations from 25th May. SOPs for passenger movement are also being separately issued by civil aviation ministry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-weeks-of-discussions-govt-clears-air-travel/story-nvlX6BCZ278TqQFFA2nTkM.html
21-05-2020||India||Bharat Biotech ties up with US varsity for Covid vaccine||Bharat Biotech has partnered with the US-based Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) to develop its experimental vaccine Coravax against Covid-19 under the accelerated development programme.This is the third vaccine candidates that the Hyderabad-based vaccine major is working on using two different platforms. One uses the nasal flu backbone to deliver Sars-CoV2 genetic material to produce an immune response, while two use the deactivated rabies vaccine as a vector.The new viral-vector vaccine candidate, which was developed by TJU researchers in January, has recently completed preliminary trials in animal models that show a strong antibody response in vaccinated mice. The data on whether it protects vaccinated animals against Sars-CoV-2 is expected next month.The vaccine uses a proven deactivated rabies vaccine as a carrier for the genetic code of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein, which the virus uses to enter human cells and cause infection.The rabies vaccine has been shown to generate a rigorous but safe immune reaction that confers lifelong protection. “Since we know the immune system reacts to the rabies vaccine with a strong response, when we add the coronavirus component, we expect to see that level of protection and immune memory carry over to the Sars-CoV-2 viral protein as well,” said Matthias Schnell, director of Jefferson Vaccine Center in Philadelphia.Bharat Biotech is the world’s largest supplier of rabies vaccines and the rabies carrier vaccine being used is approved for use in the whole population, including children and pregnant women.“We are particularly excited about this technology since the basic proof of concept has been established while using it for other pandemic infectious diseases. Bharat Biotech will be involved in an end-to-end development of the vaccine, including comprehensive clinical trials to achieve commercial licensure,” said Dr Krishna Mohan, CEO, Bharat Biotech.With support from the Department of Biotechnology under the Ministry of Science and Technology, the company plans to begin human trials by December 2020.Global efforts to develop a vaccine against Covid-19 are proceeding at an unprecedented pace and scale, with companies using established platforms and parallel vaccine development phases to fast-track development. Vaccine development, from lab to market, on average takes a decade.Scientists are using a massive range of new technology platforms for vaccine development, including nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), virus-like particles, peptides, viral vectors (replicating and non-replicating), recombinant proteins, live attenuated virus and inactivated virus approaches, many of which have never before been used to develop vaccines that are currently licenced for use.Around 25 groups are working on viral-vector vaccines, in which a virus such as rabies or adenovirus is genetically engineered so it can produce coronavirus proteins within the body without causing disease. “Most vaccine development focuses on identifying the genetic code of the spike protein that Sars-CoV-2 uses to enter human cells, which is then used in the vaccine to trigger an immune response against subsequent exposure in people who are vaccinated. The Bharat Biotech project is moving very fast,” said Dr NK Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“Our partnership with Bharat Biotech will accelerate our vaccine candidate through the next phases of development and we be able to complete animal testing and move to phase-1 clinical trial rapidly,” said Schnell, whose centre has previously used this approach to confer strong immunity in animal models against coronaviruses that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle eastern respiratory syndrome.Under the licence agreement, Bharat Biotech gains exclusive rights to develop, market and deliver Jefferson’s vaccine across the world, excluding in the US, Europe, and Japan, where Jefferson continues to seek partners.The other potential vaccines that have Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (Birac) funding are Bharat Biotech’s second rabies vector vaccine that being developed in partnership with ICMR-National Institute of Virology in Pune, and Ahmedabad-based Cadila Pharmaceuticals vaccine project that uses recombinant DNA technology.Birac is also supporting Pune-based Serum Institute of India’s phase III trials to determine whether the vaccine candidate, VPM1002, which was developed against tuberculosis by scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, also protects against Sars-CoV-2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-ties-up-with-us-varsity-for-covid-vaccine/story-dyJPOzW2G2rXcwsa9XV3tL.html
21-05-2020||India||Covid-19 crisis: Asymptomatic people can infect surfaces||In a finding that has major implications for people using public transport and sharing office space as the lockdown is relaxed in India, a study has found that asymptomatic and presymtomatic people with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are highly infectious and can extensively contaminate the environment in a very short time.Different surfaces in the hotel rooms of two students, who returned to China from studying abroad on March 19 and March 20, without symptoms were tested three hours after they tested positive on the second day in quarantine, according to the study.Eight of the 22 samples collected from the two rooms tested positive for Covid-19.These included door handles, light switches, faucets, thermometers, TV remotes, pillows, duvet covers, sheets, towels, bathroom door handles, toilet seats and flushing buttons, said the study, which was published in Emerging Infectious Diseases journal of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“The detection of Sars-CoV-2 RNA (genetic material) in the surface samples of the sheet, duvet cover, and pillow cover highlights the importance of proper handling procedures when changing or laundering used linens of SARS-CoV-2 patients,” concluded researchers.What has fuelled the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic is the long incubation period of the infection, which, on average, takes 5.1 days to show symptoms, according to a study published in March in The Annals of Internal Medicine. During this period, patients do not develop symptoms of cough, fever or difficulty in breathing but begin spreading the infection.Some people have no symptoms because they have mild disease or because they are pre-symptomatic, but they can be highly infective. Young, healthy people are more likely to have mild or no symptoms compared to older people and those with chronic illnesses.“Studies show infected people take on average five to six days to develop symptoms, but are infective from day one. Lockdowns prevent undiagnosed infected people from stepping out and infecting others, but with less restricted travel, chances of exposure increase, especially because it is a younger, healthier workforce that is the most mobile,” said Dr Ambarish Dutta, associate professor of epidemiology and public health, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar. An earlier study published in the journal, Nature Medicine, on April 15 found around 44% infections were spread by people with no symptoms, with people with Covid-19 being the most infectious two or three days before the symptoms appear. Another study in March found 48% cases in Singapore and 62% in Tianjin, China, were spread by people with no symptoms.The risk of infection and severe disease is higher in older people, men, the obese, the poor, those living in densely populated areas, and people with chronic kidney disease.“As lockdown lifts and people become mobile, social distancing, wearing masks and hand washing will be the only defence against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), for which there is no approved vaccine or cure,” said Dr Dutta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asymptomatic-people-can-infect-surfaces/story-9kQUjvmp1c2GPIxf4OeheP.html
21-05-2020||India||Two-metre distance may not be enough: Study||Droplets of saliva can travel as far as six metres even in low wind speeds of 4kmph, a new study has found, indicating that current social distancing guidelines of two metres may be insufficient to stop a Covid-19 patient from transmitting the disease. The study, published in the Physics of Fluids journal under the American Institute of Physics, used a three-dimensional model to investigate the transport, dispersion, and evaporation of saliva particles from a human cough. The scientists found that when the wind speed is approximately zero, the saliva droplets did not travel 2 metres, which is well within the social distancing recommendations. However, at wind speeds varying from 4 km/h to 15 km/h, the saliva droplets were seen to travel up to 6 metres with a decrease in the concentration and liquid droplet size in the wind direction.“Even with a slight breeze of 4 km/h, saliva travels 6 metres in five seconds. Therefore, depending on the environmental conditions, the 2 m social distance may not be sufficient, so crowed places will be affected,” said Dimitris Drikakis, co-author of the study, in an email to HT. If the wind speed is 15kmph, the droplet travelled 6 metres in 1.6 seconds.To study how saliva moves through air, the scientists created a computational fluid dynamics simulation that examined the state of every saliva droplet moving through the air in front of a coughing person. Their simulation considered the effects of humidity, dispersion force, interactions of molecules of saliva and air, and how the droplets change from liquid to vapour and evaporate. The analysis involved partial differential equations on 1,008 saliva droplets and solving approximately 3.7 million equations.“The purpose of the mathematical modelling and simulation is to take into account all the real coupling or interaction mechanisms that may take place between the main bulk fluid flow and the saliva droplets, and between the saliva droplets themselves,” said Talib Dbouk, co-author of the paper.The scientists considered an environment of 20 °C for the fluid, 50% relative humidity, 15 °C at the ground, and 34 °C for the human mouth. “We aimed to approximate as much as possible a real situation in winter/spring seasons. Further investigation is required to quantify the effects of ground surface temperature as well as relative humidity and ambient air temperature,” the study said.The scientists agreed that more studies needed to be done to understand the behaviour of fluid droplets in indoor environments, where air conditioning significantly affects the particle movement through air.“We need to understand the droplet evaporation more deeply, especially at different environmental conditions. It is work in progress,” said Drikakis.“It is worth investigating the behaviour of saliva in indoor environments, where air conditioning systems may have significant effects on the movement of particles through the air,” he added.Transmission of the coronavirus through speech and cough droplets, especially in public spaces and crowded environments, has been a major area of concern for policy makers and governments. Globally, research has shown that the virus spreads easily in an aerosol form, and even through speech. Experts said that this study added to earlier literature that under normal conditions, micro droplets can easily travel up to a distance of about 6 meters. Ajit Mohan Srivastava, a professor at the Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, said that normal outside conditions with motion of vehicles, especially during summers in India, have winds changing directions, even having upward drifts resulting from the hot ground. “Such drifts will make the droplet cloud fly higher, and hence travel to larger distances (even larger than 6 metres),” he said. “One should realize that these droplets resulting from coughing, sneezing, or even talking or breathing are micro droplets quite like the droplets in clouds, fog and mist (size varying from tens to hundreds microns). We all have seen how fog, mist, or cloud, can keep floating in the air, even rising higher with slight upward wind drift. Imagine that all these droplets are carrying infection for the case of coughing from an infected person,” he added.One important distinction for India, he said, was that with much higher temperatures (until rains start), droplet evaporation will be much faster than in the study of the paper. “Thus smaller droplets will evaporate away, hopefully making transmission less effective. In places like Delhi, where humidity is much lower than the 50% considered in the study, again droplet evaporation will be stronger, hence transmission less effective. But in coastal places, where humidity is generally very high, evaporation will be much less effective, so transmission will be more effective,” he said.The most important distinction, according to him, was that when people are walking around and vehicles moving, wind pattern is never uniform or horizontal. “Any change in wind direction, especially upward drifts may dramatically increase the droplet transmission distance. In this situation, I will not rule out the possibility that droplet clouds can float in the air for very long time, basically travelling every where inside the room.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-metre-distance-may-not-be-enough-study/story-URziNoJA7g5FjeFHMfSDLN.html
21-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan takes at least 10-12 lives in Bengal, three in Odisha, total damage being ascertained||Super cyclone Amphan has taken at least 10-12 lives in West Bengal and at least another three in Odisha as it wreaked havoc in districts of North and South 24 Parganas after roaring past coastal districts of Odisha before making landfall between Digha in West Bengal and Bangladesh’s Hatia islands late Wednesday afternoon. Uprooted trees, traffic signals and power outages were left in its wake.At around 2:30 pm on Wednesday, Cyclone Amphan made landfall with sustained wind speeds of 155-165 kmph spiralling up to 185 kmph and weakening to 130 kmph when it reached West Bengal capital Kolkata, uprooting trees and traffic signals and blocking arterial roads. Some portions of dilapidated buildings caved in.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the cyclone had killed “at least 10-12 people” in the state and caused the maximum damage in the two districts of South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas, which were “totally devastated”.“There are 5 lakh persons in relief centers. Several areas are totally cut off and cannot be reached yet. We have no information yet - it will take at least 3-4 days to assess the damage,” Banerjee told reporters. The details of the reported casualties in Bengal are awaited.Banerjee will remain at the state secretariat Nabanna, where she has been camping since Tuesday, to oversee further relief operations and take stock of the damage.Early reports from coastal Bengal received on Wednesday evening indicated that thousands of mudhouses collapsed in the storm, while trees and electric poles were uprooted. Embankments were breached and saline water gushed into villages in several districts in the Sundarbans.In neighbouring Odisha’s Bhadrak district, a two-month-old baby was killed when the walls of his family’s mud house collapsed early Wednesday morning due to overnight rain, while in Kendrapara district, a woman who had gone out fishing this morning drowned to death. Officials said that a team had been sent to Bhadrak district to ascertain the exact cause of death after an autopsy.A woman of Bhogarai block in Balasore district died after an electric pole fell on her. The woman had stepped outside for some work when the pole uprooted due to the winds. While officials in Odisha had evacuated more than 1.5 lakh people from the coastal and adjoining districts into cyclone shelters till Tuesday evening, they could not clarify why the family of the deceased newborn was left behind. Amphan, the strongest storm since the 1999 supercyclone, first barreled along the Odisha coast, with maximum wind speeds of between 100-120 kmph in Paradip and the Dhamra coast of Bhadrak district respectively. It uprooted trees and bent electric poles in coastal Odisha districts of Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Bhadrak and Balasore. Nearly 34 lakh power consumers in the state were affected as 65 numbers of 33 KV feeders were affected by the cyclone. However, special relief commissioner Pradip Jena said that more than 90 per cent of the state’s telecom infrastructure was not affected.Jena said after the cyclone passed, the administration aided by the NDRF, ODRAF, Fire Services and workers of Odisha Forest Develoopment Corporation had begun clearing roads in the four districts.Early Wednesday, the port town of Paradip faced Amphan’s fury as a gale-force wind of over 100 kmph accompanied by more than 200 mm of rain, uprooted scores of trees, electric poles, blew away asbestos and tin roofs of several. At the port, more than 100 truck drivers took shelter in their vehicles, waiting for the storm to blow over.In a village in Kendrapara district, a 20-year old woman delivered her baby in a fire service vehicle while being taken to a government hospital, after an ambulance was unable to reach them due to the adverse weather and roads blocked by fallen trees. The fire service teams used tree-cutting machinery to clear the roadblock and transport the woman. The mother and infant are admitted to the hospital and said to be out of danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-takes-at-least-10-12-lives-in-bengal-three-in-odisha-total-damage-being-ascertained/story-cnOXNTIFEP5FJVK5Nxm1UJ.html

21-05-2020||India||Loud boom from IAF test flight startles Bengaluru||Residents of several parts of Bengaluru heard a loud sound around 1.25pm, leading to some residents rushing out of their homes to find the source. Such was the intensity of the sound that some doors, windows and even buildings rattled as if an earthquake had shaken the earth. Nischal Prasad, a resident of Old Airport Road, said, “I sat down for lunch when I heard the deafening sound. I immediately rushed out to my balcony, thinking it was an earthquake. While the sound was really loud, it lasted less than a minute,” he added.However, the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNMDC) denied that any earthquake had taken place. GS Srinivas Reddy, the director of KSNMDC, clarified, “The activity reported in Bengaluru is not because of an earthquake. The seismometers did not capture any ground vibration as generally happens during a mild tremor. The activity is purely a loud unknown noise.”Residents reported the sound from Whitefield, Koramangala, HSR Layout, Attibele, Chandapura and several other localities of Bengaluru. The officials of KSNMDC said that seismometers would have captured some readings even if it was a mild earthquake. Dispelling speculation of the sound being a sonic boom caused by a Sukhoi aircraft breaking the sound barrier, Air Force officials and HAL authorities clarified that it was not either of their planes that caused the sound. A sonic boom is caused when an object travels farther than the speed of sound, creating shock waves in the atmosphere.The most likely cause, according to KSNMDC officials, is that it is some kind of geological phenomenon and its cause, in this case, is being studied both by mining and geology experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loud-boom-from-iaf-test-flight-startles-bengaluru/story-Akg1yRpOEPSX2NFPx5C2HJ.html
21-05-2020||India||Delhi records 1,000 cases in 48 hours, cases cross 11,000||Delhi hit the 10,000 mark in terms of Covid-19 cases on Monday; it logged another thousand cases in just two days, mirroring trends in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat, which have seen an increase in the number of cases over the past two weeks. Delhi recorded 534 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Wednesday, taking its tally to 11,088, according to the daily bulletin released by the Delhi government.Delhi has added half its cases since May 5. The number of deaths in Delhi increased by 10 to 176 according to the bulletin, putting the mortality rate of the infection in the city to almost 1.6%, much lower than the national average of 3.05%.“This is the mortality rate based on the number of infections that have been detected. The percentage would be lower still if we consider the asymptomatic people who might not have been tested,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and the head of the five-member committee that aided the Chief Minister in Covid-19 preparedness.None of the 10 deaths mentioned in the bulletin happened during the last 24-hours. The three-member death review committee is currently in the process of adding deaths that have happened in the past to the city’s toll after examining the patient case files, investigations, and death summary.The Delhi government on Tuesday directed all designated Covid-19 hospitals to strictly follow the standard operating procedures and submit death reports every day at 5pm before the death committee meets. “It has been observed that in spite of the order, healthcare facilities in Delhi are not reporting death (in time) of Covid positive persons as per the SOPs circulated,” the order from the Delhi health secretary Padmini Singla said.The new SOPs were released by the government on May 10 after a discrepancy in the number of deaths reported in the daily bulletin and from the individual hospitals was highlighted. The backlog deaths started being recorded to the cumulative toll May 12 onwards.“After the SOPs were put in place the reports from the hospital did start coming in,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department.Of the 5,720 people still with the infection in the city, around 30% are admitted to designated Covid-19 hospitals with severe symptoms. Over 41% of the people in the city still with the infection – 2,358 people – are in home isolation.Only 23 are on ventilators. Lok Nayak hospital, which has the highest number of Covid-19 patients in the city has 30 people in the intensive care unit and none on ventilator. At All India Institute of Medical Sciences, which has the second highest number of Covid-19 patients, 13 people are in the intensive care unit with 10 on ventilators.The Delhi government has also designated the All India Institute of Ayurveda in Sarita Vihar as a Covid Care Centre for admitting those with mild symptoms. This is in addition to three of the Delhi government-run AYUSH hospitals designated as Covid Health Centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-records-1-000-cases-in-48-hours-cases-cross-11-000/story-cTeCYPDvC4GrkdrIgulmtI.html
