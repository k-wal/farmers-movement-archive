The constable, Rajeev, who is posted at the Seelampur police station; has been caught with four other suspects, Ved Prakash Surya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-East) said. The officer said that the three injured men have been hospitalized with bullet wounds and it was too premature to say which one of them is likely to survive. The DCP said that the quarrel between Rajeev’s family and another one in his neighbourhood began around 8.30 pm on Monday. It was during that fight that Rajeev allegedly opened fire at the three others. Some people on Rajeev’s side too have been hurt, but there is no clarity on that.

The Opposition Congress termed her resignation ‘shocking’, asking Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar if it was not a “proof of his failure”. Rani Nagar (35) currently held the charge of the director, Archives Department; and the additional director, social justice and empowerment. Recently, Nagar had posted on her Facebook page that she will resign after the coronavirus lockdown was lifted. She sent her resignation to state chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora, requesting her to forward it to a competent authority in the Union government. The letter has been received at the chief secretary’s office, an official said. However, Nagar did not elaborate on what she meant by the reason of her resignation. The officer could not be contacted over the phone. Nagar has also sent copies of the resignation to the president, prime minister, Haryana governor and the chief minister through e-mail. “The reason for submitting this resignation is the personal safety on government duty,” she said in a letter to the chief secretary. “I do hereby most humbly submit to you my resignation from the post of Indian Administrative Service with immediate effect, that is effective from May 4, 2020, forenoon,” she wrote. The letter was also posted on her Facebook page. She later left Chandigarh for her hometown Ghaziabad with her sister. She posted on her Facebook page that she had taken permission to move out of the city. Commenting on it, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala termed her resignation “a shocking incident”. Hitting out at the BJP-JJP government in the state, Surjewala said, “A senior woman IAS officer has given her resignation stating that she feels unsafe.” “If a woman IAS officer resigns on the grounds citing personal safety on government duty as the reason, then who will safe in Haryana. Is this not no confidence in your government, is this not a living proof of your failure,” Surjewala said hitting out at the chief minister. Nagar had come into limelight in June 2018, when she accused an additional chief secretary-level bureaucrat of harassing her. The state government had conducted an inquiry into the allegations, but the charges did not hold against the officer, a senior official said on Monday. In an earlier post on her Facebook page, Nagar, who was living in the UT guest house of Chandigarh since 2018 along with her sister, had claimed that despite numerous complaints against the senior bureaucrat, no action was taken against him. Nagar had mentioned that last year, she had lodged a complaint against the bureaucrat before a court and claimed there is a constant threat to “our lives” (she and her sister), while requesting her Facebook friends to report the matter to the court, if they go untraceable. In December 2017, when she was posted as the subdivisional magistrate of Dabawali in Sirsa district, police had lodged a case of tresspass against an unidentified person on her complaint. Nagar had then posted a video on her Facebook page, alleging that police “failed to initiate a prompt action” on her compliant.

According to the Central government’s new guidelines, only those migrants stranded either in shelter homes or enroute are allowed to be brought back by the respective state governments.Till date, about 1.57 lakh residents of Uttarakhand stranded in other states have registered themselves on the government website to return. The state government is bringing them back in state transport corporation buses arranged for the same. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.A senior government official privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity, “After the new guidlines the number of people to be brought back will surely come down. As per it, those living in their relative’s house or any other accommodation where they are facing no major problems will not be brought back as of now. Those stranded in shelter homes or relief centres will only be brought in the initial phase.”The official added, “In the registration process, it was not required for the migrant to mention where he is staying at present. But after this new guidelines, we might have to initiate the registration process again to filter out those falling under it. This will certainly reduce the number from the total registered migrants of about 1.57 lakh.”Ridhim Aggrawal, deputy inspector general, law and order and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) said “The evacuation process is ongoing for the stranded residents of the state in which the new guidelines would be strictly adhered to.”Aggrawal, however, couldn’t reveal the amended figure of the total number of migrants to be brought back based on the new guidelines.“So far the state has brought back about 2,700 migrants mainly from Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (UP).

The silver casket dates back to 1637, when for the first time the mortal remains of the saint were taken away from public view and ensconced in a silver casket and kept atop a specially constructed mausoleum within the Basilica of Bom Jesus at Old Goa. The silver casket has shown serious sign of distress and experts have said that it will become irreparable if no action is taken within the next few years. “We have been wishing to send it to Italy, where they have offered to do it for free. However, the ASI New Delhi put paid to such plans and has instead said that this can be done by the ASI’s chemical institute in Aurangabad,” Fr Patrício Fernandes the Rector of Bom Jesus Basilica said. “However, they cannot restore even a painting and much of the work they do is not up to the mark, so if they cannot do the simple things how will we expect them to do something as delicate as this?” he added. St Francis Xavier is a revered saint and affectionately referred to ‘Goencho saib’ (Lord of Goa). The impressive Baroque Architecture of the Basilica is a huge draw for tourists from across the world to the UNESCO, World Heritage site. Plans were being made to ship the casket to Florence in Italy, before the ASI decided that it would be better to have it restored locally. The church authorities, however, said that they have the local MLAs and MPs in a bid to allow for the shipping of the casket to Florence where the restoration will be done, which if approved, will now happen only after the coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Back in 2018, the authorities had invited experts from Italy to examine the casket who had suggested that the work be done in Florence.Francis Xavier was a Spaniard Jesuit from the Basque province who in 1542 travelled to Portuguese territories in India and beyond right up to Japan for missionary work and whose “incorruptible” remains were exhumed from Sanchian, an island off China where he was initially buried and transferred to Goa the headquarters of the Portuguese maritime empire. He was declared a saint by the Catholic Church in the early 17th century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/casket-of-goa-s-beloved-st-francis-xavier-hoping-for-an-italian-restoration-job/story-wkYjcYecAnYqUGB3rj9kDK.html

Reeling under crisis one of after another, he forgot about the big ticket till he got a call from duty-free authorities.“I took the lottery carrying the no 041779.

04-05-2020||India||Thousands of migrants made to wait in Madhya Pradesh as UP shuts border||Thousands of workers on their way home were stranded in Madhya Pradesh districts bordering Gujarat, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, as UP sealed its borders to prevent further movement of stranded workers, throwing into disarray the social distancing norms, according to government officials.As per police officials about 8,000 labourers, including women and children, gathered at Bijasan village in Barwani district and more than 5,000 at Pitol in Jhabua district since Saturday as they were not allowed to enter Madhya Pradesh. Similarly, thousands of labourers have gathered at Johariya village in Datia district on MP-UP border as Uttar Pradesh closed its borders to disallow movement of people.Barwani on the MP-Maharastra border is 313 kilometres south west of Bhopal in Nimad region, while Jhabua on MP-Gujarat border is 341 kilometres south west of Bhopal in Malwa region. Datia on MP-UP border is situated 405 kilometres north of Bhopal.Earlier, Barwani administration sent such labourers in about 200 buses to Uttar Pradesh on Thursday and Friday but they were stuck in Datia as UP had closed its border. This is why the administration in Datia didn’t allow further movement of people since then, said an official.Notably, on Sunday agitated labourers in Barwani pelted stones on police personnel at Bijasan village near Sendhwa on not being allowed to enter Madhya Pradesh resulting in injuries to a police sub-inspector and two constables.Though at Bijasan the district the administration made arrangements for food for labourers, the increase in the count of labourers with each passing moment has thrown all the arrangements into disarray, said an official.“We had not anticipated that Uttar Pradesh would close its borders. Even otherwise, it’s not possible to provide basic facilities of stay and food to such a large number of people, that too while ensuring social distancing among them,” said the official.Activist Medha Patkar criticised the governments, both Central and the state, for not taking care of labourers.“People are coming through various modes, some even bare foot, but none is taking care of them, whether it’s the central government or the state governments of UP, MP, Maharashtra and Gujarat,” said Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar.Vishwadeep Singh Parihar, town inspector of police at Sendhwa, said, “There are certain women in the crowd who are pregnant. There are several couples with kids. Hence, the administration has decided to arrange transport for such people to send them to UP border so that they don’t have any problem in staying here and could reach their home early whenever UP border is opened for them.”A stranded migrant complained of lack of food and water for them and rued the arbitrary nature of decision making.“Our group reached here on Sunday morning and we want to go to Uttar Pradesh. The officials here say Yogi ji doesn’t want us to get into Uttar Pradesh. The authorities are making decisions on their own about the opening and closing of the border. There has been no food and water for us since yesterday. There should be at least prior information when they are going to close or open the border,” said Rohit, stranded at Gujarat border, from Faridpur in Uttar Pradesh.Arvind Kumar from Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh alleged that people who belong to Madhya Pradesh are being allowed to enter.Collector of Datia district Rohit Singh said, “A number of labourers were allowed to get in, but then again the border was closed from the UP side.”Director general of police, Madhya Pradesh Vivek Johri said, “We have no problem in allowing people to enter Madhya Pradesh but the states which are allowing people to leave and Uttar Pradesh which has to allow them to enter the state have to take a decision on the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thousands-of-migrants-made-to-wait-in-madhya-pradesh-as-up-shuts-border/story-QICTsKo7vjLA8XIT0onNJP.html

He did not develop any symptoms of Covid-19 after a 14-day home quarantine.Three days ago, Dalei suddenly developed a cough and cold and did not get any relief despite trying home remedies. When his conditions worsened, he was taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital in an ambulance, but he died on the way. He was declared brought dead in Balasore district headquarters hospital where doctors said he suffered from a hepatic coma.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.However, after Dalei’s body was brought to Khatanagar village late Sunday night, none of the villagers came forward to help in cremation despite his wife’s pleas. “The villagers probably feared that the man died of coronavirus as the person he travelled along from Kolkata had tested positive last month. However, I am sure the man died of hepatic coma and jaundice,” said Dr Bijay Panda, in-charge of Simulia community health centre.As no villagers came forward to help in cremation, Dalei’s family members buried the body by themselves. The CHC in-charge said that since Dalei’s swab sample was not tested earlier, a medical camp will be organised on Tuesday where the swab samples of his family members and neighbours will be examined for coronavirus.On April 27, a man in Bhubaneswar died allegedly after being denied treatment by several private hospitals over fears that he may have contracted coronavirus as he lived close to a containment zone. The man’s wife and daughter had to spend a night on the road with the body after their landlord refused to let them in their rented home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odia-man-buried-after-villagers-boycott-cremation-over-covid-19-fears/story-1S90huZosITGuHhP542xYK.html
04-05-2020||India||Vijay Mallya knocks on UK SC door to block extradition||Controversial businessman Vijay Mallya has filed an application for leave to appeal in the UK’s Supreme Court in the latest bid to block his extradition to India to face charges of major financial offences running into thousands of crores.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which acts on India’s behalf in UK courts, said on Monday: “He is seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The authorities in India/CPS have until May 14 to respond to his application”.The Supreme Court usually takes up only cases that involve public interest. The high court of England and Wales had dismissed his appeal on April 20, upholding a lower court’s judgement that there is a prima facie case against him of fraud by representation.In extradition cases, UK courts only need to establish whether there is a prima facie case against the person requested, and not to prove the person’s guilt or otherwise.Mallya tweeted after the April 20 ruling: “I will continue to pursue further legal remedies as advised by my lawyers. I am also disappointed with the media narrative which states that I must face trial in India for a fraud of Rs 9000 crores”.“I must draw attention to paragraph 6 of the judgement which is available to the public. Please note that the allegations against me and others are specifically and only related to three tranches of borrowing from IDBI Bank for a total of Rs 900 crores in 2009”.“This loan was subsumed along with loans from other Banks within the Master Debt Recast Agreement of 2010. Following the DRT order for the payment of approximately Rs 5000 crores by way of Principal and Rs 1200 crores by way of unapplied interest making a total of Rs 6200 crores”.“The Banks have already recovered in cash a sum of Rs 2500 crores which is 50 percent of the Principal amount. I have repeatedly offered to pay the Banks in full but, sadly to no avail”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-knocks-on-uk-sc-door-to-block-extradition/story-KpiGAJ1gJ6RGDLKicFedGM.html
04-05-2020||India||Maharashtra govt accuses Arnab Goswami of interfering with probe, moves SC||The Maharashtra government has accused senior journalist Arnab Goswami of interfering with the probe against him by using his tweets and television debates to browbeat the Mumbai Police.In an application moved before the top court, the state sought urgent orders to restrain the journalist from engaging in such acts that creates a “fear psychosis” among the force impeding their ability to probe the case without fear or favour.Goswami faces multiple complaints of inciting hatred among religious groups, which are now being probed under a single complaint at the NM Joshi Marg police station in Mumbai.What has prompted the state to approach the Supreme Court is an order of April 24 by which police cannot take any coercive action against Goswami for three weeks. The direction came on a petition by Goswami who sought clubbing of multiple cases against him along with protection from arrest.The fresh application by the state said, “Petitioner (Goswami) considers indulgence granted by this Court as some kind of a license to indulge in unwarranted sensationalism and to ridicule, denigrate, and defame the police department and its officers.” The application seeks a restraint order against Goswami from indulging in such acts that tantamount to interference with the investigation. A further direction has been sought asking Goswami not to abuse the indulgence granted to him by the court on April 24 and cooperate with the investigation.The application filed by advocate Sachin Patil states that the series of tweets against the police emerged after April 26 when Goswami was called by the police to join the probe. He was upset that the police was unnecessarily questioning him in connection with the FIR against him. He also alleged that the police did not act on his complaint of April 23 when two bike-borne men attacked his car while returning from work.The application stated that the television show hosted by Goswami on April 28 showed the Commissioner of Police in bad light by making false charges against him. Accusing him of making a “media spectacle” of the case against him, the application said, “The act and conduct of the petitioner would tantamount to encroaching upon the area of investigation (sole prerogative of the police) as also subjecting the entire criminal justice system to ridicule.”Goswami has also been accused of carrying out a “vicious propaganda” against the police by abusing his journalistic freedom to malign the police force and its chief using false allegations. Incidentally, Goswami has filed a second petition in the apex court with regard to a fresh FIR lodged against him on May 2, seeking similar relief from arrest. This case emanates out of his telecast which accused people of one community crowding at Bandra on April 15-16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-accuses-arnab-goswami-of-interfering-with-probe-moves-sc/story-9eNMaIMl8VuGUI9cXACvfP.html

04-05-2020||India||Plasma therapy ‘no magic bullet’ against Covid-19; Need large-scale trials to prove efficacy: Experts||The convalescent plasma therapy is no “magic bullet” to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients.The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of Covid-19 patients.Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a “huge difference” in the treatment of Covid-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Dr Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as Covid-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.“It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person’s own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,” Guleria told PTI.There is no study to suggest that “it is a magic bullet” or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.“Important issue to remember is that not everyone’s plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies” Guleria said.Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.“You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,” Guleria said.Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.“Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,” he told PTI.Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, “larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.” These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill Covid-19 patients as its initial results are good. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on Covid-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning. Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy’s usefulness.“It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,” Malhotra said.However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.“Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,” he told PTI.Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses.According to medical experts, large-scale trials will also help in answering key questions such as the tangible benefits of the plasma therapy, which category of patients are likely to benefit, at what stage of the disease will this therapy gives maximum returns, the right dosage and its adverse effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts/story-LefKFEXQOznTzQZ3o9n4XM.html

Replies from IFCN’s database of debunked fake news will be available to people at +1 (727) 2912606.Baybars Örsek, Director at the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) at the Poynter Institute, said that the chatbot which is available in English alone will be released in Hindi soon. “The service is launching in English but will be available in other languages including Hindi, Portuguese and Spanish in due course. We are working to include other languages,” Örsek said. A release from WhatsApp said that through the chatbot, people can check whether a piece of content about Covid-19 has already been rated as false by professional fact-checkers. “Since January, more than 80 fact-checking organizations from 74 countries have identified more than 4,000 hoaxes related to the novel coronavirus. All this information now forms the CoronaVirusFacts database and is updated daily by the IFCN so chatbot users can navigate and easily access its content,” the release said.Örsek said that users can search for these debunked news through the chatbot. “The IFCN bot is primarily a way to distribute fact-checks to WhatsApp users and to provide access to a searchable database of Coronavirus debunked hoaxes. It allows users to review IFCN’s database of 4000 debunked myths, to search for fact checks by word or phrase, access to tips to protect themselves from falsehoods, and also to find out how to contact local fact-checkers in their country,” he said. Through the chatbot, an user can access a global directory of fact-checking organisations, and the user’s country is detected from the mobile country code to provide contacts of fact-checking organisations which are closest. “The person can then submit a piece of information for review directly to its local fact-checker or visit it,” WhatsApp said in a release. With the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, there is a spike in the volume of fake news, and WhatsApp has been grappling to deal with it, especially in India where it has over 450 million users. As the pandemic spread, the private messaging platform brought in product changes, including reducing the number forwards of a ‘highly forwarded message’ to just one chat. The company says this has brought down virality of messages which has already reduced the number of highly forwarded messages shared on the service by 70%. Örsek said that some of these fake news items were about symptoms of the disease. “The first couple of weeks after the first case was detected outside China, we have seen so many pieces of misinformation on the spread of the virus and false symptoms. It had been the case especially in Europe, where the virus spread from Italy to Spain and then eventually to the different parts of the world where we saw a big volume of misinformation on the spread of the virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ifcn-s-chatbot-on-whatsapp-to-help-debunk-covid-19-related-fake-news/story-54LOTq8KlxnfisjBeOAfLL.html

It also provides people with important information, including ways to avoid the coronavirus and its symptoms.“The government’s requirement that the Aarogya Setu app is now mandatory for all employees, public or private, raises serious privacy and data protection questions. Covid-19 must not become an excuse for creation of a ‘surveillance state’ in India,” Tharoor tweeted.The central government has made it compulsory for all its employees to download the app and urged private entitles to also ask their employees to use it.Tharoor’s attack on the government came two days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the Aarogya Setu mobile application is a “sophisticated surveillance system” outsourced to a private operator, raising serious data security and privacy concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-must-not-become-excuse-for-creation-of-surveillance-state-tharoor-on-aarogya-setu/story-rES8gahZsECdwn2cH4q9sL.html

The Ashok Gehlot-led government’s decision followed Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s barb against the Centre accusing it of forcing migrant workers to pay for tickets amid the pandemic. She urged Congress workers to raise funds to pay for the migrants’ rail fare.“On directions of Sonia Gandhi, we have decided that the state government will pay the rail fare of migrant workers going from Rajasthan to other states,” chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted on Monday.The state government has already paid for three special trains – Jaipur to Patna, Nagaur to Hatia (Jharkhand) and Ajmer and Dankuni (West Bengal) – that were run by the north-western railway (NWR).An officer of the NWR’s commercial wing said the Rajasthan government paid Rs 473,760 for the Jaipur to Patna train, which carried 1,180 migrant workers on Friday midnight; Rs 834,000 for Nagaur to Hatia train that carried 905 passengers on Sunday; and Rs 825,660, which transported 1,186 pilgrims stranded in Ajmer to Dankuni, West Bengal, on Monday.“We aren’t dealing with individuals. We’re dealing with the state government and they’re responsible for arranging the fare, whether from the state exchequer or via donations,” the NWR officer said, requesting anonymity.Each of these special trains had 24 coaches – four general class, 18 sleeper coaches and two guard vans – and carried 54 passengers in each coach against the normal capacity of 72 due to the strict enforcement of social distancing norms. No passenger is allowed on the trains’ return journey.The Centre allowed special trains for stranded workers, pilgrims and students on Friday after requests from state governments.For special trains to carry students from Kota, the coaching hub of the country for medical and engineering aspirants, to Jharkhand and Bihar, the respective state governments paid the fare, said Pankaj Sharma, divisional railway manager (DRM), Kota.“We got the payment through the Rajasthan government before departure of each of the six special trains that we’ve have run since Friday,” he said. “The Bihar and Jharkhand governments made the payment to the Rajasthan government.”Around 7,000 students from the two eastern states left Kota on six special trains till Monday evening. Two special trains left for Jharkhand on Friday and Saturday, and four to Bihar, each carrying an average of 1,200 students, over the past four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-pay-for-fares-of-migrant-workers-taking-trains-from-raj-gehlot/story-PE1g9hov0XuIKrRZrsNEGJ.html

Only 15 minutes are left for the swearing in”, a bench of justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose told Mahaswamiji before rejecting his plea.The central government had, on April 30, cleared the appointment of Desai and four other judicial officers as additional judges of the Karnataka high court.The Supreme Court collegium had recommended their elevation ten days earlier on April 20.Mahaswamiji claimed that four of the five were either his batchmates or senior to him. But Desai was junior to him in service and the appointment of Desai amounted to superseding him, Mahaswamiji submitted.“It is a case of superseding/passing over of a senior District judge (who was appointed on 25.02.2008 under reserved category i.e., Scheduled caste) by junior district judge and the recommendation of Padmaraj Desai by the collegium is unlawful, arbitrary”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-s-plea-to-stall-elevation-of-junior-rejected-minutes-before-oath/story-4GFucjDEOmti9QbCd0RjsJ.html

Even I received minor injuries on my arm,” said Rajkumar.“It seems they had planned the attack in advance. We have detained over 80 persons and brought the situation under control,” said the IPS officer.In the morning, around 50 labourers from Uttar Pradesh got their heads tonsured here, saying the buses on which they left for their native state two days back after initial nod were forced to halt at Kosamba in the district for want of “valid permission” and sent back to Surat.They said hey have been waiting endlessly for the administration to clear their journey back home.A worker demanded that the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat co-ordinate their movement without delay, and claimed bus fare, which they arranged with much difficulty, has not been returned to them.“Many of us sold off our watches and mobile phones to arrange for the bus fare. Now we are still at the same place, with no permission given to our buses to move.“We are stranded here with no help from officials. We demand the governments of the two states to coordinate fast for our return back home,” he said.Till Sunday, eight trains carrying migrant workers had left for Uttar Pradesh and Odisha from Gujarat.Four trains from Ahmedabad, carrying around 1,200 migrant labourers each, travelled to Uttar Pradesh and an equal number of trains from Surat left for Odisha.In Rajkot, hundreds of migrant workers came out on road in Shapar-Veraval industrial area on the city outskirts, demanding that they be sent back home.Police said they managed to persuade the workers to call off the protest, and brought the situation under control.“We have reached out to migrants in residential localities and explained to them that they will be allowed to leave after getting a medical check-up done and completing other formalities,” Rajkot Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone-1) Ravi Mohan Saini said.Rajkot district collector Ramya Mohan said the administration has been given strict instruction to follow the government-prescribed guidelines while sending migrant workers back to their home states.We have get the names of migrant workers registered and sent them to the respective state for approval. Then we have to request the Railways for their transit.“Based on our request, the Railways will make arrangements for trains only after the home state concerned gives permission for their return, Mohan said.These procedures take time and migrant workers need to show patience in returning to their native places, the Rajkot collector said.Some migrant workers also gathered outside the Rajkot collector’s office to fill forms for returning home, saying they had no food and money to sustain their livelihood.“The factory where I worked is closed, and I want to go back to my native place. They say we will have to arrange our our own vehicles to return to our native place, but we want the government to send us back in train,” a worker said.PTI COR PJT KA PD VT GK RSY RSY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-3-0-eager-to-return-home-migrants-clash-with-police-in-surat/story-rKF6dVsA4oAQinMgsXqq6L.html

Secretary general Desh Deepak Verma informed that savings of Rs. 60 crore have already been identified against the annual budget of Rs. 423 crore for the secretariat for 2020-21. Total savings of Rs. 80 core are being targeted as the financial year progresses,” said an official aware of the details.The official said Naidu had given instructions that in view of the extension of lockdown till May 17 and the need for the executive’s undivided focus on containing the spread of Covid-19, a view on holding meetings of department-related standing committees and other committees of the House will be formulated later.This was the first meeting Naidu held with senior officials of the secretariat since the nationwide lockdown began on March 25.Naidu also instructed officials to initiate action to fill up the posts of chairmen of eight committees. These vacancies arose after the retirement of some Rajya Sabha members.The vacancies include the posts of chairmen of department-related standing committees on human resource development and industries, which were held by Satyanarayan Jatiya and K Keshava Rao respectively. The chairmanship of three standing committees on privileges, subordinate legislation, and papers laid on the table fell vacant with the retirement of Harivansh, deputy chairman, T Subbarami Reddy and CP Thakur respectively.Three other committees without heads are those on ethics, MPLADS and provision of computers for members of Rajya Sabha (PCMRS), which were led by Prabhat Jha, Harivansh and Tiruchi Siva.“As for oath taking by 38 members who were recently elected unopposed, it has been decided oath will be administered to them inside the chamber of the Rajya Sabha after the lockdown, if feasible, before the next session so as to comply with the norm of physical distance, with their family members likely to attend,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-announces-austerity-measures-to-cut-rs-80-cr-expenses/story-XGOLw1tMElrl07z9VhXemM.html

04-05-2020||India||Migrant workers’ return en masse from urban hubs a concern: Empowered group||The return of migrant labourers en masse from urban hubs of work to their villages is a primary area of concern, the Empowered Group, headed by Niti Aayog chairman Amitabh Kant, has noted in a progress report. Scores of NGOs are coordinating efforts and working closely with the district administrations and state governments so that measures of care, quarantine, and treatment go hand in hand, it added. The group had directed all chief secretaries to appoint state-level nodal Officers to coordinate with all NGOs and resolve their issues apart from leveraging their resources and networks. “Almost all States have appointed Nodal Officers to liaise with NGOs/CSOs.All Chief Secretaries were requested to instruct the District Administrations to leverage the bandwidth of NGOs and CSOs; Nominate Nodal NGO for each district, or groups of Districts for coordinating with the District Nodal Officer; and identify areas and sectors to stop duplicity and overlaps,” it said. “NGOs were also urged to lift and distribute rice and wheat from the Food Corporation of India’s godowns at the subsidized rate of Rs 21-22 per kg respectively so that no one in the country remains hungry,” it added. The empowered group committee is monitoring and coordinating with the NGO and Civil Society Organisations across all states and 700 districts on a real time basis to fight the spread of Covid-19. It has engaged with Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, development partners, UN Agencies, and industry associations in over 15 meetings.“In the Aspirational Districts Programme piloted by NITI Aayog, as of now there are about 610 cases in 112 aspirational districts which is considered fairly low at less than 2% of the national level of infections,” the empowered group said. Of these, six districts have reported the first case after April 21. Major hotspots are Baramula (62), Nuh (57), Ranchi (55), YSR (55), Kupwara (47) and Jaisalmer(34) it added. NITI Aayog has taken steps to ensure that these districts are able to contain the spread of the virus and has actively referred the requirements in testing kits, PPE and masks to the respective empowered groups for necessary action in order to address supply constraints, it noted. “Collaboration has been one of the guiding principles in Aspirational District Programme and these partnerships have enabled the District Administrations in ramping up isolation camps, setting up control rooms, door-to-door food supplies, distribution of cooked foods, mobilization of Self Help Groups for making home-made masks, sanitizers and re-usable & sterilizable protective gear while simultaneously sustaining their livelihoods during lockdown period. Osmanabad is one such district where a testing Centre has been established by utilizing the CSR corpus,” it said. The empowered group has also mobilised these 92,000 NGOs across districts for monitoring and coordinating. “It is a record of sorts, to harness their strengths and resources, expertise in key social sectors-nutrition, health, sanitation, education, and extensive reach in the community,” a Niti Aayog official said. The group has involved them in identifying hotspots and deputing volunteers; delivering essential services to the vulnerable, including the homeless, daily wage workers, migrants, and urban poor families; and in creating awareness about prevention, social distancing, and isolation. In the next phase, the group will mobilise CSOs and NGOs for movement against Covid-19 stigmatisation and in protecting the elderly and senior citizens. The UN in India has prepared a Joint Response Plan (JRP) with prevention, treatment and essential supplies as key components.“Skill building of 15,300 trainers, training for 3951 surveillance/ health officers on Integrated Health Information Platform, infection prevention and control training in 890 hospitals, support to ICMR for testing, strengthening risk communication and community engagement capabilities of healthcare workers, procurement of 2 lakh PPEs and 4 lakh N95 masks, have been initiated by WHO and UNICEF,” the report said. The UN is also engaged in the procurement of medical supplies including ventilators (initially 1000 units as per the current requests, but potentially higher based on future demand) for 25 States. Further, an order of 10,000 ventilators and 10 million PPE Kits to UNICEF was expedited by group, it said. Niti Aayog has also engaged with the Indian Red Cross Society whose 40,000 volunteers are working with district administration in over 500 districts. It has created quarantine/isolation facilities at 33 locations, facilitated donation of ventilators, masks, PPEs, and test kits valued at Rs 5.50 crore, apart from relief and advocacy across the 500 districts, it added.

The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) dismissed Dhankhar’s statements, made in a fresh letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, as “nonsense” and alleged that the governor was working as spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party.In his letter, Dhankhar pointed to a “collapsing health sector” and “politicised public distribution system” in West Bengal, and alleged that the state was “emerging as a police state” where voices of opposition parties were being muzzled.Countering Banerjee’s allegation that the governor was trying to “usurp power” in the time of a crisis, Dhankhar said: “People in the state know only too well who in the state is usurper and extra-constitutional fountain of power. Who runs government and syndicates. Who is this ABCD! An open secret! Surely, I am not the person.”BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, have accused the ruling Trinamool of running “syndicates”, which loosely refer to groups forcing people to buy products from them. The Trinamool has rubbished the charges as “ill-intended political propaganda”. Monday’s development was the latest in a “letter war” between the chief minister and the governor. Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with the government for some time. But the fresh letter war intensified after Banerjee wrote to Dhankhar on April 23 in response to a series of letters and social media posts by the governor. Dhankar then wrote two letters to Banerjee, on April 23 and 24, responding to which she wrote another letter on May 2. “He (Dhankar) is keen on working as a BJP spokesperson. Political commentary is not part of a governor’s job. He has turned Raj Bhavan into an extension of BJP’s office,” said TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee.Trinamool’s Lok Sabha leader, Sudip Banerjee, rubbished the governor’s charges as “non-sense”. “We would take a call whether to respond to his statements and letters at all. He speaks gibberish. He is merely playing his role in Centre’s plan to discredit Bengal,” he said.The Left and the Congress, meanwhile, urged both the chief minister and the governor to stop this “letter war”. “What are they doing? Exchanging letters and trading barbs are not the need of the hour. They must stop,” said Sujan Chakraborty, leader of the Left parties in the state assembly.The Congress’s Lok Sabha leader, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, too, urged both chief minister and the governor to stop firing salvos at each other and to focus on the pandemic situation.“The controversy has been mounting for quite some time now. This is not a time for such time debates and controversies. I urge both of them to refrain to making comments at each other and to stop this letter war right now,” said political analyst Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, former principal of Presidency College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-becoming-a-police-state-dhankar-sharpens-attack-on-mamata/story-TuXzHNvloYwctADKCU4NWL.html

He urged all citizens to wear masks while stepping outdoors, practice social distancing and sanitize/wash their hands frequently and well to stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic.On Monday, with liquor stores reopening in the national capital after a month and more, serpentine queues could be seen as people thronged the shops to purchase alcohol, defying social distancing guidelines. Residents at Delhi’s Desh Bandhu Gupta Road witnessed a bizarre spectacle where the queue outside a liquor shop stretched for around a kilometre.A day earlier, on Sunday, the Delhi government had announced that it would implement all lockdown relaxations that have been prescribed by the Union home ministry, despite the national capital being completely in the red zone with a high concentration of Covid-19 cases.All Delhi government offices engaged in essential services will function with full strength and private offices will be allowed to function with 33 per cent strength, Kejriwal had said.“The time has come to re-open Delhi. We will have to be ready to live with coronavirus. The lockdown was necessary to contain Covid-19, but Delhi is fully ready to relax lockdown restrictions,” the Delhi chief minister had informed people.The relaxations came barely two days after the Centre extended the nationwide lockdown for another two weeks on Friday. The lockdown will now continue till May 17.The lockdown was earlier scheduled to be lifted today on May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shop-owners-must-ensure-social-distance-kejriwal-after-chaos-at-delhi-s-liquor-shops/story-1yHhnlVw9PxtUFShDpVyDP.html

04-05-2020||India||Ahead of WHO’s virtual meet, some real pressure on Tedros. And a complication||The World Health Organisation on Monday told member states that it will soon start sending out formal invites for the truncated version of its annual meet later this month.The World Health Assembly’s virtual meet comes at a time the global health body chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is at the centre of a huge row over its initial response to the outbreak of coronavirus disease in China’s Wuhan.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been accused by the United States of helping China play down the disease in the early stages.Last month, Donald Trump declared that the US would hold back $ 400 million funding to the Geneva-headquartered WHO. A fortnight later, the US Director of National Intelligence issued a rare statement announcing a review of intercepted communications and other data to determine whether China, and possibly the WHO, concealed information about coronavirus.Diplomats in Washington and Geneva suggest that the WHO meet might eventually be a staid affair because it would have a very limited agenda. It is not clear if there would be an opportunity to discuss the impact of the United States’ suspension of funding on the global health body’s projects since the meeting of the Programme, Budget and Administration committee has been indefinitely deferred.But diplomats insist the effort to mount pressure on Tedros, who still has one more year to go, would continue to mount.The Ethopian politician, who was the health minister between 2005 and 2012 before taking over as foreign minister for the next four years in the government then run by his party, Tigray People’s Liberation Front, has a doctoral degree in community health.The WHO chief already has letters of support issued by the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Union leadership, a signal that he wasn’t willing to stand down.Neither is the United States.US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has continued to pile pressure on China on Sunday, insisting that there was “enormous evidence” to show that the coronavirus outbreak began in a laboratory in Wuhan, China.That renewed offensive spooked investors who saw signs of a flare-up in US-China tensions and contributed to southeast Asian stocks slipping on Monday. To be sure, the US decision to hold back money committed to the WHO has been criticised by many countries. But it has put the focus back on the initial response by China, and by default, the chief of WHO that calls itself the “global guardian of public health”.Tedros’ praise for China fuels criticismSome of the criticism aimed at Tedros is powered by his statements too. Like the one made two days after a closed-door meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on 28 January.On 30 January, Tedros told the world that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. A few hours after his effusive praise, the WHO declared the disease that may have originated from one wet market in China’s Wuhan a Public Health Emergency of International Concern for the world.Three months later, the disease, according to news agency AFP, has killed over 245,000 people, infected 3.4 million, forced half of humanity to live under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.Complication over TaiwanLong before the Tedros-led World Health Organisation begins the annual meet, it has found itself in another bit of a complication, also involving China and the United States.The self-ruled island, which Beijing considers a wayward province awaiting reunification, has been excluded from WHO membership due to objections from China. Taiwan has attended the assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations warmed, but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist. Taipei rejects that stand and insists that its exclusion creates a glaring gap in the global fight against the coronavirus.Taiwan has reported far fewer cases of the new coronavirus than many of its neighbours, due to early and effective detection and prevention work.The United States has already supported Taiwan’s participation at the assembly as an observer calling its exclusion an “affront” to UN principles, provoking a sharp outburst by the Chinese foreign ministry which expressed “strong outrage and firm opposition”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-who-s-virtual-meet-some-real-pressure-on-tedros-and-a-complication/story-4Cldpmn7J1SwbaTaUKhskI.html

The Indian aviation sector has been badly-hit due to the global health crisis which has led to flights being grounded and all international and domestic travel being stalled amid a nationwide lockdown, which has been extended twice. GoAir has managed to pay full salaries to 40 per cent of total employees (2,500), it said while the remaining employees are getting paid on a graded or deferred basis.“With no inflow of cash, which we are now anticipating will continue through the end of May, a period of over 10 weeks, and with no support forthcoming yet from either the government or the banking system, we were left with no alternative but to make the unfortunate and sad decision to pay the March earned salaries over March and April,” the joint letter said.“The limitations on our resources are not of our own making and the sacrifices we are imposing on you are sadly beyond our control,” the letter to the employees read.The private airline, like many others, has been forced to send people on leave without pay due to the current crisis.The letter also pointed out that GoAir’s board members, chairman and managing director were not drawing any remuneration.“Our CEO has taken a 50 per cent pay cut and voluntarily deferred most of his balance compensation. The senior management, too, has taken substantial pay cuts and have also deferred a portion of the compensation,” it read.The management top brass also mentioned how airlines in the United States, Europe, South/East Asia and the Middle East are getting significant support from their respective governments to tide them through this “unprecedented crisis”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goair-writes-to-staff-about-deferred-salaries-says-airline-left-with-no-choice/story-lGxDpdRoyvE0DQvC4oXDiM.html

04-05-2020||India||Central team questions Bengal govt’s claim on Covid-19 testing||One of the two inter-ministerial central teams (IMCT) sent to assess West Bengal’s response to Covid-19 has pointed out discrepancies in the number of cases reported, a high mortality rate and questioned the state government’s claim of having surveyed five million people.The team has detailed the discrepancies in its final observations submitted to the West Bengal government. HT has accessed a copy of the observations. The state and the Centre have exchanged words over the teams, availability of testing kits and gaps in West Bengal’s response to Covid-19. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee last week accused the Centre of maligning the state and spreading “canards” about its testing figures when the “real problem” was with the testing kits supplied. She lashed out at the teams for calling officers indiscriminately and hampering the fight against Covid-19. The teams have complained that they did not get enough support from the state government.In its observations, the team cited the state’s April 30 medical bulletin, saying it reported 572 cases and added that 139 patients had been discharged after treatment while 33 had died of the disease, making a total of 744. “In a communication to union health secretary on the same day, the total number of cases was indicated to be 931 leading to a discrepancy of 187 cases,” the team said. It added the state classified 72 fatalities on April 30 due to Covid-19 as deaths due to co-morbidities. “The bulletin of May 1 and 2 does not even mention the total number of cases and deaths...”The team questioned the state’s claims of very high levels of daily surveillance in containment zones. “During the stay of the committee itself, over 50 lakh [ five million] persons would have been surveyed in the four districts. Collating and evaluating a database of this magnitude requires very robust systems to be in place. However, no such evidence was available during our stay or field visits,” noted the IMCT leader Apruva Chandra.“The IMCT notes that the state government has on April 30 made a pronouncement that henceforth all deaths of Covid patients would be indicated in the daily statistics and the death certificate would be issued by the hospital with the Committee of Doctors only examining a random sample.” The team called it a big step towards transparency but at the same time added it raised the total death count of Covid-19 patients to 105 as on April 30. “For a total reported number of 744 + 72 = 816 Covid patients, the mortality rate of 12.8% is by far the highest in the country. This extremely high mortality rate is a clear indication of low testing and weak surveillance and tracking.” An IMCT member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cited the case of a Border Security Force driver, who developed Covid-19 symptoms on May 1 to underline the state’s lax attitude. “He was tested and the result came positive on May 3. But there has been no effort from anyone in the state government to trace the contacts or get his family tested.” The team reiterated its accusation that the West Bengal government has been “antagonistic” towards it and has not supported the IMCT in the performance of its duties. It added this is in contrast with the experience of IMCTs deputed to other states, where top officials attended their meetings.The IMCT, which was due to submit its final report to the Union home ministry on Monday, earlier asked the West Bengal government to explain the methodology used to ascertain Covid-19 deaths and whether it was in line with the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines.The Centre has also deputed inter-ministerial teams to Gujarat, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to probe perceived lapses in efforts to control Covid-19 and violations of lockdown regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-questions-bengal-govt-s-claim-on-covid-19-testing/story-pTuQDByvUIT4ROm8COyPII.html
04-05-2020||India||Sholay, Dabangg dialogues to educate about forest fires in Uttarakhand||The Uttarakhand forest department is employing dialogues from hit Bollywood films like Sholay, The Dirty Picture, Dabangg, among others, to spread awareness about preventing forest fires. The initiative is the brainchild of Rudraprayag divisional forest officer Vaibhav Singh. Elaborating upon it, the officer said the main idea behind such awareness posters was to make people stop and read them so that they take the information back with them.“Any awareness campaign should be catchy and attractive with the aim that people don’t easily forget the basic information. If people stop and watch for even once and then share it with others our job is done. We have been getting a very good response from locals since the posters were put up,” said Singh.Around 1,500 posters have been made so far with almost 200-odd posters already placed in every forest range. The posters also give information on punishment for setting forests on fire, that is, a fine of Rs 5,000 and imprisonment up to two years. It also has the fire control room numbers mentioned so that people can call and alert the department about any fire incident.With lockdown relaxations and movement allowed in green zones from today, officials also fear that forest fire incidents could increase. Uttarakhand has lost 11 hectares this year with 18 incidents of forest fire.“We have been lucky till now because there have been rains every two-three days maintaining the moisture content, but now temperatures are rising. With the relaxations being given to people in the lockdown, there might be a probability of forest fires. With more and more people coming back to their villages, movement in forests has also increased,” added Singh.The awareness posters are mostly being put up at markets and places where people go on a regular basis so that more people can see them.Official records show that wildfire incidents this year had come down by over 50% till April amid the lockdown enforced to fight coronavirus.Most cases of forest fire incidents in the state are man-made and the reduced number of cases are likely due to restricted movement of people in and near forest areas.BK Gangte, nodal officer for forest fires in the state, said that cases of wildfires have been significantly less this year, but it cannot be said if it is an effect of the lockdown. The department is analysing the data, he added. In Uttarakhand, 0.17% of total forest cover comes under the extremely fire prone category, 1.60% under very highly fire prone, 9.32% under highly fire prone, 21.66% under moderately fire prone and 67.25% under less fire prone category.Since the formation of the state in 2000, over 44,554 hectares of the forest area has been damaged in forest fires accruing a loss of over Rs 185 lakh, revealed an RTI reply by the state government last year.The forest department has around 174 watchtowers and 1,437 station crew across the state to keep a tab on the forest fires and take measures to check them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sholay-dabangg-dialogues-to-educate-about-forest-fires-in-uttarakhand/story-KNy18DV582n6Gt9yIGbauM.html

She is belting out songs live on her Facebook page to collect money to feed the needy in the port city.Stephanie Herve, a music therapist, is a regular in Kerala and this time when the lockdown was imposed she pitched in to help the poor who have been struggling for food. “I feel it is my duty. I don’t want to talk much about it,” she said adding she hates publicity for doing “her duty”.“Hailing from Bordeaux she has been visiting Kerala every year. When the lockdown came she said she wanted to help people. Initially, she started funding a community kitchen in the area and later we decided to distribute grocery kits to the needy. Soon, she started singing sessions with my son to collect money for the initiative,” Usha Antony, owner of the homestay in Fort Kochi, where Herve has been staying since March said. She said Herve has distributed around 600 kits containing rice, pulses, cooking oil and other essentials so far.“She possibly contributed food kits worth between Rs 5 lakh or Rs 6 lakh. Her involvement is great and we should salute her spirit. She runs a charity organisation called ‘Gabriel’ in France to fund the cause of children. Now she is conducting regular music and meditation sessions to fund her initiative in Kochi,” Congress leader and former minister Dominic Presentation said.“Besides French, she sings in English and Malayalam also. She has learnt Malayalam and Sanskrit. I was told her Sanskrit hymns are very popular. She has taught my 15-year-old son Tomson Antony French. Her renditions are mellifluous. She likes India very much,” said Usha Antony who is running a homestay in Kochi for the last two decades. Her husband is the cousin of legendary singer K J Yesudas, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stranded-french-woman-in-kochi-sings-on-fb-to-raise-funds-to-feed-poor/story-dkOBVDu0XV0fvZeXkZVmyJ.html

On her return that evening, Pune’s additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal was greeted by her son Rishiv and husband, with welcome cards and her favourite delicacies.This is one of the delightful anecdotes that the IAS officer recounted in an interview to HT as she spoke of her role in bringing the Covid-19 pandemic under control in Pune. Agarwal not only supervises the health department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) bus is also chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL),Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.With Pune being one of the prominent Covid-19 hotspots in the country, second only to Mumbai in Maharashtra, the PMC with its staff of 15,000 people is in the forefront of the city’s response to the pandemic. Till Sunday evening, Pune had recorded 1,283 Covid-19 cases out of which 101 have died, 1,152 are active cases while 131 have recovered.“All our 42 departments are working round-the-clock to provide back-up services, apart from our medical teams, engineers and clerical staff,” said Agarwal.A ‘Command Control War Room’ has been established at the Smart City office to provide the PMC with a focused approach. A lot of emphasis is placed on generating and managing data to ensure areas where maximum efforts are needed, said Agarwal.“We are maximising our efforts in those areas from where the maximum number of positive cases are emerging and undertaking extensive surveys and testing. This is the reason why Pune has started getting more positive patients this week,” she said.Her day starts at 6 am and her morning exercise regimen consists mainly of Suryanamaskar. Some amount of team co-ordination happens from home and then she steps out for work. Even after she returns home in the evening, work continues over the phone right till midnight given the fast-changing scenario on the Covid-19 front. As the Smart City head, she is responsible for updated figures of Covid-19 positive patients, number of deaths and the extent of surveys conducted which is communicated to all the agencies concerned.With the health department under her charge, she needs to regularly review the available manpower and allocate staff as and where required. Her priorities include a review of contact tracing of positive patients and ensuring that quarantined people are taken care of in terms of food and medical attention.“I am also required to visit hospitals dedicated to Covid-19,” said Agarwal, pointing out that as the number of positive patients was increasing in Pune city, the number of quarantine facilities and isolation beds was being increased.She wears a mask, gloves and PPE (personal protective equipment) while visiting hospitals. Her main concern is to ensure that there is no sharp spike of new cases.“From where would I bring additional medical staff to handle the situation if it worsens?” she asks.“This is undoubtedly the most challenging situation in my entire service and in my life; but I am confident we will win this fight against Covid-19,” she says with a sense of purpose. An IAS officer of the 2008 batch, she has worked previously as the Zilla Parishad Chief executive officer and District collector at Jalgaon and as CEO of the Shirdi Sai Baba temple trust.Agarwal is grateful to the unstinted support of her family, municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, civic officials and staff and the district administration.While appreciating the work done by the doctors, nurses and health workers who are at the forefront of this battle, Agarwal says countless people working in the other departments and providing back-up support also deserve applause. These are the people who are working silently and organising the food, preparing hospitals and quarantine centres, going on the field for surveys, creating and managing shelter homes for migrant labourers and coordinating with corporates for assistance, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-challenging-situation-says-ias-officer-leading-pune-s-covid-19-fight/story-pAdDNBtsJxN2MSEWeqMrhO.html

The UV disinfection tower (named UV Blaster) has been developed by Laser Science and Technology Centre (Lastec) with the help of New Age Instruments and Materials Private Limited, Gurugram. Lastec is a Delhi-based DRDO laboratory.“The UV Blaster is useful for high touch surfaces like electronic equipment in laboratories and offices that are not suitable for disinfection with chemical methods,” said the second official cited above.He said the system can also be operated remotely through the laptop or mobile phone using the Wi-Fi link. The UV blaster takes 10 minutes to disinfect a 12 by 12 foot room and 30 minutes for a 400 sq ft area. This system switches off automatically on accidental opening of the room or human intervention, the second official added.Different wings of the defence ministry, including the armed forces and the DRDO, have designed and developed a wide range of products to support the country’s effort to contain the spread of the pandemic.The DRDO has developed many products to combat the pandemic including ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, large area sanitisation solutions and Covid-19 sample collection kiosks. Last month, the DRDO stepped forward to provide medical oxygen plants to hospitals in far-flung areas to help them generate their own oxygen supply.It has also developed a mobile virology research and diagnostics laboratory that will speed up coronavirus disease screening and other Covid-19 research and development activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-develops-uv-disinfection-tower-to-fight-covid-19/story-zvIc0nrJaWZ69Sh2KRt3qK.html

04-05-2020||India||Covid-19: IIT Madras startup eyes special method for coating textiles for PPEs||Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras-backed startup, Muse Wearables, is developing novel and scalable methods for coating textiles with nanoparticles-based antimicrobial agents that can inactivate the human coronavirus on contact, the institute announced on Monday.These coatings are expected to be effective up to 60 wash cycles, thereby making the textiles re-usable. The coated textiles can be primarily used to manufacture N95 masks, surgical masks, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and food packaging bags, among others, with inherent properties of inactivating the coronavirus.Muse Wearables’ current pilot machine can coat textiles of length up to 100 metres within a few minutes, thereby making it a viable commercial solution that can be deployed immediately.Muse Wearables was incubated by IIT Madras Incubation Cell. Startup incubators are usually non-profit organisations that might be run by both public and private entities. Incubators are often associated with universities.“Our startups are working on a range of products that are vital to India and its fight against Covid-19, from N95 masks to intubation boxes and ventilators to affordable testing kits. They have quickly mobilized and repurposed their offerings in response to the situation and are striving to make a positive contribution to the nation and its anti-virus efforts. IITM Incubation Cell continues to assist its startups through these challenging times and hopes that industry support will help them ramp up their efforts in a more meaningful way,” said Dr Tamaswati Ghosh, chief executive officer, IIT Madras Incubation Cell, in a statement.Currently, Muse Wearables is assembling the coating machine and will shortly commence coating various textiles with different nanoparticle solutions. Their coated textiles is expected to be ready for testing by the first week of May 2020. The startup is also partnering with a mask manufacturing company to launch five-layered Antiviral N95 Masks.“Our solution tries to solve the current pandemic problem at the root level by inactivating coronavirus permanently. As soon as it comes in contact with the coated nanoparticles, its structure is permanently destroyed by the nanoparticles. For example, people using masks made by our coated textiles will not transmit the virus to others or have less chances of the virus getting transmitted to them,” said KLN Sai Prasanth, chief executive officer, Conzumex Industries, which operates the brand Muse Wearables.“Our coating process is scalable, which means it can be deployed in any textile industry as a textile finishing process. The solution we are developing are not confined to a research laboratory but can be used for commercial purposes,” he added.What’s the big deal about nano-particle coated textile?*Anti-microbial properties: it continuously captures and destroys viruses and other microbes upon contact*Other viruses as small as 30 nanometre can also be inactivated permanently*Does not leach while washing in water and is environment-friendly*At present can be coated on cotton, polyester and cotton–polyester*More fabrics will be tested soon*Non-toxic; can be safely used for making masks and other PPE||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-iit-madras-startup-eyes-special-method-for-coating-textiles-for-ppes/story-rGBXQzozWFmbppcJbHf36H.html

The state government concerned can also pay for the tickets, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said. He said the Madhya Pradesh government is doing so and asked Rahul Gandhi to tell the Congress-ruled states to follow suit. He was responding to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s attack on the railways for charging poor migrant labourers ticket fare, even as it donated over Rs 151 crore to the PM-CARES Fund.   “Rahul Gandhi ji, I have attached guidelines of MHA which clearly states that ‘No tickets to be sold at any station’. Railways has subsidised 85% & state govt to pay 15%. The state govt can pay for the tickets (Madhya Pradesh’s BJP govt is paying). Ask Cong state govts to follow suit,” Patra tweeted.  The BJP leader further clarified that for each ‘Shramik Express’, special trains being run for migrants, about 1,200 tickets to the destination are handed by the railways to the state government concerned.  State governments are supposed to clear the ticket price and hand over the tickets to workers, he said.  Seeking to corner the central government, the Congress on Monday said its state units will bear the cost of rail travel of needy migrant workers and labourers stranded at their workplaces due to the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. Congress president Sonia Gandhi in a statement announced the party’s decision and said this would be the Congress’ humble contribution in standing shoulder to shoulder with these workers.   In a tweet, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy claimed that migrant workers returning home will not have to pay money as the rail travel will be free from now onwards. Swamy, in a tweet, said, “Talked to Piyush Goel office. Govt will pay 85% and State Govt 15%. Migrant labour will go free.

The Central team complained about the “limited field visits” facilitated by the state government. “The state government has taken an antagonistic view to the IMCT and has not supported the IMCT in the performance of its duties,” read the report.The team further alleged that their experience in Bengal contrasts with the experience of the IMCTs in other states.“The mortality rate of 12.8 % is by far the highest in the country. This extremely high mortality rate is a clear indication of low testing and weak surveillance and tracking,” the report noted.The team said they will be submitting the report to the union home ministry later today. “A discrepancy has been brought out in the number of Covid cases reported by the state in its medical bulletins and its communication with the government of India, said the report. “While the state has claimed very high level of daily surveillance of individuals in containment zones, no database was shown or results made available,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-transparent-don-t-downplay-coronavirus-spread-central-team-to-bengal/story-9mLp4zs2mNz0xZ1Hao9FEI.html

Their tireless efforts are ensuring the containment of the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. Benefits must be extended to these people and the central government must consider them as healthcare workers with immediate effect,” he argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extend-covid-insurance-to-non-medics-chhattisgarh-cm-to-pm-narendra-modi/story-MsjQzyPcrjPlSspWa6JMjO.html
04-05-2020||India||In comeback to Sonia Gandhi, Centre points to 85% subsidy for migrant trains||Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s offensive over the railways charging stranded migrants for their return trip has drawn a strong rebuttal from the Centre. The railways ministry said they were charging state governments just 15% of the calculated train fare for the special trains and it was for the states to bear this cost or get the migrant workers to pay.“It is the stated position of the government that this facility has only been extended so that migrant workers who were stranded due to the lockdown could reach their destination. It was a limited relaxation to ease sufferings during the lockdown to help save lives, not spread the disease,” a senior railway board official said.Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday surprised the government and the BJP on Monday with a sharp attack that accused the Centre of forcing migrant workers to pay for tickets in this hour of crisis. She has asked Congress workers across the country to raise funds to pay for these trains.That call, one BJP leader said, appeared to be a “desperate attempt to revive the fortunes of the party rather than help the migrants”. There are at least two states - Nitish Kumar-ruled Bihar and Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led Madhya Pradesh - that have decided to fund rail travel of its workers. Kumar said the state had funded the travel of students who had returned from Kota in Rajasthan and will do the same for migrant workers as well. “They won’t have to pay anything,” he said.In a string of tweets, Chouhan also hit back at Gandhi declaring that she had been ill-advised. MP already has been paying for the trains, he said, asking the Congress to check what states ruled by her party were doing.Officials said the decision to charge 15% fare also was taken so that state governments did not end up incentivising travel of migrants.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe railways are bearing the 85% cost of running these migrant trains, the official said. In addition to the basic subsidies built into passenger fare, these trains only carry 60 per cent of the capacity due to social distancing norms, have accompanying teams of paramedics and railway security officers to ensure no one gets off midway and returns without passengers on the way back. Besides, there are costs incurred at the receiving and sending stations.Central government officials have, for days, been telling state governments not to encourage migrant workers to travel. It would not only slow down the economic revival process and make the recovery process longer but also could, as the World Bank had also warned south Asian countries, spread the vector across the region.On Friday, the Centre, however, gave in to pressure from state governments which had been demanding special trains to take the stranded workers home and operated the first train between Telangana and Jharkhand.Officials said the Covid-19 lockdown, however painful, was part of the containment process to check the spread of the Covid-19. This strategy has so far shielded the rural areas from the disease.The government had mandated that migrant workers returning home should be placed under home quarantine to protect the local population.But there have been several reports where villages have not allowed the migrant workers to return, insisting that they first go through the quarantine process at a facility on the outskirts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-comeback-to-sonia-gandhi-centre-points-to-85-subsidy-for-migrant-trains/story-5xZWkECgjJYWSCZ5kRayCP.html

The police claimed that the Nautanwa MLA misbehaved with them when he was stopped. “On being stopped by the police he confronted them and the health workers at the barricade. He also misbehaved with them while showing a pass issued by a senior bureaucrat of the Uttarakhand government stating that they should be allowed to visit the shrines to perform last rite rituals for CM Yogi Adityanath’s father, who had passed away recently,” said the official. The police, however, didn’t allow them to pass citing the closure of portals of Badrinath shrine after which they had to return. Later in the night, at around 11 pm, they were stopped by Muni ki Reti police, in Tehri Garhwal district, which booked Tripathi and his supporters. “Tripathi and 11 others were booked for violating the lockdown norms under relevant Disaster Management Act. Also, they had a pass for only 9 people but were 12 that too in three cars when only two passengers along with a driver are allowed,” said Ashok Kumar, director general (law & order). Tripathi was asked to leave the state border, which he did under the supervision of the police, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-mla-with-11-people-en-route-to-badrinath-booked-for-lockdown-violation/story-Fo8i07IYGTCKEeM9mVfi0K.html

Alcohol lovers thronged the shops with many violating the social distancing norms.In the national capital more than 100 people — not all observing social distancing measures — stood in line ahead of the reopening of a liquor store, news agency AP reported. Another liquor store in Old Delhi witnessed about 200 shoppers pushing and shoving each other until the Police intervened. “The government should just keep the liquor shops shut if such crowds are going to gather,” a Delhi resident was quoted by AP. Uttar Pradesh also saw long queues outside many liquor shops. People lined up since early morning to purchase alcohol, as early as 7 am. In Karnataka also, booze lovers thronged liquor stores hours before shutters went up at several places.At some places, they flocked liquor shops even before day-break and performed “special prayers” with flowers, coconuts, incense sticks, camphor and crackers in front of the stores, news agency PTI reported.     Large crowds gathered outside liquor shops across Maharashtra’s Pune city - one of the Covid-19 ‘red’ zones in the state. Mumbai and Pune are under the red zone but the state government notification said standalone liquor shops and those selling non-essential items would be allowed.Long queues outside liquor shops were seen in areas such as Bhandarkar road, Wanawdi, Salunke Vihar and NIBM road area in Pune. However, five districts in Maharashtra have decided not to permit liquor sale.

The man was discharged from the hospital, but is under home quarantine till May 11.“I was frightened of the disease besides being worried about my pregnant wife. However, doctors instilled confidence in me. Constant talks with family members on mobile helped me overcome the sense of fear and depression,” said the 32-year-old.According to the Union health ministry data on Monday, Jharkhand has recorded 115 Covid-19 positive cases, with three people having lost their lives to the pathogen.The railway employee, a trackman, is one of the two persons who till now have tested positive in Dhanbad district, popularly known as the coal city of the country. Both have recovered and now discharged from the hospital.The railway employee is now in home quarantine in his official residence at DS colony, which is under complete curfew since April 18.He is currently living alone as his wife and six-year-old son are with his in-laws in neighbouring Bokaro district. The man’s parents and his two siblings are in their native village in Bihar.His wife has been with her parents since before the lockdown. It had only been few days since he had returned from his in-law’s place to Dhanbad, that he was detected Covid-19 positive. His colony in heart of Dhanbad got converted into a containment zone.Over a dozen primary contacts, including his wife and son were tested, but all of them tested negative for the disease.“I broke down both emotionally and mentally when the doctor in divisional railway hospital (in Dhanbad) informed me that coronavirus has infected me. I had heard about the disease, and mostly bad things. Initially, I had lost hope of recovery. But after getting admitted at the Central Hospital (dedicated Covid-19 hospital), I felt better. Doctors and nursing staff were very encouraging,” said the trackman.Besides the doctors, he also remained in constant touch with his family members. He would call up his family members several times in a day.“I was worried for my wife and family members. But it comforted me when their reports came negative. There was no objection on using the phone any time of the day. Since it was easy to speak to my family members, they were also relieved,” he said.The railway employee said his colleagues and seniors also called him on few occasions to check his condition when in the hospital.He has now set a routine. “Since I am alone in the house, I have engaged myself in cleaning the quarter and other belongings to spend time. I also spend time watching TV besides cooking food and speaking to family members,” he added.On his immediate future plans after completion of his quarantine, he said while he would follow doctors’ prescription on health front. The man is, however, still undecided if he would meet his family soon after coming out of quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-was-frightened-jharkhand-man-on-covid-19-battle-and-how-he-overcame-depression/story-lMyyLK30wsCS9WAOEDu2NM.html

The man asked them to get transit forms so that they could reach their native place in North India amid the coronavirus lockdown. He also charged Rs 200 and issued “receipts” but the trip was never made.Chandrashekhar Jadhav, a union leader, ran the Shramjeevi Kamgar Union at Jai Ambe Industrial Estate in Bhayander E, Maharashtra. He allegedly told migrants, who worked at many industrial units in the above area, to fill a transit form to reach their native place in north India. The migrants were charged Rs 200 each and were issued receipts, said PI Prakash Birajdar of Navghar police station.He even staged social distancing drill, as per rules, and the migrants believed him, said the official. “However, no forms were issued and the migrants lodged a complaint with us. We arrested him under Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations, 2020 and Sections 269, 270 (spread of infectious disease) of the Indian Penal Coder. We arrested him on Sunday and released him on bail,” said Birajdar.Jadhav claimed that he has a clearance from the Mira Bhayander civic body to enlist names of migrants stuck in the twin cities. “We are investigating the matter and checking his previous criminal record as we have reports that Jadhav was earlier arrested in similar cases,” said Birajdar.Meantime, Sanjay Patil, Additional Superintendent of Police, Thane Rural, has warned people not to fall for such scams and inform the police about such fraudsters. The migrants should directly contact the District Collector, Thane online for the transit forms with all identity proofs and a medical certificate from by any approved government medical agency, Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhayander-union-leader-held-for-duping-migrants-promised-them-trip-to-native-place/story-Py2l7KncRyiUxPY7SSVoaO.html

Priyanka Gandhi’s tweets came hours after Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president and her mother, announced the party will pay for the train tickets of all such migrant workers and labourers who are taking special trains run by the Indian Railways.Sonia Gandhi, in a statement, had also criticised the government for not planning ahead before announcing the lockdown, which has now been extended up to May 17.“Workers are nation builders. But today they are struggling to make ends meet - this is a cause of agony for the entire country,” Priyanka Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.She also repeated the Congress president’s points to criticise the government—the Namaste Trump event in Ahmedabad in February and free air travel for Indians stranded abroad—as she posted on Twitter.“When we can bring back Indians stranded abroad in aeroplanes free of cost, when Namaste Trump can spend 100 crore from the government treasury in the program… ” she said. ..जब रेल मंत्री पीएम केयर फंड में 151 करोड़ रु दे सकते हैं तो फिर मजदूरों को आपदा की इस घड़ी में निशुल्क रेल यात्रा की सुविधा क्यों नहीं दे सकते? भारतीय राष्ट्रीय कांग्रेस ने निर्णय लिया है कि घर लौटने वाले मजदूरों की रेल यात्रा का पूरा खर्च उठाएगी। 2/2Priyanka Gandhi’s jibes were also aimed at Piyush Goyal, the railways minister.“When the railway minister can give Rs 151 crore to the PM-CARES Fund, then why can’t the workers get the facility of free rail travel in this hour of disaster?” she asked.“The Indian National Congress has decided that it will bear the full expenses of the rail journey of the workers returning home,” she added.Former Congress president and her brother Rahul Gandhi has also attacked the Centre for charging migrants for train tickets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/they-re-struggling-to-make-ends-meet-priyanka-gandhi-slams-centre-for-charging-migrants-train-fare/story-LLiFy6ELIdhz1gaB0wt1lJ.html

The order was issued in response to a petition filed by the Imran Khan government.The term of the current government in Gilgit-Baltistan is set to end on June 24 and elections have to be held within 60 days.However, the external affairs ministry said India “completely rejects such actions and continued attempts to bring material changes in Pakistan-occupied areas of the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir”, and instead, Pakistan “should immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation”.“It was further conveyed that such actions can neither hide the illegal occupation of parts of Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom to the people residing in Pakistan-occupied territories for the past seven decades,” the statement said.The Indian government’s position on Gilgit Baltistan is reflected in the resolution passed by Parliament in 1994 by consensus, the statement added.The resolution described Jammu and Kashmir as an integral part of India and demanded Pakistan “must vacate” areas of the state “occupied through aggression”.The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the demarche was read out over telephone in view of the Covid-19 lockdown. In normal circumstances, a diplomat can be summoned to the external affairs ministry to receive the demarche.Several other recent demarches were read out to Pakistani diplomats over telephone, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lodges-strong-protest-with-pakistan-over-move-to-hold-elections-in-gilgit-baltistan/story-v4v0xB5W2TPoLw8LAS08zJ.html

Assam shares a 267km border with Bangladesh, of which 90 km falls in Dhubri.“The Bangladeshi nationals were carrying valid travel documents. However, few of their visas had expired during the lockdown restrictions. They were travelling from Upper Assam’s Jorhat district with lockdown passes that were issued for migrant labourers. They’ve been placed in a quarantine facility in the district on Sunday,” said Anant Lal Gyani, deputy commissioner (DC), Dhubri district.The DC said that the 26 Bangladeshi nationals had entered India via the Changrabandha international border in West Bengal’s Cooch Behar district before the lockdown restrictions were enforced. Though they had T-1 visas meant for tourists, they told the officials in Dhubri that they were engaged in fishing activities in Jorhat, he added.“The two vehicles in which they’re travelling were intercepted in Dhubri on Sunday, as the passes issued to them from Jorhat were valid for travel only till the district. Besides, the local address in Dhubri furnished by the Bangladeshi nationals turned out to be fictitious. Later, they admitted that they’re trying to go back to their country,” Gyani said.Yuvraj, superintendent of police (SP), Dhubri district, said that all the relevant details of the Bangladeshi nationals have been shared with the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for the deportation process.“We’ll initiate the process of their deportation soon. They may be deported even before their mandatory 14-day quarantine period ends,” the SP said.Last month, Border Security Force (BSF) officials in Assam’s Karimganj district in the Barak valley had sent back a Bangladeshi national, who had swum across the Kushiyara river on the Indo-Bangla border in a bid to get himself treated in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-govt-initiates-deportation-process-for-26-bangladeshis-held-amid-lockdown/story-exNGf46ekmMdbextRtTsLI.html

Some other arrangement needs to be made and these require time,” Sinha said.“It won’t be proper to allow lakhs of stranded migrants labourers all in one go. They need to be brought back in phases because detailed planning has to be made. Else every effort made till date will go down the drain,” Sinha added.The state, however, has started the inter-district movement of migrant workers stranded in different parts within the state.Despite the pressure being mounted on the government by opposition parties to fast-track the process of bringing back migrant workers, the government has so far given its nod to the entry of two special trains, one from Rajasthan carrying 1,200 pilgrims and the other from Kerala with migrant workers, to enter the state, as of Sunday evening. The train from Rajasthan will originate from Ajmer and stop at two places in West Bengal—Durgapur in West Burdwan district and Dankuni in Hooghly district—on May 5. The train from Kerala will start on May 4. Bengal on Sunday asked the government of Kerala to share the details of every passenger before the journey starts.While top officials of the state government remained tightlipped and there was no press briefing on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Lok Sabha members of the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Left leaders have started contacting other states on their own to arrange for the return of the workers.“I spoke to railway minister Piyush Goyal, who said that Bengal has not applied for any special train but has given consent to let only two trains to enter the state. We are afraid the Bengal government’s delay in arranging for the return of the migrant workers would worsen their plight,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha and a lawmaker from West Bengal. Senior BJP leaders alleged that they had contacted the administration in Karnataka to organise the return of migrant workers stranded there but that the Bengal government did not respond.“Karnataka has already appointed an IAS officer as the nodal officer for dealing with the return of migrant workers to Bengal. But the state government did not contact officials in Karnataka as of Sunday evening,” Sukanta Majumdar, the BJP MP from Balurghat in West Bengal, said.“Bengal’s dillydallying on the issue of bringing back migrant workers, who are our own people, is scandalous. The Centre’s is also behaving in an inhumane way by charging train fare from migrants who stand virtually penniless. The state needs to expedite the process and the centre needs to facilitate,” Communist Party of India (Marxist) politburo member Md Salim said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-allows-2-trains-to-carry-back-stranded-people-oppn-targets-it-for-going-slow/story-efcebr2dnyVTWbF3zJyYwK.html

In April 2018, the departmental promotion committee has held him eligible as he was found guilty in a disciplinary proceeding. In November 2017, his increment was ordered to be withheld without any cumulative effect on his future increments.Sangvikar moved the high court after the MAT rejected his plea in March 2019. He challenged the validity of the GR contending that it was arbitrary, illegal and violative of the constitutional mandate of equality. It was also argued on his behalf that he could not have been denied a promotion, as no disciplinary proceeding was pending against him at the relevant time.The high court, however, rejected the argument. It said when an officer is found guilty in a departmental proceeding, the imposition of punishment is with an object to improve his conduct and to enforce discipline. “Denial of promotion in such circumstance is not a penalty but a necessary consequence of his conduct,” said the bench. The bench noted that the DLC took into consideration that at the relevant time, his punishment was not over. Besides, he had not been debarred for promotion and could be considered after the period of punishment is over in June 2020.“There is, therefore, no discrimination found in the matter of promotion of the present petitioner,” said the bench. “It cannot be expected from any administration to reward an employee with a promotion during his period of sentence. As such, we do not find any arbitrariness in the decision taken by the departmental promotion committee (DPC).”The bench also held that the policy contained in the GR was in larger public interest, keeping in mind difficulties faced by various departments dealing with such employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/employee-found-guilty-of-misconduct-can-t-be-treated-equally-with-others-bombay-high-court/story-XeGnRgzCK6FhiF1IQYH1zN.html
04-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown eased in hardest-hit Maharashtra; officials wary of adverse effect||The Maharashtra government revised its order on Sunday, easing most of the restrictions on the industrial and commercial activities even in the urban areas mostly earmarked as Covid-19 red zones. The decision came a day before the third phase of nationwide lockdown comes into effect, where considerable relaxations have been given by the Centre to revive the economy.The Maharashtra government allowed the shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities to open even in the 14 districts identified as red zones; the restrictions, however, will continue in the containment zones. This has paved way for the operations of almost all the commercial activities including opening of liquor shops from Monday.The decision has been taken to revive the state economy, which has taken a massive hit due to the coronavirus lockdown. Maharashtra witnessed loss in revenue receipts of more than Rs 41,000 crore (around 17-18% of the annual receipts) in March and April.The authorities, however, feel that the relaxation may lead to the largescale violations of lockdown norms in major cities like Mumbai, Thane and Pune that account for 90 per cent of the Covid-19 cases and may lead to surge in the spread of the disease.“The decision was reversed within 24 hours, eyeing at the revenue loss. However, it may become difficult for the authorities now to restrict the crowding in these cities. Sensing this, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed the officials to ensure strict implementation of the lockdown in these areas. It going to be tough in the urban areas,” said a senior government official.THe Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have 88.9 per cent of the cases (11,538 of 12,974) and 86.1 per cent of the deaths (473 of 548) in the state as on Sunday. Mumbai alone has 1,577 containment zones, of which 533 have bee marked as red, 633 blue and 359 orange.Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in the country, has recorded 12,974 Covid-19 cases and 548 cases. of them, 8,800 cases and 343 deaths are reported in Mumbai alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-eased-in-hardest-hit-maharashtra-officials-wary-of-adverse-effect/story-9Rgw9nprLz2ebKgMIRVBIL.html

State capital Bhopal is next in terms of number of cases. There are 532 Covid-19 patients in Bhopal; the death toll stands at 15.Ujjain has 156 Covid-19 positive patients and 30 dead. The death rate of Ujjain is 26.92 per cent followed by Indore with 4.84 per cent and Bhopal with 2.81 per cent. The recovery percentage in Ujjain is 11.53 while in Indore it is 22.32 and Bhopal 44.54.Jabalpur, another divisional headquarters which has had 96 patients so far, has witnessed just one death but its recovery rate is slightly worse than that of Ujjain - 10.41 per cent.Chief minister’s instructions to authorities to send a special team to Ujjain came during a review meeting on Sunday.An official communiqué from the government said, “It was found during the review of Ujjain district that the death rate of Corona patients is the highest over there. We have to save every patient at any rate.”The chief minister also instructed the authorities to pay attention to Burhanpur too which has densely populated localities. Dhar administration was also instructed to be careful in the wake of the spread of Covid-19.Additional chief secretary, health department, Mohd Suleman said, “As many as 2,600 tests are being carried in 14 labs of the state now. On May 3, fifty positive cases were found out of 2,608 tests.”A BJP leader claimed the government took Ujjain situation seriously after the chief minister received complaint from party leaders that there was negligence in treatment of the 56-year-old BJP corporator who came from the minority community. He was admitted on April 20 and died on Sunday. He was active in distributing food packets among people in Covid-19 affected localities before he fell ill. However, public health expert Amulya Nidhi termed the state government’s move to send a special team to Ujjain as ‘too little and too late’.He said, “Ujjain’s situation has been grim for a long time. There was no adequate survey, screening, collection of samples and tests right from day one. There was inordinate delay in getting tests reports. Meanwhile, the virus was spreading alarmingly in certain localities under the very nose of the administration and health department. The government should immediately increase the number of tests and do a comprehensive survey and screening of people over there.”Meanwhile, the state government has decided not to charge fare from labourers being brought in trains from other states. The state government has also notified a toll free phone number 0755-2411180 on which people stranded in other states can seek assistance and information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-indore-ujjain-in-madhya-pradesh-now-in-grip-of-covid-19-govt-deploys-special-team/story-vI3qc5v8nOOCVE8xRN6njL.html

For the family of Danika Chaudhary, her first birthday was that moment.The Covid-19 lockdown made it impossible for Chaudhary’s father Arun Tomar to celebrate her first birthday on a grand scale in Kota. But the city police ensured they don’t miss out on fun.Additional SP, Kota, Headquarter, Rajesh Kumar Meel along with his securitymen wearing masks and gloves arrived at the residence of Tomar in Kota on Monday where they gifted the baby girl Danika Chaudhary a birthday cake.Tomar and his family was in surprise and awe of the Kota cops’ gesture.“We did not expected this and it was a welcome move. Since it was the first birthday of our daughter, we were emotional about it but Kota police made the day for us,” said Tomar, who works as a radio jockey.Tomar further said that the family had decided to celebrate the baby’s first birthday at home because no grand celebrations are allowed during the lockdown.Additional SP Meel said that Tomar had met him a few days ago and talked about not being able to celebrate her daughter’s first birthday. “So we decided to give our blessings by visiting them,” he said.Rajasthan reported three more coronavirus deaths on Sunday, while 114 people tested positive for the virus.Of the 114 new cases, 40 are from Chittorgarh, 32 from Jaipur, 27 from Jodhpur, five from Udaipur, three from Ajmer, two each in Bharatpur, Kota and Pratapgarh and one from Dungarpur, according to a state government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kota-police-surprise-family-of-birthday-girl-stuck-inside-due-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-h7cMb1Gaa2kLBj2OBhD8FP.html

The state government had empowered the two district collectorates to enlist the number of labourers stranded in Goa because of the Covid-19 lockdown and who were seeking to return home, following which these people signed up to be ferried back home.They include 18,000 migrant workers from Karnataka, 17,000 from Uttar Pradesh and 11,000 from Bihar. “We are in talks with the railways authorities and special trains will be arranged which will begin from one station in Goa and culminate at a station in UP and Bihar,” Sawant said while addressing a press conference. He, however, didn’t elaborate on when these arrangements will be finalised only saying that the departure of the trains will be announced publicly. Sawant also urged the labourers to continue to remain in the state saying that after economic activities resume, workers, especially in the construction sector, will be in short supply. The government also welcomed Goa residents who have been stranded at different parts of the country and wish to travel to the state on their own but cautioned they will be taken to the quarantine centre once they are back and will be kept there until the results of their swab tests are in and reported negative. More than 3,000 Goans are seeking to return home, many of whom are willing to come back in their own vehicles and have registered online for transit permits on the Goa government website. “After that, we will send them home with a home quarantine stamp mandating that they quarantine themselves at home for 14-days,” Sawant.While those who show residence proof will be quarantined for free, those who are not ideally residents of Goa but need to visit because of emergencies, including the ill health of relative, and for work reasons will be allowed in the state but will have to pay Rs 2,500 per day for their 14-day quarantine in a hotel. “We will not be liberally issuing permissions to persons for whom Goa is not home. Only in the case of emergencies, they will be allowed as an exception,” Sawant said.Earlier this week, around a hundred labourers converged at a railway station after word spread that trains were being arranged to take them back to their home state, necessitating the intervention of the police to help them return to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/71-000-stranded-labourers-seek-to-leave-goa-transport-being-arranged-cm-sawant/story-SpkcOrZez0Y0QgvRYn95TK.html
04-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Key services to resume in Delhi today||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that his government was allowing self-employed people including domestic help, those involved in laundry services, technicians, electricians and plumbers to operate in the national capital from Monday, when the third phase of the national lockdown over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) kicks in with considerable relaxations.The Delhi government released its implementation strategy over the guidelines released by the Union home ministry, with Kejriwal saying that the Capital will follow the lockdown restrictions enforced by the Centre. He, however, urged the central government to lift restrictions in the Capital’s areas that have largely remained unaffected by the disease. The Union government announced on Friday that the lockdown, necessitated by the infectious outbreak, was being extended by two weeks till May 17.Detailing the Delhi government’s plan at a news briefing on Sunday, Kejriwal said: “Self-employed people – technicians, plumbers, electricians, mechanics, sanitation staff, people working as domestic help, laundry, dhobis – people like these the permission to work.”The Delhi CM also said print and electronic media, IT-related services, call centres, data centres, warehousing services, cold storages, private security firms and industrial estates with access control will also be allowed to remain open. Elevator technicians, AC mechanics, vehicle mechanics, generator mechanics and TV mechanics will also be allowed to work from Monday. The Delhi chief minister on March 23 announced a complete lockdown in the Capital to contain Covid-19, which has severely hit metropolises across the world, days before the central government announced similar restrictions across the nation.While public health experts say the lockdown was needed to control the disease from spiralling out of control, there have been concerns over stalling economic activity. Kejriwal said on Sunday Delhi was reporting heavy revenue losses and it was important to reopen areas largely outside the spectre of the pathogen to ensure people don’t travel back to their hometowns because of the lack of employment. Currently, there are 94containment zones in the national capital.The Delhi CM said that people were losing jobs and traders were suffering because there was no business. He, however, reiterated the Centre’s rule on people not being allowed to step out of their homes for non-essential activities from 7pm to 7am.Kejriwal said government offices and private facilities with 33% staff will open from Monday but the suspension of travel by air, metro and bus will continue. Delivery of essential goods through e-commerce portals will continue in the national capital, he said.“Malls, cinemas, salons, market complexes and Delhi Metro will remain shut while shops selling essentials will continue will be open,” he said, adding that 50 people will be allowed in marriage function. Movement of individuals and vehicles is allowed only for permitted activities, with a maximum of two persons (besides the driver) in four-wheeler vehicles, and with no pillion rider in the case of two-wheelers.Shortly after Kejriwal’s announcement, residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in Delhi said they were open to letting electricians and plumbers enter the residential complexes, but expressed concern over domestic help resuming work.Rajiv Kakria, convener, Save Our City campaign, said the Delhi government’s decision came just a day after the city reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a single day. “If the government ensures that the situation is conducive and there are zero movements from containment zones, then it can be eased. But it is better to wait and see how the situation pans out,” he said. “Domestic help work in at least 5-6 households… It is risky, especially now when the cases are spiralling up,” he added.Madhur Srivastava, RWA president, Sector-4 DDA colony of Dwarka, said: “We have a designated electrician, plumber and a person who irons clothes. We used to allow residents to use services from outside but that will strictly be banned now.”The Delhi government, RWAs say, has allowed self-employed people to work but without making any provision for their commute. “Public transport is not allowed, then how will they come?” said Atul Goyal, president URJA, a united front of a group RWAs in Delhi.Reacting to the latest relaxations, Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “When these people come for one, they should ensure to wear a mask while working and wash their hands before starting the work. If there are elderly people or children at home, then they should be kept away as chances of them contracting the infection are high in case the domestic help is infected but asymptomatic.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, welcomed the government’s decision to allow self-employed people working as domestic help. “This decision will help both, as there are people, especially the elderly, who are finding it difficult to manage the household without any help. It will also provide financial stability to domestic help. People should teach them how to protect themselves from the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-services-to-resume-in-delhi-today/story-r1nVyt0m9QjiiGeTNe3m0M.html
04-05-2020||India||Prison authorities told to allow video calls between jail inmates, their kin||Worried over coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection spread in country’s overcrowded prisons, the ministry of home affairs on Sunday issued fresh guidelines for detained, convicted and undertrials.The government has ordered that all the Mulaqats – meeting between the prisoners and their family members, be stopped till the pandemic is controlled and that video calls/phone calls be allowed. The prisons have also been asked to stop all group activities of the inmates barring crucial ones with social distancing measures.It also asked all the states’ chief secretaries and prison heads to earmark separate building as a holding area for those detainees who might have had a history of foreign travel or exposure to Covid-19 patients. The jail staff members who are showing any Covid-19 symptoms must not be allowed entry the jail, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued along with the order stated.The MHA decided to issue detailed guidelines for prisons after close to two dozen cases of infections were reported at Indore jail in Madhya Pradesh.“People in prisons and other places of detention, living in closed and crowded environment, are likely to be more vulnerable to the coronavirus disease. Moreover, experience shows that prisons, jails and similar settings where people gather in close proximity may act as a source of infection and spread of infectious diseases within and beyond prisons. Any control strategy for Covid-19 in the community which does not encompass the prison context will not be sustainable,” Home secretary Ajay Bhalla stated in his letter.For the prisoners who are moving in and out daily, MHA has recommended that a daily diary be maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prison-authorities-told-to-allow-video-calls-between-jail-inmates-their-kin/story-9KJFx6oot1DE8dfZchX17O.html
04-05-2020||India||Disagree with call for RSS ban: Cong leader Singhvi||Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi on Sunday said he disagreed with those who sought a ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying the country needed divergent views. His remarks came in response to ‘#BanRSS hashtag’ trend on Twitter.“India needs the extreme left and right views in economic spectrum. Similarly, need non-Hindu and Hindu views. Hence, cannot ban RSS. It’s important that people from all walks exist in India to make us truly plural. Disagree with #BanRSS! Equally disagree with many #rss views!” he tweeted.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has been critical of the RSS and is facing a defamation case in Mumbai for linking the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh with the RSS. While stepping down from the Congress president’s post on May 25 last year after the 2019 Lok Sabha loss, Gandhi said he often stood alone in the fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the RSS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disagree-with-call-for-rss-ban-cong-leader-singhvi/story-R0T4s69RbeAadVB5WGgGUP.html
04-05-2020||India||India tally over 40k, 427 new cases in city||The number of Covid-19 cases in India crossed 40,000 and the national capital saw its highest single-day spike on Sunday, with the contagion in the country largely driven by urban hot spots, even as the central and state governments sketched out plans to relax some of the lockdown curbs in low-risk areas from Monday while putting in place measures to prevent a jump in infections.According to data by state health departments, 2,616 new patients were diagnosed on Sunday, taking the country’s total tally to 42,527 cases including 1,393 fatalities. Delhi on Sunday reported 427 new cases, its highest increase in one day, as the number of infections in the Capital rose to 4,549 including 64 deaths. While cases across the country have steadily increased since March, the latest 10,000 infections were recorded in 5 days, two days fewer than it took for the tally to go from 20,000 to 30,000. It took about 43 days for India to record its first 10,000 positive cases. Of these, the three worst-hit states -- Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi -- accounted for 56.5% of the fresh infections, signalling how metropolises have become breeding grounds of the highly infectious disease that has ravaged countries worldwide and brought the global economy to a standstill.The Union government has maintained that the country is on the right path in controlling the infections and that the spread of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is slowing down. Data shows that India’s doubling rate — the average period it takes for infections to double — has gone up from four days at the beginning of April to around 11.5 days as of Sunday.“If in last 14 days, the doubling rate was 10.5 days, then today it is around 12 days,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan told reporters in Delhi on Sunday. He said India’s mortality rate, which is 3.2%, is among the lowest in the world, and added that the country was “on the path of success” to win the “war” against Covid-19.At 12,947, Maharashtra has the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, of which 8,800 are in India’s financial capital Mumbai. Authorities fear that the number of infections could balloon if the disease spreads in Mumbai’s Dharavi , the slum colony that has 850,000 residents and where about 590 cases have been reported so far.Maharashtra is followed by Gujarat, with 5,428 cases recorded till Sunday. Other cities such as Madhya Pradesh’s Indore (over 1,500 cases) and Uttar Pradesh’s Agra (over 500 cases) have also emerged as hot spots. While public health experts have lauded India’s action in enforcing strict nationwide lockdown on March 25, when there were just over 500 positive cases, they say the next few weeks will be crucial for the country to flatten its curve of infections so the health care system is not overwhelmed.The developments come a day before the 3rd phase of the nationwide lockdown comes into effect. Although the Centre extended the lockdown till May 17, it has allowed relaxations according to zones – red, orange and green – that are categorised by the perceived risk of the disease’s spread.“The challenge ahead lies that cases do not leak from red or orange zones into green zones as then we can say the curve has truly flattened... In many ways, the map of India will change for a few months, and your actions will evolve based on the colour coding of country’s map,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS Delhi and member of the national task force for Covid-19 outbreak.To ensure that India is prepared to handle a spike in infections, the Centre has scaled up health infrastructure and testing capabilities. A total of 1,046,450 tests were conducted by Sunday, with over 74,000 samples being tested daily, according to the health ministry. “Our strategy remains to strengthen surveillance, effective contact tracing, and scaling up testing so that all positive cases are traced, tested, isolated and treated, and to cut the chain of transmission,” said a senior health ministry official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tally-over-40k-427-new-cases-in-city/story-qFRBQSIYnYLDhlBPq8dJ6J.html

The trials will be conducted at BJ Medical College, Pune. The institute in Mumbai’s Parel had submitted the proposal to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) last month as a therapeutic treatment. “The vaccine helps to improve the immune system among people, so it is believed that it can be used as a therapeutic treatment for patients with Covid-19. Preliminary research has shown that it has helped to neutralise the virus to some extent,” said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD).Around 35 people with moderate and severe infection will be part of the trial. Dr. Usha Padmanabhan who currently heads the Department of Cell Biology at Haffkine Institute will be in-charge of the trial. Dr Rajesh Deshmukh, managing director of the Institute said, “Unlike other new drugs, it would be easier to treat patients as this vaccine is already available in markets. We have already set up the laboratory for the trial at the college.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haffkine-institute-gets-approval-for-bcg-trial/story-2sgLGdF7U0Foodf19J4t7J.html
04-05-2020||India||Forest panel to share its views on Etalin Hydropower Project soon||The minutes of environment ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC) of April 23 when they considered granting forest clearance the contentious Etalin Hydropower project of 3097 MW in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, will be made public next week. But, senior environment ministry officials said the FAC hasn’t taken a decision on whether to reject or allow the project yet.The environment ministry’s forest division has been overwhelmed in the past week by letters and submissions on the project which will involve clearing of at least 2.7 lakh trees. After several conservation scientists and researchers wrote to FAC about losing a significant tiger habitat and biodiversity rich sub-tropical evergreen and rainforests, the Idu Mishmi community of Dibang valley has also started petitioning the FAC.“We have received some letters which are in favour of the project and some which are not. We plan to release the minutes of our discussion in FAC meeting next week but a decision is still not taken. We require more information. We will address the concerns raised by scientists and conservationists at an appropriate time,” said Sanjay Kumar, director general of forests.Among several petitions received by the ministry, the Project Affected People Forum who are residents of the valley near Tangon and Dri tributaries of Dibang river where concrete gravity dams will be constructed, also wrote to the ministry. The petition said that scientists and researchers with “anti-development mindset” are trying to sabotage the project by running a signature campaign against it.The members of the forum said that the project will be critical for the remote region which has been neglected by the government. “There are no basic services like proper healthcare services, schools here. When the project comes up people will get jobs. This is a very remote area. The project is also important for Arunachal Pradesh which has no source of revenue generation. There are no big industries here. China across the border has already built several dams on the rivers,” said Rohit Mele, chief advisor of the forum over phone.More importantly, 250 families have been assured compensation under the land acquisition act which hasn’t come through yet. “Land acquisition has been completed and detailed project report made. All technical formalities are over except forest clearance and environmental clearance. These families are waiting for compensation,” added Mele who said that the project developers (Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited) have assured that there will be no major environmental or biodiversity impact from the project.Another group of Idu Mishmi people in a different letter to FAC highlighted that the project threatens the culture and heritage of local people.Referring to a Wildlife Institute of India (WII) report commissioned by the FAC which found that there are no tigers in the community forests outside the Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary, the letter said: “There are several omissions and contradictions in the findings of WII. Arguing that tigers are not found in the community forest outside of Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary is a total disrespect of our community’s knowledge and traditions. In reality it is a fact that parents and elders of the Mishmi community have always narrated to their children how they have witnessed tigers with their own eyes. It is we the locals who have experienced, known and managed this land for centuries,” the letter by Kera-aa Initiatives for Cultural and Ecological Security, Mishmi Hills said.Anoko Mega, member of the Arunachal Pradesh Wildlife Board in his letter dated May 2 to FAC said that the Talon river is sacred to the community and the souls of those departed.“The population of the Idu Mishmi community is less than 15,000 individuals. We are aminority tribal group and the Dibang Valley is our homeland…despite mass protests from our community, India’s biggest dam – Dibang Multipurpose Project - has already been approved on the Dibang river. Between both dams it is expected that 6 lakh trees will be cut down. With the destruction of the Dibang Valley, where will my community turn and what will be left for our future generations?” he asked.According to FAC’s own factsheet, the project falls under the richest bio-geographical province of the Himalayan zone and falls under one of the mega biodiversity hotspots of the world. The proposed project location falls at the junction of the Paleoarctic, Indo-Chinese, and Indo-Malayan bio-geographic regions having luxuriant forests and plethora of flora and fauna. It is also a “vital tiger area.”HT had written to Jindal Power Limited on April 29 about a response on the ecological concerns raised by conservationists but the company hasnt responded to the query yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-panel-to-share-its-views-on-etalin-hydropower-project-soon/story-ohYk0xwKdSh0V0tkPUQmDP.html
04-05-2020||India||Centre rushes 20 health teams to 20 districts||The Union health ministry said on Sunday it was deploying 20 central teams to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots including Delhi and Mumbai to assist in controlling high caseloads and helping the state governments in their strategies against the contagion.The move comes days after the Union home ministry sent Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) to states where the situation was “especially serious”. The central teams have flagged areas of concern in the states over the battle against Covid-19 and suggested remedial measures.“The teams of experienced specialists were constituted over the weekend and are being sent to the states from where maximum cases are being reported. These teams will assist the state government in surveillance, implementing effective contact tracking measures, case management and infection control,” said a senior health ministry official on Sunday, asking not to be named.The severely hit districts where these 20 teams will work with state experts are Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Delhi (south-east and central districts), Indore, Pune, Jaipur, Thane, Surat, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Jodhpur, Agra, Kolkata, Kurnool, Guntur, Krishna and Lucknow. “These teams will support the states in implementation of containment measures for Ccovid-19 in the affected areas within these districts/cities. The teams shall assist the state governments,” a statement by the health ministry said.Another official said these are districts with high cumulative positive figures, cases doubling too frequently or high death rates.According to the health ministry’s revised list on Saturday, 130 districts across the country are “red zone” or hot spots of the disease. While there are 284 “orange zones”, 319 districts are “green zone”, which have largely remained outside the spectre of the highly contagious disease.All major metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, are now “red zones” as they have been reporting high caseloads and infection clusters.The states of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have the highest number of “red zones” at 19 and 14 respectively, followed by Tamil Nadu at 12. All of Delhi’s 11 districts are hot spots.The new list has been prepared by including factors such as incidence of testing, level of testing, and population density of the area. “This is a dynamic list that gets revised on a daily basis as the outbreak is a highly evolving situation,” an official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rushes-20-health-teams-to-20-districts/story-KQvuHLH5GGWb57Yv0jw7HI.html

Strong winds and thundershowers is likely to continue impacting the region on Monday and Tuesday due to an intense western disturbance and moisture incursion from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.“There is heating in many parts of the country and (also) a lot of moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea. All conditions are favourable for thunderstorm activity over northwest India. Western Disturbances (WDs) pass through the region round the year, but this time we are also seeing some intense WDs,” said M Mohapatra, the director general of IMD.IMD’s Sunday bulletin said due to strong southeasterly and easterly winds from May 3 to 6 in the lower levels over northern plains of India, along with fresh moisture incursion from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, fairly widespread rain and thunderstorms as well as lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) is likely over this region. Peak activity over the Western Himalayas is likely on May 4 and 5, while peak activity over the northern plains, including Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh is likely on May 5.“Already hailstorm has started impacting south Haryana and some parts of Rajasthan. Rest of the northern states are experiencing thunderstorms and rain. This year we had a pattern of unusually high number of WDs since January, when there were nine WDs against a normal of three-four. In April there were seven WDs,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre. “It’s too early to link it with climate change. We have to see if this pattern sustains for a few years,” he added.Scientists earlier told HT that such changes in the WD pattern may be due to weather anomalies in Europe, because WDs originate as low-pressure systems in the Mediterranean or they could also be linked to favourable sea temperatures over the Pacific.The maximum temperature on May 2 reached 44 to 45 degrees C in parts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and southwest Madhya Pradesh. Heat wave conditions are likely to develop over these areas in the next three-four days, according to IMD. Also, Cyclone ‘Amphan’ may develop over the south Andaman Sea in the next three-four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thundershowers-hail-and-strong-winds-will-affect-northwest-india-for-2-more-days/story-0l9JPkdmm1HpCDAz60r21K.html
04-05-2020||India||Restaurants stare at uncertain future as customers may not have the stomach to dine out||Since the second week of March, restaurants, pubs and discotheques across the world have shut down as the first signs of the Covid-19 pandemic taking hold emerged. Nearly two months later, owners are unsure when they will be able to reopen their outlets and what their business would be like once they do.A combination of risks has made this segment of the hospitality business particularly vulnerable to the crisis, with infections feared to spread in closed, indoor spaces – which most eateries are – and through multiple points of contact, whether the food, the dishes or even furniture on an average day filled with multiple customers.“The problem is at two levels. How do you comply with social distancing rules in restaurants, where putting a distance of say 1-2 metres between tables will be difficult, and how do you convince people that the food that they will be served is safe,” said Anurag Katriar, president of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) and CEO of deGustibus that runs Mumbai’s Indigo chain of restaurants.Nightclubs, bars and the banqueting business will be particularly affected, the NRAI president said, since these depend on large crowds.The coronavirus disease has been established to spread in closed spaces like restaurants, with one such instance taking place in Guangzhou, China, where nine people contracted the disease from a fellow diner. Crucially, dozens of others present in the eatery at the time did not get the disease, which health authorities said was because the infections were spread only among those who were sitting within the draught of the same air conditioner as the infected person.At least three American provincial officials – in New York, Connecticut and Atlanta – have hinted at letting restaurants expand to streets outside, which will be closed to vehicles to make more room for pedestrians and cyclists as an alternative to more risky mass transit.“I think such a dining option is a good way out for restaurants at present, but in congested cities like Mumbai, this will be difficult,” Katriar said.The new normal, Katriar added, will depend on how severely India is hit by the pandemic. “If India emerges with, say, 2,000 casualties, it will be very different from a situation if there are 20,000 casualties,” he said. “If the disease takes a big toll, people will be reluctant to go out to eat for a long time,” he added.For the time being, according to the restaurateur, businesses could look at carrying out regular batch testing and disclosing the results to make customers feel safe about eating out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restaurants-and-eateries-stare-at-uncertain-future-as-customers-may-not-have-the-stomach-to-dine-out/story-uYUFsPoN57JxMnKRHkXZLI.html
04-05-2020||India||Kerala plans reverse quarantine for elderly||Kerala, the state with the lowest Covid-19 mortality and highest recovery rate in India, is set to take the fight against the viral pandemic to the next stage by implementing a “reverse quarantine” to protect its elderly and people ailing with medical conditions that make them susceptible to the virus.The state, which on January 30 was the first in India to report a coronavirus case, is seeking to preserve the impressive gains it had made in the battle against the pathogen, which has affected 499 people, of whom 95 are active patients. Four have died. A blueprint for the reverse quarantine has already been prepared and health workers have started monitoring the medical conditions of the elderly and people whose immunity may have been compromised and left them susceptible to Covid-19 by existing health conditions.Experts say reserve quarantine refers to a practice of isolating the most vulnerable people -- those of advanced age and under treatment for existing ailments -- from the rest of the population and monitoring their health closely to protect them from infection.“In Kerala, we have 70 lakh people who are above 65 years of age and suffer from diabetes, cancer, blood pressure, heart ailments, kidney disease and respiratory tract infections. They are sitting ducks. Our priority is to detach them from others and protect them,” said Dr B Iqbal, who heads an expert panel that advises the state government on prevention of the coronavirus disease.“In case of a community spread we can isolate vulnerable population and check their mortality rate effectively unlike what happened in some of the western countries. We have formed grassroots committees to monitor their health conditions. Besides local body members, Asha {accredited health activist} workers, resident association office-bearers, youth volunteers and local police officers will be part of these committees,” he said.The plan is being implemented at a time when Kerala is preparing to receive, once flights resume, citizens from the state who are either stuck overseas, mainly in the Middle East, or have lost their jobs.Family members of Keralites settled abroad, pregnant women and students of Indian origin who want to pursue higher education at home are among the 300,000 people who have registered on a website opened by the Kerala government for such people last week.Some returnees from overseas locations n March had turned super spreaders after jumping home quarantine, prompting the state to adopt a more cautious approach this time. Experts like Dr. Iqbal say that a reverse quarantine is a viable option until an effective vaccine is found for Covid-19. Once a person is in put in reverse quarantine, a separate room with a toilet is given to him or her and their interaction with other family members is limited. Social distancing norms and face masks are a must. In north Kerala, many cancer patients have already been put in reverse quarantine.“Since it is a new virus we need a multipronged strategy to deal with it. Reverse quarantine is one among them. We can’t say how long the virus will be active and {when the local population will} achieve herd immunity. So we can isolate people who are more prone to it. As Kerala is an informed society it is better to practise it here,” said epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, also former principal of the Christian Medical College, Vellore.A sense of deprivation and neglect can set in among those prescribed reverse quarantine, and it has to be addressed by family members and medical counsellors. Some areas, especially north Kerala, have strong palliative care services and volunteers from the region can be used elsewhere to tend to patients, said Dr Iqbal.“We can’t live in a lockdown like this for long. We have to live with it till a vaccine is found. So we have to evolve a mechanism to suit this. Like social distancing, reverse quarantine is a way to check the mortality rate,” said another expert, adding the key is “minimum exposure” of the vulnerable to the outside world. In so-called red zones,a ban has been enforced on people above 65 and children below 10 years stepping out of their houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-plans-reverse-quarantine-for-elderly/story-eo2kSbNaNWEKZjMlqRIaCJ.html
04-05-2020||India||Need to reboot health care system to also focus on non-Covid patients||Many hospitals that had shut down non-essential care services and postponed elective surgeries to lower crowding and free up health staff to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients will begin working to capacity once the lockdown lifts, but operations are unlikely to return to what they were before. “Hospitals have and must adapt and evolve to treat patients with and without Covid-19, to ensure no one dies because of lack of treatment. Elective procedures can be postponed for a while, but they cannot be postponed indefinitely. We’re already seeing complications of gall bladder stones getting septic and people getting heart attacks, which could have been averted. Separated Covid-19 hospitals and wards, and strong infection-control and crowd management protocols will ensure patients and health staff will stay protected,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, who heads Medanta-The Medicity, Gurugram.Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, cancers, diabetes and chronic kidney disease account for around 61.8% in 2016, as compared to 37.9% in 1990, of all deaths in India, according to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) report: India - Health of the Nation’s States 2018. With social distancing being the new normal, reduced movement associated with social distancing and unhealthy snacking is threatening to aggravate risk factors for NCDs, such as obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol.“A month of being cooped up indoors would not have caused irreversible health damage, but it will if it continues. Outdoor physical activity must be consciously re-initiated once movement restrictions are slowly lifted. More effort must be made to commence outdoor activity with basic precautions, such as wearing masks and not moving in groups,” said Dr Nikhil Tandon, professor and head of the department of endocrinology and metabolism, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.What needs as much attention is the absence of routine, and anxiety about an uncertain future that will lead to undiagnosed mental health issues in millions of people. “A lack of structure can really damage health because regularity of when you eat, how much your exercise, when you sleep is critical to manage NCDs, such as diabetes, obesity and depression,” said Dr Tandon.Many states in India have halted immunisation and reproductive health outreach services as community health workers help with Covid-19 surveillance and contact tracing. Missed immunisation may lead to a resurgence of potentially fatal vaccine-preventable diseases, such as childhood pneumonias, diphtheria, pertussis, hepatitis B and diarrhoea. This threatens to reverse the gains India has made by immunising children against vaccine-preventing illnesses to bring down infant mortality rate to 33 per 1,000 live births in 2017 from 34 the year before.States must begin drives to catch up on missed services. “Given travel restrictions and the very fear of contracting the disease, we have evidence showing that fewer women and children are visiting health facilities now... We see a gradual attention turning to safe motherhood, family planning services, emergency obstetric care, including safe abortion, but in India we are dealing with vast numbers, unlike any other country. Women of reproductive age here are close to 350 million. So the need is huge, but the Indian economy is the 5th in the world and if anyone can afford it, India is right at the top,” said Argentina Matavel Piccin, UNFPA Representative, India.The national programmes to eliminate malaria, and treat tuberculosis and HIV have also taken a hit and will need a push to ensure they don’t derail. “Overall case notification (in India) has significantly declined due to reduced testing and though the lab services are open, people cannot come due to the lockdown. Once the lockdown is relaxed or completely removed, we think there will be a surge in people seeking services,” said Jamie Tonsing, Regional Director of The South-East Asia Office of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases ( The Union).Government officials are now realising the need to integrate health programmes, data systems and cross-departmental planning so that multiple agencies can work together. “What Covid-19 has taught us well is the need for coordination, not just inter-departmental, but also inter-ministerial. The central and state governments should not go back to bureaucratic normal after the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic is over but share resources to reach the common goal of keeping people healthy,” said a senior health ministry official, who did not want to be named. “We don’t want a situation like in Congo where after Ebola, more people die of TB, malaria and measles than from Ebola,” he said.“The biggest issue with public health delivery post-Covid is the recognition that universal health coverage is critical for any country to face a pandemic. Many countries are learning that you cannot build health care capacity during a crisis. It takes time and investment to build a good public health system. India has failed to invest in health for decades and this must change post-Covid19. Health spend must at least increase to 2.5% of GDP, at a minimum,” said Prof Madhukar Pai, Canada Research Chair in Translational Epidemiology & Global Health, and director, McGill Global Health Programs, McGill University, Montreal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-reboot-health-care-system-to-also-focus-on-non-covid-patients/story-a3caJQjm2BplVsvl3vkt8J.html
04-05-2020||India||Social distancing, curbs to mark flight and train travel||Social distancing requirements on long-distance travel modes such as trains and flights are likely to require operators to adopt drastic new measures, most of which will also impact the economics of their business. The civil aviation and the railways ministries are considering several restrictions such as crowd management, screening of possible infected persons and new rules that will make masks mandatory for all passengers as part of standard operating protocols (SOP) likely to be put in place when trains and flights can be resumed. One such SOP, released by the Airports Authority of India recently, suggests that flights are likely to resume at close to a third of their usual capacity, and airport terminals will open with only a few outlets for food and beverages.According to the SOP, seating arrangement shall be done in such a manner so as to maintain social distancing (1-1.5 m) among passengers using chairs at terminals. “Sufficient staff shall be deployed near washrooms, X-Ray machines, conveyor belts, etc, to guide passengers to maintain sufficient distance,” it said. Alternate check-in counters may also be introduced to avoid congestion.Strict social distancing norms are likely to also be introduced inside planes, though officials and experts are yet to determine how that will be possible. An official, who asked not to be named, said other ideas include spreading out flight timings to avoid crowding at terminals and asking people to arrive sooner than usual so that security and immigration processes can be completed while maintaining distancing.Civil aviation analysis agency CAPA said the current financial year will be hard on airlines. “Potential social distancing and inspection protocols when services resume will seriously impact the ability of airlines to even recover their variable costs. Some carriers may lose less money by remaining grounded,” it said. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has proposed reporting time for passengers be increased up to 120 minutes. A ‘business continuity plan’ drafted by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has also proposed reporting time for passengers to the airport should be increased up to 120 minutes. Restrictions will also be imposed for travelling in trains. The ministry of railways is preparing detailed guidelines for sale of tickets; social distancing and other safety measures to be observed at train stations, train platforms and within the trains for facilitating movement of stranded migrants for now.There will be strict norms for passengers including arriving hours before the journey, downloading the Aarogya Setu app to display a health status and mandatory thermal screening, according to officials. Passengers will have to wear masks and apply hand sanitizers before and after boarding. Inside the trains, strict social distancing will be ensured, and the ministry is also mulling the idea of leaving the middle berth vacant and deploying only non-AC coaches, added the officials quoted above. The Centre is also planning to make ticketing for metro trains contactless and not allow passengers to use tokens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-distancing-curbs-to-mark-flight-and-train-travel/story-GWr2v0HQXWdr3OErElUxoJ.html
04-05-2020||India||States to collect rail fares: Govt in guidelines||State authorities shall collect fares after distributing tickets among stranded migrants and students who are boarding special trains to return to their hometowns, and hand over the amount to the Indian Railways, the railways ministry said in fresh guidelines on Sunday.After allowing the running of the Shramik Special trains on Friday, the railways said it will charge sleeper class fares and an additional Rs 50 for one point-to-point journey, while it also added that states can coordinate and pay on passengers’ behalf.The move to charge fares for these trains ferrying migrants --- many of them have lost their jobs --- students and others stranded in different parts of the country due to the ongoing lockdown met with opposition.Rajasthan deputy chief minister and state Congress president Sachin Pilot said the central government should bear the expenses. “They have no earnings. In such a situation, they should not be charged fares…,” he said.Criticising the Centre, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said: “It is very unfair that the entire responsibility has been shifted to the state governments....In Parliament, the government said it bore the entire cost of repatriating Indians stuck abroad. In the same manner the migrants should have been sent back.”National Conference leader Omar Abdullah tweeted similar views. “If you are stuck abroad during this COVID crisis this government will fly you back for free but if you are a migrant worker stranded in another state be prepared to cough up the cost of travel (with social distancing cost added)...,” he said.According to the fresh guidelines, the railways shall print train tickets to specified destinations on the basis of the number of passengers indicated by an originating state, and give the tickets to the local government authority. “The local state government authority shall hand over the tickets to the passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and hand over the total amount to the railways,” the guidelines said.The railways also said these trains were being run only for those who have been identified and allowed to travel by the states sending and receiving them, and not for the general public. The railways reserves the right to discontinue the special train operations if safety protocols are flouted at any stage, the ministry said.“The originating state will inform the exact number of passengers travelling in a train, which should be 1200 (or at least 90%) considering the capacity…,” the guidelines said.Shramik Special trains are bound for a single destination without any stoppages. Usually, they have 24 coaches with each carrying a little over 50 in place of the total capacity of 72. These trains will run for distances of over 500 km.“We have informed that trains will not be stopping at any station in the middle, and states must make it clear to the passengers as there have been incidents where they thought they could get off…,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. The guidelines also said local authorities will give food packets and drinking water to passengers at the originating station. The railways will provide one meal on the train for a journey of over 12 hours.The railways ministry also asked states to encourage passengers to download the Aarogya Setu app for checking the health status of passengers.It will also be the responsibility of the governments sending people to bring such individuals to designated stations in sanitized buses, following social distancing norms. All passengers will have to mandatorily wear masks. Passengers will have to be screened by the sending states and only those found without symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will be allowed to travel.States are also scrambling to arrange payments for the railways in order to ensure the running of these trains to bring their residents back home. Jharkhand is one of the few that has made an advance payment to the railways for deploying 31 special trains, according to officials aware of the developments.Five Shramik Special trains were run on Friday and 10 on Saturday. According to officials, railways is unlikely to run trains originating from red zones such as Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, at least for now.“There are no trains planned for now, but we are running (trains) in nearby places…like in Maharashtra trains, are being run at Bhiwandi and Vasai…Trains will only run to these places (red zones) when the demand from the state government comes,” said the official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-to-collect-rail-fares-govt-in-guidelines/story-cluRhb7J58xqTZ0zqZizOK.html
04-05-2020||India||Send only stranded migrants: Centre tells states||As state governments scramble to book buses and trains to send migrant workers home, the Union home ministry on Sunday rebuked the state administrations and told them the transport hadn’t been meant for workers who intended to visit home, but for those in distress because they had been caught unawares by the lockdown.Home secretary Ajay Bhalla’s mild reprimand came after state governments rushed to the railways ministry to run special trains to send all migrant workers home. Bhalla underlined that the Centre had only made an exception for people who had been stranded because of the lockdown, enforced for three weeks from March 25 and twice extended since.“The facilitation envisaged in the aforesaid orders is meant for such distressed persons, but does not extend to those categories of persons, who are otherwise residing normally at places, other than the native places for purposes of work, etc., and who wish to visit their native places in normal course,” he wrote in a letter to state chief secretaries, a copy of which accessed by Hindustan Times.This is the first time that the home ministry has explicitly, in writing, stressed that the operative word in its order allowing the transport of migrant workers, tourists, students and others was “stranded”. On April 30, Hindustan Times reported the operative word fine print of the home ministry’s order:Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba had also spelt out in a video conference with state chief secretaries last week that the relaxation shouldn’t result in a free-for-all and the states should only allow people who had been stranded due to the lockdown to travel from one state to another.The Centre decided to send the clarification in writing on Sunday after an assessment that the states, under pressure from the public and opposition parties, were getting into a race to send, or bring home, as many migrant workers as possible.“It is clarified that the MHA orders are meant to facilitate movement of such stranded persons, who had moved from their native places/workplaces, just before the lockdown period, but could not return to their native places/workplaces on account of restrictions placed on movement of persons and vehicles as part of lockdown measures,” Bhalla wrote in his letter..Central government officials said the state governments should have, in the first instance, offered the ride home to 1.4 million people living in relief camps run by the states or non-profit organisations.“They are the people who have been really in distress and are stranded in every sense of the word,” a government official said. He explained that the states, which were practically encouraging migrant workers to return home, should account for the fact that the state’s economy would take longer to revive in the absence of the migrant workforce that powers most industries.This was one reason why the Centre had been reluctant to run special trains to transport the workers. It relented when the chorus from the states became too loud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/send-only-stranded-migrants-centre-tells-states/story-UtTQSjwogahL3fHTD2sr7M.html
04-05-2020||India||E-commerce likely to gain currency as retail sector gears up for changes||In some of the most sensitive Covid-19 outbreak areas – known as containment zones – the only method of purchasing essential supplies is through home deliveries, which reduces the risk of infections that can otherwise spread in settings like a crowded shop. While shops and direct-to-consumer businesses are slowly reopening in the other parts of the world, as well as in India, the crisis is likely to accelerate a trend that has gained strength in recent years: E-commerce.The changes in the retail sector can roughly be categorised into three phases – now, next, and beyond, according to the ‘Moving towards a resilient retail sector post Covid-19’ report by analysts at EY, who predict that old and rural consumers are likely to take to online purchases at a faster rate. “We are currently in the ‘now’ phase where most retailers are coping with a complete pause in business,” said Pinakiranjan Mishra, one of the authors of the report. “In the medium term, or the ‘next’ phase, where the government starts easing restrictions, retailers will need to focus on bouncing back from the current situation. In the long-term ‘beyond’ phase, they need to focus on transforming to succeed in a new business landscape. The challenges would be to cater to consumers via their preferred channels and to build business resiliency to operate smoothly during future crises,” he added.Co-author Farokh Balsara said the Covid-19 crisis could also be an opportunity. “The pandemic will reshape Indian retail, and the players ready to seize the opportunities of today would be leaders of the new retail industry that emerges post the crisis,” he said. The report said the pandemic should serve as a reminder to retailers to quickly build a flexible and agile business-and-operations model to take care of future disruptions. “This will mean a significant focus on converting to a digital enterprise. Thus, it is the time for retail players to get control of the current crisis and invest in the build-out of a more resilient organization,” said Mishra.The nature of business, too, will change because of compliance requirements to maintain social distancing and higher degree of hygiene.Global e-commerce giants such as Flipkart said they already have a stringent system in place. “At the Flipkart Group, the safety of our supply chain and delivery executives and the customers with whom they interact is of utmost priority,” said a company spokesperson.“For our supply chain and logistics network, we have organised more than 3,000 awareness sessions covering over 100,000 employees across all our facilities on how our employees and partners can minimise their exposure by following simple precautionary measures,” she said. Permanent features of retail businesses in India will include, temperature screening, fumigation, antibacterial soaps and hand sanitizers. Even for home deliveries, customers will be encouraged to use digital modes of payment and fully contactless deliveries will be encouraged.A government official working in an economic ministry said India’s policy focus would be more towards digital economy, whether it is online payment modes or online transactions. “The government is working with the industry to launch an indigenous e-commerce platform soon, which will link most of the 70 million ‘kirana’ stores with consumers,” this person said.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on April 24 announced that it would launch a national e-commerce marketplace soon with support of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). “Beside DPIIT and CAIT, the other promoters are Startup India, Invest India, All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation and Avana Capital,” the association of Indian retailers said in a statement. CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said, “The e-commerce marketplace will be of the traders, by the traders and for the traders and consumers of the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/e-commerce-likely-to-gain-currency-as-retail-sector-gears-up-for-changes/story-ahdCCYlzR8FwXMimNlAEZM.html
04-05-2020||India||Forces express gratitude to India’s Covid warriors||From fighter jets performing fly-pasts over Delhi’s Rajpath and Mumbai’s Marine Drive to helicopters showering petals over hospitals dedicated to treating Covid-19 patients and transport aircraft flying in formation over multiple cities; the armed forces on Sunday carried out exercises across the country in a concerted gesture of gratitude to people at the frontline of the battle against the virus.Army bands performed outside Covid-19 hospitals and sailors on-board India’s largest warship, INS Vikramaditya, formed a human chain on the aircraft carrier’s flight deck to pay tribute to the corona warriors. Several warships were also illuminated at anchorage at Mumbai, Porbandar, Karwar, Vizag, Chennai, Kochi and Port Blair.Senior officials said all the activities planned for the day, as announced by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, were carried out as scheduled.Acknowledging the role of the armed forces in honouring Covid-19 warriors, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, “Saluting those who are at the forefront, bravely fighting Covid-19. Great gesture by our armed forces.”Fighter jets and transport planes staged fly-pasts across the length and breadth of the country, from Srinagar to Thiruvananthapuram and Dibrugarh to Kutch.Defence minister Rajnath Singh tweeted: “I thank the Armed Forces for their special initiatives like fly pasts, showering flower petals and several other performances to express gratitude towards medical professionals, police and other frontline warriors. The entire nation stands united in these challenging times.”The fighter jets that featured in the fly-past over Delhi-NCR flew at a height of 500 to 1,000 metres and were visible to the residents of Delhi from their rooftops.The C-130J special operations aircraft also flew over Delhi-NCR in formation.Apart from Delhi-NCR, the IAF’s fighter jets carried out fly-pasts over Mumbai, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Patna and Lucknow. Also, transport aircraft flew over 10 cities including Delhi, Srinagar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Mumbai and Hyderabad.Air force helicopters showered petals on hospitals across 23 locations including Delhi, Leh, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Mumbai, Jaipur, Dispur, Itanagar, Trivandrum and Chennai. Navy and coastguard helicopters also showered petals over hospitals in Mumbai, Goa, Chennai and Port Blair.The air force also showered petals over the National Police Memorial in Delhi and wreaths were laid at the memorial on behalf of the three service chiefs to recognize the contribution of policemen who are at the forefront of the Covid-19 fight.Coastguard ships were also lit up across multiple locations on the country’s eastern and western sea boards as a mark of respect towards corona warriors.In Rajasthan, the Sapta Shakti Command organised multiple events to felicitate representatives of the Armed Forces. Defence spokesperson Col Sombit Ghosh said commemorative events with participation of military bands were organised at popular locations in towns to convey appreciation. “Helicopters of the Indian Air Force also joined in a fly-past showering petals over SMS Hospital Jaipur as a mark of gratitude. Fighter Jets Sukhoi-30 passed over Rajasthan Assembly and transport aircraft C-130 passed over Jalmahal Palace, Jaipur to express gratitude and solidarity,” Col Ghosh said.In Uttarakhand, Rishikesh, an Army chopper flew over the AIIMS building and showered flower petals in the morning. A team of the Army officials also visited the hospital and offered gifts to the staff as a thanking gesture. Dr Ravi Kant, director, AIIMS Rishikesh, said, “We all from AIIMS Rishikesh are really grateful to the defence forces for their gesture towards us. First, they flew past over our hospital and showered flower petals and later a team of Army officials visited us in the afternoon with gifts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-express-gratitude-to-india-s-covid-warriors/story-YxE211Mn0ySBzyqMKaPYAM.html
04-05-2020||India||Experts’ inputs to PM nod: What shapes govt guidelines||The government’s broad response to the coronavirus pandemic — symbolised in bureaucratic orders, guidelines, and clarifications with wide ranging impact — is shaped by a complex decision making process, which involves key union ministries and sectoral experts, inputs from state governments, intensive analysis of data, an assessment of daily reports, and finally a nod from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, three officials familiar with the process said.Ever since the national lockdown was announced on March 24, guidelines by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) have regulated lives of citizens, defined the scope of economic activities to be allowed, enabled — or prohibited —transport of persons and vehicles. In its latest order on Friday, while extending the lockdown for two weeks, the MHA order stipulated a set of relaxations in varying degrees in red, orange and green zones.But behind the formulation of these guidelines is an elaborate process. Officials involved in the process said that as a phase of lockdown draws to an end, or a crisis — such as the one regarding stranded migrant workers — erupts, MHA, the health ministry and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) officials swing into action.There is also a parallel process that takes place, with cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba convening a meeting with state governments; consultations and inputs here too shape guidelines. “The first step of making guidelines usually starts with a meeting between the cabinet secretary and the states where many key secretaries are also present,” said an official involved in the process. The government also listens to the perspectives of other stakeholders, particularly those involved in the economy and carefully weighs the trade-offs. The latest guideline on extending the federal lockdown till May 17 came after a series of formal and informal meetings last week. In one of the video conferences, ICMR made presentations with charts and projections on the rate of spread of the disease, how the virus is likely to progress, the situation in Covid hotspots and how green and orange zones are faring.The union health ministry then provided its inputs from the public health perspective. Based on inputs from cabinet secretariat and other sources, the union home ministry prepared a draft guideline for further discussion. Only after the inter-ministerial consultations are over, the issue is taken up by the National Disaster Management Authority and the Prime Minister’s Office.A senior official said that every aspect of the guideline is discussed threadbare at different levels. “In the latest circular, the government carefully used the phrase ‘lockdown measures to be continued to be implemented in all parts of the country’. Even as the guideline issued on May 1 provided major concessions, the NDMA was careful not to convey any impression to the public that it is business as usual,” said one official.Another official added that the government is extremely cautious after thousands of people came out on the streets to celebrate on March 22 even as the PM appealed to the nation to voluntarily stay indoors from 7am till 9pm. This, he underlined, had made the government conscious that every little detail must be spelt out to prevent any confusion. Between the NDMA, chaired by the PM, and the home ministry, there are at times some discussions on finer aspects of the guideline. And finally, only after the PM gives his approval, the guidelines are issued.A senior official said that the Prime Minister, who is spearheading the country’s battle against Corona, depends a lot of sectoral experts and inputs from the states before taking a final call on issues related to the Covid||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-inputs-to-pm-nod-what-shapes-govt-guidelines/story-CXCqViOrCPnWhfkPXStUwK.html
04-05-2020||India||With some relaxations, states draw up plan for lockdown 3.0||India prepared on Sunday for the third phase of the ongoing lockdown with states and Union Territories drafting their own rules, mostly in line with federal guidelines that have given area-specific relaxations in a graded approach to bring back normalcy in the backdrop of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.There were some that stood out. Among them was Jharkhand, which announced that there will be no relaxations spelt out by the central government for the three zones in the country --- red, orange and green --- for two weeks beginning Monday.“Migrant workers, students and others are returning home from other states. As a precautionary measure, lockdown would continue in Jharkhand for next two weeks. The new directions of the Centre regarding relaxations would not be implemented in for now,” chief minister Hemant Soren said in a Twitter post.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIn the eastern state, capital Ranchi is in red zone (areas with most Covid-19 cases); 11 districts are in orange zone (places with fewer cases) while the rest of the 12 are in green zone (places with no cases).The northeastern state of Mizoram promulgated an ordinance making the punishment for violations of lockdown measures more stringent, a day after Rajasthan passed a similar ordinance.The Assam government announced a complete ban on the movement of non-essential travel between 6pm and 6am for the next two weeks, which covers the extended lockdown period. The central guideline has banned such travels from 7 pm and 7 am.“Directives have been issued to police to take stringent action against curfew violators. Hence, we request everyone to ensure that the restrictions are complied with,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. “All relaxations are only for districts in green zones...” Of Assam’s 33 districts, 30 are green and three orange zones. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, two big states, toed the Centre’s line.The Maharashtra government allowed the functioning of standalone liquor shops across the state, barring containment zones (which are areas inside red/orange zones with stricter perimeter control).According to a government notification, standalone shops selling non-essential items, too, will be allowed in red zones, which include Mumbai and Pune. Construction activities in all red zone districts will be allowed, provided workers are available on site.In UP, standalone liquor shops can operate from 10 am to 7 pm with social distancing in red zones. The state also allowed all standalone shops and shops in residential complexes.In line with the central directive, the state allowed private four-wheelers with a maximum of two persons besides the driver for all activities permitted by the government in red zones. Private offices can operate with up to 33% of staff strength in such areas.Lucknow, the capital of India’s most populous state, Agra and Gautam Budh Nagar (which houses Noida), among other districts in UP, are red zones.Chhattisgarh, too, allowed liquor shops and was planning to start its home delivery, according to a minister. Liquor shops will be open from 8am to 7pm. “To maintain social distancing, we have decided to provide home delivery to some big colonies and settlements,” Chhattisgarh excise minister Kawasi Lakhma said. “How liquor will be delivered online will be announced on Monday. We are still working on it.” Karnataka, too, permitted the sale of liquor in standalone stores. So did Madhya Pradesh. But a minister in Uttarakhand said liquor shops may not be open in red zones. And Kerala, where per capita consumption is second highest after Punjab, was yet to resume selling liquor.Karnataka said Bengaluru urban and its four neighbouring districts (Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara, Chikkaballapur and Kolar) would be treated as a single unit for inter-district movement of individuals and vehicles between 7am to 7pm for permitted activities with the production of letter from the company they are working in and the official identity card. Hence, no other inter-district passes will be required to move across these districts, the order said.The Goa government agreed to restart public transport, including buses, taxis and auto rickshaws but only with 50% of seating capacity, while restricting their timing from 7am-7pm.Chief minister Pramod Sawant announced said several services and economic activities will resume in line with the central guidelines since Goa is a green zone. He, however, stressed that all non-essential shops should be closed by 6pm so that people can be home by 7pm.“Only essential workers such as medical workers and other essential services like shops selling milk will be allowed to be open after 7pm,” Sawant said.Restaurants, street eateries, beach shacks and drinking in public places will remain prohibited as these activities banned across the nation.In Rajasthan, the government prohibited the sale of pan and tobacco products, though the central guidelines have allowed the opening of shops selling tobacco products with strict social-distancing norms.The Centre first imposed a 21-day lockdown on March 25, and then extended it for 19 days till May 3. On Friday, the government announced another two-week extension, but this time with zone-specific curbs and relaxations though there are some activities banned throught the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-some-relaxations-states-draw-up-plan-for-lockdown-3-0/story-S8XApMshduTLVv8AwrfYuJ.html
04-05-2020||India||Mumbai Police files FIR against Arnab Goswami, accuses him of spreading hatred||The Mumbai police registered an FIR against Arnab Goswami, editor and owner of Republic TV channel on Saturday following a complaint that he tried to create hatred against Muslims last month.The case was registered at Pydhonie police station and investigation has been initiated, police said.Irfan Abubakar Shaikh, secretary of Raza Educational Welfare Society and a resident of Null Bazar in South Mumbai in his complaint to the police alleged that both the channel and Goswami were trying to create hatred against the Muslim community and targeted a mosque in Bandra that had no link to the protest by migrants on April 14.  Also Watch: Arnab Goswami, wife attacked in Mumbai; 2 arrestedShaikh said that on April 29, the Hindi channel Republic Bharat had used footage of the Bandra protest by migrants who had gathered near Bandra railway station. Arnab Goswami was anchoring the show.“There was no link or issue related to the mosque near the Bandra station. The only issue was that the migrants had gathered in the open space near the mosque. But Arnab purposely highlighted the mosque to create communal disturbance in the city,” said Shaikh in his compliant to the police. Shaikh highlighted alleged comments by Goswami like ‘Ab se thodi der pehle Mumbai ke Bandra me Jama Masjid Hai.’ Aur Is Jama Masjid Ke Pass Achanak Hazaro logo Ki Bheed Jama Hogae’. (Thousands of people gathered outside Jama Masjid in Bandra) ‘Mumbai ke Bandra me masjid Ke pass kisne bheed jutae. (Who gathered the crowd outside the mosque in Bandra?) ‘Lockdown me har Bheed Masjid ke pass kyu Juti Hai? (Why is it that crowds gather near every mosque during lockdown), which he claimed fuelled hatred against Muslims.“There were many such questions and debate on the channel intended to blame the Muslim community for the spreading of Covid-19 disease. Goswami had made many such hate filled comments against the community, targeting it,” the complainant said.Shaikh said Goswami linked the Bandra Mosque to the migrants’ protest without any reason and gave a communal colour to the protest which had no link or involvement if any particular community.The Pydhonie police registered a case under various sections of the Indian penal code.“We have registered a case against Arnab Goswami and the owner of Republic TV for the hatred. Further investigation is going on. As part of evidence after taking the statement we have collected the footage of the shows with the clips in a pen drive as evidence,” said a police officer from Pydhonie police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-file-fir-against-arnab-goswami-accuses-him-of-spreading-hatred/story-8tfFHRTG7xImSCrgpS1PWI.html
04-05-2020||India||The power of khadi: Hand-woven masks help protect against Covid-19, boost courage to fight||Face masks have become ubiquitous following the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. Touted as the first measure to protect against the virus, masks have become a common feature for all leaving their homes. As a result, there is a shortage and unavailability of masks.Arushi Nishank, an environmentalist and Indian classical dancer, is on a quest to disseminate Mahatma Gandhi’s ideology of khadi through her reusable khadi masks and delivering them to our Army personnel.She says, “We all are living in our homes and are fighting this global epidemic. While we are following the lock down, our brave soldiers on the border on one hand are fighting enemies and on the other they are tackling with this deadly virus. Through Sparsh Ganga foundation, we decided to send khadi masks to our brothers on borders.”Khadi fabric, also known as khaddar, is a hand woven natural fibre made with cotton. Synonymous with Mahatma Gandhi and the Swadeshi movement, this fabric has a rugged texture and feels comfortable when worn during summers. For Arushi, more than a cloth, Khadi is an ideology and forms the identity of India as a nation. She says, “We chose Khadi for our masks because it is more sustainable, as a cotton mask requires 55 litres of water and a khaki mask just soaks up 3 litres of water.”The foundation is also generating employment opportunities and is tying up with small and medium scale industries for large production of masks. She adds, “We have handed over around ten thousand masks to the authorities at Delhi, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra, which will be given to the doctors and soldiers who are constantly protecting us.”In another bid for khadi, UP government has ordered 55 crore khadi face masks for the state’s rural population. The UP government’s initiative does not have a profit component and hence the khadi masks would be available at a cheaper rate in comparison to market price. 7 lakh- meter khadi has been provided to the rural development department. The face masks will be prepared through small self help groups (SHGs) in rural areas, thus generating employment.Khadi, a hand-spun hand-woven fabric made of natural fibres has always stood the test of time. Pandemics, economic upheavals, historical events and climate change have destroyed many industries. But khadi has never altered its course of life in terms of sustainability and in terms of resilience to pandemics and health and hygiene.Designer Manish Tripathi has also been distributing khadi face masks to people in Delhi. He says, “I chose khadi for face masks as it is an ethical fabric- requires less water, is hand woven and hand spun.”He further adds, “With the government’s mandate to wear masks, it gave me an impetus to make these masks and distribute among people. I felt a person who cannot afford a square meal a day, how will he acquire a mask.”Manish also feels that surgical and N95 masks create unnecessary fear and anxiety for onlookers. He says, “Though it is a mandate but surgical masks create a sense of foreboding and gloom. The khadi masks are colourful and compliment the person, thus reducing the levels of anxiety.” Tripathi is distributing around 150 masks daily to poor people as well as Covid-19 volunteers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-power-of-khadi-hand-woven-masks-help-protect-against-covid-19-boost-courage-to-fight/story-wfc0JZleSeGfA4DPc4oQQJ.html

In the face of this pandemic, Indians across class, caste, region and religion have been supporting each other. With a huge chunk of population below poverty line, the poor have been hit the hardest. Many NGOs and self-help groups have come forward in supplying meals to the needy people.Sattu, the desi nutrition powerhouse is being served by NGOs to hundreds of needy people in Meerut and Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh. Sumithra Prasad, founder, Dorai foundation, that is distributing sattu in these cities, says, “Along with dry ration, we started giving bananas and melons to keep people energised.” She adds, “Then we added shakkar paras prepared by single mothers who are unemployed at this moment. Soon, we realised that sattu, too, can be a great addition.”A staple diet of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, sattu is now a global superfood. Prasad says, “We prepare sattu in the traditional way, which involves using an iron vessel in which horse gram is roasted and mixed with jaggery. Then this dry mixture is sieved and grounded into a fine flour. Then we distribute to people residing in the interiors of Uttar Pradesh with no means of livelihood at this moment. ”The power of social solidarity in a time of mandated physical distancing is immense. “We Indians are socially responsible citizens. All the volunteers have tirelessly worked for the production and distribution of sattu,” she says. Prem Shankar Yadav, speech therapist and a volunteer, says, “Sattu is rich in iron, manganese, and magnesium, and low on sodium. It provides instant energy and also works as a cooling agent in summer.” He adds, “Sattu can be had anywhere, anytime. For migrants, this is the most wholesome dish which is easy to prepare and easy on the stomach.”Units have been set up in Mirzapur and Meerut, where a differently-abled volunteer, Imran Maliik helps with the production. He says, “This is the most paushtik (healthy) drink one can get. Specially during corona, it is imperative to boost immunity and this is what this drink aids.” “Saatu flushes out toxins and it is considered to be a full meal. It can be had as a shake with a bit of salt, raw onion, cumin, green chili and lemon. It’s a great idea to serve sattu to keep people fit,!”, says chef Nishant Choubey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sattu-the-saviour-in-uttar-pradesh-ngos-are-beating-hunger-with-the-desi-nutrition-powerhouse/story-W96Z6uKWMH232Lo4bZhkEL.html
04-05-2020||India||In times of Covid-19, a gift of hygiene for migrant labourers||Ever since stringent lockdown was enforced to contain the spread of COVID-19 across the world, roads, borders and city squares fell quiet. Many migrant labourers who weren’t able to make it back to their villages are now living in shelter homes provided by the government.While the government has made arrangements for their ration and daily needs, they are short of clothes and personal hygiene necessities. “At the shelters in Soniya Vihar, where we are deployed, we noticed that many labourers were wearing the same clothes for days, as they had no choice. So we decided to put together some lightly used and freshly washed clothes for them,”says 20-year-old NCC cadet Aartika Bhayana.Bhayana, with three more team members distributed clothes in all sizes to these migrant workers residing at shelter home. “We collected clothes from residents, our relatives and family members. We washed them, ironed them and gave it to more than 112 labourers. They were not expecting this and it brought an instant smile on their faces. They clapped for the entire team that this made this possible,” says Bhayana, who was supported by Ridhima Khanna, Preeti Singh and Kanchan Singh. The NCC cadets were assigned the task to maintain social distancing at the shelters, provide labourers with ration and other necessities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-times-of-covid-19-a-gift-of-hygiene-for-migrant-labourers/story-4Dbp3WtfsYukGlp74BxD9K.html

Inspector Neha Chauhan, says, “We saw a Facebook post by his children tagging us and asking if we could do something for his birthday. So with the help constables Neha, Parvin, Aarti and driver Mahavir, we bought a cake and went to celebrate his birthday.”As soon as these police personnel spotted the old gentleman in his house, Puri started to retreat back in his house, fearing that they would reprimand him on not following the guidelines of the lockdown. He tells us on phone, the video not only went viral but went into overdrive. “Though politically incorrect, but it spread like coronavirus,” says Puri.As the global pandemic has brought a host of new experiences, including working from home, home-schooling and online socialising, it has also, unsurprisingly, increased the loneliness of all people. Puri says, “Like everyone else, even I hadn’t stepped out of my house at all due to the lockdown. But seeing so many people after a month with a cake for my birthday made me emotional and tears of happiness rolled out of my eyes.” He jokingly adds, “I have just turned 69 years young and anyone is bound to become emotional at such a celebration.”For loneliness, he says all of us have to bear it as we have no other choice. He says, “It’s not just senior citizens, but everyone is battling the demon of isolation. We all  are social beings and thrive on interactions and meeting new people.” Senior citizen gets birthday surprise from Haryana Police, video goes viral via @htTweets https://t.co/v7AeGebfpLPuri, owner of Atma Ram and Sons publishing house, says, “All my family including my granddad has been in publishing. At this time, I am missing my daily routine. More than anything, I miss travelling 11km to my store at Punjab University. Never thought I would say this but I miss the traffic and of course seeing new faces and meeting old acquaintances.”He has two sons, one settled in Australia and the other in Delhi who had requested Panchkula Police to surprise his father. He says, “I thank ACP Nupur Bisht, who planned the surprise.” Question him on whether he would like to celebrate his birthday like this every year, with the cops, and he laughs and says, “Are you kidding me?”As an afterthought he says, “Well, of course! I have celebrated my birthday in different continents but this was very different and I will cherish it for many years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/celebrations-can-t-be-locked-down-cops-planned-a-lovely-surprise-for-this-birthday-boy/story-62DPDzQH992MCWX8yEeAEJ.html

With COVID-19 dominating the news cycle, words like quarantine and self-isolation are being used with an uneasy casualness and lethargy is setting in. But for some people, the lockdown can’t act as a detterent when it comes to their fitness routine. A keen runner, 73-year-old Rajinder Singh was initially at a loss as to how he was going to keep fit when Britain went under a lockdown. Labelled as ‘the skipping Sikh’, he says, “Health is wealth. And my good health is a result of god’s blessings. I do five minute skipping honestly everyday.” He shared a video of himself skipping rope in the backyard of his home and it went viral. Singh’s love of skipping was sparked by his father many years ago and he now wants to be a role model to others in his community. Born in Devidaspura, a village in Punjab, he says, “I moved to London in 1972 from Punjab and my love for running was instilled in me by my father, along with other qualities like helping people in need even if it meant running across villages.”For his part, Rajinder, has always loved exercising and says, “ Since I was young, I used to participate in all sports at my village. My father encouraged me to run and play all forms of sports to maintain my health.” Skipping brings a lot of joy to Singh and he wishes to share this happiness with others. He says, “It just requires stamina and you have to just grab a rope.”The pandemic hasn’t prevented Singh to stay away from his exercise schedule for even one day. “With the available resources, I am sticking to my fitness regime. I have been skipping and running around my house. I have been spending time with my family and also working in my kitchen garden.”He wants to inspire people of his age to stay fit and he’s urged others to post similar videos. “ As I started posting videos online, people blessed me from all over the world and encouraged me to post more videos. I motivate others to do the same.”Keeping in mind all the guidelines laid by the government, the 73-year old says, “ I am a law abiding citizen and I am happy to have been following all rules laid by the government.” A god-believer, he believes in respecting people of all races, religions and ethnicities. Singh says, “We are all together in this fight, hating people at this time won’t benefit anyone at this point.”He further adds, “We need to work compassionately to get the world rid of this virus. The pandemic has made us realise that we are all one, one of the foremost Indian values taught to kids back in the country.”With the help of his daughter, Min Kaur, he has also set up a fundraising initiative that hopes to raise money for the British National Health Service (NHS). “It is brilliant, no one can compare with the NHS. I am very thankful to them as they are working round-the clock to save lives and we must try our best to help them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hating-people-won-t-benefit-anyone-at-this-point-skipping-sikh-rajinder-singh/story-5fdBAXDXMOuZ6RNW7M4k8I.html

An artist in Chennai came up with the idea of corona shaped helmets a few weeks ago. Police officers in Chennai wore the helmets to deter people from stepping out of their homes.Now, he has modified an autorickshaw to look like coronavirus with spikes in its body to spread awareness about the infection. B. Gowtham, the creative artist, says, “When I started to work on the corona helmet and then this auto, the idea was to make the city administrations’s and police’s work easier with attention grabbing art.” He adds, “The auto is the identity of the city so it was my obvious choice as it would send out the message loud and clear.” The Corona auto is being used to spread awareness among the people of Chennai to wear a mask while being out of their houses. The Chennai based artist says, “Even if my initiative can save one life from the deadly virus. I would be very happy.”The auto is made of 165 discarded plastic bottles. It took six days with the help of six people to make this quirky piece of art. “While making it, we had to be very careful as it had to look aesthetically beautiful as well as technically sound,” says Gowtham.To make work easy for the administration, the auto is fitted with an audio system to transmit awareness messages about wearing the mask. The 27-year-old artist says, “Wearing masks is a necessary precaution and if people of Chennai don’t abide by the rules, they will be heavily fined. This auto is here to make people aware of the crisis we are facing and how a simple measure such as wearing masks will go a long way in helping save lives.”The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of our dysfunctional relationship with nature. Gowtham adds, “In many ways, corona virus has made us aware that as a human race, we are so tiny and we have always been ruthless to our planet and never really considered it as our home.”Gowtham feels that if we follow all rules of the nature, do not spit or litter and add less carbon footprint, we will be able to create peace and harmony and co-exist beautifully with nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quirky-ideas-make-an-impact-after-corona-helmets-artist-comes-up-with-corona-auto/story-eS8TMaDk867JphAqEfoZOK.html

With resources less for even humans, it is a very critical time for these stray dogs as they are exposed to severe shortage of food.In a unique endeavour, Indore Municipal Corporation has set up a roti bank for stray dogs that are starving. The motivating force behind it, Vandana Jain, who runs a campaign, Dogitization in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, says, “The municipal corporation has always helped us. With their help, we created a roti bank, where we make 5,000 rotis and then we distribute it through NGOs.”Jain started Dogitization to create awareness amongst citizens of Indore to be kind and compassionate towards the street dogs. She also encouraged everyone to win the trust of the dogs and eventually send off each dog of the city to dog sterilization clinics.Vandana and her group lovingly address each stray dog as ‘laddoo’. She says, “It’s sad that humans divided themselves in upper and lower castes, and they also created levels in animals. Godmen appeal to us to worship cows, give them roti and chaara. But no one talks that about dogs. I feel till the time ‘kutta’ word is used, people will never respect this life.”So, in order to make people fall in love with the sweetest and most faithful living creature on earth, she promotes them as ‘laddoo’ instead of kutta (dog). “Everyone should try it. Speak to a dog on the street and call him laddoo and offer him food and you will see how the dog starts wagging its tail, it will make an instant bond with you,” she says.In these trying times, Jain is thankful for the support she is getting from the administration. She says, “I convinced the additional SP, Maneesha Pathak Soni to allow one toast manufacturer to also make toasts for these street dogs and she granted us the permission.”Dogitization could manage to order 1,200 kg toasts in 16 hours for hungry dogs. She says, “That goes on to show how kind this city is. Without the city’s support, we could not have done this”. We wish all the happy laddoos of Indore a healthy, happy life!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-roti-bank-for-laddoos-indore-s-unique-endeavour-for-street-dogs/story-theQl80ytmZuG41ObKGgoK.html
