The alleged killer was identified as Sanjay Kumar Yadav (24) from Bihar.On Friday, the police recovered nine bodies from a well at Gorrekunta village on the outskirts of Warangal. The dead were identified as Mohammed Maqsood (55), his wife Nisha (48), sons Shahabad Alam (21) and Sohail Alam (18), daughter Bushra (20) and her three-year-old son Shoaib. The family belonged to West Bengal, The other three victims were identified as Sriram (21) and Shyam (22), both from Bihar, and Shakil (30) from Tripura. All the adults were working in a burlap bag manufacturing unit in Geesugonda block of Warangal and had been staying in the same company premises since the enforcement of the coronavirus disease lockdown on March 25.The police initially thought they had committed mass suicide owing to financial constraints or some other family reasons before tracing the crime to Yadav.According to the police commissioner, Yadav had a relationship with Rafiqa (37), a divorcee sister-in-law of Maqsood. Rafiqa, along with her three children, started living with Yadav separately. But she later realised that Yadav also was trapping her teenaged elder daughter. in a relationship, and threatened to expose him, Ravinder said.Yadav promised to marry Rafiqa and left for West Bengal along with her on a train on March 6. During their journey, he gave her buttermilk laced with sedatives and after she went to sleep, strangulated her and threw her body out of the train. He quietly returned to Warangal.When Maqsood grew suspicious and started questioning Yadav, threatening to complain to the police, Yadav decided to kill him and his family. He bought sleeping pills from a medical shop and on May 20, attended a birthday party hosted by Maqsood for his son where he mixed the pills in the food. The family members, the two Bihar men and the lone Tripura man ate the food and slipped into a deep sleep.“After ensuring that all of them were unconscious, Yadav dragged all the nine to the well one after the other and threw them into it between 12.30 am and 5 am on Thursday,” Ravinder said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-crack-death-of-9-migrants-in-warangal/story-Qhz6cLt3xqXzJ7CtZaC23M.html
25-05-2020||India||For two states, unfamiliar farm threat triggers untested response||Lucknow/Bhopal: For agriculture departments of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, dealing with swarms of locust is something new. Therefore, in addition to spraying pesticides, the local administrations have adopted unconventional -- adnd potentially unproven -- methods such as sounding sirens, playing loud music and using drones to scare the insects.Agriculture department officials of the two states said that they have no records to show when the last locust attack took place in their states. “We have no record of the last major locust attack,” said sugarcane commissioner, Sanjay R Bhoosreddy, who is coordinating anti-locust activities in Uttar Pradesh. Prayagraj district agriculture officer Ashwani Kumar Singh, said: “We have informed farmers that they can scare away locusts by beating tin drum, plates etc. Besides, they are also being advised to spray pesticides on their crops to protect them from locusts.” Singh said that the police have been asked to blow sirens from their vehicles . “All village pradhans and farmers of Prayagraj have been alerted about the locust attacks and have been asked to inform district authorities if they spot a swarm through gram panchayat adhikaris and agriculture technical assistants who remain in touch with them locally so that appropriate steps can be taken,” he said. The Agra district administration has deployed 204 tractors equipped with chemical sprays to keep the pests at bay. The Jhansi district administration has directed the fire brigades to remain on standby with chemicals and also to blow sirens to ward off the insects.In Uttar Pradesh, locusts have damaged crops in Jhansi, Lalitpur and Hamirpur districts and 15 more districts such as Agra, Aligarh, Mathura, Firozabad and Etawah are under threat. Bhoosreddy said all necessary protective measures were being be taken to protect sugarcane crop. “If locusts are spotted in sugarcane crop, the department has recommended immediate spraying of insecticides such as chlorpyrifos 20 percent EC, chlorpyrifos 50 percent EC, Bundiomethrin, Fipronil, and Lambda,” he said.In Madhya Pradesh, principal secretary, agriculture Ajeet Kesari, said, “Our teams continue to track the swarms wherever they are going and spray chemical over them. However, their groups are smaller now -- say one or two kilometres in radius -- unlike in the beginning when they were spread in the radius of 5 to 6 kilometres.”Farmers in Hoshangabad, Raisen, Sehore, Sagar, Chhatapur, Harda and several other districts too beat drums, tin cans, burst fire crackers and even arranged bone fires . “All possible ways are being adopted to keep locust away from crops. We have deployed police vehicles that blow sirens to shoo away the insects,” said AK Nema, deputy director, agriculture, Sagar division. He added that farmers have been given pesticides to spray on crops to minimize the damage. Madhya Pradesh agriculture minister, Kamal Patel, said, “A survey will be carried out in the state to assess the damage caused by swarms of locusts and compensation will be given to the farmers affected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-two-states-unfamiliar-farm-threat-triggers-untested-response/story-h9lfbGsRfoyOF3HZSpPcCO.html

25-05-2020||India||Online meetings for house panels unlikely||The plan to hold online meetings of Parliamentary panels in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown seems to have been put in cold storage. Preparations have started for the usual, in-camera meetings at the Parliament complex. “So far, nine rooms in the Parliament House and annexe are identified for holding regular meetings of the 24 department-related standing committees and another six rooms are being prepared for other committees of both the Houses,” said a senior official aware of the matter, requesting anonymity. Rajya Sabha chairman M.Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla factored in the resumption of flights and train services between Delhi and state capitals to draw up the plan for holding regular meetings of House panels, the official said. The concept of online meetings of Parliamentary panels was proposed when flights and train services were stopped as part of the Covid-19 lockdown imposed in March.Both Naidu and Birla started discussions with senior officials to explore the possibility of holding online meetings—something that has never happened since the panels came into existence in 1993. Now they are focused on preparations for regular meetings. Before Lockdown 4.0 ends on May 31, Naidu held an hour-long meeting with Birla on May 23. The secretaries general of both the Houses and other senior officials were also present at the meeting. “Both the Presiding Officers have taken note of the resumption of air and train services in the country this month,” said the senior official cited above. A second senior official said the concept didn’t have overwhelming support. The chairmen of four panels (all from the Congress)-- information technology panel chief Shahi Tharoor, Pubic Accounts Committee chairman Adhir Chowdhury, home affairs panel head Anand Sharma and environment panel chairman Jairam Ramesh -- had favoured online meetings. The officials also pointed out that only the main committee room in the annexe has enough space to maintain social distancing. Naidu and Birla said extra seats with mike facilities must be provided in the other rooms too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-meetings-for-house-panels-unlikely/story-U1g6HtP41f8cjPM3NFxULM.html
25-05-2020||India||Proposal to auction Tirumala temple property sparks row||Hyderabad A recent proposal of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, which manages India’s richest temple of Tirumala in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, to auction as many as 50 immovable properties of the temple located in different states has triggered protests from opposition parties and Hindu groups.On Monday, the TTD clarified that no final decision had been taken yet in this regard. “It was just a proposal which would be discussed at the next trust board meeting. after taking into consideration the suggestions from all quarters,” TTD trust board chairman YV Subba Reddy told reporters in Tirupati.He said the decision to auction 50 “unviable” properties was taken by the erstwhile trust board during the Telugu Desam Party regime in January 2016, based on a recommendation made by a sub-committee appointed for the purpose.“At the TTD trust board meeting held in February this year, it was decided to examine the earlier resolution and suggest a plan of auction for the auctioning of the properties,” he clarified.Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has proposed to auction 50 immovable petty properties located at different places in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rishikesh in Uttarakhand.On April 30, the TTD listed out as many as 23 properties situated in various parts of Tamil Nadu including Vellore, Kacheepuram and Thiruvalluvar districts, for auctioning, with the total upset price (base price) of these properties being Rs 2 crore.The properties proposed for auction include houses, house sites, vacant lands and agriculture land. The TTD chairman said properties donated by devotees to the hill shrine several decades ago were non-maintainable and non- revenue generating for the TTD. There are another 26 properties in Andhra Pradesh and one piece of land in Rishikesh.The decision triggered criticism from political parties as well as religious groups and individuals.Bharatiya Janata Party Andhra Pradesh uniut president Kanna Lakshminarayana demanded the temple withdraw the proposal as it would hurt the sentiments of Hindus.Jana Sena party president Pawan Kalyan lashed out at the temple trust board for the decision that hurts the sentiments of devotees.Temples protection movement convenor CS Rangarajan appealed to the government to form a Dharmika Parishad to govern the assets of temples. He expressed the fears that the TTD’s decision would set a precedent for all the temples for selling away the properties donated by devotees.Viswa Hindu Parishad threatened the YS Jagan government with launching Kar Seva, if the decision to sell God’s properties is not withdrawn.The TTD chairman, however, said as per the rules, the TTD Board was competent to sale, exchange and mortgage the immovable properties, if found beneficial to TTD.He said that the practice of selling immovable, non-maintainable and not useful properties had been in vogue since 1974. Between 1974-2014, about 129 such immovable properties which were not useful to TTD activities were disposed of in public auction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proposal-to-auction-tirumala-temple-property-sparks-row/story-AGFHcXVwmiSGMcDr6GUz4H.html

The state witnessed 60 fatalities, pushing up the toll to 1,695. With 38 of these recorded in Mumbai, the city crossed the 1,000 deaths-mark. While Mumbai’s Covid-19 toll rose to 1,026, the number of cases in Mumbai increased by 1,430 to 31,972.In other parts of the state, Pune recorded 244 fresh cases, while Thane 149 new cases on Monday, taking their virus count up to 5,319 and 2,739 respectively.Maharashtra, which is the worst-hit state in the country, has witnessed a surge in Covid-19 cases, with more than 20,000 infections reported over the past nine days alone. The state government is expecting cases to rise further in the next fortnight, especially in Mumbai and Pune, said state health department officials, adding that the government has already started strengthening its health infrastructure and adding new beds.Mumbai, which accounts for 60% of the state’s coronavirus cases, is already staring at a shortage of hospital beds and intensive care unit (ICU) facilities.The Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) on Monday outlined the plan to increase beds in Mumbai by creating “jumbo facilities”. The CMO said a centralised dashboard has been created to track the availability of beds and its location in real-time. With increased capacity and real-time tracking of beds, patients will not have to spend crucial hours waiting for availability of beds.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address to the state on Sunday, said the government is anticipating a spike in cases by month-end. As a part of their preparations for the surge in Mumbai, a field hospital at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) with 1,000 beds, including 200 ICU beds, has been readied in a fortnight. Additionally, a Covid Care Centre (CCC) with 600 beds at Mahalaxmi Racecourse, which will have 125 ICU beds, is being erected for patients with mild infections. Nesco Exhibition Centre in Goregaon will have 535 beds.“In the next two weeks, Dedicated Covid Hospital Centre (DCHC) and Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) collectively with 7,000 beds will come up at Dahisar, Mulund, Mahalaxmi Racecourse, and Goregaon,” a note from the CMO said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is acquiring hospitals with 100 beds and 20 ICUs in each ward to tackle the rise in cases.Similarly, hospitals are being acquired in Thane city. Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde has asked to augment bed capacity at the Thane district hospital too. As many as 150 beds will be added at the hospital.Meanwhile, according to the state health department, of the 60 deaths recorded on Monday, 54 were in the past 48 hours, while the remaining six are from last week. The fatalities are of 42 men and 18 women. Twenty-seven of those who succumbed to the infection were over 60 years, while 29 were in the 40 to 59 age group, and three were under 40 years. According to the health department, 78%, or 47 patients, had high-risk co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-death-toll-crosses-1k/story-YAKAH22q76FuBp2ksdCVbL.html
25-05-2020||India||Expedite setting up of migrant commission in state, says Yogi||LucknowUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Monday that measures to set up a migration commission should be expedited to provide jobs to migrant workers coming back to the state due to the Covid-19 lockdown.The chief minister gave the directives at a meeting of his Team-11 convened to review the lockdown situation in the state.“Yes, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked for making efforts on a war-footing to set up the migration commission. The commission will be set up in the next few days in accordance with the existing provisions of law,” said chief secretary RK Tiwari.The announcement came amid a growing controversy over the chief minister’s assertion last week that states will need to obtain permission if they wanted to use Uttar Pradesh’s manpower.In response on Monday, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray demanded that Maharashtra should allow only “bonafide” migrants and they should submit all details to the authorities.”Any migrant entering Maharashtra too, would need to take permissions from us, the Maharashtra government and the state police. The Maharashtra government needs to look into this matter seriously,” said Thackeray.Official estimates say about one million migrants have left Maharashtra and gone back to their respective home states since the Covid-19 pandemic began. A majority of these workers belong to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Jharkhand and West Bengal.The controversy has alarmed business associations who say any move to curtail the flow of workers would be detrimental to the economy.“These statements like registration will only scare away the migrant labour and will impede the growth of an industrialised state like Maharashtra,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman of the Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade. “There is also apprehensions of how much migrants will come back as many sectors are dependent on migrant labour,” he added.At a webinar on Sunday, the chief minister had said his government would set up the migration commission in the interest of workers. “The migration commission will work in the interest of the migrant workers. If any other state wants UP’s manpower, they cannot take them away just like that. Those states will have to do it with the consent and permission of the UP government. The way our migrant workers were ill-treated in those states, the UP government will take their insurance, social security in its hands now. The UP government will stand with them wherever they work, whether in Uttar Pradesh, other states or other countries,” he had said.Asked if the state government would study the Centre’s Inter State Migrant Workmen Act or go for enacting a new law to set up the commission, Tiwari said, “Our basic objective is to watch the welfare of migrant labourers and ensure that they get their wages.”The state government’s move about prior permission for jobs in other states may, however, has to stand legal scrutiny with experts saying there can’t be any restriction on doing business in any part of the country. “The Constitution of India provides a fundamental right allowing every citizen free movement and the right to do business anywhere in India. The state government can enact any law for welfare of migrant labourers. It, however, cannot restrict these rights,” said former advisor to governor and legal expert CB Pandey.About 2.5 million migrant labourers have already reached the state. The state government is carrying out an exercise for skill mapping of the migrant labourers. An official spokesman said the skill mapping so far has indicated that 151,492 migrant workers belong to the real estate sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expedite-setting-up-of-migrant-commission-in-state-says-yogi/story-zImxAMNQf7WBkGYMFBCV4J.html

They were housed in relief centres set up in Champawat and US Nagar district till now, said an official.“More than 1,500 migrant Nepalese were sent to Nepal from Sharda barrage on Monday. They were housed in Champawat and US Nagar districts. They were taken by buses and dropped near the international border,” said SN Pandey, district magistrate, Champawat.These Nepalese had come from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, where most of them worked as labourers and workers. They were housed in relief camps in the two bordering districts. Some of them were with their families and were in a distressed condition.They were stuck in India as Nepalese government had sealed the Indo-Nepal border to check Covid-19 outbreak and was reluctant to permit their entry fearing they may bring infection into Nepal, an official said.These Nepalese citizens were anguished by the stand taken by the Nepal government. Three days ago, they shouted anti-Nepal government slogans at Jagbuda bridge for not allowing them to enter Nepal.For Coronavirus Live Updates“450 Nepalese stuck in Nainital district will leave for Nepal on Tuesday. It is decided that the entry gate at Sharda barrage in Banbasa will remain open from 6 am to 10 am daily for such Nepalese migrants. Entry gate will not be opened for all,” Pandey said.He said Indians stuck in Nepal will return on May 29 and 30 as per schedule. Only those Indians will be allowed to come who have already registered their names with the embassy in Kathmandu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-1-500-stranded-nepalese-sent-to-nepal-via-champawat-barrage/story-h59qkhzNAxdvZaMsgRGzsI.html
25-05-2020||India||Over 24k samples collected for random antibody tests||The Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) has collected around 24,000 blood samples from 60 districts in 21 states over the past two weeks for a sero-survey (a test of blood serum) to check for exposure to the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the general population.The cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years or more will detect infection in the community by testing for the presence of antibodies against Sars-CoV2 that are found in the blood of people who have recovered from it. Representative samples were taken from 60 districts chosen from among four categories based on reported Covid-19 cases per million population -- zero, low (0.1-4.7), medium ( 4.8-10) and high (>10). Four hundred samples from 15 districts from each stratum were selected randomly, according to ICMR.The first batch of about 70% samples was dispatched to a central laboratory in Tamil Nadu for analysis on Sunday, and the results are expected in about three weeks.“By end of this week the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai (Tamil Nadu) that has been identified as the central lab to do the analysis, should receive all samples,” said an ICMR official, who did not wish to be identified.This community-based survey will hold the key for getting several vital clues on the disease trend, testing and so on in the country, experts said. “If more people have antibodies and never detected that means the infection is widely present. It is a good thing that only few are getting ended up with complications and death. Indirectly it is also a way of knowing whether enough tests are being done,” says Dr Girdhar R Babu, head, life course epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India . The blood samples will be tested for IgG antibodies using ELISA method (IgG is an antibody that develops later as compared to the other antibodies and therefore confirms a past infection). ELISA is an enzyme-based laboratory test that detects and quantifies antibodies in blood. The 21 states from where samples have been taken are Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Jammu & Kashmir.Additionally, about 5,000 samples have been picked from 10 hotspot cities with maximum case load: Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Thane, Pune, Indore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Aurangabad.“Conducting population-based sero-surveillance for Sars-CoV-2 will estimate and monitor the trend of infection in the adult general population, determine the socio-demographic risk factors and delineate the geographical spread of the infection,” said a recently published ICMR document. It added: “Such serosurveys repeated at regular intervals can also guide containment measures in respective areas. State-specific context of disease burden, priorities and resources should guide the use of multifarious surveillance options for the current COVID-19 epidemic.”“We are likely to repeat the survey depending on what results we get,” said the ICMR official.Apart from the sero-survey, the Union health ministry has a hospital-based active surveillance plan using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests among healthcare workers, outpatient department patients, and pregnant women in all districts. At least 10 hospitals--six public and four private --will be selected from each district for the sampling, with an overall target of lifting 800 samples a month. These two surveys are in addition to the random testing of about 250 severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) cases that the Centre has advised all states to conduct in each district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-24k-samples-collected-for-random-antibody-tests/story-Pec8jZE03DMQ0zOQwr4KEN.html

Officials said 106 of the prisoners were in six UP jails while another 15 were lodged in Haryana jails.This concession was not extended to people being tried in terror cases.The gesture, the official said, was an attempt to bring some happiness in the lives of the prisoners and their families back home in Kashmir. Unlike other prisoners, prisoners from Kashmir do not have many visitors due to logistical reasons.It also means that for people who are not accused in terror-related cases, the government is willing to take a sympathetic view and go an extra mile.“But for those involved in terror, you saw what happened in the morning,” the official said, a reference to the encounter in south Kashmir’s Kulgam earlier in the day.Two men, accused of being operatives of the ISJK (The Islamic State in Jammu and Kashmir, were shot dead in an encounter. One of them was identified by security forces as Adil Ahmad Wani alias Abu Ibrahim and the second, Shaheen Bashir Thoker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-eid-outreach-amit-shah-lets-120-kashmiri-prisoners-in-3-states-call-valley-home/story-5Frhwp0IRcd6gX0LfS3UlI.html

25-05-2020||India||Indian Army chief’s remarks ‘hurt sentiments of Nepali Gurkhas’, says minister||The Indian Army chief’s remarks about Nepal acting at the behest of others in raising a border dispute has “hurt the sentiments of the Nepali Gurkha army personnel who lay down their lives to protect India”, Nepal’s defence minister Ishwar Pokhrel has said.Days after Indian Army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane made the comments, which were seen as a veiled reference to a possible Chinese role in the border row, Pokhrel dismissed the remarks as a “political stunt”.The Nepal government recently protested against the opening of a new road to Lipulekh by defence minister Rajnath Singh to facilitate people making the pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar in Tibet. India rejected the protest by saying the road was within Indian territory. Nepal then published a new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadura, which fall within India, as part of Nepalese territory.In an interview with Nepal’s news agency Rastriya Samachar Samiti, Pokhrel said the Indian Army chief’s remarks “have come in an embarrassing manner” at a time when Nepal has been trying resolve the border issue through diplomatic dialogue.“No matter what background and circumstance is it based on, such statements are an effort to offend sovereign and independent Nepal and prideful Nepalis… With this, the Indian CoAS [chief of army staff] has also hurt the sentiments of the Nepali Gurkha army personnel who lay down their lives to protect India. It must now become difficult for them to stand tall in front of the Gurkha forces…In fact, the statement by the Indian CoAS seems to be a political stunt,” Pokhrel said.He added, “How professional is it for the head of the army to make a political statement? We don’t have anything like that here. Nepali Army does not go vocal on such matter. Army is not there to speak. Nepali Army is a fully professional military force. It would definitely play its role in the right time, as per the directives of the government based on our Constitution.”Pokhrel, who is also the deputy prime minister, described India as “our friendly state” and said the “lost Nepali territory must be returned through peaceful political dialogue and through diplomatic channel, and I am confident that it is possible”.There was no immediate response from the Indian side to Pokhrel’s remarks.Pokhrel also said this was the “first time in history” that the Nepal government had written an official letter to the Indian government “saying Nepali land at the Nepal-India border region has been encroached and this should be stopped”. He added, “We have raised this topic on the basis of the historical facts, proof and treaties available to us. We have issued the new map of Nepal on the basis of this.”He reiterated that Nepal had been seeking talks on the border issue since the Indian government issued its new political and administrative maps of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh on November 2 last year.“Now, serious political and diplomatic initiatives have to be immediately pursued on the basis of the combined force based on common and unified stance of the political forces of the entire nation as well as of historical facts and evidences. Infrastructure development and comprehensive security plan needs to be implemented in that area,” he said.Pokhrel said the Nepal government had published its new political map after it didn’t receive “any immediate positive response to the communication we sent” to India for talks on the border issue.There are more than 30,000 Nepalese Gurkhas serving in the Gurkha Rifles regiments of the Indian Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-chief-s-remarks-hurt-sentiments-of-nepali-gurkhas-says-minister/story-0lqL7aD1wcGniRxcM1siGK.html

25-05-2020||India||9 migrants found dead in Telangana’s Warangal killed by fellow worker: Cops||The Telangana police on Monday said it has solved the mystery behind the death of nine migrant workers, including six of the same family, whose bodies were recovered from an abandoned well on the outskirts of Warangal town on Friday last.Warangal city police commissioner V Ravinder announced that all the nine persons were murdered by another migrant worker to cover up another murder he had committed in March. The killer was identified as Sanjay Kumar Yadav, 24, from Bihar.The police had recovered nine bodies, said the commissioner, from a well at Gorrekunta village of Geesugonda block on the outskirts of Warangal. The deceased were identified as Md Maqsood (55), his wife Nisha (48), sons Shahabad Alam (21) and Sohail Alam (18), daughter Bushra (20) and her three years old son Shoaib (all from the same family from West Bengal), Sriram (21) and Shyam (22) from Bihar, besides Shakil (30) from Tripura.All the elders were working in a gunny bags manufacturing unit at Geesugonda and staying in the same company premises since the enforcement of lockdown in March.The police initially thought they all had committed mass suicide owing to financial constraints or some other family reasons, including a suspected illicit affair between the Bihari youth and Bushra, who had divorced her husband a year ago.“After going through the evidence available at the spot, examining the footage from the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and post-mortem report, we came to the conclusion that it was a cold-blooded murder by Sanjay Kumar Yadav, who came from Bihar six years ago and was working in the same factory,” Ravinder said.According to the police commissioner, Yadav had an illicit relationship with Rafiqa (37), a divorcee sister-in-law of Maqsood, who came from West Bengal to see his brother and stayed with them till recently.“Rafiqa, along with her three children, started living with Yadav separately. But she later realised that Yadav was also trapping her teenaged daughter. Unable to bear it, she threatened to expose him,” Ravinder said.Soon after Yadav hatched a conspiracy to eliminate Rafiqa. He promised to marry her and left for West Bengal with her on March 6. During their journey, the police said, he gave her buttermilk laced with sedatives and then strangulated her with her dupatta and threw her body out from the train at Nidubrolu in West Godavari district. He got down at Rajahmundry and quietly returned to Warangal, the police added.After a few days, when Maqsood enquired about Rafiqa, Yadav told him that she stayed back with her family in West Bengal. When nothing was heard from her family members even after two months, Maqsood grew suspicious and started questioning Yadav. He even threatened to complain to the police.Fearing trouble, Yadav then decided to kill all the family members of Maqsood, said police. He is alleged to have bought sleeping pills from a medical shop and on May 20 attended the birthday party hosted by Maqsood for his son. He is reported to have mixed the pills in the food. “After ensuring that all of them were unconscious, Yadav dragged all the nine to the well one after the other and threw them into it between 12.30 am to 5 am on Thursday,” Ravinder said.Based on the evidence, the police were able to track Yadav and arrest him. “During interrogation, he confessed to committing the crime,” the Commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-migrants-found-dead-in-telangana-s-warangal-killed-by-fellow-worker-cops/story-KFy5NDVxVc5TkQN8W4yEpJ.html

25-05-2020||India||Odisha’s order to sell liquor online flouted in Bhubaneswar, people queue up outside stores||Odisha government’s order of selling liquor online went for a toss as people gathered in large numbers at several liquor shops in Bhubaneswar on Monday, flouting the government notification.The State Excise department in a notification on Saturday  said that home delivery of liquor will be allowed by existing Indian Made Foreign Liquor outlets in areas other than Covid containment zones and shopping malls. A ‘special Covid fee’, amounting to 50% over the MRP of the liquor was to be charged to generate additional revenue for the state government. There had been a complete ban on sale of liquor in the state for the past two months during lockdown before the state government allowed online sale from May 24. Despite the government order that liquor can be ordered only through online and delivered by delivery platforms Zomato or Swiggy to buyers, hundreds of people queued up in front of IMFL outlets in the state capital on Monday.The reasons for the long queues varied from people not registering online to some who didn’t want their families to know they drank. “Though the government has said liquor can be sold online, we can’t risk ordering it as our family members would know about our drinking if the liquor was delivered at home. I had ordered liquor online, but I came to the liquor outlet to collect it myself,” said a buyer, who outside a liquor store. Several others who stood in the lines were those who had not registered online, till police intervened to stop the offline sale.Later in the day, police and excise department in Bhubaneswar had a meeting in which it was decided that no IMFL outlet will sell liquor offline. However, in other areas of the state, IMFL outlets remained closed for buyers and liquor was being sold through online.Meanwhile, a resident of Bhubaneswar fell prey to cyber fraud, losing Rs 1.36 lakh after placing an online order for liquor. Anjan Barik came across a post on the Internet that claimed to take orders for home delivery of liquor from a shop named Kadambari. When Barik called the number shared in the post, the receiver asked him to pay Rs 200 through PhonePe. When he sent Rs 200 to the PhonePe account, the person at the other end sent him a barcode and asked him to scan it. When Barik scanned the barcode, a sum of Rs 1.36 lakh was deducted from his bank account in four phases. Later, he lodged a complaint with Mancheswar police.In another such incident, a banker in Bhubaneswar was duped of Rs 19,000 after placing an online order for liquor last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-s-order-to-sell-liquor-online-flouted-in-bhubaneswar-people-queue-up-outside-stores/story-0CKZmqlk2gU2D8ups88qqL.html

While the house sites measure between one cent to five cents, the agricultural lands measure around 10 cents to less than an acre.The TTD chairman said properties donated by devotees to the hill shrine several decades ago were non-maintainable and non- revenue generating for TTD as they were very petty and unviable. There are another 26 properties in Andhra Pradesh and one piece of land in Rishikesh.The decision triggered a lot of uproar in political circles as well as religious groups and individuals.Bharatiya Janata Party Andhra Pradesh unit president Kanna Lakshminarayana demanded that the temple withdraw the proposal to sell the properties gifted to the Lord by devotees as it would hurt the sentiments of the community.The BJP called upon all its leaders and cadres to host a ‘SaveLordBalajiLands’ slogan as DP for their social media accounts. The slogan is trending as BJP’s top leaders GVL Narasimha Rao, Sunil Deodhar, state president Kanna Lakshminarayana and all other leaders have changed their DP accordingly.Jana Sena party president Pawan Kalyan lashed out at the temple trust board for the decision that would be likely to hurt the sentiments of devotees.Temples’ protection movement convenor CS Rangarajan appealed to the government to form a Dharmika Parishad to govern the assets of temples. He expressed the fear that the TTD’s decision would set a precedent for all temples for selling properties donated by devotees.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad threatened the YS Jagan Reddy-led government with launching Kar Seva, if the decision to sell God’s properties is not withdrawn.The TTD chairman, however, said as per the rules, the TTD Board was competent to sell, exchange and mortgage immovable properties, if found beneficial to TTD.He said that the practice of selling immovable, non-maintainable and non-useful properties had been in vogue since 1974. Between 1974-2014, about 129 such immovable properties which were not useful to TTD were disposed of in public auction.Subba Reddy also appealed to devotees not to get carried away by false propaganda by vested interests aimed to create confusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-to-auction-tirumala-temple-properties-kicks-up-row-chairman-clarifies/story-748LNEtqpbLQoDV1xjRDzO.html

On Monday, Akola recorded its highest day temperature for the season at 47.4 degrees Celsius, 5.5 degrees Celsius above normal, while Nagpur, which was the second hottest location in India on Saturday and Sunday, recorded 47 degrees Celsius, 4 degrees above normal. “No relief can be expected from hot weather for Vidarbha region till May 31,” said ML Sahu, deputy director general of meteorology, India Meteorological Department (Nagpur). “Hot and dry northwesterly winds from Gujarat and Rajasthan region continue to flow over this region, raising temperatures, and till there are pre-monsoon showers or wind pattern changes, the present scenario will continue.”IMD issues colour coded warnings based on the intensity of weather events in a particular region, ascending from ‘green’ (no warning), ‘yellow’ (be updated), ‘orange’ (be prepared), and ‘red’ (take action). A ‘red alert’ warning directs citizens to take “extreme care needed for vulnerable people”, while the health impact statement read, “Very high likelihood of developing heat illnesses and heat stroke to all ages”.Of the 11 districts in Vidarbha, the ‘red alert’ has been issued for four, ‘orange alert’ for three (Wardha, Yavatmal and Amravati), and ‘yellow alert’ for the remaining districts (Buldhana, Washim, Gadchiroli, and Bhramapuri). Meanwhile, a ‘yellow alert’ has been issued for other parts of Maharashtra, including Jalgaon, Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur till Wednesday, while Parbhani, Beed, Hingoli and Nanded are likely to witness heatwave conditions in isolated pockets till Wednesday, said IMD.The Konkan region, which includes Mumbai, witnessed normal temperatures on Monday. The day temperature at the Santacruz weather observatory was 33.7 degrees Celsius, close to the normal-mark, while Colaba recorded 34.2 degrees Celsius, a degree above normal. Moisture levels were high, with Colaba and Santacruz recording 89% and 77% humidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-alert-issued-for-vidarbha-till-may-31-due-to-heatwave/story-GJtjy6pbtcwIFtiiDCQflL.html

New SOP out||Union minister DV Sadananda Gowda flew in from Delhi to Bengaluru but did not proceed for the mandatory one week of institutional quarantine followed by another week of quarantine at home mandated by the state government.The minister for chemicals and fertilisers soon after arrival left in a private car even as other passengers were sent to compulsory one week of institutional quarantine mandated by the Karnataka government for any passengers coming from high risk states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi.Gowda, speaking to the media, claimed that being a minister he was exempt from the quarantine rules. He accused the media of unnecessarily blowing up the issue.“I am also looking after Pharma. It is my duty to ensure that there is no shortage of medicine supply in the country. If I don’t do that then the number of cases will double,” he said, adding ,“If doctors are quarantined, if people who supply medicines are quarantined, how will we beat the virus?”His assistant claimed that Gowda had come with a negative Covid-19 test report conducted by an ICMR approved lab but refused to elaborate further.In an SOP released shortly after the controversy erupted, Pankaj Kumar Pandey, state commissioner of health and family welfare, said, “The ministers of union government or state governments or officers on their official duty who are travelling across states will be exempted from the requirements of quarantine as has been done for health professionals and others.”The Karnataka Congress, however, questioned the union minister giving the quarantine a go-by.“…(Sadananda Gowda) flouts all Covid norms, lands from Delhi and walks away without quarantine period. The Karnataka government rules have no exemption for anyone. How come he comes up with his own rules? Is he not putting all his primary contacts under health risk? Why no action?” tweeted the Karnataka Congress.BJP spokesperson, Prakash, said the minister has already clarified his stand on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sadanand-gowda-lands-in-bengaluru-goes-home-giving-quarantine-a-go-by/story-AE0z4SEG1zGKYsjjkNS82M.html

In the worst affected Goalpara district, 33 relief camps have been set up where nearly 9,000 people are taking shelter.Flood waters have affected 579 hectares of crop area in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts, the ASDMA bulletin said. Nearly 12,000 domestic animals and poultry have also been affected.Most rivers in the state including the Brahmaputra and its tributaries witnessed a rise in water levels on Monday as well. Jia Bharali was flowing above the danger mark at Sonitpur while the Puthimari river crossed the red mark in Kamrup.

25-05-2020||India||Assam Covid-19 tally past 500 with biggest single day spike of 147 cases||With 147 new patients detected on Monday, the single biggest spike in a day for the state, the number of Covid-19 positive patients in Assam crossed the 500 figure mark.The day started with 35 new cases from seven districts in the state including the first patient from Dhemaji, the only district out of 33 in Assam, which had not recorded any Covid-19 positive case till Sunday.Soon, 39 more patients were confirmed from three districts taking the state’s tally to 467 cases. By Monday late evening, 73 more patients were reported, taking the total to 540 cases.Five patients, who had tested negative in subsequent tests, were discharged during the day in Guwahati and Jorhat. At present, the state has 470 active cases, 63 recoveries, 4 deaths and 3 cases of positive persons migrating to other states.Assam recorded its first positive case on March 31 when a 52-year-old cancer patient was found to be infected with coronavirus. It took another 37 days for the figure to reach 50 on May 7 and just 10 days to double and reach the 100 figure mark on May 17.The figure doubled again to reach 200 cases four days later on May 21 and it crossed 400 cases in another four days on Monday. The latest surge in positive cases has happened in the past 7-10 days since the ban on inter-state movement was lifted on May 4.Of the total cases, nearly 400 are amongst people who have returned to the state by roads and railways in the past three weeks. Till Sunday afternoon, nearly 60,000 people had entered Assam from other states in the region and across the country.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“The surge has happened in the past 7 days and hence our recovery rate has dropped to 16% in comparison to the national figure of 41%,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.“One positive aspect is that almost 90% of our total cases are of people who are in quarantine. We have adopted a policy of ruthless quarantine of 14 days for all returnees and it has helped prevent community outbreak of the disease,” said Sarma.A community surveillance campaign by the state government covered 25,000 villages in the state and recorded around 23,000 cases of people with fever. Tests conducted on a section of them who showed Covid-19 like symptoms have come negative for all.Sarma mentioned that a pro-active approach adopted in the past two months has helped Assam put adequate infrastructure in place and at present the state has capacity to treat nearly 5,000 Covid-19 patients.More cases likely with resumption of domestic flightsWith resumption of domestic flights from Monday, Assam now faces additional burden on quarantine facilities and the number of Covid-19 positive cases could also surge further.A total of 32 flights were expected to arrive at Guwahati’s Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport on Monday, but due to cancellations, only eight arrived. A total of 686 passengers landed on the first day. Himanta Biswa Sarma, senior Airport Authority of India officials, security personnel and state government officials were present at the airport to ensure the standard operating procedures (SOPs) prepared by Assam government were followed. All passengers were taken by government vehicles to their respective districts, where they will be placed in quarantine. Assam has declared 14 days of mandatory quarantine and Covid-19 tests for all passengers. Although there was an apprehension that chaos and confusion would mark the first day, it was avoided as most of the flights to Guwahati got cancelled. “Today the number of arriving passengers got reduced due to cancellations, but from Tuesday, we expect around 1,000 more passengers. The next few days will be a bit hectic, but I am sure we will be able to manage the situation,” Sarma told journalists at the airport. He added that the state government hopes the rush of returnees to end by the end of June so that they can be managed properly before the onset of floods in July.

This way we’ll be giving the best possible care to our patients. We’re in touch with officials from other states such as Kerala, where the recovery rate is good,” said Negi.Dr. Ashutosh Sayana, principal of Government Doon Medical College, who is the nodal officer for the initiative, said that the officials are trying to arrive at a consensus on a single treatment plan for Covid-19 patients across the state.“Initially, the recovery rate was good for patients admitted at Doon Hospital. We thought of discussing the treatment plan with doctors from other hospitals in Uttarakhand, take their suggestions, and also share our views to form a single treatment protocol. We’ll also imbibe from the treatment models of Kerala and Tamil Nadu,” said Dr. Sayana.There would be uniformity with one treatment protocol and the best practices can be shared among doctors, he added.The health department is also focusing on ramping up the infrastructure in hospitals across the state, as the hill state reported over 200 Covid-19 positive cases over the past four days.On Saturday, Negi had asked all chief medical officers to improve health infrastructure in their districts.“All districts should ensure the installation of adequate number of ICU (intensive care unit) beds, ventilators, procurement of medicines and oxygen supply in a bid to tackle any extreme possible situation,” said Negi. He also urged the officials to give him a regular update about Covid-19 situation in their respective districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-doctors-look-to-develop-one-clinical-protocol-for-covid-19-treatment/story-6T5nP0SGhPFXAQg4yhhqgL.html
25-05-2020||India||Kerala reports 49 new coronavirus cases, total active cases at 359||Kerala reported 49 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases on Monday, including two prisoners and healthcare workers each, state health minister KK Shailaja said. Of the 49 new cases, 14 and 10 are reported from north Kerala’s Kasaragod and Kannur districts, respectively.Among the new Covid-19 positive cases, 18 people have come back from abroad, 25 returned from other states and six contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, from other infected people locally, the minister said. She promised to ramp up efforts to contain the spread of the viral outbreak.There has been a recent spike in Covid-19 positive cases because of the return of stranded people from West Asian countries and other states across the country amid the easing of lockdown restrictions. An estimated one lakh people have returned to the state over the past two weeks. Kerala still has 359 active Covid-19 cases of the 896 reported to date. Around one lakh people are under quarantine, including 90% of them at their homes.Four more areas, including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s home district Kannur, have been declared as hotspots.On Monday, the Vijayan-led government completed four years in office, but no celebrations were held because of the prevailing lockdown restrictions imposed to contain the viral outbreak.“We’re with our people and they also accept us in a big way. The state is a role model for many others. We’ll continue our best efforts. We have completed in four years what we had promised to accomplish in five years of our rule,” said the CM.The ruling Communist Party of India (M) hoped that its effective governance amid the pandemic would help gain political mileage.But the opposition Congress alleged that a lion’s share of the government funds was spent on unnecessary public relations (PR) exercise. “It’s a PR campaign at its best,” alleged opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-kerala-reports-49-new-cases/story-Mi4XM05TFpl52aK0zgmmcL.html
25-05-2020||India||Yogi wants migration commission set up on war footing, even as Raj Thackeray fumes over his proposal||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday has asked state officials to expedite the setting up of the migration commission meant to provide jobs to migrant workers returning to Uttar Pradesh due to the ongoing lockdown in the country and to safeguard their rights.The instruction comes amid a brewing political controversy that saw Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray shoot a sharp retort to Adityanath’s claim made on Sunday that workers from UP were ill treated in other states, which, he added, will now have to obtain UP government’s permission to hire manpower from the state.“The migration commission will work in the interest of the migrant workers. If any other state wants UP’s manpower, they cannot take them away just like that. Those states will have to do it with the consent and permission of the UP government. The way our migrant workers were ill-treated in those states, the UP government will take their insurance, social security in its hands now. The UP government will stand with them wherever they work, whether in Uttar Pradesh, other states or other countries,” he had said.Following up on his assertion, Yogi issued the directives to constitute the commission on Monday at a meeting of his Team-11 convened to review the lockdown situation here.“Yes, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked for making efforts on a war-footing to set up the migration commission. The commission will be set up in the next few days in accordance with the existing provisions of law,” said chief secretary RK Tiwari.Asked if the state government would study the Centre’s Inter State Migrant Workmen Act or go for enacting a new law to set up the commission, Tiwari said, “Our basic objective is to watch the welfare of migrant labourers and ensure that they get their wages.”The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The state government’s proposal mandating prior permission for jobs in other states may, however, face legal scrutiny, with experts saying there can’t be any restriction on doing business in any part of the country.“The Constitution of India provides a fundamental right allowing every citizen free movement and the right to do business anywhere in India. The state government can enact any law for welfare of migrant labourers. It, however, cannot restrict these rights,” said former advisor to governor and legal expert CB Pandey.UP CM’s proposal has also not gone down well with Raj Thackeray who said Maharashtra should also allow entry only to a restricted group of workers from UP that register with the state.“...If such is the case, then any migrant entering Maharashtra too would need to take permissions from us, from the Maharashtra state, our police force. Shri Adityanath needs to take cognizance of this,” one of Thackeray’s tweets on the issue stated on Sunday.Thackeray added that such workers should also be denied voting rights in Maharashtra.“Also, the migrant workers from UP will have voting rights only in UP. As per rules laid down, a voter can only vote from one place and cannot exercise their voting rights in two places. This fact needs to be realised by CM Adityanath, by Maharashtra and other states too,” he said in another tweet.About 25 lakh migrant labourers have already returned to UP. The state government is carrying out an exercise for skill mapping of the migrant labourers. An official spokesman said, the skill mapping so far has indicated that the largest number of 1,51,492 migrant workers have come from the real estate development sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-wants-migration-commission-set-up-on-war-footing-even-as-raj-thackeray-fumes-over-his-proposal/story-raVxdRoUkd076IZPgRdw3M.html

The workers are also alleged to have damaged the food stall located in the new building of the railway station, informed railway officials.The incident occurred at around 11.40am when the 09399 Shramik Special train way from Palghat to Bihar Sharif arrived at the Prayagraj station. “Around 250 passengers of this train carrying around 1,600 migrant workers created ruckus soon after arrival of the train and looted 720 bottles of mineral water, 10 boxes of cold drinks,100 packets of biscuits and namkeen, besides 1,000 packets of ‘mathri’ (North Indian style crispy crackers) and 720 pieces of buns and other snacks from a food stall located in the new building of the railway station. They also damaged some railway property near the stall during this,” said Sunil Gupta, public relation officer (PRO), Prayagraj Division of NCR.These water bottles, cold drinks and snack packets were kept to be distributed among the passengers of the Shramik Special trains itself. “The 09399 Shramik Special train left Prayagraj Chheoki railway station at around12.25pm without any further disturbance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shramik-special-passengers-stole-water-bottles-biscuits-in-up-railways/story-8cP4rUHOaafeUn9CyWtSXK.html
25-05-2020||India||In India’s Covid-19 testing strategy, a hard push from PM Modi and a dose of reality||As India crosses the 1 lakh tests per day milestone and begins work on the next, a senior government official on Monday underlined that India’s testing strategy had evolved to try “remain ahead of the virus” despite the healthcare infrastructure constraints and ensure that the testing facilities were not overwhelmed in any part of the country.“It has been a tough balancing act… sometimes in the face of criticism from the media,” the official said, requesting anonymity because he isn’t authorised to speak with the media.Do remember that the public health system wasn’t paralysed this time as it was in 2009 when one of the worst flu pandemics Swine flu reached India. Hundreds died in this pandemic, a government official said. But the 2009 experience led to some attention being paid to strengthen the molecular diagnostic facilities for viruses in India.That came in handy when Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak, told the country’s top scientists in and outside the Indian Council of Medical Research to expand testing facilities.“You have to work day and night to save people’s lives. Make every effort. You have my full support,” PM Modi told them. And then, he and his office kept following up.“For this outbreak, we are answerable to the highest level and are being watched by the highest level (officialese for Prime Minister,” Dr Nivedita Gupta, the ICMR scientist who executed the effort to set up labs across the country, told Vogue’s India website, earlier this month. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The difficult decision of the national lockdown bought them time as it slowed down the spread of the virus and gave the government time to prepare the healthcare infrastructure to trace, track, test, quarantine and treat people.“We adopted an intelligent testing strategy to remain ahead of the virus. So in the beginning when the infection was entering the country from abroad, we centered our efforts to set up the initial burst of laboratories in cities…. This focus kept on shifting on the basis of our analysis of the likely hotspots of the infection,” a government official explained.Like before the government started allowing the migrants to go back home, testing facilities preceded them in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha.That was the most difficult part since India doesn’t have a medical college at the district level, and district-level hospitals don’t have the specialised set-up.“This has been quite challenging as the labs outside the medical college systems have meager experience of handling human infectious material,” a health ministry official recalled.All underserved areas were mapped and Covid-19 molecular diagnostic capacity reached in ‘difficult to reach’ areas such as Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Sikkim, Ladakh, Goa, Andaman & Nicobar Islands.In the big picture, India moved from 13 labs in the first week of February to 123 labs on March 24, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a nationwide lockdown. Days before the lockdown is formally lifted later this month-end, India has 609 testing labs in all states and UTs.Jugaad, or a frugal innovation, certainly helped when the imported Chinese testing kits didn’t.TrueNat — a diagnostic machine used for testing drug-resistant tuberculosis — was tested and validated by ICMR to screen people for the Sars-Cov-2 virus (which causes the coronavirus disease) to boost testing capacities.Since TrueNat platform comes with an inbuilt sample collection in viral lysis buffer, the virus is inactivated and the biosafety requirements are minimal while handling the sample.There were 367 of these machines in different states for TB diagnosis. These are being used for Covid-19 also . Besides, supplies of 608 additional TrueNAT machines - each has a capacity for 10-12 tests in a day - are also being mobilised to be ready for deployment in June.With supplies of these machines, it would be possible to have Covid-19 testing capacities in districts with no capacity for carrying out the RT-PCR tests, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test that is considered the gold standard for detecting Sars-Cov-2 virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-india-s-covid-19-testing-strategy-a-hard-push-from-pm-modi-and-a-dose-of-reality/story-OdltrmDPeTD4BRPUEM0qMP.html

She was brought to the community health centre in Betalghat around 1.15 pm, where doctors gave her two anti-venom injections. But she died within ten minutes,” said Dr Rana.Dr Rana said she had been quarantined with her parents at the primary school three days ago after their return from Delhi around 12 days ago.Dr Rana said she was first taken for ‘jhaad phoonk’ (excorcism) before being brought to the community health centre, which resulted in the delay. She said the girl’s body has been sent for post mortem. “After post mortem results, we will be in a better position to say what exactly happened.”Dr Satish Pant, a doctor in Betalghat who treated the girl, said the girl was brought around 1.15 pm. “Her parents said she was bitten by a snake on her ear while she was sleeping. We immediately started the treatment protocol for snake bites and administered her two anti-venom injections. But despite our best efforts, she died around 1.25 pm. They should have brought her earlier,” he said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19In the last few days, due to the heavy influx of migrants from other states, Nainital has emerged as the district with the most positive Covid-19 cases in the state. Of Uttarakhand’s 332 positive Covid-19 cases till Monday afternoon, Nainital has the maximum 117 cases. Around 14,400 migrants from other states have returned to Nainital so far, including 7,921 in rural areas and 6,479 in urban areas of the district, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/snakebite-kills-six-year-old-girl-in-uttarakhand-quarantine-centre/story-H0NerjD2wWdfCGiDgoZcQK.html
25-05-2020||India||Explainer: What is a locust plague||India’s farms are facing a significant threat from a swarm of millions of locusts that have migrated from Africa and have now been spotted in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.A GENETIC MARVELThe desert locust is one of about a dozen species of short-horned grasshoppers. They are unique in the way that they change their behaviour – turning from solitary to “gregarious” or social insects that coalesce into a swarm and forage for food together.WHERE DID THEY ORIGINATE?This swarm originated in the Horn of Africa, where excess rains triggered a breeding boom. According to Indian experts, the swarm entering India now had another round of breeding in Baluchistan, Iran and Pakistan.WHERE ARE THEY NOW?Swarms have moved to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and border areas of Uttar Pradesh. They migrated to Fazilka in Punjab from Pakistan before spreading to other states from there. The worst-affected districts are Barmer, Jaisalmer and Nagaur.WHAT DAMAGE CAN THEY CAUSE?The current upsurge is alarming in the Eastern Africa region. Over 25 million people will face acute food insecurity in the region in the second half of 2020. In Yemen, where locusts have been reproducing in hard-to-access inland areas, 17 million people may be impacted. A swarm of locust spread over a square kilometre can chew through food enough for 35,000 people in a day.CAN THEY HURT HUMANS?Locusts do not attack people or animals. There is no evidence that suggests that locusts carry diseases that could harm humans.CAN THEY BE CONTROLLED?They can fly as far as 150km a day, making them difficult to control. Locust swarms can cover extremely large areas, which can sometimes be extremely remote and difficult to access. FAO monitors locust swarms on a 24-hour basis and provides forecasts and early warning alerts on the timing, scale and location of movement. Traditional chemicals are used to control their numbers. Now nature-based biopesticides are also available as a less harmful alternative for controlling outbreaks.WHAT HAPPENS NOW?If we are not able to control them, the sub adults will come back to their summer breeding area in the Thar desert bordering Pakistan. If there are good rains, they will lay eggs and lead to a new generation of desert locusts migrating to India again in a few months.MEASURES IN INDIAThe Locust Warning Organisation under the ministry of agriculture has a ground team of 50 people mainly to monitor and track the swarms; drones are used for aerial spraying of Malathion 96, an organophosphate insecticide and a potentially toxic chemical for non-cropped areas. For areas with agriculture, chlorpyrifos is sprayed by drones, fire brigades and tractor-mounted sprays.STRENGTH IN NUMBERS*40-80 million locusts are estimated in a swarm that spreads over 1 square kilometre*These many locusts can ravage crops equivalent to the feeding need of 35,000 people in a day*Their life span is between 3-5 months. They become hoppers after a month and can start laying eggs when they 60-70 days oldSource: Locust Warning Organisation, FAO, National Geographic||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explainer-india-staring-at-a-desert-locust-plague/story-EEDjCjHYannJ0c7u9ObaDK.html

The doctor reportedly displayed his identity card and even showed the cop his duty roster. But the policeman allegedly did not listen.“On that day, I was the cardiologist on call for SMHS Hospital and all other associated hospitals. I requested the policeman to allow me to pass as I was already getting late due to a traffic jam. Instead the cop started abusing me. I got down from my vehicle and asked him if he wanted to talk to his office, which enraged him and he started hitting me with his baton. In the meantime, the Station House Officer came running and dragged me into the police station,” Dr Maqbool said.The police have, however, on receipt of the complaint said the matter will be probed and also blamed the doctor for allegedly trying to manhandle the policeman on duty on that road.According to the doctor, inside the police station, the officer snatched his phone and his identity card. “Despite my repeated requests to call my HOD and the Principal of the Medical College as I was on call to deal with emergencies, the officer harassed me and termed doctors as thieves who indulge only in selling duplicate medicines and taking commission.” “Noticing his arrogant behavior and knowing that patients would suffer and could die, I apologized to the officer and after that he allowed me to make a call to my colleagues for arranging someone to take care of the patients. It was only after my brother came and submitted a bond that I was released from police custody. My vehicle is still with the police,” the doctor said.Dr Maqbool further added that the SHO threatened him that he should not tell anybody how he landed in police custody. “The officer was so rude that he threatened to strip me naked. For me, it was pure torture which I received that too while performing Covid19 duties.”’After his release instead of going home, Dr Maqbool walked on foot six kilometers to the hospital and performed two angioplasties in the morning. “I am a senior interventional cardiologist who has represented the state and country at multiple and national and international forums with multiple awards to my credit and if this is the behaviour I get what will our juniors face at a time when the whole world is dealing with a deadly disease killing thousands daily,” he questioned.Dr Maqbool also denied that he had tried to manhandle the policeman on duty. “The policemen are lying. There are CCTV cameras at the Hawal Chowk and the footage will reveal everything. If I am found guilty, I am ready to face harsh punishment. But I want action against the arrogant officer.”Principal, Medical College Srinagar, Dr Samia Rashid said that she had taken up this issue with all the top officials of the administration who had promised action. “The doctor was on call and still he was stopped and jailed. This issue has demoralized our doctors, especially the doctors who are our frontline workers and they were ready to go on general strike against this rude behaviour by the local police,” she said.SSP Srinagar, Haseeb Mughal said that doctor had reportedly tried to manhandle the policeman. “We have already filed a complaint against the doctor since he reportedly manhandled a policeman when he was coming from the wrong side. When the policeman stopped the doctor he pushed him saying that he was in a hurry. Now, he has sent me a complaint so I have also assigned the SP Hazratbal to enquire into the issue. We have already taken legal cognizance of his misconduct,” the’ SSP Srinagar said adding that the matter would be probed.“If our policemen are at fault, disciplinary action will be taken but at the same time we will not allow anybody to manhandle and misbehave with police personnel who are on the job 24/7,” he said.The issue has created quite an uproar on social media in Srinagar and many doctors have been pointing out that this is how frontline workers in Kashmir are being treated by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-kashmir-doctor-alleges-police-harassment-cop-says-he-was-pushed-first/story-DiZoztc4ieMUaUG26y5bkJ.html

During the training, Singh was seen with eyes closed by many colleagues who assumed he was sleeping. But when they shook him at the end of the programme, he just fell down following which he was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival. “He had come to impart training but said at the beginning of the programme that he was unwell and feeling sleepy because of late-night duty at a quarantine centre in Rudrapur. He asked other senior officials to continue the training. All of us thought that he slept during the entire programme,” said Praveen Singh, data operator in Kichha municipality.Praveen added, “When the programme got over and he didn’t move, we tried to wake him up. Seeing him unconscious, some of us sprinkled water on his face to bring him back but that didn’t work. He was then rushed to the government hospital but doctors declared him brought dead.”His family, as well as higher authorities, were informed about the incident.“His post-mortem has been conducted but we are yet to receive his report.

25-05-2020||India||Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati after 60 days, to host mega TDP meet via Zoom||After over 60 days in Hyderabad due to lockdown and then a cancelled flight, Chandrababu Naidu, along with his son Nara Lokesh, drove down to Amaravati on Monday afternoon. TDP Andhra unit president Kala Venkat Rao said Naidu would focus on the party activities again. “He would address the two-day biennial party conclave Maha Nadu to be held on May 27 and 28 through Zoom application. In all, 14,000 party delegates would attend Maha Nadu through Zoom,” he said.As Naidu, Telugu Desam Party president and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister, had obtained special permission from the police departments in both the states, his convoy had a smooth passage at the inter-state check post at Garikapadu on the National Highway No. 65. The Andhra police, however, checked the vehicles of other TDP leaders who accompanied his convoy.Entering the home state after a gap of more than two months, Naidu was given a rousing reception at the check-post and at different locations all along the highway. He straightaway drove to his residence at Vundavalli on the banks of Krishna river.On Sunday evening, Andhra Pradesh DGP Gautam Sawang wrote to Naidu giving him permission to fly to Visakhapatam to call on the families of those who lost members in the poisonous gas leak on May 7. Later, he had planned to return to Amaravati by road.The DGP issued an electronic pass to Naidu to travel to Visakhapatnam, saying that the visit of the opposition leader was being treated as a special case.However, as Naidu was preparing to fly to Visakhapatnam, the Centre announced late on Sunday night that all flights to Andhra Pradesh had been cancelled on technical grounds on the request of the state government and that the flights would begin only on Tuesday.It forced the TDP chief to cancel his Vizag visit and he decided to travel to Amaravati by road.TDP lawmaker and former minister K K Atchannaidu alleged that the YSR Congress government had deliberately deferred resumption of flight services only to prevent the former chief minister from visiting Vizag.“It is only after Chandrababu Naidu’s schedule was announced that the state government deferred the resumption of services, that too only by a day. Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri’s tweets indicate the same,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrababu-naidu-in-amaravati-after-60-days-to-host-mega-tdp-meet-via-zoom/story-m9vfMEGk7yoI62GDMxNAFI.html
25-05-2020||India||ICMR antibody survey begins, results likely in three weeks||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has collected around 24,000 blood samples from 60 districts across 21 states over the past two weeks for a serosurvey to check for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), among the country’s adult population.The cross-sectional survey of adults, aged 18 years or more, will detect infection in the community by testing for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that are found in the blood of people who have recovered from it. Four representative samples were collected from 60 districts on the basis of reported Covid-19 cases per million population -- zero, low (0.1-4.7), medium (4.8-10), and high (>10). Around 400 samples from 15 districts from each category were selected randomly, according to ICMR.The first batch of about 70% of samples was dispatched to a central laboratory in Chennai for analysis on Sunday, and the results are expected in about three weeks. “The ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai will do the analysis,” said an ICMR official, requesting anonymity.This community-based survey will hold the key for getting several vital clues on the viral disease such as its trend, testing pattern, etc, according to experts. “If more people have antibodies and were never detected that means the infection is widely present. It’s a good thing that only a few are suffering from complications leading to deaths. This is also an indirect methodology to ascertain whether enough tests are being conducted across the country,” said Dr. Girdhar R Babu, head, Lifecourse Epidemiology. The blood samples will be tested for detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA method (IgG is an antibody that develops later as compared to the other antibodies, hence, determine a past infection. Elisa method is an enzyme-based laboratory test that detects and quantifies antibodies in the blood) that will determine a past infection due to the virus. Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Jammu & Kashmir are the 21 states from where samples have been collected.Besides, about 5,000 samples have been collected from 10 hot spot cities that have reported the maximum caseload such as Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Thane, Pune, Indore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Aurangabad.“Conducting population-based serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 will estimate and monitor the trend of infection in the adult general population, determine the socio-demographic risk factors and delineate the geographical spread of the infection,” said a recently-published ICMR document on serosurveillance. “Such serosurveys repeated at regular intervals can also guide containment measures in respective areas. State-specific context of disease burden, priorities and resources should guide the use of multifarious surveillance options for the current Covid-19 epidemic,” the paper said. “We’re likely to repeat the survey later depending on the results,” said the ICMR official.Apart from the serosurvey, the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) has a hospital-based active surveillance plan using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) among healthcare workers, outpatient department patients, and pregnant women in all the districts in the country. At least 10 hospitals -- six public and four private hospitals -- will be selected from each district for the sampling, with an overall target of collecting 800 samples a month. These two surveys are in addition to conducting a random test of about 250 severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) cases that the Centre has advised all the states to carry out in each district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-antibody-survey-begins-results-likely-in-three-weeks/story-8a2SgTaTkICbH9QoWPGBlK.html

25-05-2020||India||Caught between Covid-19 and Amphan, Bengal’s environment refugees face an uncertain future||Caught between the Covid-19 pandemic, the lockdown and the devastation left behind by cyclone Amphan, the environmental refugees from Bengal’s ‘vanishing’ island of Ghoramara now face an uncertain future.While 50-year-old Sheikh Abdul Rauf returned home in Ghoramara a day after the Janata Curfew in March, his four sons – in their late 20’s and early 30s - managed to return from Kerala a day later on March 24. All of them had left the island at some point of time in search of a livelihood. But now they have all come back because of the fear of the pandemic and the lockdown.“But see our fate. We were forced to leave the island in search of work after losing all our farmlands due to the erosion caused by rivers. Then the virus forced us to come back. Now the cyclone has again evicted us. Where are we supposed to go now?” said Rauf, while standing outside his hut badly damaged by the cyclone.Also read: Cyclone Amphan wreaks havoc on IIM Calcutta campusLocated at the southern tip of Bengal, at the mouth of the sea, the island has been reduced to 4.8 square kilometre (sq km) as compared to more than 9 sq km in the 1970s due to severe erosion by three rivers. Hundreds of people like Rauf have left the island for other states in search of job. Rauf works as a tailor in Kolkata’s Kidderpore area.  “From a total of around 7,000 people around a decade ago, the population has been reduced to 5,000. While many have gone to other states in search of work, around 1,200 have left the island permanently and have settled elsewhere like Sagar Island, which is much bigger. But because of the fear of the pandemic and the lockdown, at least 200 – 250 people, of the 500-odd people who had gone to other states for work, have come back,” said Sanjib Sagar, panchayat pradhan of Ghoramara. The panchayat has only five members and is the smallest in West Bengal.Every time the rivers erode a portion of the island, some villager loses his house and is pushed further inland to rebuild his house. Some have been forced to rebuild their houses six times and have no farmland left, last time they had to purchase land from other villagers.“I returned home after a woman in the locality where I used to stay in Kerala tested positive for Covid-19. There were 20 of us from various villages on the Ghoramara island. We all returned together just before the lockdown. But now we have been evicted again. We can’t even go back to Kerala as the disease is spreading. Back home we have lost everything because of the cyclone,” said Chandan Chowdhury whose family had to rebuild the house at least five times.Chowdhury and his family, along with a few hundred other villagers, had to be evacuated just before the storm. Some returned to the island on Sunday to restart life.Ghoramara, once comprised three Mouzas (a type of administrative district) of which two, including Lohachura, have eroded completely. It once boasted of a three-storey post office, one of the largest post offices in the state. But even that has been washed away by the erosion.“The island is vanishing primarily because of river erosion. Many argue that it is the rising sea level. Had it been for the rising sea, many other islands in the area, like Nayachar, would have vanished. But whatever reason it may be, these environment refugees now face an uncertain future,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caught-between-covid-19-and-amphan-bengal-s-environment-refugees-face-an-uncertain-future/story-StYh8JcTgbwmdkhjeMJrTK.html

He claimed that all social distancing norms were followed during the game. “I have always followed social distancing, lockdown norms. MHA permitted opening of stadiums without spectators. Based on that, I went there and played. All norms were followed,” Manoj Tiwari was quoted as saying by new agency ANI.The agency reported that Tiwari played a game of cricket at an academy in Sheikhpura of Sonipat district in violation of social distancing and government guidelines for the fourth phase of national lockdown.Tiwari, as cited above, is relying on a government notification issued on May 17 which said sports complexes and stadia could reopen but spectators were not allowed.“Sports complexes and stadia will be permitted to open; however, spectators will not be allowed,” said the MHA notification. It was widely interpreted as permission for athletes in Olympic sports to resume training without spectators. However, it was not said explicitly if any sporting activity could resume in these facilities without spectators.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The same notification also listed sports activities among mass activities that were not allowed to resume yet.After the notification, it was reported that BCCI could consider allowing players to resume training. India cricketer Shardul Thakur became the first to resume training on Saturday, however, it is said to have miffed the cricket board since Thakur had allegedly not taken its permission.Also Read: BCCI miffed with Shardul Thakur for training outdoors: reportSeveral reports said Tiwari did not wear a mask while playing and was also seen taking selfies with other people present at the ground.Tiwari’s move has also come under the scanner since Delhi’s borders with Haryana are not open due to fears that the rising number of coronavirus cases in Delhi could lead to a spike in Haryana as well. A video posted on Tiwari’s twitter account shows him playing cricket at a facility with spectators watching. However, it is not clear if the video was shot at the Sonipat game which is under question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-bjp-chief-manoj-tiwari-cites-mha-order-defends-playing-cricket-during-lockdown/story-ZTGJLA3QjFMypBrwlVtXfJ.html
25-05-2020||India||Worst locust attack in 26 years: All about the latest threat amid Covid-19 outbreak||Standing crops and vegetables in at least five states in the country face a major threat as swarms of locust have been reported a month in advance.The Union environment ministry warned in a statement last week that locust swarms have entered Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. It said Rajasthan is the most affected state and added the swarm has entered the country earlier than expected.Uttar Pradesh has also reported the attacks and there is an alert for Maharashtra as well as Delhi.The United Nations (UN) has warned that armies of locusts swarming across continents pose a “severe risk” to India’s agriculture this year.What are locusts?Locusts are the oldest migratory pests in the world, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).These insects differ from ordinary grasshoppers in their ability to change behaviour and form swarms that can migrate over large distances. The most devastating of all locust species is the Desert Locust (schistocerca gregaria), according to the FAO.The locusts, which are considered to be among the most dangerous pests known to humanity, reproduce fast — 20-fold within three months — the FAO experts noted.An adult locust can eat quantity equal to its weight daily, and just a single square kilometre of the swarm can contain up to 80 million adults, they said.Locusts can fly up to 150km daily and a one square km swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day.What has pushed the outbreak?The recent locust outbreak along the India-Pakistan border may have been driven by the longer-than-usual monsoon across the region, and frequent cyclones in the Indian Ocean, scientists say.“The current locust outbreak is the biggest in 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia, 26 years in India, 70 years in Kenya,” Keith Cressman, locust forecasting officer at FAO told PTI.“The outbreak started after heavy amounts of rains over east Africa and the Arabian Peninsula,” Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune added.Koll noted heavy rains, which drove the locust outbreak, occurred due to intense storm activity sourced from the Arabian Sea during the last two seasons. “Heavy rain triggers the growth of vegetation in arid areas where desert locusts can then grow and breed,” he said.Koll explained that recently climate change accentuated the phenomenon called the “Indian Ocean Dipole”, with warmer than usual waters to its west, and cooler waters to its east.“On top of that, the rising temperatures due to global warming made the Western Indian Ocean particularly warm,” he said.Cressman said the current locust invasion in India by an unprecedented number of swarms originated in southern Iran from their breeding in spring last year.“Summer breeding along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border was much higher than normal due to the swarm invasion and the monsoon rains lasting one month longer than normal, allowing up to three generations of breeding,” Cressman said.What is the government doing?Authorities across the country have said they have stepped up vigil, deployed drones to detect their movement and held talks with Pakistan, the most likely gateway for an invasion by the insects, on ways to minimise the damage.The government is also considering importing equipment from the UK, apart from deploying drones, satellite-derived tools, special fire-tenders and sprayers at pre-identified border locations.What’s the latest status?On Monday, locusts were seen flying over Jaipur even as officials of the agriculture department said the swarm over the city was on its way to Dausa. Officials said the swarm that flew over Jaipur city came from Nagaur.More than half of Rajasthan’s 33 districts are affected by invasion by these insects, which are traditionally known to be attacking western Rajasthan districts bordering Pakistan.Swarms of locusts arrived in Malhargarh area of Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur district on Sunday.“Scientists from central locust team and agricultural science department conducted an exercise and removed around 60% of them by spraying,” said Manoj Pushp, Mandsaur District Magistrate.The Jhansi district administration in Uttar Pradesh has directed fire brigade to keep its vehicle ready with chemicals following a sudden movement of a swarm of locusts.“The villagers along with the common public has been told to inform the control room about the movement. The locusts will go places where there is green grass or greenery. Hence, details about the movement at such places must be shared,” Andra Vamsi, Jhansi’s district magistrate, said. Kamal Katiyar, the deputy director of the agriculture department, said the swarm of locusts, which is moving, is small in size.“We have got the news that nearly 2.5 to a 3-kilometre long swarm of locusts has entered the country. A team has come from Kota (Rajasthan) to tackle the locusts,” Katiyar said.At present, the locust swarm is at Bangra Magarpur in Jhansi. “Spraying of insecticides will be done in the night,” Katiyar said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worst-locust-attack-in-26-years-all-about-the-latest-threat-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-HCSl5S2bvqQT3mIeWijOsL.html

25-05-2020||India||MP farmer ostracised for failing to perform rites after son’s death during lockdown||A farmer in Bundelkhand region has filed a complaint with police accusing members of his community of ostracising him for failing to perform religious rites following the death of his son. The complainant said he couldn’t perform the 13th day religious ritual first due to the Janata Curfew and later due to lockdown restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19.Brijgopal Patel, a resident of Khajwa village in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhatarpur district, said in his complaint filed at sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP) of Rajnagar town on Saturday,that his 15-year-old son died after drowning in an under-construction well in his agriculture field on March 9.“I couldn’t organise the terhavi (The 13th day ritual after death) due to Janta curfew and later lockdown and curfew restrictions as I feared that it would mean a large gathering of invitees and everyone including my family and I would be exposed to the threat of being infected with coronavirus. However, a panchayat was convened by other community members at the village at the end of March and a diktat was announced that my family would remain boycotted till I organise the ritual”, Patel said in his complaint.The farmer alleged that as per the diktat, he and his family can’t fetch water from the village well and they can’t take part in any auspicious programme in any other community member’s family.Sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP), Rajnagar town, Manmohan Baghel said, “I have instructed Rajnagar police station to investigate the charges. Statements of the complainant and other villagers have been recorded. Action will be taken based on the findings of the investigation.”Rajnagar janpad panchayat chief executive officer (CEO) Pratipal Singh Bagri said, “Ostracising anyone is a wrong practice. I constituted a team of janpad panchayat personnel after coming to know about the matter to help the farmer and take action against the guilty persons.”There has been a lockdown since March 24 across the country to curb the spread of coronavirus pandemic. It has been extended thrice during the past two months and is now slated to end on May 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-farmer-ostracised-for-failing-to-perform-rites-for-dead-son-during-lockdown/story-QbE2xzQDHHMISbsfEAPVGP.html
25-05-2020||India||Uttarakhand youth are saying thank you to Covid warriors at hospitals, police posts with music||Expressing gratitude towards front line health, sanitation and security personnel, two members of a Delhi-based rock band ‘Nazm’ are giving live musical performances before Covid warriors in Uttarakhand, appreciating their contribution to saving lives while risking their own in these testing times.From hospitals, medical centres to police stations, the rock band members, Raghav Raja, vocalist and Rohit Joshi, guitarist--who hail from Haridwar-- are letting the Covid warriors know with their music that the country is in their debt.Stuck at their homes since March-end when the lockdown began, Raghav Raja and Rohit Joshi decided to motivate and provide some musical solace to the frontline workers by penning patriotic and motivational songs. Their Rock band ‘Nazm’ specializes in Sufi, Bollywood, folk and alternative rock music“We have performed in various Indian cities as well as in foreign countries like Dubai but it’s a unique feeling performing for health, sanitation and police workers who are actually a solid wall between us and coronavirus. Smile and appreciation we receive from these personnel is the best reward for us. We know they rarely get time out for any recreational activity as Covid-19 has severely affected the whole of humanity for the past three months,” said Raghav and Rohit.Appreciating their initiative, Haridwar’s chief medical officer Dr Saroj Naithani said, “We allowed them to perform as their intention is noble and we are getting good response from the health personnel.”“From showering of petals, garlanding, clapping to being praised through musical performances by these youths, we all feel motivated and get the inner strength to carry on our war against the coronavirus pandemic,” said Dr Saroj Naithani.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Raghav and Rohit’s initiative is also getting appreciation and backing from their families and neighbours in Haridwar’s Vivek Vihar Colony, where they live.“From local devotional song evenings, enactment of Ramleela, performances in marriages to social and cultural events, both Raghav and Rohit, over the years have become known faces in our city. They are affectionately called ‘2-R’. We feel proud when officials and health personnel applaud their musical performances,” said Anusha, Raghav’s sister, who herself plays tabla and harmonium.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Senthyl Aboodai Krishan, who gave permission to the duo to perform at police stations, said such sentiments for the people fighting the epidemic is a good sign for the society and it motivates and encourages the professionals at the front line to even risk their lives in the line of duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-youth-are-saying-thank-you-to-covid-warriors-at-hospitals-police-posts-with-music/story-99oCU5fT9Z193WzXcxGFUK.html

The film set, a replica of a church, erected near a temple at Aluva in Kerala’s central Ernakulam district, was demolished on Sunday night by a group of people owing allegiance to AHA and later they posted a video of the attack on social media.The under-production Malayalam film, Minnal Murali, was set to be released in August, but will be delayed because of the lockdown restrictions, which were imposed in end-March to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and also because of Sunday’s attack.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have condemned the attack and sought strict action against the perpetrators.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said action would be taken against those responsible for the “despicable act”. Many bodies related to the film industry also condemned the attack.The film’s director, Basil Joseph, said they had obtained the permission from the panchayat, the temple body, and the irrigation department before erecting the set to shoot the concluding scenes of the movie, starring actor Tovino Thomas in the lead role.“We have heard of movie sets being vandalised by religious fanatics in some parts of north India. Sad, now it is happening here in Kerala,” Tovino wrote in a social media post.Locals said some fringe outfits had expressed reservation over setting up the set, that too a replica of the church, near a temple. Police said assailants have been identified and they would be arrested soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/film-set-vandalised-by-right-wing-group-kerala-cm-promises-strong-action/story-sUdVmktLtSgQ0usTMNEmvO.html
25-05-2020||India||Army Chief Naravane’s 2012 prophecy on Chinese strategy rings true in Ladakh sector||Back in the autumn of 2012, a senior faculty member at the Mhow-based Army War College published a paper on the China’s war zone campaign (WZC). Beijing would, the army officer argued, seek to coerce smaller adversaries into acceding to China’s demand through graded threat of force or actual use of force till its ends are met.The officer, then Brigadier Manoj Mukund Naravane, wrote that the political objective of this Chinese concept is unveiled by “occupation of certain un-held tract of land or high value targets’. This would be done through elite forces.The first would be the domination-cum-deterrence (DCD) phase where the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would focus on building up its presence in the territory in question to deter the enemy. In the second phase, Gaining Initiative by Striking First (GISF), it would deploy rapid reaction units to strike first to wrest the initiative from the enemy. The last stage is the Quick Battle Quick Resolution where the PLA would use a dedicated division level force. But the PLA, the senior army officer said in his seminal paper published in Scholar Warrior, a journal published by the Delhi-based think tank Center For Land Warfare Studies, expects to achieve its objective in the first two phases.As the Indian Army Chief now, General Manoj Mukund Naravane is faced with a WZC situation along the 3,488 kilometre long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with PLA opening multiple fronts in western and eastern sectors while the world including India battles the Covid-19 pandemic that has its origins in central China’s Wuhan city. The Chinese aggressive manoeuvres also entail the PLA moving support elements in depth areas of eastern Ladakh.Also read | China’s tactical play in Ladakh isn’t just about the boundaryAlthough Gen Naravane didn’t refer to it in his 2012 paper, national security planners say the key to the Chinese WZC concept is deception coupled with state of the art intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.The top army officer was clear that the only way to counter the WZC strategy is to thwart Chinese designs in the initial two, DCD and GISF, stages.Beijing did have the initial advantage when it moved soldiers to Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh. The Chinese army had built roads right up to their claim line and could move in troops quickly, once it decided to activate them.This advantage now stands neutralised with Indian force levels building up over the past weeks. The Indian Army is also staring at the aggressor with troops holding their positions and not allowing the Red Army to brow beat them at Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso.Top government officials told Hindustan Times that the security establishment did realise that India’s northern borders would remain turbulent for some time to come after New Delhi decided to upgrade its border infrastructure in 2014.For decades, India had been debating the extent and pace of creating border infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control with China. Beijing, meanwhile, kept building railway tracks and roads.Also read | Experts raise concern over Ladakh face-offThis meant that the Chinese PLA patrols along the border often went uncontested.This started to change after India matching up the build up to a degree and earmarking its claim line through regular patrols. And this friction is expected to continue unless both sides exchange maps of their respective positions in both the eastern and the western sector.The situation in the middle sector is far better after both sides exchanged maps in 2002. So both sides now know the exact disputed territory. The western sector maps were shared but never exchanged at the behest of Chinese; the eastern sector maps were not even shared.While China openly covets Arunachal Pradesh as its territory, its long term game in eastern Ladakh could be to cut through Galwan-Murgo axis to provide an all weather alternative to the Karakoram highway, which enters Pakistan through Khunjerab Pass and not Karakoram pass north of Indian positions of Daulet Beg Oldi.However, with the Indian Army digging into its positions to face the aggressor, the long drawn out mobilization may not work for the PLA as the law of diminishing returns comes into play like in the protracted 1979 Sino-Vietnam war. Status quo ante is the only viable option as it leaves both sides with a win-win situation.Also read | China to evacuate citizens from India amid pandemic, rising border tension||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-naravane-s-2012-prophecy-on-chinese-strategy-rings-true-in-ladakh-sector/story-OsfNk1vmIWOQHHNGHGzHcI.html

However, the much improved relations with Bangladesh meant that the two sides exchanged sweets on the holiest festival of Muslims on Monday.India and Pakistan’s relations have rarely been normal but have worsened from time to time including the current streak of tensions that peaked after Pulwama terror attack on February 14, 2019 that killed at least 40 CRPF personnel. India held a Pakistan based terror group responsible for the attack and carried out air strikes to destroy a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror hideout in Pakistani territory of Balakot. That led to a dogfight between the two countries’ fighter planes. The tensions only escalated after India’s decision to abrogate Article 370-- which granted Jammu and Kashmir special status-- and bifurcate the state into two union territories. India has since then accused Pakistan of trying to push even more militants into Jammu and Kashmir to destabilize the region and attract international attention.Incidents of cross-border terrorism haven’t ceased even as nations around the world are busy fighting the coronavirus pandemic. The Indian military establishment has said that the Pakistan is now pushing a greater number of militants through its launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC).The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19In the view of the situation, the exchange of sweets did not take place at any location along the India-Pakistan international border from Jammu to Gujarat, the officials quoted by PTI said.According to the official, the BSF had gone ahead and offered sweets during Diwali last year as well as on its raising day-December 1- and also on the Republic Day on January 26, but it was not met with reciprocation by the Pakistani side.However, the BSF exchanged sweets with its Bangladeshi counterpart-- Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) -- all along the eastern front. India and Bangladesh share a 4,096-km-long international border.“BSF and BGB share a very cordial relationship. Both the countries share a similar culture, traditions and festivals.The warmth and bonding between the countries and border-guarding forces reflect during several occasions, when they share the joy of festivals, including during Eid,” a statement issued by the south Bengal frontier of the BSF quoted by the PTI said.The south Bengal frontier guards 903 km of the India-Bangladesh border.“BSF troops up to the border post level conveyed their best wishes to their companions of Bangladesh. The pleasantries for BGB headquarters were shared at Petrapole (land-border crossing in West Bengal),” the statement added.The BSF, during these events, convey its best wishes and good health to its partner, the BGB, with a hope of a better future ahead, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-s-exchange-of-sweets-on-eid-reflects-india-s-current-ties-with-pak-bangladesh/story-htZ9HMoR92ESflUlIzgDLI.html

25-05-2020||India||How Rajasthan forest department created jobs in tendu leaf collection during Covid-19 lockdown||Rajasthan forest department created jobs for local communities in Jhalawar as it sold 15 extra units for collection of tendu leaves to locals in open bidding during the coronavirus lockdown, officials said.For the collection of tendu (Diospyros melanoxylon) leaves, forest areas are divided into units which are auctioned between December and January. Rajasthan has 167 units in 14 districts, including 45 in Jhalawar. Only 69 of them were sold during the bids. For the remaining, the divisional forest officers (DFOs) call for open bids. The state will earn Rs 7.5 crore as royalty from these units.Tendu leaf is used to wrap bidis. Leaves of many other plants are also used to as bidis in different parts of the country but traders said the texture, flavour and workability of tendu leaves are unmatchable.In Jhalawar forest areas, merchants from Tonk, Karauli, Madhya Pradesh, Maharasthra and Gujarat come for collection of leaves and bring specialised labour from their native places.Also read: Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan cross 7000-mark, death toll 163This time, due to the lockdown restrictions, this was not possible. Also, there was an objection from the local public representatives, who said labourers from outside may bring the virus with them and infect locals.“We held dialogues with the representatives and merchants to find solutions. We got the merchants to give priority to local community in collection of leaves,” said Jhalawar DFO Hemant Singh.“We also encouraged the local representative to take up the units as the collection was less in other states such as Chhatisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha due to the lockdown and untimely showers,” he added.In Jhalawar, 15 more units were sold in an open bidding during the lockdown. For the first time, more than 90% of people, labourers and supervisors, involved in collection in the district, were locals, including many first-timers. “This will make the locals self-reliant and will be beneficial for the local economy,” the DFO said.Singh said that more than 2,500 families from 240 villages are benefitting from these efforts which have led to the generation of extra 75,000 man days. About 50-60 labourers can work in one unit of an average size. They collect leaves from the forest in the morning and stack them in bundles of 50 each. These bundles are then given to the unit holders. Payment – one rupee per bundle – is made immediately and in cash. One family can make around 500 bundles in a day.“For merchants from outside, our staff, especially rangers, helped them in coordination with the district administration in medical screening, arranging logistics and labourers. This encouraged more traders to come to Jhalawar who were initially reluctant because of the curbs,” Singh said.The officer said that people in villages are happy as it’s like a small event for them every year and everyone is involved. “During this time there is no work in the fields. Unlike in MNREGS, here we get instant cash which can be used to buy seeds and preparing fields for Kharif crops,” said Ramlal, a small farmer in Mandawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-rajasthan-forest-department-created-jobs-in-tendu-leaf-collection-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-0eSkHJGASwLDi1k3rOwQqO.html
25-05-2020||India||In 2am tweet, Piyush Goyal seeks trains’ list from Maharashtra. Sena replies||A war of words has broken out between Union Minister for Railways and Commerce & Industry Piyush Goyal and Shiv Sena member of Rajya Sabha Sanjay Raut over an alleged 50% less number of Shramik Special trains being provided daily to ferry stranded migrant workers out of Maharashtra, which has reported the maximum number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases in the country. On Sunday, hours after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the rail authorities have managed to provide only 50% of the trains required to ferry stranded migrant workers back to their home states, Goyal tweeted that they could arrange 125 trains on conditions that they don’t run “empty” and also sought a list of passengers.Earlier, the CM had said that though he had requested the rail authorities to run 80 Shramik Special trains daily, only 40 are operating.Goyal put out a flurry of tweets in response to Thackeray’s plea and sought various passenger details such as their boarding stations, medical certificates, etc., over the next hour. Later, he again tweeted that the Maharashtra government has been unable to provide the required information even after one and a half hours. He cited that planning 125 trains would take time and the rail authorities would be unable to accede to the state government’s request unless they have full details.Raut sprang to the CM’s defence and took on Goyal.“Maharashtra government has submitted a list to the rail authorities. There is only one request to Piyush Goyalji that the trains should reach their destinations. The train going to Gorakhpur should not end up in Odisha,” Raut said.He took a potshot at Goyal and was referring to last week’s incident where hundreds of migrant labourers travelling to their native Uttar Pradesh were instead taken to Rourkela in Odisha. Later, the rail authorities claimed that it was a planned diversion due to congestion on some routes.On Monday, too, Goyal kept up the heat on the state government.“Where is the list for 125 trains from Maharashtra? As of 2am, I received a list of only 46 trains of which five are to West Bengal and Odisha, which cannot operate due to cyclone Amphan. We are notifying only 41 trains for Monday, despite being prepared for 125 !!!,” he tweeted.Raut replied to Goyal via a tweet. “Piyushji, what list was sought for Nagpur-Udhampur train that left on May 14. Please share what efforts have been made to arrange trains first and then to gather passengers? Now, which list are you seeking? Don’t forget that you represent Maharashtra in the Rajya Sabha.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/war-of-words-between-piyush-goyal-and-sanjay-raut-over-shramik-trains-from-maharashtra/story-oiNXxyVdSTpCSKgvMWCyOJ.html

One of them has around Rs 2 crore and the remaining amount is in another.“The trust has received donations of around Rs 4.70 crore till date. Once the construction work of the Ram Mandir begins, donations will increase,” a member of the trust, who did not want to be named, said.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has said donations made to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra are eligible for deduction under Section 80G of Income Tax Act, 1961. “The trust and the VHP are optimistic that once the coronavirus scare subsides and the bhoomi pujan at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya takes place for the construction of Ram Mandir, the focus will again shift to the temple,” Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was expected to take part in the bhumi pujan or ground laying ceremony in Ayodhya in April but the ceremony was deferred due to the coronavirus pandemic.Now, the much-awaited ceremony is expected only after the lockdown is lifted and the virus scare subsides.The trust also has Rs 12 crore as fixed deposit in another bank, which it received from the former receiver of the Ram Janmabhoomi after its formation. It has also received some gold ornaments from the receiver and Rs 1 crore from the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, which spearheaded the Ram Mandir movement across the country since the 1990s.However, these have not yet been transferred in the two current accounts of the new trust.The Supreme Court had appointed divisional commissioner of Ayodhya, formerly known as Faizabad, as the receiver of the Ram Janmabhoomi. However, after the formation of the new trust, divisional commissioner MP Agarwal handed over the charge to Ayodhya Naresh Vimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra, a member of the trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-pandemic-hits-donations-to-ayodhya-s-ram-mandir-trust/story-q1GLdH9ZGdcjJBx7lzchAN.html

The products under reference have no relevance to the procurement being made by the Central Government,” an official statement from the ministry of health stated on Monday.While the statement doesn’t mention the reports in particular that made the claim, however, a few in the past days have questioned the quality of the PPEs supplied locally to medical professionals in Ghaziabad. A prominent Hindi daily had claimed that some new kits produced and procured locally were found to be worn out and torn in places. It blamed the poor quality of kits to be among the reasons for the government doctors and other healthcare professionals catching the disease in the district. The UP government then decided to ban local procurement. Another report had cited complaints regarding poor quality PPE kits by some surgeons in Ludhiana Civil Hospital.The ministry of health in its statement said that the central government had cleared PPE manufacturers and suppliers after applying stringent quality testing standards set by the ministry of textiles.“HLL Lifecare Limited (HLL), the procuring agency of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, is procuring PPE coveralls from manufacturers/suppliers only after getting their coveralls tested and approved by one of the eight labs nominated by the Ministry of Textiles (MoT) for testing the same. It is only after their products qualify in the test prescribed by the technical committee (JMG) of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, that they are procured,” the ministry explained.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19It added that random sampling of the supplies is also being made and the company that fails to meet the standards is being disqualified for any future procurement.“All the States/UTs have been asked to ensure procurement which is being carried out at their level after following the prescribed testing for PPEs from MoT nominated labs. In addition, manufacturers who have got their products qualified from these labs are also being on-boarded on Government e-Marketplace (GeM),” the statement adds.The ministry said the information about qualified and approved manufacturers and suppliers was available on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) for the states and the private sector to use.The ministry further pointed out that there was no shortage of safety equipment and essentials as the country had ramped up its domestic production capacity of PPEs and N95 masks and the requirements of the States/UTs are being sufficiently met.“Today, the country is producing more than 3 lakh PPEs and N95 masks per day. States/UTs as well as Central Institutions have been provided with around 111.08 lakh N-95 masks and around 74.48 lakh Personal Protective Equipment (PPE),” said the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-distances-from-bad-quality-ppes-says-its-procuring-from-tested-suppliers/story-DsKm5GU9Uhf3h7Nxc7oFWL.html

But due to lack of modern and systematic way of farming, farmers fail to derive the expected profit. In a move to make lac cultivation profitable for farmers, the forest department while suggesting the CM to include lac farming under agriculture and provide opportunities to lac growing farmers to avail loans through agricultural cooperative committees like other farmers, had requested him to accept the proposal sent in this regard,” said a government press release.Lac is the resinous secretion of a number of species of lac insects. Thousands of lac insects colonise the branches of the host trees and secrete the resinous pigment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-cultivation-to-be-given-status-of-agriculture-chhattisgarh-cm-baghel/story-CbRK72ebxeFEntSJONtf6I.html

Many trees were uprooted in the gale blocking roads, puncturing water supply pipes and bringing down electricity and telephone lines,” Seth said in a statement.Falling trees have also severely damaged the campus boundary wall in a number of places as well as a few buildings.The gale-force winds caused windows and doors in some buildings to blow out and panels of the solar water heating system installed on rooftops to blow away, she added.“Fortunately, no-one was injured during the cyclone. Our campus is known for its scenic lakes, and our water management systems worked well to ensure that none of the lakes overflowed so that we had no flooding in spite of the torrential rain. Unlike many parts of Kolkata, our advance planning ensured we had no electricity outage,” the IIM director said. She said numerous measures were undertaken to restore many essential services to the campus.“We have every expectation that the “Joka Spirit” that the Institute prides itself upon will inspire all stakeholders to participate in rebuilding this great Institute to showcase its pristine and scenic glory,” she said.Seth added that most of IIM, Calcutta’s students are away from campus after they secured jobs during the placement season or are doing summer internships after completing their first year. “Our MBA admissions process is continuing with offers being made to prospective entering students but with delays due to telecom network outages in Kolkata. Online classes for our Executive MBA and Visionary Leadership in Manufacturing have also been disrupted due to these outages, and will resume as soon as connectivity is restored,” she said.At least 85 people were killed in the state and lakhs rendered homeless as Cyclone Amphan cut a path of destruction through half-a-dozen districts of the state last week, flattening houses, uprooting thousands of trees and swamping low-lying areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-wreaks-havoc-on-iim-calcutta-campus/story-VJAkt8cpusGAYJqmvz8goJ.html

The UP government will stand with them wherever they work, whether in UP, other states or other countries,” Adityanath said at the webinar.Chairing a review meeting on Covid-19 and the lockdown earlier in the day, the chief minister asked the officers concerned to prepare a draft outline for the migration commission.The chief minister also said that his government had facilitated the ‘safe and honourable’ return of 2.3 million (23 lakh) migrant workers so far and it would stay committed to bringing back all those who wanted to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mns-chief-raj-thackeray-hits-back-at-yogi-adityanath-for-seek-permission-for-migrant-workers-remark/story-uHWf1vnipuL9AUOQSFQGnM.html
25-05-2020||India||With 103 Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, Odisha records biggest single-day spike||Odisha’s tally of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) stood at 1,438 after 103 new cases, in the biggest single-day surge, were reported from across the state in the last 24 hours, reports said on Monday.Most of the Covid-19 cases were reported from Deogarh district, followed by Kendrapara at 15, Jagatsinghpura at 10 and eight from Bhadrak districts, news agency ANI said.Dr Jayant Panda, the spokesperson of Odisha’s health and welfare department, had said last week that the state’s tally may surpass 10,000-mark by the end of June due to the return of migrant workers from Covid-19 hotspots.The surge in numbers come after the state government on Sunday announced a series of relaxations in inter-state and intra-state transportation mainly buses, taxis, auto-rickshaws and two-wheelers, making it easier for people to travel.According to the standard operating procedure (SOP), intra-state movement of two-wheelers, private vehicles, auto-rickshaws, official vehicles and taxis, including cabs by aggregators like Ola, Uber etc, have been allowed except in Covid-19 containment zones. Four wheelers and auto rickshaws can take up to two passengers apart from the driver.Intra-state and city buses can ply with passengers not more than their seating capacity while inter-state buses can ply as per the agreement with neighbouring states. All passengers travelling across the state by any mode of transport will compulsorily have to wear face masks and people with visible symptoms will not be permitted to travel.The relaxation of the lockdown is expected to result in a surge of cases as people will come in contact with each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-103-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours-odisha-records-biggest-single-day-spike/story-CDt4ifExcpzSIH89T104OP.html
25-05-2020||India||New chopper drone may be deployed along India border: Chinese state media||China’s newly-developed helicopter-drone that made its maiden flight last week may be deployed on the Sino-India border, state media reports said on Monday.The AR500C unmanned helicopter is equipped to carry out fire strikes and disrupt electronic circuitry of its target at heights above 15,000 feet, state media reported.“The test flight of the AR500C came at a time when China-India border tensions have been flaring up, as Chinese border defence troops have bolstered border control measures,” Global Times, the tabloid run by the ruling communist party said in a news report.The tabloid claimed that the Chinese action was a response to India’s recent, illegal construction of defence facilities across the border into Chinese territory in the Galwan Valley region.New Delhi has already dismissed China’s allegations, saying, in fact, Chinese soldiers were hindering patrolling by the Indian armed forces.“Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across the LAC in the western [Ladakh] sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate,” external affairs ministry spokesperson, Anurag Srivastava said last week.Srivastava added: “All Indian activities are entirely on the Indian side of the LAC. In fact, it is [the] Chinese side that has recently undertaken activity hindering India’s normal patrolling patterns.”State media reports about the new drone and its deployment are part of the aggressive narrative put forward by China that it’s India, which is to blame for the soaring tension at the border in Sikkim and Ladakh sectors.China’s state media arms had been similarly aggressive and anti-India during the Doklam (Donglang) stand-off in Bhutan in 2017.Observers say it won’t be very surprising if there are reports of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) carrying out military drills on a “plateau” near a “border” in the days ahead.“Capable of conducting missions including reconnaissance, communication relay, electronic disruption and fire strike at high altitude, this versatile and easy-to-operate drone could help safeguard China’s southwestern borders with India,” analysts told the tabloid.Developed by the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the unmanned helicopter successfully made its maiden flight at an AVIC base in Poyang, east China’s Jiangxi province, in which it conducted several maneuvers including hovering, horizontal and vertical moves, another leading state media arm, China Central Television (CCTV) reported over the weekend.“As China’s first unmanned helicopter designed to fly in plateau areas, the AR500C can take off at an elevation of 5,000 meters and has a ceiling of 6,700 meters. It has an endurance of five hours, maximum speed of 170 kilometers an hour and a maximum takeoff weight of 500 kilograms,” the GT report said.The Chinese military currently operates the Z-8G, China’s first large transport helicopter, which also focuses on plateau operations.It can take off from nearly 15000 feet above sea level and has a ceiling of nearly 20000 feet and lift troops and supplies to high-altitude areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-chopper-drone-may-be-deployed-along-india-border-chinese-state-media/story-DQUUa0f1flgrPQYDo06oII.html
25-05-2020||India||Assam’s Covid-19 tally doubles from 200 to past 400 in just 4 days||Assam’s tally of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crossed the 400-mark with the detection of 35 new cases on Monday morning, officials said.The state has seen a sudden surge in the number of cases in the past few days and it took just four days for the figure to double from the 200-mark to reach 428 with the new cases on Monday.Assam recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 31 when a 52-year-old cancer patient was found infected with the virus. It took another 37 days for the figure to reach 50 on May 7 and just 10 days to double and reach the 100 figure mark on May 17.The figure doubled again to reach 200 cases four days later on May 21 and it crossed 400 cases in another 4 days. The latest surge in positive cases has happened in past 7-10 days since the ban on inter-state movement was lifted on May 4.Of the infections so far, more than 300 cases are of people who have returned to the state by roads and railways in the past three weeks. Till Sunday afternoon, nearly 60,000 people had entered Assam from other states in the region and across the country.“The surge has happened in the past seven days and hence our recovery rate has dropped to 16% in comparison to the national figure of 41%,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.All of the state’s 33 districts have now recorded Cvovid-19 cases. Hojai with 86 cases leads the tally and Dhemaji, which recorded its first patient on Monday, is at the bottom with one case.“Though there has been an increase, one positive aspect is that almost 90% of our total cases are of people who are in quarantine. We have adopted a policy of ruthless quarantine of 14 days for all returnees and it has helped prevent community outbreak of the disease,” said Sarma.A community surveillance campaign by the state government covered 25,000 villages in the state and recorded around 23,000 cases of people with fever. Tests conducted on a section of them who showed Covid-19 like symptoms have come negative for all.Sarma mentioned that a pro-active approach adopted in the last two months has helped Assam put an adequate infrastructure in place and at present, the state has the capacity to treat nearly 5,000 Covid-19 patients.With the resumption of domestic flights from Monday, Assam is expected to get nearly 2,000 passengers daily and it would put additional burden on quarantine and testing facilities.Barring few exceptions, the state has made 14 days institutional and home quarantine mandatory for all returnees including those who would be arriving by flights.“There could be some issues in handling passengers at Guwahati airport on the first day. But that would get streamlined in the next few days,” Sarma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-covid-19-tally-doubles-from-200-to-past-400-in-just-4-days/story-T0IvyUO5zrLa2bqKonK1PL.html

25-05-2020||India||‘Does virus know’: SC questions full capacity flights for stranded Indians||Air India may operate non-scheduled relief and rescue flights on international routes with middle seat booking till June 6, the Supreme Court ordered on Monday, partially modifying the Bombay high court order of May 22 which had mandated the national carrier to keep middle seats vacant while flying home Indians stranded abroad.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde extended the liberty to Air India to fill up middle seats of the rescue flights after taking into account difficulties which passengers, including families, could face if the centre seat passengers are offloaded.“We are of the considered view that the petitioner, Air India, should be allowed to operate the non-scheduled flights with the middle seats booking upto June 6,” the top court said.Air India and the central government had rushed to the apex court on Sunday seeking a stay on the Bombay high court order.The top court sent the matter back to the Bombay high court to pass an appropriate interim order on June 2, which is the next date of hearing of the case in the high court. Air India will have to comply with the interim order of the Bombay high court while operating non-scheduled flights after June 6.“However, after that (June 6) Air India will operate non-scheduled flights in accordance with the interim order to be passed by the Bombay High Court”, the top court said.During the hearing on Monday, the apex court was critical of Air India’s logic to operate international flights without keeping centre seats vacant.“You should be worried about the health of citizens and not about the health of commercial airlines,” CJI Bobde told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for Air India and the central government.The court also ordered that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is free to alter any norms during the pendency of the matter in the interest of public health and safety of the passengers rather than commercial considerations.The petitioner before the high court, Deven Yogesh Kanani, who is an Air India pilot himself, had pointed out that operating flights without keeping middle seats vacant was in violation of the circular issued by the DGCA on March 23.Air India had contended that the circular of March 23 applies only to scheduled domestic flights and not non-scheduled international flights. Further, it was also argued by Air India that the March 23 circular has been superseded by a circular issued on May 22 as per which there is no express mandate to keep the middle seats vacant. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta impressed upon the Supreme Court the difficulties which passengers may face if the middle seat bookings are cancelled. He told the court that one-third of the passengers who are expected to be brought in by the non-scheduled flights would be left stranded in foreign airports if the high court order was not stayed.“According to Mr Mehta, this (Bombay high court order) has resulted in a lot of anxiety and difficulties arising from want of proper shelter, money, etc, at the foreign airports. Moreover, in some cases, the travel plan of families who were travelling together has been disrupted because those in the families who had middle seats have to be offloaded,” the Supreme Court noted in its order.The central government also pointed out the difficulties in convincing airport authorities of foreign nations to offload passengers based on an order passed by a court in India. Besides, it was also submitted that keeping the middle seat unoccupied will not help much to prevent the transmission of coronavirus.“How can you say it will not affect anyone?

More than half of Rajasthan’s 33 districts are affected by invasion by these crop-munching insects.Officials said the swarm that flew over Jaipur city came from Nagaur.“It settled in Sarna Chod and Sanchoti villages in Sanganer tehsil on Sunday night. We were able to control around 30% of the 5km-by-1.5km swarm,” BR Kadwa, deputy director of the agriculture department in Jaipur, said.The remaining insects came to Jaipur city on Monday morning, making people wonder how locusts, which are traditionally known to be attacking western Rajasthan districts bordering Pakistan, could come to the state capital.Locals circulated videos and photos of locust swarms on WhatsApp groups.The swarm, Kadwa said, came from Deedwana in Nagaur and entered Jaipur through Kishangarh Renwal and Jobner.“We carried out the control operations in Jhotwara panchayat samiti area on Saturday night. Then it flew to Vidhyadhar Nagar and Shastri Nagar,” Kadwa said.The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Desert Locust Information Service bulletin says that locusts can fly up to 150km in a day and a one-square-kilometre swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people, in terms of weight, in a single day.“The swarm has crossed Jaipur city and moved towards Dausa,” said Om Prakash, agriculture commissioner.A locust outbreak was reported in Rajasthan in May last year after a gap of 26 years and the attack continued until February this year, damaging crop on at least 670,000 hectares across 12 districts, according to the agriculture department. The state put the loss due to the invasion to about Rs 1,000 crore.The Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) of the Union ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare warned of another attack in May-June this year. Sure enough, an attack was reported in Ganganagar, a north Rajasthan district bordering Pakistan, on May 11. Last year, the swarms were first spotted in Jaisalmer, another bordering town.The United Nations (UN) has warned that armies of locusts swarming across continents pose a “severe risk” to India’s agriculture this year. Authorities across the country have said they have stepped up vigil, deployed drones to detect their movement and held talks with Pakistan, the most likely gateway for an invasion by the insects, on ways to minimise the damage.Uttar Pradesh’s agriculture department on Sunday informed Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and bordering districts of the state about the possibility of locust attack and asked them to take preventive steps accordingly.On Sunday, swarms of locusts arrived in Malhargarh area of Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locusts-swarm-in-rajasthan-s-jaipur-move-towards-dausa/story-l7zpI8Ag6cy9ydd4QhkIpI.html

Over 3,000 active cases are currently being treated at home. “Patients with mild symptoms or the asymptomatic ones are treated at home and are not admitted in hospitals.

He said in the past week, the national capital reported around fresh 3,500 Covid-19 cases while nearly 1,500 patients have recovered. “Fresh cases are being reported but patients are also recovering and going home,” he said. “As many as 1,750 Covid-19 patients were admitted in hospitals on May 17. The figure has risen to 2,000 at present. Only 250 new patients have occupied beds across various hospitals in one week,” he said.Kejriwal said that due to most cases being mild or asymptomatic, the load of Covid-19 patients in hospitals is not severe. “However, we are prepared if there is a sudden spike in severe cases of coronavirus patients,” he said.  Of over 13,000 coronavirus patients in Delhi, Kejriwal said nearly half have recovered and half of them are still getting treated.

The court was hearing a petition filed by the Centre and Air India after Bombay high court questioned why the airline was not keeping the middle seats vacant in international flights.“Air India shall be allowed to operate non-scheduled foreign flights with middle seats booking for next 10 days,” Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde said.The Bombay high court, while hearing a petition of a pilot, had sought a response from the Air India and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).The pilot, Deven Kanani, in his plea claimed a circular issued by the Government of India on March 23, 2020 laid some conditions to prevent the spread of Covid-19 while bringing back Indians stranded abroad due to the pandemic.However, the condition pertaining to keeping the middle seat between two passengers empty was not being followed by the Air India, he said in the plea.Kanani submitted photographs of an Air India flight operated between San Francisco and Mumbai where all seats were occupied.Air India counsel Abhinav Chandrachud opposed the plea and told the high court that the circular of March 23 has been now superseded with a new circular issued by the Government of India on May 22, 2020 while permitting domestic flights to operate from May 25The new circular does not say the middle seat needs to be kept empty, Chandrachud told the court.A division bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and Abhay Ahuja on Friday, however, noted that a cursory glance at the circular dated May 22 indicates that it applies only to domestic operations and not to international operations.The bench directed Air India and DGCA to file affidavits clarifying their stand, and posted the petition for further hearing on June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-air-india-to-operate-without-leaving-middle-seat-vacant-for-10-days/story-kikIEqjct0HDPXnk6uZ97N.html

He also advised to chief minister Mamata Banerjee not to an exaggerated report to the Centre on the losses due to cyclone Amphan.His tweets coming at a time large swathes of south Bengal was yet to limp back to normalcy has triggered a controversy.“Urge @MamataOfficial: Be in touch with Guv – had this been done army could have been called 3 days back,” Dhankhar wrote on Twitter in English and Bengali. I have directed all authorities to attend to RAJ BHAWAN in last ONLY AFTER NORMALCY IS RESTORED IN CITYURGE @MamataOfficial :BE IN TOUCH WITH GUV-HAD THIS BEEN DONE ARMY WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED 3 DAYS BACKSHARE REAL LOSS @PMOIndia :INFLATING FIGURES IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE(2/2)The state government called in the army on Saturday to clear the roads of the fallen trees. In another advice to the chief minister, the governor wrote, “Share real loss @PMOIndia: Inflating figures is counter-productive.”His tweets came after CM Banerjee said that the estimated loss due to the cyclone was Rs 1 lakh crore. She has said that 1 crore people have been rendered homeless due to the cyclone. Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi has initially approved Rs 1,000 crore assistance to the state government for the immediate requirement in the restoration work.On Sunday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders supported Dhankhar’s statement. “The governor has voiced the concerns of the whole state of Bengal. People are apprehensive of corruption by the state administration because of the examples they had set on earlier occasions. The CM is only talking about money. Why is she seeking money only? The Centree needs to investigate every claim of the state government,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said. After the aerial survey, PM Modi had said that he had spoken to Mamata Banerjee and Dhankhar and had decided that a detailed survey needed to be done to review the extent of the damage.The CM on Saturday had urged district officials to prepare reports of damage and losses very carefully so that the Central teams that are likely to visit the state to investigate the extent of the losses could be properly briefed.On Sunday, Derek O’Brien, the national spokesperson of the state’s ruling party Trinamool Congress, said that 6 crore people have been directly affected by the cyclone. Bengal’s population stood slightly above 9 crore in 2011 and is estimated to be around 10 crore at present.“It’s extremely unfortunate if the governor stoops too low, especially at the hour of such a crisis. I am especially shocked with his reaction because he himself accompanied PM Modi and the chief minister during the aerial survey of the affected areas. If he still thinks that the losses were not mammoth, we simply have nothing else to say,” said TMC spokesperson Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, a Lok Sabha member. On social media, many netizens took digs at the governor for “doing politics in the time of a crisis”....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-guv-tells-mamata-not-to-inflate-figures-on-losses-due-to-cyclone-amphan/story-AapqxUNOwgJ4fw8a46n9gM.html

25-05-2020||India||Delhi’s first flight to Pune, Mumbai’s to Patna as domestic air travel resumes||Indian skies will open up for domestic passenger services from Monday after a gap of two months, with Delhi-Pune and Mumbai-Patna flights being among the first to take off, aviation industry sources said. All scheduled commercial passenger flights have been suspended since March 25 when the government imposed a nationwide lockdown to curb the coronavirus pandemic. Both the flights will be operated by IndiGo on Monday morning. While the Delhi-Pune flight is scheduled to depart at 4.45 AM, the Mumbai-Patna flight would depart at 6.45 AM. Aviation industry sources said the first passenger flight would be 6E643 from Delhi airport and it is likely to be operated by aircraft VT-ITK, which is an A320neo plane of IndiGo. The sources added the first domestic passenger flight to arrive at Delhi airport on Monday would be from Ahmedabad and it is of SpiceJet. “The flight SG8194, which would be conducted by B737 model numbered VT-SGQ, would be landing at 7.45 AM at Delhi airport,” one of the sources said. The Mumbai airport’s operator MIAL said in a statement, “The first flight departing out of CSMIA (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport ) will be to Patna at 6:45hrs and flight arriving from Lucknow will be the first arrival flight at 8:20hrs both operated by IndiGo.” It was announced last Thursday that one-third of pre-lockdown domestic flights will operate from Monday. All international scheduled commercial passenger flights remain suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-first-flight-to-pune-mumbai-s-to-patna-as-domestic-air-travel-resumes/story-yp065GEbUTfuTKVFm6RNhI.html
25-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Students, migrants take first flight home as services resume after 2 months||As India resumed domestic passenger flights in a graded manner on Monday, hundreds of people reached the Indira Gandhi International Airport here to take early morning flights to their hometowns and workplaces. Flight operations remained shut for two months owing to the nationwide lockdown necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic.Those who took first flights included paramilitary personnel, army men, students and migrants, who failed to book a ticket on special trains being run by the railways. Many said they shelled out more to reach the airport as there were limited public transport options available.With trains running full and inter-state buses remaining off the roads, Sandeep Singh, 19, spent Rs 5,500 to reach Delhi from Dehradun where he studies. “I remained stuck in my PG. Mummy and papa were a worried lot. I am taking the first flight home,” he said. Aamir Afzal, a mechanical engineer from Patna, who had come to Delhi on an official visit on March 23, was among those who took the flights to celebrate Eid with family and friends. “I had been staying in a hotel in Mahipalpur with my co-worker. The hotel charged us Rs 900 per day. We could not get a confirmed ticket on a train back home,” he said.Due to the lesser number of trains, the tickets get sold out within 5-10 minutes. It is difficult for a person to book a ticket using a mobile phone, Afzal said. Afzal’s friend Rahid Ali said he was happy he would be able to join his family in Bihar’s Begusarai district on Eid. “But it will be a muted affair as so many homeless and hungry migrants who cannot afford to travel on train or flight are still stuck in various parts of the country. It doesn’t suit one to celebrate the festival in such circumstances,” he said. A few people travelled long distances only to find that their flights had been cancelled. Naik Satish Kumar’s Kolkata-bound flight got cancelled as the state decided not to resume operations till May 28. “I travelled all the way from Ambala on a bus to take a 6-am flight to Kolkata. When I reached here, I got to know the flight had been cancelled. I am returning home now,” he said. Excited to meet his two-year-old daughter, Santu Mandal, a resident of West Bengal’s Bardhaman district, reached the airport along with brother, Nasiruddin Mandal, at 1 am, unaware that the flight to Kolkata had been cancelled. The Mandal brothers, engaged in hand embroidery, spent Rs 12,000 to book the tickets “because we could not get a confirmed train ticket”. It is the first time Sudhir Kumar will be on a plane. The Army personnel posted in Punjab’s Bhatinda district says he never considered taking a flight home earlier as train travel is convenient and cheap. But trains are full already, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-migrants-take-the-first-flight-home-after-being-grounded-for-weeks-due-to-lockdown/story-i3FzUInhgLiJrYuXrg6JXK.html
25-05-2020||India||Central minister threatens to thrash Chhattisgarh officials with belt||Renuka Singh, Union minister of state for tribal affairs was seen in a video threatening district administration officials in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh for allegedly beating a man up in a quarantine centre and being discriminatory towards BJP workers.The minister was enraged after Dilip Gupta, a resident of Balarampur district had accused the chief executive officer and tehsildar of the district panchayat of assaulting him in a quarantine centre in the area after he complained of poor arrangements.“Bhagvadhari BJP karyakartaon ko kamzor na samjhna aap... Jo bhed-bhaav kar rahe ho na BJP karyakartaaon ke saath .. Bhool Jaaiye .. Andheri Kothari mein le jaake mein ..belt kolke thokna jaanti hun bhut acche se... (Don’t think that BJP workers are weak .. Forget about the discrimination which you are doing with them.. I very well know how to lock people in a room and thrash them with a belt),” the minister is seen telling officials.“You have just beaten him because he knows his rights...You people are working are working arbitrarily which will not work,” she said.“If I was only a MP, I would have lived entire time in my constituency but I am a union minister too, so I have to go to Delhi. This does not mean that my workers and people have become venerable,” she said.HT cannot vouch for the veracity of the video.The minister did not respond to repeated call and messages from Hindustan Times. She later told news agency ANI Sunday evening that Dilip Gupta, who had come to Balrampur, was put in a quarantine centre and badly beaten for highlighting poor arrangements at the facility.“When Gupta witnessed poor arrangement in the quarantine centre , he made a video to raise the issue . When the administration came to know about the video, two officials – a tehsildar and CEO Janpad Panchayat reached in the centre..They threatened and beaten him with belt. After this they shifted him to some other place and the family started searching for Gupta. The parents informed me and when I reached in the centre, I found that the Gupta was badly beaten… The CEO Janpad Panchayat accepted that he made a mistake,” the minister said.Balrampur’s Collector, Sanjiv Kumar Jha said an inquiry has been ordered.“We have ordered an probe in this matter whether Gupta, who reached Balrampur from Delhi on May 15 was beaten up by the officers or not . We will take action accordingly,” said Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-minister-threatens-to-thrash-chhattisgarh-officials-with-belt/story-yaZrau5t8F10T7zWjYM0JN.html
25-05-2020||India||Centre issues fresh guidelines for Indian citizens stranded abroad||The government on Sunday issued a fresh Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for the return of Indians stranded abroad due to the coronavirus lockdown, saying it will be a paid service and preference will be given to people in distress including those who have lost their jobs and pregnant women.A similar SOP was also issued by the government for those who are stranded in India and desire to travel abroad.As per the latest SOP, all travellers will have to give an undertaking that they would undergo mandatory quarantine for 14 days. It will be a seven-day paid institutional quarantine at their own cost, followed by seven days of isolation at home with self-monitoring of health.Only for exceptional and compelling reasons such as cases of human distress, pregnancy, death in family, serious illness and parent(s) accompanied by children below 10 years, as assessed by the receiving states, home quarantine may be permitted for 14 days and use of ‘Aarogya Setu’ app shall be mandatory in such cases, it said.According to the SOP issued earlier by the MHA on May 5, the institutional quarantine period was 14 days and another 14 days was for home quarantine while ‘Aarogya Setu’ app was mandatory for all international arrivals.The fresh SOP said that the states and UTs can also develop their own protocol. Priority will be given to compelling cases in distress, including migrant workers, labourers who have been laid off, short-term visa-holders facing expiry of visas, persons with medical emergency, pregnant women, elderly, those required to return to India due to death of family member, and students, the SOP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-fresh-guidelines-for-indian-citizens-stranded-abroad/story-GLYjproML5ehvcguSuUxkK.html
25-05-2020||India||Delhi prepares for a quiet Eid without congregations||In May 1987, when a curfew was imposed in Delhi after tension flared in some neighbourhoods following communal rioting in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut, Eid prayers were not offered at the iconic Jama Masjid. Thirty-three years later, Delhi’s largest mosque will again remain shut to devotees when Eid is celebrated on Monday. Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, cited the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic as the reason for the mosque remaining shut. Similarly, all other mosques in the city will remain shut to devotees on Eid as a lockdown continues to be enforced to contain the spread of the virus.Eid-ul-Fitr is celebrated to mark the end of the holy month of Ramzan during which Muslims observe a fast from dawn to dusk. On the day of Eid, dressed in new clothes, devotees offer prayers at mosques and then hug and greet relatives and friends. After the prayers, people visit each others’ homes with sheer khurma (a traditional dessert) as a customary ritual of the festival. This year, the community will observe the festival at homes with no public prayers, hugs, and dawats (get-togethers).“It’s going to be hard for people to celebrate Eid like this but we need to do this to protect each other from the coronavirus infection. People have an immense attachment to the Jama Masjid. But this time everyone has to pray at home. We have already announced that no one will be allowed inside the mosque on Monday. Only the mosque staff living inside will offer the prayer on the premises,” Bukhari said.Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Masjid Fatehpuri, recalled the last time Eid prayers were not held in the mosque. “In 1993, when the curfew was imposed post-Babri Masjid demolition, we did not hold Eid prayers in the Fatehpuri mosque and encouraged people to offer prayers in their local mosques (Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992). But this year it’s unprecedented. The mosque is closed since March due to the pandemic. We are requesting people to not only pray at their home but also avoid roaming on the streets and gatherings,” he said.Haji Miyan Faiyazuddin, 82, of the iconic Haji Hotel in the Jama Masjid area, said that he has never experienced an Eid without Namaz being offered in mosques, hugs being exchanged, and celebrations on the streets.“I had gone for my first Eid namaz in Jama Masjid when I was six. Even during instances of communal tension, namaz was not prohibited in the local mosques as it has been now. After the namaz, we would visit each other’s house. Children would buy toys and sweets on the way home. We would also share sweets and other delicacies with our Hindu brothers and they also visit our homes. But, this time, it will be a silent Eid,” he said.Faiyazuddin, whose family claims a lineage of five centuries, said people should follow all the norms specified for the prevention of Covid-19. “We can celebrate Eid again next year but we cannot afford to put everyone’s life in danger. Also, people should help those who have lost their livelihood and loved ones due to this pandemic,” he said.Shopkeepers selling clothes, shoes and jewellery, and tailors, who would otherwise remain busy throughout Ramzan, said this would be a “black Eid”. Farookh Ahmed, who runs a readymade garment showroom in the Shaheen Bagh neighbourhood, said, “We have opened our shops two days back after a gap of five months. The market was first shut due to the anti-CAA protest and then the Covid-19 lockdown. We did not even get a window of a week to sell some clothes before Eid. People are also not shopping like before this year. For us, it’s black Eid,” he said.The reference was to the long-running protest staged in Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).On Saturday, very few people were spotted in the markets for Eid Shopping in the walled city, Batla House, Shaheen Bagh, and other Muslim-dominated areas. The hashtags of #EidatHome and #EidiforMigrants were also trending on Twitter, requesting people to stay at home and help those in need. “Refrain from buying new clothes and rather use the money for the marginal sections of the society,” said Ashhar Uddin, in a tweet.Rana Safvi, an author, said that she will have a low-key celebration at home. “I won’t be able to meet my daughter as she lives in Delhi while I am in Noida. We will do a video call and greet each other,” she said.“This time, we should celebrate an Eid of compassion. We should give more to those in need. I will also do that,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-prepares-for-a-quiet-eid-without-congregations/story-7SrRXRNUFBsy0w9nZ6E7QK.html
25-05-2020||India||India now among 10 worst countries in Covid-19 cases||With the highest one-day national surge of 6,634 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, India on Sunday overtook Iran to become the 10th biggest hot spot of the pathogen, which has rapidly swept the globe, claiming new epicentres across continents and leaving health care systems overwhelmed in its wake.The number of Covid-19 cases in the country stood at 138,474 on Sunday, nearly doubling over the course of 13 days, even as graded relaxations in the fourth phase of the national lockdown were likely to push up the contagion over the coming days.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayNew Covid-19 cases dropped to zero for the first time on Saturday in China, the country where the pandemic originated, but surged in India and ravaged South America. Experts say that in countries with weak health care systems and impoverished populations, fighting the virus has proven to be difficult. Latin America has become the latest epicentre of the highly contagious disease. Brazil and Mexico reported record numbers of infections and deaths almost daily this week, fuelling criticism of their governments for limited lockdowns. But infections also rose and intensive-care units were swamped in Peru, Chile and Ecuador, all countries praised for imposing early and aggressive shutdowns. India’s trajectory of Covid-19 cases appears to be tracking that of Brazil, according to analysis of latest data. India’s case count on Sunday was where Brazil’s infections stood about 15 days ago. Also read: Centre identifies 4 model cities for Covid-19 handlingThe latest 10,000 infections were recorded in two days. India recorded its first 10,000 Covid-19 cases in nearly 43 days, with a wave of infections beginning in March after three isolated cases were first reported in Kerala in January. It took seven days for the cases to climb from 20,000 to 30,000.The disease’s doubling rate, which is defined as the average period it takes for a twofold rise, decreased from 13.9 days on May 18 – the day the cases hit 100,000 – to 13.1 on Sunday. The doubling rate – which is calculated over a period of last seven days – was four days at the beginning of April. Several experts say the peak of the outbreak in India is yet to come.Across the world, many governments are easing restrictions as they face political challenges and poor economic indicators brought on by the pandemic. In just a few months, the pandemic has killed at least 345,000 people worldwide and infected more than 5.4 million.Also read| Covid-19 lockdown: Some states look beyond colour-codingTurkey, which stands at the ninth spot in the global tally just above India, imposed its toughest lockdown measures yet starting Saturday for the Eid holiday. In Germany, which has drawn praise for its handling of the outbreak, seven people appeared to have been infected at a restaurant. It would be the first known such case since restaurants started reopening two weeks ago. France, which has the seventh highest number of infections, has allowed religious services to resume after a legal challenge to the government’s ban on gatherings in places of worship.The US has been the hardest-hit country, with about 100,000 Covid-19 deaths so far among 1.6 million confirmed cases, followed by Russia and Brazil.Concerns, however, are rising in India, where new cases showed another record jump on Sunday, going past 6,000 for the third straight day as the two-month lockdown eased. States with relatively few cases have seen spikes in recent days as residents, including migrant workers travelling in special trains, have returned home.On average, India has reported 6,102 cases over the last five days. The corresponding number for the previous five days was 4,753. The data, which is based on official figures from states, shows that about a third of the total cases have been reported over the past week.On Sunday, the number of infections in Delhi rose to 13,418 after 508 new cases were reported.Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in the country, surpassed 50,000 cases. It reported 3,041 new infections during the day and its overall tally was 50,231. Of these, 30,542 cases – more than a fourth of the national tally – have been reported in Mumbai alone. The surge of cases also continued in Tamil Nadu as the state recorded 765 cases. The state has so far reported 16,277 cases. As India relaxes curbs that were put in place on March 25, experts say the coming weeks will be crucial. Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and who also heads the five-member committee formed to assist the Delhi chief minister to tackle the pandemic, told HT recently that the lockdown has only delayed the peak, “which is likely to come maybe in July or mid-August”.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-now-among-10-worst-countries-in-covid-19-cases/story-887sPJfXLEzVIUPZd6VKcK.html
25-05-2020||India||Domestic flights resume today after ‘long day of hard negotiations’||Air travel across the country was set to resume on Monday, with all states finally agreeing to accept at least some flights but announcing varied quarantine and self-isolation rules for arriving passengers to address misgivings about infections being brought in from other cities.Instead of following the national guidelines issued by the Union government for all departing and disembarking passengers, many of the states chose to set their own rules: Karnataka, for instance, requires mandatory institutional quarantine for passengers from worst-affected states, while Punjab and Meghalaya have made a swab test mandatory for arrivals. Several states said passengers will be taken to a facility only if they show symptoms of fever or cough — in line with Union government guidelines released on Sunday — while several among them decided to additionally mandate or suggest self-isolation for either 14 or 28 days, even if a traveller is asymptomatic.Some other states, such as Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh, said that only state residents will be allowed to enter the city from the airports.The announcements came a day after three states — Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu — requested the Union government to reconsider the decision to allow domestic flight operations to resume as it could lead to a spike in infections. On Sunday, the ministry held several discussions with these states and airline representatives.“It has been a long day of hard negotiations with various state governments to recommence civil aviation operations in the country. Except Andhra Pradesh which will start on 26/5 and West Bengal on 28/5, domestic flights will recommence across the country from tomorrow,” civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said in a tweet on Sunday evening..In the morning, he spoke to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over video to convince the state to allow some flights to resume. Shortly after, Thackeray, in a press conference, said: “I spoke to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri today and told him that the Mumbai international airport needs more time to resume its operations. Till the time the airport plans and fine-tunes operations, aviation ministry should initiate minimum possible domestic flights from Maharashtra from May 25.”On Sunday evening, the ministry announced that some 50 flights will operate from Mumbai. “It’s extremely ill-advised to reopen airports in red zone. Mere thermal scanning of passengers, inadequate without swabs. Impossible to have autos/cabs/buses ply in current circumstances. Adding positive passenger will add Covid stress to red zone. #MaharashtraGovtCares,” Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said in a tweet before the two administrations came to an agreement. Several discussions also took place between officials of other states, civil aviation ministry and airline representatives. The meetings covered the quarantine rules for flyers as well as standard operating procedures for airports, according to officials aware of the discussions.“Negotiations were held with the state governments and they all came on board, as we also agreed to certain terms and conditions. A state like Maharashtra had genuine concerns as it has the most number of cases. We agreed to run fewer flights — only 25 will operate to Mumbai. West Bengal, too, had concerns due to the damage caused by cyclone Amphan and we agreed to delay flight operations,” said an official, asking not to be named. Also read: No quarantine for asymptomatic passengers landing at IGI airportFlights to and from West Bengal will resume on May 28. After initially seeking time till May 31, Tamil Nadu came on board with the Union government’s plan early on Sunday. The Union health ministry separately released guidelines for travellers on domestic and international flights. In both types of flights, airlines have been advised not to board anyone showing symptoms of Covid-19. All passengers will need to wear masks while on board. The federal guidelines lay down that anyone showing symptoms when they land will need to be taken to a facility for isolation where they will be assessed. Passengers will also be advised to download the Aarogya Setu mobile application.“These guidelines are an extension of our earlier travel advisories with modifications made as per the current Covid-19 situation. Now that travel restrictions are being eased, it will be our aim to ensure disease transmission stays under check. These guidelines can be modified as per what the latest situation demands,” said a senior government official, who asked not to be identified.The government is yet to allow international flights, but the SOPs for when they resume say that all passengers will need to go into a week-long quarantine at a facility for which they will need to pay. According to PTI, Saujanya Shrivastava, chief operating officer - flights, MakeMyTrip and Goibibo, said: “With domestic flights taking off after 61 days of lockdown, there is an understandable apprehension amongst flyers. That said, we expect the situation to smoothen out as flyers gradually get attuned to the new safety protocols.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-finally-clear-air-for-anxious-flyers/story-ruhPX2T3pGvYaIA4iQsXhJ.html
25-05-2020||India||After migrants jump quarantine, Odisha reduces isolation tenure to 14 days||With the pressure of keeping over 2 lakh migrant workers in quarantine centres for 21 days proving difficult in view of frequent protests at such centres and migrants jumping quarantine, the Odisha government on Sunday brought down the total quarantine period from 28 days to 14 days.Special relief commissioner Pradeep Jena said in rural areas the migrant workers will undergo 7 days of mandatory institutional quarantine after which the asymptomatic ones will be discharged for home quarantine for a further period of 7 days. Earlier, all returning migrant workers in rural areas had to compulsorily stay in 21 days of official quarantine followed by 7 days of home quarantine. They were also stamped with indelible ink on their left arm.Jena, however, said government officials, professionals, businessmen or any other person travelling to Odisha on work and leaving within 72 hours would be exempted from mandatory quarantine. Besides, anyone who has already undergone the prescribed quarantine period in any other state would also be exempted from quarantine in Odisha.Additional chief secretary of the health department, PK Mohapatra said the change in quarantine policy came following changes in ICMR guidelines.Officials however admitted that shortening the quarantine period was necessary to free up school buildings and Anganwadi centres that are currently being used as quarantine centres. So far 2.4 lakh migrant workers have been quarantined in Odisha after lockdown was relaxed.A senior official said reducing the quarantine period was necessary as more and more jumping of quarantine norms were being reported across the state with gram panchayats feeling the pressure of keeping the migrant workers in the centres.In several quarantine centres the inmates have gone on strike protesting the quality of food while in other places villagers are uneasy about having quarantine centres next to their homes.In Sundargarh district, four migrant workers escaped from an institutional quarantine at a school in Gurundia block early Sunday morning. The inmates who had returned from Kerala and Maharashtra jumped the school’s boundary wall protesting the quality of food served there.“The returning migrant workers have proved to be a big headache for us. It seems the prime duty of the Sarpanch is now to ensure that the inmates complete their quarantine period,” said a Sarpanch in Ganjam district, the epicentre of Covid-19 in Odisha.The state government’s shortening of the quarantine period came on the day more than 200 migrant workers fled a ‘Shramik Special’ train near Balibagada in Ganjam district after pulling the alarm chain. The ‘Shramik Special’ train carrying Odisha migrants from Namapalli in Telangana was going towards Khordha Road station in Bhubaneswar. After some locals spotted the migrant returnees coming via the railway track towards Balibagada area, they informed the police and the Railway Protection Force.Pradeep Jena said the Centre’s decision to run more Shramik Special trains without any prior information and without the consent of the state government, would make things difficult for Odisha.The Centre earlier used to inform the state government about Shramik Special trains leaving for Odisha as well as the particulars of the migrant workers travelling in it, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-migrants-jump-quarantine-odisha-reduces-isolation-tenure-to-14-days/story-DypTkVAHy9kY2luo3hSVCO.html
25-05-2020||India||Biggest 1-day spike in Bengal with 200 cases||KOLKATAAs West Bengal struggles to restore normality four days after being struck by cyclone Amphan, the state on Sunday recorded its highest daily spike in Covid-19 cases, with more than 200 people detected with the viral infection for the first time on a single day. The spike is a major concern for the state because the areas worst hit by the cyclone are also the ones most affected by Covid-19.The state government said 208 persons tested positive for the coronavirus disease on Sunday, taking Bengal’s tally to 3,667. The state recorded more than 100 cases for the first time on May 6, reporting 112 cases, and has reported another 2,211 cases, with an average of 123 cases per day. The state has so far recorded 272 deaths, including 72 attributed to co-morbidity. Kolkata, North 24-Parganas and Howrah that account for 2,934 of the total cases in the state have also been badly hit by the cyclone. These districts have most of the containment zones in the state.Among Sunday’s new cases, 52 were from Kolkata, 48 from Howrah and 21 from North 24-Parganas. South 24-Parganas, the worst cyclone-hit district, recorded only four new cases but that was due to too few samples being tested as large parts of it remained cut off from the rest of the state even on Sunday, according to a senior official of the state health department.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said that the state faces a great challenge in containing the spread of the disease, enforcing the lockdown and simultaneously carry out relief and restoration work for the damage caused by the storm.“It’s going to be a humongous battle against nature to contain Covid-19 at this hour. We are getting reports from the districts that people are focussed on post-cyclone restoration. They are not caring about masks and social distancing. Thousands of people have been rendered homeless. They are trying to remove fallen trees and electric poles and repair breached embankments. The faster the restoration takes place, the earlier social distancing norms can be implemented again,” said public health expert Rezaul Karim. Even on Sunday, the state witnessed demonstrations in Kolkata, Howrah and North 24-Parganas, even around areas where several persons tested positive for Covid-19, by people who demanded immediate restoration of power and water supply.“We urge people to have patience and not to hit the streets. We are trying our best to give relief to the people but we should not forget that the storm was of great magnitude and we still are battling Covid-19,” urban development minister Firhad Hakim said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biggest-1-day-spike-in-bengal-with-200-cases/story-9DTHOVS5b0Ttrr4WIbDS2O.html
25-05-2020||India||Virtual courts are not a panacea: Chandrachud||The Covid-19 outbreak forced the Supreme Court to resort to virtual court hearings so that the safety of lawyers, litigants and media personnel was not jeopardised, but such hearings will not replace or be a substitute for physical courts, Supreme Court judge, justice DY Chandrachud, said on Sunday.“I want to dissuade people from the idea that virtual court hearings are some sort of a panacea,” justice Chandrachud said at a webinar organized by Nyaya Forum of National Academy of Legal Studies and Research, Hyderabad on the topic Future of Virtual Courts and Access to Justice in India.“They will not be able to replace physical court hearings. We had to resort to virtual court hearings because Covid-19 descended without warning and we had no other choice. We had to protect those who come to court –lawyers, litigants, media personnel, paralegals, interns”, he said.The Supreme Court, which is under complete shutdown due to the Coronavirus threat, has been hearing only extremely urgent cases since March 23 via video conferencing without the personal presence of lawyers. The top court had issued a circular on March 23 suspending the entry of lawyers and litigants into the court premises and directing that only extremely urgent cases be taken up for hearing through video conferencing during the lockdown period.The video conferencing is conducted by the court through the Vidyo app that can be downloaded on mobile phones and desktops.On the use of technology in courts, justice Chandrachud said that technology was an inseparable adjunct to rule of law and will have to be employed as a critical element in court design. Justice Chandrachud, who is also the chairperson of the e-committee at the Supreme Court, said that the digitization of courts including e-filing must be standardized across the countryThe filing of cases in the Supreme Court is set to undergo a radical change with the introduction of the new e-filing module in the near future. The module will provide personalized information to every advocate-on-record of cases which have been filed by them, their own causelist of cases, details of pleadings filed by them and pleadings filed by others in cases in which they appear.The service will be available round the clock which would mean that a lawyer can file case anytime of the day and any day irrespective of whether the registry is working or not.“We as judges have a vital role to ensure that young members of the Bar are trained and we have to do the hand-holding ourselves”, justice Chandrachud said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virtual-courts-are-not-a-panacea-chandrachud/story-bSdGTHP3IbrAKHefjtQgMN.html

Additional Superintendent of Police, Chhindwara, Shashank Garg said, “The video is old in which head constable Krishna Dongre and constable Ashish were seen beating a man. Sub-divisional officer of police SP Singh has been deputed with an inquiry into it. As we have learnt the man used to create ruckus in intoxicated state in his locality and police had been called to control him in the past as well.”The 30-year-old man who was thrashed, has been identified as Nanu, a mason and resident of Piplyanarayanwar. In the purported video, one of the two policemen were seen hitting the man with his lathi (cane) in his head and other parts even after he fell unconscious.The man was then taken to the district hospital for medical examination after which he was dropped at his residence. His condition is fine, said police.Superintendent of Police (SP), Chhindwara Vivek Agrawal said, “The incident is unfortunate. As we came to know about it, I immediately suspended the police personnel and ordered an inquiry into the incident. There will be exemplary punishment against them if they are found guilty in the inquiry.”When asked about injuries caused to the man the SP said, “No serious injury was found in medical examination. However, since the incident is old it might be a reason why no serious injury was found.” Earlier on Saturday, they were shifted from field duty to the police lines. Chhindwara is home turf of state Congress president and ex-chief minister Kamal Nath .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-mp-policemen-suspended-for-beating-up-man/story-jyhfCxi42WWcquFdngoX3L.html
25-05-2020||India||2 migrants deliver babies aboard spl trains||BhubaneswarTwo women migrant workers travelling back to their homes in Odisha by Shramik Special trains safely delivered babies during their journeys on Sunday, providing a rare cause of cheer amid the often grim stories narrated by distressed migrants returning to the state after losing their jobs during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown.In Bolangir district, a migrant worker delivered a baby girl in the Shramik Special train at Titlagarh railway station on Sunday. Migrant worker Hema Kanti was travelling from Kazipet in Telangana in Bolangir when she went into labour.East Coast Railway officials halted the train at Titlagarh railway station where Kanti gave birth to a baby girl at around 10.15 am in the presence of the railway divisional medical officer. Railway officials shifted Kanti and the newborn to Titlagarh government hospital after the delivery.In the second incident, police officials in Jharsuguda town police station helped a migrant worker deliver a baby in a police control room (PCR) van. Payal Kumari of Krishnapur in Bihar was going from Secunderabad to Danapur in Bihar with her husband Balkrishna Prasad when she experienced labour pains.On being informed by Railway authorities, Jharsuguda Town police station inspector Sabitri Bal rushed to the railway station along with tehsildar GB Mangaraj. “As the train halted at Jharsuguda station at 2.20 pm, inspector Bal found the pregnant lady in extreme pain and decided to take her to hospital. Since no other vehicle was available, the police officer took Payal in a PCR van. Before they could reach the hospital, Payal delivered a baby girl inside the vehicle under the supervision of Bal,” said Jharsuguda superintendent of police Rahul PR.Later, the mother and baby were admitted to Jharsuguda hospital where their condition was stated to be stable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-migrants-deliver-babies-aboard-spl-trains/story-PcholNQ1L7HYNwpROGHg6H.html
25-05-2020||India||Red alert issued as heatwave intensifies in north India, likely to persist for 4-5 days||Delhi’s residents sweltered in a heatwave on Sunday, with the maximum temperature hitting five degrees above normal for the second consecutive day, and no respite forecast for the plains until at least May 28, prompting a red alert in the capital as well as Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.The Safdarjung weather station recorded the maximum temperature at 44.4 degrees Celsius. The authorities sounded a red category alert for Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, west and east Rajasthan on May 25 and 26 for heatwave or severe heatwaves. A red category alert implies authorities should take action to avoid health emergencies.South Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh reported heatwaves and Churu in west Rajasthan reported a severe heatwave on Sunday, with a maximum temperature of 47.4 degrees Celsius.The heat was worse in several other places, where the maximum temperature rose above 46 degrees Celsius.Nagpur Sonegaon in the Vidarbha region recorded 46.2 degrees Celsius; Churu in Rajasthan 46.6 degrees Celsius, Akola in Maharashtra 46 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Heatwave conditions are very likely to persist for the next four to five days, with peak intensity on May 25 and 26, IMD said in its Sunday bulletin, citing dry northwesterly winds blowing over the plains of northwest India and central India and the north-south trough in lower tropospheric levels from east India to south-peninsular India.“We don’t see any signs of maximum temperatures falling till May 28. From May 28, we are expecting dust storms and thunderstorms due to a western disturbance. Wind speed will increase to 50 to 60 kmph and there will be clouding. Right now, very dry hot northwesterly winds are blowing over entire northwest India. Sunrays are also vertical, making its impact very intense, humidity has been only 30% to 40%,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre.The maximum temperature in Delhi’s Aya Nagar was 45.6 degrees Celsius, 6 degrees above normal and 44.2 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road.IMD’s bulletin added that heatwave conditions were likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and Telangana during the next 4-5 days. Similar conditions were predicted in some pockets over Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Marathawada, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam, Rayalseema and north-interior Karnataka during next 3-4 days.Because of strong southerly winds from Bay of Bengal to northeastern states at lower tropospheric levels, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at some places over Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh from May 24 to 28, according to IMD. Heavy rainfall is also likely over parts of south-peninsular India on May 26 and 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-alert-issued-as-heatwave-intensifies-in-northern-india/story-mN7acE4BahtYIwnyzxSsLM.html
25-05-2020||India||Poverty-stricken, jobless Hyd couple tries to sell infant son for ₹22,000||Poverty and lack of work during the lockdown enforced to prevent the spread of Covid-19 drove a migrant couple in Hyderabad to try and sell their two-month old son for Rs 22,000 through a mediator on Sunday.Jeedimetla police arrested the couple, Madan Kumar Singh, 32, and Saritha, 30, of Uttar Pradesh, who came to Hyderabad a few years ago to work as construction labourers.Another woman, identified as Seshu, who was brokering the deal, was also taken into custody. The child was the couple’s second son; the first is seven years old.“We have rescued the child and shifted him to Sishu Vihar being run by the women and child welfare department authorities,” P V Padmaja Reddy, deputy commissioner of police of Balanagar, said .She said enquiries revealed that the couple was in acute poverty. “We are investigating as to whether there were any other reasons for the sale of the child,” the DCP said.Jeedimetla police said the couple had apparently thought they would not be able to raise the second child. The child’s mother told the police that her husband was also used to consuming alcohol and was pestering her for money to buy liquor.“The couple managed to find a broker Seshu, known to the couple, who reportedly found a childless couple who agreed to buy the child for Rs 22,000. On receiving a tipoff, we caught Seshu, who was taking the child for a medical examination,” a police officer said.Andhra Pradesh Balala Hakkula Sangham (child rights association) president P Achyuta Rao said it was the responsibility of the state government to come to the rescue of daily-wage workers who were in extreme poverty because of the lockdown. “The department of women and child welfare should launch an awareness campaign about the cradle scheme among the poor people who were resorting to selling of new-born babies,” he said. Cradle (”Ooyala” in Telugu) scheme is meant for taking care of abandoned children or children who were sold by their parents, by Women and Child Welfare Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poverty-stricken-jobless-hyd-couple-tries-to-sell-infant-son-for-22-000/story-utRo7TvglPQjqLPo3gr5IJ.html
25-05-2020||India||Indian soldiers not held at China border: Army||As tensions simmer between India and China in the Ladakh sector that has seen a worrying troop build-up and military reinforcements from both sides after a nasty border brawl in early May, the army on Sunday strongly denied reports in some sections of the media that an Indian patrol party was detained by Chinese forces last week and later released.“There has been no detention of Indian soldiers at the borders. We categorically deny this. It only hurts national interests when media outlets publish unsubstantiated news,” army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said. Union minister Jitendra Singh shared the army’s statement on his Twitter handle and described the reports as “dangerously fake news.”The detention of a border patrol by an adversary is seen as a provocative act that can bring rival forces perilously close to conflict, experts said. The standoff along the line of actual control (LAC) is not confined to a small area, has triggered an increase in troop numbers on both sides at multiple locations and seems to suggest a greater design rather than adventurism by local Chinese commanders, as reported by HT on Sunday.Indian and Chinese soldiers are eyeball-to-eyeball at four different locations in the sensitive sector and the total number of soldiers on both sides at these flashpoints is estimated to be around 3,000.“Wherever the Chinese have sent more troops, we have matched their numbers by beefing up our deployment. Some structures have come up on both sides to support the troops on the ground,” officials said. Chinese soldiers are said to have constructed bunkers and other structures to support their deployments in some disputed areas. The Chinese side has also deployed troops, vehicles and heavy equipment, involved in a military exercise in the area, to the Ladakh sector --- satellite images showing the military build-up have been doing the rounds on social media.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane made a low-key visit to Ladakh on Friday for a security review as tensions grew between India and China near Pangong Tso and three pockets in the Galwan Valley region where Chinese troops have pitched close to 100 tents and erected temporary structures to establish a presence.China’s state-run media has described the latest tensions as the worst since the 2017 Doklam standoff, which lasted 73 days. Soldiers on both sides are showing restraint and local commanders are meeting almost daily to de-escalate. However, experts said ending the stalemate would require political direction and diplomatic intervention.India on Thursday rejected China’s allegation that Indian troops initiated tensions and crossed the LAC in the Ladakh and Sikkim sectors and accused the Chinese army of hindering patrols on the Indian side.China’s foreign ministry first accused Indian troops of trespassing across the LAC in a statement last week, saying Beijing had to take “necessary countermeasures” after the Indian Army allegedly obstructed normal patrols by Chinese troops.HT was the first to report on May 10 about tensions flaring between India and China in north Sikkim where 150 soldiers were involved in a tense standoff a day earlier. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured at Naku La during the confrontation.Scores of soldiers from the two countries clashed near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5-6 and several of them were injured in the scuffle that involved around 250 men. While a flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the situation, tension spread to other parts of eastern Ladakh, including the Galwan Valley area....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-soldiers-not-held-at-china-border-army/story-Ffv3EAkj6BW0eFglRWMKJP.html
25-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||A new study on Covid-19 patients from Singapore highlights just why it’s important to refine treatment and hospitalisation policies on the basis of science.Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that a joint paper by the country’s National Centre for Infectious Diseases and the Academy of Medicine showed that patients were no longer contagious 11 days after infection. In other words, they had enough of a viral load to return a positive test, but not enough to infect others. Bloomberg cited a report in the Straits Times to say that the country’s ministry of health will now see if these findings need to be “incorporated into its patient clinical management plan”. This is a significant finding for two reasons. One, most scientists now accept that the primary way in which the coronavirus disease spreads is person to person. This, despite the huge obsession researchers have had with surface transmission and the reams of literature on what’s safe to touch and what isn’t.A minor digression is in order here: your newspaper is perfectly safe. As I messaged a friend in the neighbourhood who asked whether he should allow the papers to be delivered to his house: “It’s probably safer than many other things you do; there are no records, anywhere in the world, of anyone getting infected by a newspaper; and, in the worst-case scenario that you become the first person in the world to be infected by the newspaper, then you will be a person of interest to science.” Actually, I didn’t use the term “person of interest to science”; I said “medical marvel”.Two, if follow-up studies establish the findings of the Singapore study to be accurate and universal, people can be safely discharged after 11 days, even if they continue to test positive. The current discharge policy in India is that a person has to test negative twice before being discharged. A change in this policy may mean less strain on health care resources. It also means people who have physically recovered from the illness, or asymptomatic people who never fell ill, can now be discharged 11 days after they first tested positive.India has now reached a stage (138,474 cases as of Sunday night; 3,949 dead), where it has to start looking at whether its health care resources are adequate to deal with the pandemic. They probably are at the aggregate level — not at all hot spots of infection.For instance, Mumbai’s health care resources are straining under the weight of a high volume of cases and suspected cases (anyone with symptoms is being admitted to hospitals). In the seven days to Saturday, the city saw 1185, 1411, 1372, 1382, 1751 and 1566 cases -- an average of 1,444 cases a day. Sure, many of these are likely to be asymptomatic individuals who get sent to a quarantine facility or be asked to isolate at home, but at least some of them will need hospitals. Then, there are those with Covid-19 symptoms who have been tested and are awaiting results, or are yet to be tested (and have to be in hospital).On average, between Monday and Saturday last week, 807 Covid-19 and suspected Covid-19 patients were admitted to Mumbai hospitals. The most was on Saturday, 1059, and the least on Monday, 678.Delhi has been registering, on average, between half and a third the number of cases in Mumbai over the past few days, but the city has been lucky so far in that many of the positive cases have not needed hospitalisation. Between Monday and Saturday, for instance, the number of people requiring hospitalisation increased only by around 114 (the number doesn’t factor in the number of people who either died or were discharged, and is therefore an approximation). It also doesn’t include suspected cases admitted to hospitals. Still, while a direct comparison of the Delhi and Mumbai numbers isn’t possible, the data clearly shows the pressure on the health system in Mumbai.This should serve as an early warning for planners in Delhi, Chennai, and Ahmedabad. They may never have to cope with a situation akin to what Mumbai is going through right now, but they should be prepared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-m36raAKeYcuQv2LTZCIgfL.html
25-05-2020||India||Covid-19 dampens Eid celebrations across India||Under the shadow of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh on Sunday marked Eid al-Fitr, but the usual fervour and celebrations were missing. Although the lockdown was partially eased to allow shopping and short travel, people remained indoors and avoided customary meetings with family, friends and relatives to maintain physical distancing and check crowding at public places The rest of the country will celebrate Eid on Monday. Prayer gatherings, outdoor celebrations and other public events were curtailed or cancelled to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.No Eid prayers were offered for the second consecutive time in major mosques of Kashmir. All the shrines put up banners saying no congregational prayers were being organised.Last year, Eid-ul-Azha prayers could not be offered in Kashmir because the authorities imposed a strict curfew in the wake of the effective revocation of Article 370 that divested the state of its special status and divided Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories -- J&K and Ladakh.In Kerala too, the usual fervour associated with Eid was missing. Many shopkeepers in Kozhikkode’s Sweetmeat Street, famous for its shopping, said their business had been one-tenth the usual level in the last two days. Besides the lockdown norms, lack of money also forced many people to remain indoors, they said. Many religious leaders had asked believers to stay at home.With other states celebrating the festival on Monday, guidelines were being put in place by governments and the religious heads.There will be no relaxations for Eid prayers in Uttarakhand. Ashok Kumar, director general (law & order) Uttarakhand police said. “The restrictions will be in place as they are at present.”Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee appealed to the Muslim community in Bengal to celebrate Eid and offer prayers indoors so that social distancing norms enforced to counter the Covid-9 pandemic are not violated. The Bengal Imams Association made the same appeal.“For a month you observed Ramzan indoors. I appeal to you to celebrate Eid the same way. Please have faith in me. Mankind will be grateful to you,” said Banerjee.In Madhya Pradesh, Masajid committee (Bhopal) superintendent Yasar Aarafat said, “Only five selected persons will offer the prayer on the occasion at the mosque at Eidgaah. People will offer prayers at home. There will be no hugging also on the occasion.”In Goa too, there will be no community celebrations this year, with the president of the Association of All Goa Muslim Jamaats, Sheikh Basheer Ahmed, saying: “This year we will celebrate Eid differently. It won’t be like every year because this year we will celebrate it individually each in our own homes with our children, parents and family. We should not congregate for the namaz at the masjid, idgah or any other similar place. We cannot congregate and have to maintain social distancing,” Ahmed said.In Chhattisgarh, prayers will be offered in the mosques, but no more than five people will be allowed.“No congregation is allowed during Eid and we have appealed that celebrations should be done inside the house. We have also appealed not to spend money on shopping and purchasing. Instead, the money should be distributed among the poor and sufferers in this crisis,” said Shehar Qazi of Raipur, Mohammad Ali FarooqiThe historic Gandhi Maidan in Bihar, after more than 90 years, will not host any Eid prayers in view of the pandemic and the need to maintain social distancing.On a call by Ulemas and Muftis from all schools of Islamic thought, Muslims in Hyderabad have been offering Taraweeh prayers at their homes during Ramzan month. In Uttar Pradesh too, both Shia and Sunni clerics asked the faithful to keep Eid a low-key affair and offer prayers indoors.Nawab Malik, Maharashtra minority affairs minister, on Saturday urged people not to gather in basements, parking areas, or any other place to offer prayers.“Our religious leaders have already urged people not to violate lockdown rules and to contribute in the best possible way to fight this challenge. The Muslim community will not be demanding any exemption and ready to celebrate Eid without any gatherings,” said Malik.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disease-dampens-eid-celebrations-across-india/story-VZc7XvClp0tDoJIenR5UrK.html
25-05-2020||India||Covid-19 surge pushes Mumbai to the brink||On May 10, a 35-year-old bank loan agent in Mumbai suddenly developed a temperature. With the city firmly in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic,his family was alarmed but he dismissed their concern, saying he hadn’t come in contact with any confirmed Covid-19 patient.He ran to the local medical store in the neighbourhood in Vakola, and bought a strip of paracetamol. When he went to bed that night, he thought his body temperature would be down to normal the next day.That didn’t happen. By morning, he was burning up and over the next two days, his condition slowly deteriorated. On May 13, his 38-year-old brother took him to VN Desai Hospital where an X-ray showed patches of pneumonia in his lungs that made the consulting doctor suspicious. He was referred to Cooper Hospital, a designated Covid-19 hospital in the city.“After standing in a line for two hours to take a slip to see a doctor, I was informed that the line for the fever clinic is different. By that time, my brother had already started having trouble breathing. So, I rushed him to a private nursing home,” said his brother.The nursing home refused to admit him without a swab test. So, the doctor at the nursing home prescribed a Covid test and he was taken to Hinduja Hospital for a test.After three days on May 16, the report confirmed that he was a Covid carrier.Worried, his brother called the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) helpline number (1916) for guidance. At 6pm that day, two doctors came to examine the patient.“The doctors informed me that at around 8pm, they will send an ambulance,” said the brother. But the vehicle didn’t arrive even at 10.30pm, prompting the brother to call the helpline again. “Finally after four hours of wait, at round 12.30am, the vehicle came,” said the brother.There was now a new problem – the ambulance didn’t have any oxygen support system, critical for a patient with severe breathing problems. By the time they reached the Guru Nanak Hospital, four kilometres away, the patient’s oxygen levels had dipped to dangerous levels. The hospital had no intensive care unit (ICU) beds available so the doctor referred him to Seven Hills Hospitals, 12km away. They reached the hospital at 1.45am. “Before we could enter, police stopped us at the gate and told us that there was no bed available. Despite repeated pleas, they didn’t allow us to go inside. Then they asked to go to Nair hospital [in central Mumbai],” said the brother.By now, he had travelled across five suburbs of the city, first to get a diagnosis and then, in search of a bed. Frantic, the brother dialed Nair Hospital, one of the largest Covid-19 facilities in Mumbai with 52 ICU beds, but was told there was none available.Four more hours were spent in the ambulance before a local politician helped the family get an ICU bed at the Jogeshwari Trauma Centre. The bed was available only after 9am.It was already 5am, so the brothers went home to rest. “My brother’s back was paining by sitting in the ambulance for so long and there was no oxygen support, he couldn’t even breathe, so I took him home. We rested for four hours, then went to Jogeshwari Trauma Centre,” said the 38-year-old.When they reached the hospital at 9am on May 18, they were informed that there were no vacant beds. After waiting for another three hours, at around 12pm, the patient finally was admitted to the ICU and given a bed – a week after his symptoms had worsened and two days after he was confirmed to be a Covid patient. At night on May 18, his brother received a call that the patient’s condition was severe and that he had been put on a ventilator. “Then, at 12.35am, the hospital informed me that my brother succumbed to his infection,” the brother said.Devastated with their loss and seething at the lax response of the authorities, the family researched his condition and found that patients develop pneumonia in the later stage of the infection. “This means he was already serious. But because of the delay of 18 hours due to unavailability of ambulances and bed, his condition deteriorated,” said the brother. “If he got treatment on time, I could have saved him.”The harrowing experience of the Vakola family is not isolated. On May 1, a family from Chembur visited five hospitals to get a 62-year-old woman admitted but couldn’t. Four days later, the woman succumbed to the infection without getting any treatment. “I had never felt so helpless as I did when I could not save my mother. I was ready to put in all my savings but no hospital was ready to admit and treat her,” said the daughter. A 38-year-old patient from Govandi could not find a bed for four days and was turned away from four government hospitals. He developed Covid symptoms on May 3; his condition is now critical but he has not even been administered a swab test.Much like New York was in March and April, Mumbai is struggling to cope with the surge of Covid patients. Hospitals are stretched to capacity, front-line staff are struggling to deal with physical, emotional and psychological trauma and tempers are running high among patients and medical staff. Doctors are contracting the infection by the dozen, fights are breaking out in hospital queues and bodies of deceased patients are being left behind in wards for hours on end. A worried civic body has taken over large sections of private hospitals and is looking to turn buses and school vans into makeshift ambulances. “Mumbai is on the verge of a health crisis,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultants. “The corporation should have made the arrangements earlier considering the huge population of Mumbai. Now, the helpline number has started giving a token number for the waiting list. They don’t even consider the patients who are critical,” he added. Mumbai reported its first infection on March 11, when two passengers from Dubai tested positive. But the city’s crisis grabbed national attention on April 1, when the first case was reported from the slum cluster of Dharavi, where more than a million people jostle in cheek-by-jowl shanties and tin-roofed rooms are often shared by eight or 10 people. Since then, the virus has raced through almost every neighbourhood of the coastal city, from the upmarket localities of Marine Drive and Malabar Hill to the working-class neighbourhoods of Worli and Sion. As of Sunday, Mumbai had 30, 542 cases with 988 fatalities. On average, the city has reported around 1,500 cases every day this week, with experts warning that the peak of the disease will come in the middle of June. On Sunday, the city crossed 30,000 cases with 1,725 new infections – its highest daily jump yet. This trajectory of the virus is well chronicled. When the disease pummeled New York in early March, the daily tally of cases suddenly jumped from the hundreds into several thousands. A week later, hospitals were overflowing and exhausted health care staff struggled to treat the patients who were being wheeled in almost every minute, as as depicted in unforgettable photos from that time of tired nurses with garbage bags for protective equipment. The Maharashtra government’s data says roughly 29% of the state’s patients need hospitalization. Daksha Shah, deputy health officer of the BMC, further added that 20% of the patients require ICU care and 5% need ventilators. In Mumbai, which has 21,297 active cases, Shah’s calculation translates to roughly 6,100 patients needing hospitalization, 4,200 patients needing ICU beds and 1,060 requiring ventilators. A separate calculation by the daily report of state medical education and drugs department pegged the percentage of patients requiring critical care at 5%. If this figure is extrapolated for Mumbai, it translates to around 1,000 patients. But the BMC controls just 530 ICU beds, though the capacity has now gone up to 1,165 after the government on Friday took over 80% of beds in private hospitals in the city. Additionally, the city has 589 ventilators, and 2,255 beds with oxygen support systems.“This will be inadequate,” said a top state health department officer on condition of anonymity. He said according to the government’s calculations, almost 0.5% of Mumbai will be infected by the end of June, which translated to at least 100,000 infections. At the 5% ICU requirement calculation mentioned earlier, this translates to 5,000 ICU beds.One big advantage Mumbai has over New York is that India has a much lower fatality rate than the US – 2.9% compared to 5.9%. But the city is grappling with rising panic and outdated technology.Government procedure dictates that a patient is supposed to call the BMC helpline and get themselves registered for a hospital bed, which is then allotted to the patient as soon as it is available. This may take between a few minutes to several hours. The BMC helpline is fielding 4,000 calls daily – out of which 1,800 are for bed requests -- but the lack of live dashboards means that helpline coordinators cannot guide patients on time, causing further delays.Volunteers of the number say unavailability of live updates from hospitals cripple their ability to help patients. “By the time we assign a bed to a caller, the bed gets booked by another critical patient. There are waiting lists in all tertiary care hospitals. So, we need to distribute the crowd to peripheral hospitals where beds are available. For that, we need a live dashboard to inform patients,” said a volunteer on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to talk to the media.In response, BMC officials said they have put in place a foolproof system.“We have appointed a doctor in the 1916 control room, who is supposed to gauge the need to allot an ICU bed, on call with the patient, after asking a set number of simple questions. These questions can help the doctor determine for the time being if the patient primarily needs an ICU bed. Every co-morbid patient does not need an ICU bed,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC.Officials also said they are developing a live dashboard in coordination with a private company that will be installed soon. “Only BMC officers will have access to the dashboard. It will get updated every 30 seconds. It will have the list both from private and civic-run hospitals. We can’t keep it open as people will unnecessarily start flocking to the centres,” added Kakani.Beds in Mumbai are divided into three categories: One, Covid Care Centres 1 and 2 (CCCs 1 and 2), the first for high-risk contacts of positive persons and the second for asymtomatic and mild symptomatic patients.Two, Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) for symptomatic patients and moderately ill patients and some patients with co-morbidity; and, three, Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) for patients showing prolonged symptoms of fever, cough, and breathlessness, patients with co-morbidity, Covid positive senior citizens, severely ill and critical patients who need ICUs. In all, there are 73,000 beds in Mumbai -- 5,500 DCH, 10,000 DCHC, 23,000 CCC1 (not for Covid patients), and 34,500 CCC2 beds. Currently, a total of 5,392 patients are admitted in the first and second categories of beds – the most critical. Out of this, 4,056 are in government and civic-run hospitals while 1,336 are in private hospitals. Kakani said the body has sufficient CCC, DCHC and DCH beds for Covid-19 patients. “It is true however, that there are limited number of ICU beds and these need to be used judiciously,” he admitted. According to the government, there are four main reasons for the shortage in critical care.One, many patients and their relatives prefer major hospitals to peripheral hospitals. “While we have beds available in peripheral hospitals, we cannot force a patient to go there if he doesn’t want to. The hospitals everyone chooses are the ones that are over burdened,” said a senior civic body official on condition of anonymity.Two, the stigma and panic around the infection prompt many families to not seek treatment on time. “They wait and watch for the symptoms to subside, but it only gets worse. Many patients come to hospitals at a much later stage of the infection, and then need critical healthcare,” said a second civic body official on condition of anonymity.Three, many patients insist that doctors put them on oxygen support even if their levels are normal. “Due to the anxiety and fear, they become breathless. Then they assume that their oxygen saturation is low. The recovery rate among patients between 20-40 years is high. We need to save the beds for senior citizens with co-morbid issues,” said Dr Om Srivastava, a city epidemiologist who is also part of the Covid task force.Four, many government officials feel private non-covid hospitals should not discharge a Covid-19 patient until a bed is found in a Covid hospital. “We coaxed private hospitals, offered them incentives, but it did not work. Hence we came up with the guidelines for 80% reservation of beds in all private hospitals, managed and distributed centrally by BMC,” said a third civic body official. The BMC says it is aware the city is yet to hit the caseload peak and is preparing for an even bigger surge in cases. So-called Jumbo facilities for asymptomatic patients in six locations are being converted into critical care units, with at least 10,000 beds added. At least 50% of these will have oxygen points as well and 10% beds will be reserved for virus patients who need dialysis.The BMC is also revamping mini buses and school buses to make ambulances and hopes this will add 350 vehicles to its 250-strong fleet. “The preparations we are making now will complete by May end. These are being made keeping June’s cases in mind,” said additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal.The surge of the pandemic has hit hard thousands of medical staff at the forefront of the fight against the virus in isolation wards. Interns, resident doctors, senior doctors, and nurses, all working in three shifts of eight hours each with personal protective equipment (PPE) as their only shield, are fighting a steep battle against not just the disease but also associated mental health concerns. In Mumbai alone, 300 medical staff have contracted the infection. “We can’t start the air conditioning due to possible transmission of the virus. In this heat, we have to work in PPE for 6-8 hours without even drinking water. With precipitation and dehydration, our body starts aching. We feel dizzy,” said a doctor stationed in the isolation ward of St George Hospital which has over 100 covid-19 patients. Many woman nurses and doctors complain of urinary tract infection (UTI) due to the dehydration. The problem gets worse during menstruation. “During the monthly cycle, women generally feel nauseous and weak. With the PPE on, we can’t even go to the washroom, to get refreshed,” said a nurse from Kasturba Gandhi Hospital.All the medical staff on Covid duty are given alternative accommodation in hotels or lodges. Many haven’t seen their family for over two months. “I have a 3-year-old daughter whom I have seen last in March. We do video chats everyday but I miss hugging her,” said Mahalaxmi Iyer, a nurse at Seven Hills Hospital, a resident of Vasai. At the Kasturba Gandhi Hospital, a 48-year-old midwife developed loose motions. So, she used an adult diaper for two days to avoid going to the washroom while on PPE. “I can’t take leave as we are already short staffed and I couldn’t afford going to the washroom repeatedly. So, I used an adult diaper. It felt uncomfortable in the beginning but later, I got used to it,” she said. The fear of contracting the infection is ever present. So far, over 75 resident doctors have contracted the infection on duty. Many of them are as young as 20 years. “We weren’t ready to face the situation. Even after the duty hours, we discuss the reports of patients. Many of us have developed anxiety. Then parents keep forcing us to come back home which adds on to the mental trauma,” said a nursing student from Sion hospital who contracted the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-surge-pushes-mumbai-to-the-brink/story-N3XsregWx5gEUGVBLGow8N.html
25-05-2020||India||IAF set to raise second LCA squadron in Sulur||The Indian Air Force is all set to raise its second squadron of the locally made light combat aircraft Tejas at Sulur in Tamil Nadu on May 27, people familiar with the development said on Sunday. The IAF’s first Tejas squadron was raised at the Sulur air base in 2016 with two aircraft and more planes joined the fleet progressively.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria is expected to travel to Sulur on Wednesday for the event. The second squadron is being raised with the first aircraft in the final operational clearance (FOC) configuration and more will be added later, officials said.The IAF has so far ordered 40 LCAs, split in the initial operational clearance (IOC) version and the more advanced and FOC configuration. The first squadron consists of IOC aircraft.“The raising of the squadron, though delayed, is welcome news. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited has to speed up production of the Tejas to meet the trust placed on it by the IAF; eight Tejas per year is just not acceptable,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.In March, the defence ministry gave the green light to the purchase of 83 LCA Mk-1A advanced Tejas jets from HAL. The contract is expected to be inked in the coming months.The deal, expected to be worth Rs 38,000 crore, is critical for HAL to prevent a complete halt of production at its facilities. HT reported on January 11 that HAL’s order books are empty beyond 2021-22 and new orders from the armed forces --- especially for the 83 jets --- are critical for continuity in production.The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far.The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array radar, advanced beyond-visual-range missiles and significantly improved maintainability. HAL is expected to deliver the first Mk-1A jet to the IAF three years after the deal is signed.The IAF is struggling with a shortage of warplanes. Compared to an optimum strength of 42-plus units required to fight a two-front war, the count of the IAF’s fighter squadrons has shrunk to 31. The first four of the 36 Rafales ordered from France are expected to arrive in India by July-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-set-to-raise-second-lca-squadron-in-sulur/story-JXmn3V2KhbqXm3fNDAYUnM.html
25-05-2020||India||Addressing Covid outbreak with clinical studies of Ayush systems: Ayush minister||The ministry of Ayush (ayurveda, yoga & naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy) is also active in India’s fight against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In an interview, Ayush minister Shripad Yesso Naik talks about initiatives launched by his ministry and studies being carried out to generate scientific evidence in favour of ayurvedic herbs in the treatment of Covid-19.How is the Ayush ministry contributing to managing the Covid-19 situation in the country?The ministry of Ayush has taken several initiatives like research in collaboration with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), public health institutes, and through its research councils and national institutes. It has also released health advisory vetted from Ayush experts toward immune boosting measures for protection against Covid-19. Also, there is a dedicated dashboard to provide real-time information on all Covid-19 related activities by the Ayush ministry.There is some amount of skepticism among a section of people related to trying Ayush medicines either as prophylaxis or for treating Covid-19 symptoms. Is there any attempts being made to generate scientific evidence in support of traditional medicines?The ministry is addressing Covid-19 pandemic problem through clinical studies (prophylactic, stand-alone and add-on interventions) of Ayush systems, and also studying the impact of Ayush-based prophylactic interventions in high-risk population. It’s also studying impact of Ayush advocacies and Ayush measures for prevention of Covid-19 among the population. The ministry has set up an interdisciplinary Ayush research and development task force with a group of experts to formulate and develop strategies for this initiative. In order to generate tangible evidence the ministry has also initiated collaborative clinical studies as a joint initiative of ministries of Ayush, health, and science & technology through CSIR with technical support of ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) for studying identified Ayurveda herbs as add on to hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19.Also, various prophylactic, clinical and population-based survey studies have been initiated to address the challenge of Covid-19. The ministry has invited research proposals through a dedicated website portal for Covid-19, which were thoroughly screened by a screening committee and the task force to identify and study best possible leads. In the past, certain preventive advisories against Covid-19 were issued by the Ayush ministry that had mentioned some medicines for it, but were later withdrawn after it was criticized as the disease currently has no cure. Will you clarify?The Ayush ministry’s advisory suggested immune boosting measures and certain symptomatic management with a disclaimer that this was not the treatment or cure of Coviod-19, and it was not withdrawn and is still available online. Further immune boosting advisories with daily used spices, herbs and lifestyle have been released so maximum public could benefit.Since everyone is talking about adopting a new normal in the post Covid-19 world, including in medical practice, how do you see things changing for practicing alternative systems of medicine?There has been a paradigm shift from the disease: cure-oriented medical practices toward health-oriented health- care services where people are becoming more and more aware toward prevention of disease and salutogenesis (medical approach focusing on factors that support human health and well-being) that is making the body strong and with improved immunity so to have a healthy life. Post Covid-19. I believe this will further strengthen. Ayush has a major role to play in this as its main objective is to maintain health of the healthy and prevent the disease.Now that Aatmanirbharta is the buzz word in almost all spheres, what are the focus areas for the Ayush ministry towards promoting be self-reliance?Aatmanirbharta is certainly important for us and the best way toward making a stronger, healthier and better India. With its introduction in Ayushman Bharat and initiation of health and wellness centres, it will certainly be achieved in near future. We are also committed in propagating advocacies on healthy lifestyle and use of common herbs etc of Ayush systems, yoga, pranayam etc. among masses to make a better Aatmanirbhar (in terms of health) India. Ayush medicines have a market outside India but still lag behind in comparison to the Chinese traditional medicine market. How do you plan to promote brand make-in-India?Ministry of Ayush has taken several initiatives to bring Ayush on a global platform, and to improve its market like establishment of Forum for Indian Traditional Medicine at Research & Information System for developing countries ( an international agency which specializes in the issues related to international economic development, trade, investment and technology and is an autonomous body set under the administrative control of external affairs ministry). Also, there are two voluntary certification schemes for ayurveda products developed by the ministry-- certification scheme of Quality Council of India (QCI), an autonomous body, and certificate of pharmaceutical products for ayurveda products issued by Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for the purpose of export. QCI scheme provides two kinds of certificates: Ayush standards mark for Ayurveda products complying with domestic regulations, and Ayush premium mark for products complying with international norms. The ministry, along with commerce ministry, is also organizing International Arogya to promote the Indian system of medicine at a global level, and develop strategic partnership in the field of medical and integrated health-care sector between India and other countries. The ministry is also working in collaboration with Ernst and Young for the promotion of investment and ease of doing business in Ayush sector.The worldwide herbal market products are around $6.2 billion and estimated to reach $5 trillion by the year 2050. Currently, the demand for traditional Indian herbal products or Ayurveda has increased tremendously in India as well as at the international level with rising awareness about health and fitness and changing lifestyle. We are working to strengthen it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/addressing-covid-outbreak-with-clinical-studies-of-ayush-systems-ayush-minister/story-MwxBcgYGSGT88CMEv6rBxJ.html
25-05-2020||India||UP rolls back mobile ban at Covid-19 wards||The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday withdrew an order baning the use of mobile phones by Covid patients in isolation wards after members of the medical fraternity and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav questioned the move. .Director general of the medical education department, Dr KK Gupta, issued a new order which said all patients carrying mobile phones will have to disclose it to medical personnel, who would disinfect the phones and chargers and hand them over to patients at the time of admission.“Disinfection will also be done at the time of discharge. Patients will not share mobile phones with anyone else during admission,” Gupta’s new order said.The earlier order, which reached all medical institutes, had restricted patients from bringing their cell phones to isolation wards and directed medical teams to provide one or two common phones.“Patients in Level-2 and Leve-3 Covid hospitals should not be admitted with mobile phones as it spreads infection,” the earlier order had said.Akhilesh Yadav called Covid quarantine centres ‘torture centres’ and slammed the state government over the order. “The government wants to prevent mobile phones from sending out the truth about mismanagement and bad condition of the centres,” he said/He tweeted: “If mobile phones spread infection, then why not ban them in the entire country? Mobile phones become mental support in loneliness. But the truth is it exposes mismanagement and bad condition of hospitals and the government does not want the truth to reach the people; that’s the reason behind the ban. The need is to sanitise mobile phones than ban them.”The ban order also surprised health experts, who said a cell phone used exclusively by one patient can’t spread infection. “If one or two phones are used by 10 patients, it can always spread infection, no matter how many times the paramedical staff sanitise them,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of the Indian Medical Association, Lucknow branch.He said coronavirus means physical distance and not emotional distance from family and that cell phones help as stress-busters too. The ban order purportedly came after some patients made videos of the problems they faced and one even gave a video interview to a foreign news agency explaining all the problems faced by her during hospital stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-rolls-back-mobile-ban-at-covid-19-wards/story-IOh9aIMZeAlqikuix9gGXN.html
25-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Some states look beyond colour-coding||Colour-coding of zones based on the prevalence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases is losing relevance in several states that are primarily focusing on containment areas instead to contain the infection, according to local officials.For example, authorities in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Punjab, West Bengal and Jharkhand have decided against identifying red zone districts in the fourth phase of the lockdown that began on May 18 with the Centre relaxing guidelines to help businesses open after an unprecedented lockdown.In the latest lockdown guidelines by the home ministry, states have been given the power to define red, orange and green zones that have been instrumental in the strategy for imposing area-specific curbs in the previous phase of curbs between May 4 and May 17. While stricter curbs were implemented in red zones, orange zones got several relaxations. The rules were significantly eased for green zones.“Under the new guidelines, States and Union Territories (UTs) will now delineate Red, Green and Orange zones taking into consideration the parameters shared by the Health Ministry,” the government said on May 17. These zones can be a district, or a municipal corporation, or even smaller administrative units such as sub-divisions.Earlier, it was the Centre that came out with two lists — on April 15 and May 1 — identifying red zones (with maximum Covid-19 cases), orange zones (with fewer infections) and green zones (Covid-19-free areas), though several states expressed dismay over the process. In the first list, India had 130 red zones, while the second list identified 170 such areas.The new guidelines added that within red and orange zones, “containment and buffer zones will be as demarcated by the local authorities, after taking into consideration the Health Ministry guidelines”.An official in Chhattisgarh, which has identified four blocks as red zones, said: “We have gone by the central government rule, which allows just a locality or a block, instead of an entire district, to be declared a red zone,” said the official who did not want to be named.Till last week, four districts in the state were in the red zone defined by the central government. Now, in the four red zone blocks, Chhattisgarh has 44 containment centres, same as it had on May 17. “The zones are declared keeping in mind the present situation and geographical area,” the official added.The Centre has laid down some guidelines for states to help them define the zones. The parameters include active cases, active cases per lakh population, doubling rate and case fatality rate, testing ratio and sample positivity rate. Similarly, it has asked local authorities to focus on mapping of cases, geographical dispersion of cases, and enforcing strict perimeter control in case of containment zones, which can be broadly defined as epicentres of infections.On Saturday, Jharkhand placed 21 districts with Covid-19 cases in orange zones. “At present, the state has no red zone district as none of the 24 districts... all 21 affected districts are placed in orange zones, and three other districts, which have not reported any case so far, are green zones,” said state health department principal secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni.Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, too, have done away with the concept of zones, and have taken a cluster-based approach. Till May 17, Andhra Pradesh had five red districts and Telangana six. Now, the focus is on Andhra’s 341 clusters and Telangana’s 130.Andhra Pradesh’s nodal Covid-19 officer, Arja Sreekanth, said clusters that report several fresh cases in a five-day period are classified as “very active”. The two states have given powers to district collectors to identify these clusters and implement strict lockdown norms there. According to federal guidelines, lockdown relaxations across the country are not applicable to containment zones. “The number of containment clusters keep changing on a day-to-day basis, depending on the increase or decrease in the number of Covid-19 cases,” S Subrahmanyam, an official in Andhra’s Covid-19 command control room, said.Kerala, too, has discontinued the colour-coding and adopted containment strategies giving the police powers not to allow people in these areas to move out of their houses. Karnataka has adopted a similar approach. “The number of containment zones is a dynamic number which changes on a daily basis,” said a Karnataka health department official, who was not willing to be named.“The colour categorization was needed in the initial stages to prevent quick spread of Covid to new areas in the district. We were able to contain the infection to certain areas, which shows the strategy worked...(now) the states should decide on how to manage the Covid-19 hot spots,” VK Paul, member incharge of health, Niti Aayog, said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-states-look-beyond-colour-coding/story-S9MmJKsg1XZNLfakSnnmQP.html
25-05-2020||India||Centre identifies 4 cities as role models for handling Covid-19 pandemic||Four cities -- Jaipur, Indore, Chennai and Bengaluru -- could serve as possible role models for other urban centres in handling the Covid-19 pandemic that India is striving to control while moving to restart the economy.In the last few days, the Centre has organized meetings between different municipal bodies to share their experiences in two broad aspects of Covid19 management: effective practises in handling a very high number of positive cases and keeping the mortality rates low, said officials aware of the developments.It identified Jaipur and Indore metropolitan areas for innovate ways of tackling a high caseload and Chennai and Bengaluru as examples of large cities that are able to keep their mortality rates low. Also read: Surge in Covid-19 cases pushes Mumbai to the brinkMany Indian municipalities are facing challenges such as shorter case-doubling time, higher confirmation rates and higher mortality rates than the national average while issues like perimeter control of containment zones, mapping of buffer zones and house-to-house surveillance require more effective management. Slums and other high-density pockets inside the municipalities pose higher risk in Covid-19 management in the top urban centres.Both Indore and Jaipur are aggressively conducting house-to-house surveys and contact tracing. While Indore has formed special patrolling teams for by-lanes, Jaipur has limited groceries or vegetable vendors in different localities to curb the potential super spreaders. As shops or milk booths see a large number of footfalls during the day, municipal workers and the local police are keeping a close eye on these places to ensure regular sanitizing and other measures.Chennai and Bangaluru account for a sizeable number of Covid cases i but have been able to keep the mortality rate to about just 1%-- much lower than the India’s national average of around 3%.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayA senior official said that the two southern cities had led by example in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Both Chennai and Bengaluru have optimized the use of ventilators and patient triage or assigning the degree of urgency in cases while handling a large number of patients,” said the official, who requested anonymity .“We have seen some cities where ventilators have been used irrationally. But the patient management in southern states, particularly in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, has been much better,” he added.The strategy adopted by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation was also lauded in the recent meetings. The city has established a network of private hospitals and municipal authorities for pooling health infrastructure. The city is also working to make a portal to display online the availability of beds in different hospitals apart from GPS-enabled ambulances for real-time tracking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-identifies-4-model-cities-for-covid-handling/story-9dm4dVcsqvZU0YGWMynbEN.html
25-05-2020||India||Seer among two killed in Maharashtra’s Nanded; accused arrested||A sadhu residing in his ashram in Nagthana in Maharashtra’s Nanded district, some 250 kilometres from here, and another person were killed on Sunday morning, with police stating that robbery may have been the motive.The accused, a history-sheeter with a 10-year-old murder case against his name, was held a few hours later from Tanur police station limits along the Telangana state border, police added.Superintendent of Police Vijaykumar Magar said sadhu Shivacharya Nirnay Rudrapratap Maharaj (33) and a 50-year-old man identified as Bhagwan Shinde were killed around 4am in Nagthana.“There is a possibility Sainath and Shinde met each other at a Zilla Parishad school some 750 metres away from the ashram where the deceased sadhu stayed. Lingade killed Shinde first, kept his body in a bathroom, and then went to where the sadhu resided, killed him,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seer-among-two-killed-in-nanded-accused-arrested/story-yNmtA1NiIjXOT6QekvQZnN.html
25-05-2020||India||Delhiwale: An auto in Nehru Place||Parked on the side of the road, an auto rickshaw driver and his green-and-yellow rickshaw are waiting for customers.This used to be one of the most ordinary sights of our city, but recently the table has turned and the most ordinary has become extraordinary—no thank you, coronavirus!After a considerable easing of the lockdown restrictions, the city is sprouting back to action, like a dead man regaining life. Every mundane hint of activity has something magical, and so it is with Som Nath and his auto rickshaw. One change has to be noticed though: his driver’s uniform no longer comprise of just grey shirt and grey pants—but also of a mask.“It’s my second day of leaving home to work again,” says the middle-aged Mr Nath. He has been on the spot here in south Delhi’s Nehru Place for about half an hour. “I’m not getting many customers.” One of the reasons is that he is agreeing to board one single person only for each ride, not two (forget three) even if they belong to the same household. “Every auto driver is following the same rule,” he shrugs his shoulders.For two months, Mr Nath stayed cooped up with his wife, Mala, and two sons at their home in Sangam Vihar. His older son is a mechanic and the younger is in tenth standard. There were no earnings during that time but “at least I got cheap rations of atta and dal.” Buying fresh vegetables was not always possible due to their high prices, he notes.During the course of the conversation, Mr Nath remarks that scores of daily wage labourers have been emptying the cities to go back to their villages during the lockdown. His circumstances were not as desperate. “And anyway, I have almost nothing to support myself in my village... we don’t even have a little landholding.”He moved out from his village in Pratapgarh, UP, twenty years ago.About ten minutes pass and no customers approach Mr Nath’s rickshaw. It’s a blinding hot afternoon and the temperature is hovering around mid-40s.“I do feel scared of catching the virus from infected customers,” he confesses to a query. The driver takes precautions, however. He rarely removes his mask except to drink water. And he rubs his palms vigorously with hand sanitizer every time he finishes a transaction with a customer.“But I try not to be tensed. Everyone is passing through this same problem.”Now another auto rickshaw stops by the pavement. Its driver steps out. He too is in a mask.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-an-auto-in-nehru-place/story-aVq09ZhAcZvg6Upt2aWkmM.html
25-05-2020||India||20% beds in 117 private hospitals to be reserved for Covid-19 surge||Private hospitals with 50 or more beds will need to set aside 20% of their bed strength for Covid-19 patients, the Delhi government ordered on Sunday in a measure meant to prepare the city’s health care system for a surge in infections. The capital has 117 private hospitals that will be covered by this rule, which officials said was necessitated because dedicated privately run Covid hospitals were now running close to their capacity. In exchange, the government has allowed these hospitals to add 25% more beds by invoking the natural calamity or disaster clause in the Delhi Nursing Home Rules 2011.Delhi reported 508 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking the count to 13,418. According to the health bulletin, 30 more deaths were added to the death toll that now stands at 261.The new deaths appeared to have taken place more than 24 hours ago and added to the Covid fatality tally after reviews.“It has been found that in the recent past majority of the beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients in dedicated private hospitals are occupied at any given time. Therefore, there is a need to increase the number of beds dedicated for Covid-19 patients in the private hospitals in the city,” the order, issued by director general of health services Dr Nutan Mundeja, said.The 117 hospitals will be allowed to bill Covid-19 patients as per their rates. But for the extra 25% beds allowed, they can charge non-Covid-19 patients only 50% of the treatment cost in the most economic category.“The billing of non-Covid patients admitted on extra beds shall not be more than 50% of the lowest economy category of the concerned hospital as per earlier practice during upsurge of cases of vector-borne diseases,” the order read.During the 2015 dengue outbreak in the city, when almost 16,000 were infected and 60 people died, the Delhi government had in a similar manner asked private hospitals to reserve beds for the treatment of dengue patients.“An increase in the number of cases in the city is likely, but even if there is a surge, the administration and the health teams in Delhi are prepared to handle it,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and chairperson of a five-member committee set up by the government in March to guide the chief minister on preparedness measures.Reacting to the government directive, Dr Sanjay Mehta,head of medical services, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, said there was no question of not abiding by it.“I haven’t seen the order yet but if there is a directive we will abide by it. Even though we are not a dedicated Covid hospital but as a responsible organisation, we have taken steps keeping patient and staff safety in mind such as first-level triaging, separate wards for clinically suspect cases, etc. 20% is a huge number so we will have to arrange for manpower, etc., as you cannot mix the staff, which can be harmful for patient safety,” he said.While large hospitals are expected to cope with the rule, it could lead to feasibility concerns for smaller ones if they were to spare beds from their existing strength.“My hospital primarily offers cardiac services, and at any given time my bed capacity is 90% filled with serious cardiac patients who cannot be discharged unless fully recovered. Currently, you cannot even refer these patients anywhere as not many hospitals would be open to taking patients from other hospitals. In such a scenario, taking out 20% of my 106 beds will be difficult. It’s not that I don’t want to help the government but there’s genuine problem,” says Dr RN Kalra, medical director, Kalra Hospital.“Delhi government is working on adding more beds in the private sector next week,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department.Eight private hospitals with a capacity of 617 beds are presently treating Covid-19 patients. Of these, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Jasola is at full capacity of 81 patients, according to government data. Another four of the eight hospitals, Max Smart Super-Specialty hospital in Saket, Maha Durga Charitable hospital in Model town, Fortis Shalimar Bagh and Sir Ganga Ram City hospital in Rajinder Nagar have been running at 80% capacity.Only the recently added Cygnus hospital was at 20% occupancy, Delhi’s daily health bulletin shows, but the hospital was shut down on Saturday and the patients evacuated after a fire broke out. Two other hospitals – Saroj hospital in Rohini and Khushi hospital in Dwarka – with 100 beds in total, have been designated as a Covid-19 hospitals by the Delhi government and are yet to start accepting patients, as they have only recently been designated.Apart from private ones, two Delhi government and four central government hospitals have a bed capacity scalable up to almost 4,000 beds. These hospitals on an average are running at 44% capacity, according to the data.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is running at about 85% capacity of around 600 beds that are presently operational, but is in the process of adding another 200 beds. “The hospital has about 500 patients and space for another 100 or so. But the capacity can be scaled up to 800 beds,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS.Lok Nayak, which has reserved all of its 2,000 beds for Covid-19 patients, has the highest bed capacity in a government hospital. At present, 536 people are admitted, meaning it is running at almost 27% capacity.“In March, when one of the first cases in the city was reported, nobody thought so many people would get infected. And, now with the lockdown being eased, people are on the streets, markets are open and the number of cases is likely to go up. However, even if there is a surge, the cases can be managed well if the government and the private sector work together,” said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care in New Delhi and former head of pulmonology at AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-beds-in-delhi-s-117-pvt-hospitals-to-be-reserved-for-covid-patients/story-IIOpUI6p1wXFgAzuRIXnbK.html
25-05-2020||India||For migrants’ kids, school, friends, home give way to hunger, hardship||Under a flyover near the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh (UP) border in Ghazipur, eight-year-old Guddi was trying to engage her three younger siblings in play on a hot Thursday afternoon. “Keep your hands on each other’s shoulders and make a circle. Let’s all laugh together now,” she said. Her siblings, two sisters and a brother, obeyed.Guddi’s family was among hundreds of migrant workers gathered in Ghazipur with the hope of boarding a bus for their villages. Her family is from a village in UP’s Hardoi district and had come to Delhi to work in a garment factory five years ago.Around 2pm, as a food distribution van arrived, she and other children quickly queued up to collect their share. “My mother asked me to engage my siblings until the food van arrives. They were nagging her for food. I will make them eat now,” she said.Hundreds of children of migrant workers like Guddi are on the roads with their parents, struggling to return home after losing their work during the lockdown imposed on March 25 to curb the spread of Covid-19. Braving the scorching heat, without proper food and water, they walk to the city’s borders or registration centres to enrol themselves to travel back to their villages.While parents take care of their belongings, it’s the responsibility of the children to collect food and water distributed by good samaritans and NGOs, and look after their younger siblings.According to the Delhi government’s data, as many as 410,000 migrant workers have registered to travel back to their homes. Of them, around 150,000 had already left as of Saturday. A majority of them have left aboard Shramik Special trains, with most of the trains heading to UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand. Some have also left aboard buses arranged by the government.Unaware of what’s happening around them, some children think that they are going to their villages for a summer break. “We have walked from our room in Narela to here (Ghazipur). It’s tiring. But Baba (father) said we will have to save money for our stay in the village during the summer break. He even massaged my legs when they started aching,” said Rani, 9, a class 3 student at a municipal school in Narela. Her family was has been trying to get on a bus to Bhagalpur in Bihar.Rani’s father Deepak said he could not tell his daughter about the circumstances.“ How do I tell her that I do not have money to take an auto? We are left with only ₹2,000. My factory owner has not paid us for a month and now asked us to leave. I could not even tell her we are not going for a summer break but because of the circumstances,” he said.Some are aware of the financial hardships their families are facing. Roshan (11), a class 7 student in a government school in Bawana, is worried for his family. “My father’s employer had asked him not to come back to work. He was working in a factory there. Mother has also lost her work. We do not even have land in our village in Bhagalpur. I’ve heard my parents discussing that we will have to work on someone else’s land in the village now,” he said. His family managed to cross the Delhi-UP border earlier this week and reached Ghaziabad. From there, they boarded a bus home. “My school friends must be busy with the activities and work they get on WhatsApp from school. I also receive a message of activities and practice work every day from school. But I can’t use the phone much now to save the battery and internet for our journey. I hope we manage to collect enough money and return before school reopens,” he said.For many girls, going back to village life means “loss of freedom”. Shabana ,14, had come to Delhi in February to get admission in a government school in class 7. “My cousin convinced my parents to send me with her to study in Delhi. She (cousin) and her husband were working in a bag printing unit in Sadar Bazar. I was so happy here. For the first time in my life, I wore a pair of jeans here. It’s not allowed at home. But they have lost their jobs. I will have to go back to the village school now,” she said. She and her cousin’s family had reached Ghazipur on Thursday to board a bus for Badaun in UP.Experts said it’s worrisome that children are going through such difficulties. Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, said the institute’s staff has been interacting with migrant families and their children in the backdrop of the pandemic. “It’s worrying to see children taking the role of adults. They are not only taking care of their siblings but also their parents. Many studies have shown children have more resilience than adults. If a natural setting is provided to them at the earliest, there is a possibility these hardships won’t affect them psychologically. But if it lasts for a long time, there is reason to be worried,” he said. Authorities at government and municipality schools have flagged concerns about children dropping out . “It’s very difficult to contact many of these kids who have left for their states. We tried to provide them academic help before the summer vacations were announced, but could not reach out to many. We don’t know where they are and if they will come back,” said Vibha Singh, principal of a municipal school in east Delhi.Ranjana Prasad, a member of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Children Rights (DCPCR), said it’s too early to predict if the reverse migration will lead to dropouts in schools. “We still don’t know when schools will reopen. It’s possible most migrant families will return when things settle, since there are fewer work opportunities in the villages and a scarcity of schools,” Prasad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-migrants-kids-school-friends-home-give-way-to-hunger-hardship/story-CNuDyEBRavfcLxqqRpfRIN.html
25-05-2020||India||‘States will need permission to hire workers from UP’: CM Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said his government will lay down stringent conditions for ensuring social security of workers from UP who are hired by other states. Other states will also need to seek permission from his government before engaging workers from UP, he said.“If any state wants manpower, the state government will have to guarantee social security and insurance of the workers. Without our permission they will not be able to take our people…because of the way they were treated in some states,” he said in an interaction with journalists through video conferencing.The CM said all migrant workers who have returned to the state were being registered and their skills mapped by his administration. Any state or entity interested in hiring them will need to take care of their social, legal and monetary rights.Adityanath also asked called for the creation of a migration commission that will look into various factors related to the rights of migrant workers and ensure they aren’t exploited.Prof Amitabh Kundu, distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said requiring government permission for employing people could face a legal challenge as the Constitution guarantees the freedom of movement and residence and employment of workers.“Article 19 (1)(D) guarantees freedom to move freely, and 19(1)(e) the freedom to settled in any part of the country…so the need for permission can be legally challenged,” Prof. Kundu said.He also said the demand for labour in the southern states outstrips the employment avenues in UP. “UP does not have the capacity to absorb all the returnees, as the population growth is higher than the national average,” he said.Out-of-work migrant workers who are returning to the state has emerged as a big challenge for the government. Though the UP CM was among the first to send buses to bring back stranded workers and students, which out pressure on other state to follow suit; the government was criticised for not providing organised transport to the workers during the lockdown, which forced thousands to walk.Acknowledging that workers trying to get back home on foot was a big challenge, Adityanath said once the government had made arrangements for buses, it had to also face a second challenge of screening and quarantining the returnees.He said state ministers were divided into groups to make policies. “ One committee was assigned to look for policies for livelihood options for workers in urban and rural areas...Second committee was to deal with business sector; to provide for the workers, and the chief secretary was tasked to coordinate with the Centre and other states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-will-need-permission-to-hire-workers-from-up-cm-adityanath/story-jwGCUoZevZ0FrqzNC3XrAK.html
25-05-2020||India||This is what you call a hug curtain and it’s going viral!||Amid the lockdown, Paige, a10-year old girl from California created a plastic curtain with arm slots so that she could hug her grandparents while quarantined! The girl, whose mom Lindsay Orkay works as a nurse, had self isolated herself from her daughter. Paige spent hours to complete the so-called hug curtain created using shower curtains, a hot glue gun and disposable plates. She said she got her inspiration after watching a video of someone making a blanket to hug their family members.”She came up with the idea, she laid it out in the family room and spent multiple hours working on it,” Paige’s mother, Lindsay Okray, told a news website, KABC. In times like these when we need our family most, many providing essential services are away. Paige’s hug curtain went viral on social media, and netizens praised her for a coming up with such a lovely idea to make her grandparents feel loved. Closer home, essential workers say it was a bittersweet feeling to be away from loved ones, and they craved for their touch. “I was happy to serve the nation and sad to be away from family physically. I had been working in the hospital for a week continuously. When I came home, my daughter ran towards me and I had to move away. Tears welled up in my eyes but to keep her safe, I had to be away,” says Priya Suresh, a nurse employed with a Noida hospital.Similarly, when a police officer comes back home after his/her duty, they have to quarantine themselves from their family. Recently, a moving image of a police officer sitting outside his home and eating went viral. In the picture, his daughter stood at the door gazing at him as he ate.Until a week ago, Monika Bhardwaj, DCP North Delhi, had to hide herself from her little daughters to avoid all physical contact. “I have twin daughters who are just 3-years-old, they couldn’t understand why they couldn’t meet me. ‘Mumma ke sath keeda ata hai (an insect comes along with mom) is what we used to tell them but they still wanted to be with me. So I hid from them. Initially, erratic work hours and new challenges made life very stressful. Playing with my kids is always a stress buster but I couldn’t even do that,” shares Monika Bhardwaj, DCP North Delhi.The police officer says that many of her colleagues didn’t even go home and stayed away from family as they were involved in ground work amid the coronavirus outbreak. “That’s how it is for us, but then our commitment to duty comes first,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-is-what-you-call-a-hug-curtain-and-it-s-going-viral/story-9hsCN1ZQnfxCWYePyfkhJI.html

But the lack of transport to Kerala turned out to be a roadblock for the students. A few of them contacted Supreme Court advocate Haris Beeran, who sent an email to Menon, highlighting the issue and seeking his help.“I have been informed that there are students from Kerala who are stranded and would like to return to their hometown,” Beeran said in his email.Beeran said the students had registered with the Kerala government’s website but nobody from that state had contacted them.“It has also been informed to them that there are trains running from Delhi and Punjab, which are transporting stranded students to Kerala. Since the route of these trains do not permit them to pass through Chhattisgarh, they have no other option but to seek assistance from the government of Chhattisgarh and the state government will have to take some measures to transport these stranded and helpless students back to their state,” the email said.Menon, who hails from Kerala, conveyed the situation to the state government through advocate general Satish Chandra Verma.The three buses carrying the students are expected to arrive in Kerala on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-hc-intervenes-to-send-stranded-medical-students-home/story-7uvYra4JrAph6MwZNLYitM.html
