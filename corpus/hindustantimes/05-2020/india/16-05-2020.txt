He sat on a footpath with the migrants and interacted with them for over an hour, the Congress said and alleged the Delhi police later detained the workers citing a direction to do so. The police refuted the claim. “We have not detained any migrant. Rahul Gandhi came and interacted with the migrants. Later, his supporters took the migrants in their vehicles,” said deputy police commissioner (south-east Delhi) R P Meena.In a video the Congress released, Mahesh Kumar, one of the migrants, said their group of 13 migrants, including a child, was squatting on the footpath when Gandhi met them. “He asked us to speak about our problems. We told him that we do not have enough food and water. We have spent 50 days without much work and have worked for only 4-5 days in between,” he said. Kumar added that Gandhi promised to make arrangements for their return.The Congress said that the migrant workers worked at a factory in Ambala and were waiting for their dues to be paid. It added that the Congress’s Delhi and Uttar Pradesh units have been asked to facilitate their travel to Jhansi, around 500 km away. Gandhi has been critical of the government’s handling of the migrant crisis. On Saturday, he tweeted about the latest accident involving migrant workers in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya. “I am hurt by the news of the death of 24 labourers and the injuries to many people in UP’s Auraiya. I express my deepest condolences to the families of the deceased and hope the injured get well soon,” he tweeted.Migrant workers left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown imposed in late March have continued to walk and cycle back to their homes even as buses have been arranged for them since late April and trains from May 1 onwards.

But care must be taken to safeguard our start-ups, which have enormous prospects, from being bought over,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The minister said the list of weapons banned for import will be reviewed every year and more items will be added to it after discussions with the department of military affairs (DMA). This implies India will have to compulsorily develop technology for the defence systems and platforms figuring on the negative import list.One of the key responsibilities assigned by the government to the DMA, headed by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, is to promote the use of indigenous military equipment in the armed forces.Imports account for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements and it has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for weapons and systems including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers.Sitharaman highlighted the need for the “realistic setting” of general staff qualitative requirements (GSQRs) of weapons and platforms. “Sometimes unrealistic quality requirements are set and quite a lot of time is spent in searching for suppliers who will meet all those requirements…you will end up with just one supplier and since buying from a single supplier is not permitted, you do the entire circle all over again,” she said. The minister also spoke about overhauling trials and testing procedures.GSQRs are the specifications put out by the armed forces for the equipment they need. “The point about having ‘realistic’ GSQRs is debatable; it is inconceivable that the forces are given equipment that doesn’t meet their operational requirements fully. Phase-wise development of a war fighting system is an accepted methodology but GSQRs must meet operational necessity in full,” said Air Vice Marshal Bahadur.The minister said the corporatisation of the OFB would help improve autonomy, accountability and efficiency in ordnance supplies.The Confederation of Indian Industry said the government’s focus on domestic manufacturing was encouraging as the country was among the largest importers of defence equipment in the world.CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee said: “The list of non-importable items and corporatisation of the OFB are some landmark steps and will boost the confidence of domestic manufacturers. The increase in FDI limit will attract foreign funds into this sector along with technology infusion.”India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the United States and China, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in a report released in April.Sitharaman also announced giving the private sector a role in India’s space programme, including in satellites, launches and space-based services. For boosting private participation in space activities, government will provide level playing field for private companies in satellites, launches and space-based services.Also, the government will provide predictable policy and regulatory environment to private players, she said.The private sector will be allowed to use ISRO’s facilities and other relevant assets to improve their capacities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-higher-fdi-local-weapons-for-self-reliant-defence-sector/story-TkWwgfAwZuTnm70ek7xamL.html

It is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm, in the next couple of days, is expected to affect the West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts, the India Meteorological Department said on Saturday.It is likely to make landfall on West Bengal coast as a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ on May 20 afternoon but the trajectory is still being studied closely by scientists who said details will be available on Sunday.The cyclonic storm is currently lying about 1040 km south of Paradip, Odisha; 1200 km south-southwest of Digha in West Bengal and 1300 km south-southwest of Khepupara in Bangladesh.It will intensify into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours (by May 17) and further intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm during the subsequent 24 hours by May 18. “It is very likely to move north-northwestwards initially till May 17 and then recurve north-northeastwards across northwest Bay of Bengal towards West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts during May 18 and 20,” IMD’s Cyclone Warning Division said on Saturday.Fishermen are advised not to venture into south Bay of Bengal between May 16 and 17, to central Bay of Bengal between May 17 and 18 and north Bay of Bengal between May 19 and 20. Fishermen are also advised not to venture into north Bay of Bengal along and off North Odisha, West Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh coast between May 18 and 20.“For now we know that the cyclone is moving towards West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts. We will give details of landfall location on Sunday morning and an evacuation strategy can be made after that. State governments are being alerted. It may make landfall on West Bengal coast,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“Adverse weather can be expected in Odisha and West Bengal coastal areas between May 18 and 20. These states are under pre-cyclone watch. Actions to be taken will be decided tomorrow as we get more details of its trajectory. For now, the cyclone is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and move towards West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts,” said Sunita Devi, IMD scientist in-charge for cyclones.Squally wind speed reaching 45 to 55 kmph, gusting to 65 kmph is prevailing over southeast and adjoining southwest Bay of Bengal currently. It is likely to increase to 90-100 kmph, gusting to 110 kmph over eastcentral and adjoining west central Bay of Bengal by May 17 morning, 120-130kmph, gusting to 145 kmph over southern parts of central Bay of Bengal by May 18 morning, 155-165 kmph, gusting to 180 kmph over northern parts of central Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Bay of Bengal on May 19, and 160-170 kmph, gusting to 190 kmph over north Bay of Bengal by May 20.Sea condition will be high (6-9 meters wave height/34-47 knots wind) over southwest and adjoining central Bay of Bengal from the May 16 night, very high (9-14 metres wave height /38-63 knots wind) over the same region from May 17 morning. It will become phenomenal (over 14 metres wave height/64 knots) over southern parts of central Bay of Bengal on May 18, over northern parts of central Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Bay of Bengal on May 19 and over north Bay of Bengal on May 20, according to IMD’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-to-hit-odisha-wb/story-z0mIS2jnGUKnAWce6IBWVP.html

District Collectors should prepare lists of stranded labour & destination and apply to Railways through the State nodal officer,” the Railways minister tweeted.“Along with this, the District Collectors should give a list and destination to the State Nodal Officer of Railways,” he said.Over the last few days, Goyal has been appealing to state governments to approve more trains to ferry migrants to their home states. The appeal has gone out specially to states like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal.However, it is not clear how the steps prescribed by the minister on Saturday are different from the present protocol where lists of such workers are prepared at the district level as well.In a press release issued later in the day, the ministry indicated that the Railways hopes this process will ensure maximum utilisation of rakes.“Once the information about migrants wishing to go back to their home states is made available from each district, the Indian Railways can take further action to help operationalise the trains.“Railways is presently running less than half of its capacity. It can transport many more migrants safely and quickly,” it said. The national carrier has the capacity to run almost 300 ‘Shramik Special’ trains a day, it said.“Full capacity operationalisation of the railways rakes would provide significant relief to the migrants across the country who are seeking to go to their home states. The Indian Railways is ready to augment the running of ‘Shramik Special’ trains as per the actual needs of the districts,” it said.As on Saturday, more than 15 lakh migrants have already been transported by the Railways to their home states and almost 1,150 ‘Shramik Special’ trains operationalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-ready-to-run-shramik-special-trains-from-any-district-piyush-goyal/story-XCm0JrOAlCBkbxW29rdOCM.html
16-05-2020||India||30 cities should have maximum restrictions in lockdown 4.0: Official||Thirty municipal areas including Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata that account for nearly 80% of India’s coronavirus cases should have the maximum restrictions under the Home Ministry’s lockdown 4.0 ground rules, the health ministry has told the government.The third round of the lockdown, first imposed on March 24 midnight, is due to end on Sunday night.There is no word on the extent of the restrictions that would be imposed in lockdown 4.0. The ground rules for the next round would be made public on Sunday.The last version of the lockdown that came into effect from 4 May had introduced considerable relaxations in districts that had not reported Covid-19 cases and eased restrictions elsewhere. The Centre’s objective, starting from the first round of relaxations from 21 April, has been to gradually resume economic activity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had this week told chief ministers that the Centre would opt for another spell of the national lockdown but made it clear that lockdown 4.0 would be very different from the earlier three versions. He had also indicated that this time, the Centre would give a long rope to the states to decide how to ease the restrictions.The rules for lockdown 4.0 have been designed to give a hard push to resumption of economic activity but continue some of the restrictions in municipal areas that have reported a large proportion of the restrictions. These 30 municipalities are spread across 12 states. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu account for over one-third of these municipalities. Gujarat and Rajasthan have three cities each in this list and West Bengal, two.Covid-19 hotspots: 30 municipal areasMaharashtra : Brihanmumbai, Thane, Pune, Solapur, Nashik, Aurangabad and PalgharTamil Nadu : Greater Chennai, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Chengalpattu, Ariyalur and VillupuramGujarat : Ahmedabad, Surat, VadodaraRajasthan : Jaipur, Jodhpur and UdaipurWest Bengal : Kolkata and HowrahMadhya Pradesh : Indore and BhopalUttar Pradesh : Agra and MeerutTelangana : Greater HyderabadAndhra Pradesh : KurnoolPunjab : AmritsarOdisha : BerhampurDelhiThe government’s renewed focus on the urban areas comes in context of data that suggests these 30 cities are home to most of the country’s Covid-19 case.On Saturday, Health Secretary Preeti Sudan held a special meeting with municipal and health officials from the 12 states where the 30 municipal corporations are located. The meeting discussed the high risk factors and reviewed indices such as confirmation rate, fatality rate, doubling rate, tests per million for these places. She also updated the states about the health ministry’s new guidelines aimed at such urban settlements, particularly informal settlements such as Mumbai’s Dharavi slums.Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi account for nearly 68 per cent of India’s 86,000 Covid cases.On Saturday, Maharashtra reported 1,600 new cases, one of the highest single-day spikes, pushing the state’s total to 30,706.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-cities-should-have-maximum-restrictions-in-lockdown-4-0-official/story-h5L4mMoIJ0XCPF0piYYVMP.html
16-05-2020||India||Centre lifts restriction on export of woven masks||Almost two months into the lockdown, the government on Saturday eased some restrictions on the exports of masks, allowing woven ones to be exported. The move follows a long term demand of the textile industry.     The Directorate General of Foreign Trade in a circular on Saturday, modified its March 31 order and allowed the export of non-medical and non-surgical masks made of woven cloth such as silk, wool and cotton, as well as knitted ones. All other types of masks under the Indian Trade Clarification based on Harmonised System of Coding will continue to remain prohibited for exports, the circular said.     On January 31,the government had banned the exports of all categories of PPEs in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic but lifted the ban on February 8, inviting widespread criticism from the Opposition. The textile ministry said that it did so after it was assured by the industry of adequate supply of 2-ply and 3-ply surgical masks at reasonable prices.  Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe ban on exports was re-imposed on March 19. The three kinds of masks made in India are differentiated by melt blown fabric, which ministry officials defined as a “critical component”. N95 and N99 masks, which are used by health-workers and Covid patients in hospitals, as well as two and three-plymasks used in surgeries are non-woven and made of melt blown fabric.  “There is a shortage of melt blown fabric the world over, not just in India, and we cannot part with the masks made of the material at this critical point,” an official said.        Days before the lockdown was announced on March 24, key government officials in a meeting helmed by the textiles secretary on March 18 pegged the shortage of 10.5 lakh N95 masks and 10 lakh masks. Since then India has reached the capacity to produce 2 lakh N95 masks daily, Prime Minister Modi said during his address to the nation on May 12. Ashok Juneja of the Textile Association of India said that since the garment industry does not have any orders, the move will help generate income. “The woven ones are washable and can be reused, and in the near future, the usage of masks will increase,” said Juneja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-lifts-restriction-on-export-of-woven-masks/story-cU5Gml4MREEZ7gOPqGDSoN.html

Jena explained that the passengers who come to Odisha by other Shramik Special trains to the western and the southern regions of the state will have to remain in quarantine centres on their arrival and later be shifted to their native places after the cyclone is over.Apart from Shramik Special trains, the Indian Railways has also started operating special passenger trains between New Delhi and Bhubaneswar. Jena, however, did not say anything about the other trains scheduled to reach the coastal region between May 17 and 20 when the cyclone is likely to make impact. Meanwhile, the state government has put 12 coastal districts - Gajapati, Ganjam, Puri, Khurda, Jajpur, Nayagarh, Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Mayurbhanj and Cuttack on alert for cyclone. Of the 12 districts, the state government as per the forecast of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), has identified the four districts like Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Balasore and Bhadrak as prone to the impending cyclone, which is likely to impact the state between May 18 to 20.Sources in the chief secretary’s office said the cabinet secretary has assured the state all assistance like use of chopper, deployment of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Coast Guard and others whenever necessary.“As per the predicted path of the cyclone till now, around seven lakh people in 649 villages along the sea coast are likely to be severely affected. “The standing crop in lakh hectare particularly, ripe summer paddy, pulses and oil seeds, cashew, mango, coconuts and vegetables are likely to be damaged in the heavy rainfall and wind,” Tripathy informed in the video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-urges-centre-to-temporarily-suspend-shramik-special-trains-due-to-impending-cyclone/story-4iB28N2enLJR2ED2wAzrnI.html

Without any social dialogue, the government is bringing gross changes and is going in the wrong direction,” BMS general secretary Vrijesh Upadhyay said in a statement.It has also cautioned that allowing private companies a role in India’s space programme and access to ISRO facilities to improve their capacities will have “serious consequences” for national security. “We depend on space for many security and surveillance measures which are dangerous to be privatized,” Upadhaya said.Also Read: Private firms to get access to ISRO’s facilities, space exploration opportunitiesWhile announcing the fourth tranche of measures to rev up the economy, Sitharaman said FDI cap through the automatic route will be raised from 49% to 74%, subject to security clearances in the defence sector; and the government will allow private players in commercial mining of coal, privatisation of power discoms in the Union Territories. It is also granting private firms access to ISRO facilities for capacity building and future space exploration.Also Read: FDI in defence sector hiked from 49% to 74%, says FM Nirmala SitharamanBMS is opposed to allowing FDI in sectors such as defence, food processing and pharma and said, “Government becoming shy of consultation and dialogue with trade unions, social representatives and stakeholders shows lack of confidence in their own ideas and is highly condemnable.”“Raising the FDI limit for the defence to 49 to 74% in the name of reducing huge defence bill and corporatisation of ordinance factory board is objectionable. Putting 6 airports to auction for getting Rs 13,000 crore and privatization of discoms is detrimental to India in the long run,” Upadhyay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-affiliated-labour-union-slams-sitharaman-s-reforms-claims-govt-is-going-in-wrong-direction/story-rAq2GawPO7fG0hmE2qDiHP.html

The Congress party will bear the expense for the same. We will observe all the protocols while helping these migrant workers reach home. We seek permission to run these 1,000 buses,” read a statement from Priyanka Gandhi’s office. In a separate development, the Centre said it has developed an online national migrant information system to capture the movement of stranded labourers heading home and to further facilitate their travel.Earlier in the day, 24 migrant labourers were killed and several injured after the truck they were travelling in collided with another truck in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya district.CM Yogi Adityanath on Friday asked state officials to set up teams in every police station area to ensure that no migrant worker travels on foot or bike or in any unsafe mode in Uttar Pradesh.The directive came amid rising cases of migrants losing their lives in road accidents while marching back home.The CM said food and water should be provided to the migrants as soon as they enter the state and added that they should be medically screened. Arrangements for a vehicle to send them to their respective destinations should be made if they are found fit, the CM told officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-seeks-nod-to-run-1-000-buses-to-send-migrants-home-in-up/story-1Xp5WSCLIsdvGFNgPyYu4J.html
16-05-2020||India||Centre issues guidelines to urban local bodies to contain Covid-19||The Union ministry of health and family welfare released a document on Saturday delineating focus areas that need to be addressed by the urban local bodies for preparedness in these settlements for responding to Covid-19 the country’s tally in the pandemic reached 86,000.Among the measures that the ministry of health and family welfare underlined for urban settlements for prevention and control of Covid-19 are institutional mechanism, incident response system, coordination mechanism, Covid-19 containment plan, surveillance, hospital preparedness and clinical management, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical intervention.The government said that these urban localities are often overcrowded, with many people crammed into very small living spaces. A substantial percentage of this population is migrant workers employed in the industrial and other informal sector.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“These areas are characterized by poor structural quality of housing, inadequate access to safe water, poor sanitation and insecure residential status. There are gaps in health and healthcare services,” the document said. It acknowledged that in the context of Covid (or any other respiratory infectious disease for that matter) implementing strategic interventions such as surveillance, physical distancing, isolation, quarantine and communicating the risk to the dwellers could be challenging. It also cautioned that social distancing will be a major challenge due to many people crammed into very small living spaces. It said social distancing should be practiced particularly in community water points, public toilets, PDS distribution points, health centers etc. It called for social distancing to be promoted at all formal and informal gatherings. The document also said a quarantine facility (school, stadium, etc.) in a nearby area needs to be identified, where a large number of high risk contacts can be accommodated. Shifting of high risk contacts (elderly and those with co-morbid conditions) is a crucial intervention to minimize the spread of disease in such persons, thereby limiting morbidity and mortality among them. A contingency plan will also be in place to move high risk populations to alternate or temporary sites.It stressed on the use of masks should be made mandatory and said common mask distribution sites and disposal sites should be identified and all dwellers may be made aware about the same.Community cleaning and disinfection drive needs to be undertaken on a daily basis. In particular, the community toilets need to be cleaned at-least three to four times a day. The civil dispensaries, health posts, health and family welfare centers will also be used as depot holder for Hydroxychloroquine, masks household disinfectants etc. It said community groups are key to creating awareness on Covid among these populations. “Use of local (political, religious and opinion) leaders for communicating all aspects of the Covid prevention and control is vital as dwellers are more inclined to trust them. Under these leaders, community cadres need to be created for community engagement,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-guidelines-to-urban-local-bodies-to-contain-covid-19/story-mnK9v15CL81n2eSzSLl48I.html

16-05-2020||India||Online database for migrants to monitor their movement, help with travel||The Centre on Saturday said it has developed an online National Migrant Information System (NMIS) to track the movement of stranded labourers heading home and to further facilitate their travel. “This system will help in speedy communication between states without creating additional work at the level of the field officers. It has additional advantages like contact tracing, which may be useful in overall Covid-19 response work,” read the order from the ministry of home affairs. Amid a nationwide lockdown necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak, hundreds of migrants, for days together now, have been walking or hitchhiking their way to homes.“The portal will work as a central repository and help in sending as well as receiving state/district to ask for and give their acceptance in an online format seamlessly,” the order said.The states will be able to visualise how many people are going out from where and how many are reaching destination states. The mobile numbers of the people will be used for contact tracing and movement monitoring. Earlier in the day, 24 migrant labourers were killed and several injured after the truck they were travelling in collided with another truck in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya district. On May 8 in another incident, 16 migrant labourers were crushed to death by a goods train in Maharashtra after they fell asleep on the tracks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-database-for-migrants-to-monitor-their-movement-help-with-travel/story-Ofq0lcuHqODtusAxQxirOJ.html
16-05-2020||India||Kerala reports 11 new Covid-19 cases||Kerala has reported 11 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, said state health minister KK Shailaja on Saturday while sounding a word of caution that the third phase of the pandemic would be critical for the state.Kerala has been preparing for a spike in Covid-19 positive cases, as those stranded abroad, mostly from the West Asian nations, are being evacuated by the central government under Operation Vande Bharat – the largest evacuation operation since the invasion of Kuwait by the then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in August 1990.The state has reported 587 Covid-19 positive cases so far, of which 87 are still active.North Kerala’s Wayanad and Kasaragod have emerged as hotspots.A truck driver and a Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader have become the latest superspreaders. The driver came back from Chennai’s Koyembedu vegetable market, a Covid-19 hotspot, and infected 10 others with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and the CPI(M) leader, who had sneaked into neighbouring Karnataka to bring back one of his relatives, infected eight others, said health officials.“People slacken when restrictions are relaxed. This is not a good sign. Now, we’ve to be more vigilant even though we’ve to live with the virus. We managed the first two phases well. Our mortality rate, which is less than 1%, is the best in the world. However, we shouldn’t lower our guard. The third phase is critical for the state,” Shailaja said.Kerala is the first state in the country to report a Covid-19 positive case on January 30, when an infected medical student returned from China.The second phase occurred during the first week of March, when a few people, who came from abroad violated home quarantine norms and infected others.The state had successfully contained the viral outbreak with its track, trace, and treat methodology. But the third phase will be the most challenging as several stranded people are now returning to the state and 60% among the latest 80 Covid-19 positive cases are imported.At least 3,750 people returned by 17 international flights and three ships to the state in the last week from the Persian Gulf nations and the Maldives. Similarly 40,000 people stranded in other parts of the country returned to the state in the past 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-11-new-covid-19-cases/story-Kt4Pv9riCj5v33BnsTgvoL.html

Another 20 NDRF teams are on standby.Special relief commissioner Pradeep Jena said the collectors in all the coastal districts have been asked to ensure that the diesel generator sets, inflatable tower light, telescopic tower light, chain saws given multipurpose cyclone shelters be in operational readiness. He said 20 teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force will be sent to the districts likely to be affected by the cyclone.IMD DG Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said the depression over Southeast Bay of Bengal lay centred 1,040 km south of Paradip and is very likely to intensify into cyclonic Storm in next 12 hours and further into severe cyclonic storm in another 24 hrs. It is likely to move north-northwest and make landfall on West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts on May 20. However, the exact progress of the cyclone would be known by Sunday, he said. The system is now moving at 20 km per hour.Under its impact, rain is expected to start in coastal Odisha by May 18 evening and by May 19, northern coastal Odisha will receive very heavy rainfall, the IMD predicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndrf-deploys-teams-in-odisha-and-bengal-as-cyclone-amphan-closes-in/story-ksxtcwAtMMGJewaDKrtxwI.html
16-05-2020||India||Reverse migration of labourers, break in supply chain adversely impacted construction activity: Puri||Reverse migration of labourers and a break in the supply chain of construction material has adversely impacted real estate projects and the construction work will take quite some time to reach full gear, union housing minister Hardeep Puri said Saturday.Puri said it is vital to take remedial steps to ensure the Covid 19 pandemic does not lead to a complete breakdown of the real estate sector after causing major project delays. “As we have already seen stalling of a lot of projects in Delhi- NCR region due to various reasons, leading to a lot of litigations etc, it is vital to take remedial measures now to ensure that Covid-19 does not lead to a complete breakdown of the real estate sector. Such a situation will result in many stalled projects resulting in huge losses for all the stakeholders especially homebuyers,” he added.Speaking with the stakeholders of the real estate sector in a webinar titled ‘3rd anniversary of RERA’, Puri said the principal objective of RERA is to help restore the trust between a buyer and the seller by effective implementation of the act.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“This would not only help ease the burden of inventory pile-up in the sector, but also provide the necessary financial cushion to the developers to complete pending projects,” he said.During the initial period of the lockdown, construction activities were barred. After reviewing the situation, the Government has put in place certain measures to allow for construction activities, effective from April 20 onward, he said. Referring to the announcement made by the finance minister Friday to provide affordable rental housing to migrant labourers and urban poor, Puri said the Affordable Rental Housing Complex (ARHC) scheme, where Government-funded houses in cities, will be converted into Affordable Rental Housing Complex under the PPP model. “This single step will, to a great extent, alleviate the problem of providing temporary housing to migrant people who are stranded in several urban areas. The Credit Link Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) for middle-income group has been extended to 31st March 2021, which is likely to benefit 2.5 lakh middle-class people. He added that these measures are aimed at giving a fillip to the housing sector, as a part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, announced by the Prime Minister,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reverse-migration-of-labourers-break-in-supply-chain-adversely-impacted-construction-activity-puri/story-RrIbO7O6aoVDK1WlX4RkCO.html

16-05-2020||India||Covid ‘demon’ can only be killed by divine forces: Priest body urges PM to reopen temples||An all-India organisation of priests has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reopen temples and pilgrimage centres to help combat the Covid-19 outbreak, saying the novel coronavirus is an “asur (demon)” and can only be killed by divine forces. “If all temples, shrines and pilgrimage centres are reopened, the coronavirus cannot do any harm (kuch nahi bigad sakta hay),” Akhil Bhartiya Tirth Purohit Mahasabha national president Mahesh Pathak said in a letter to the prime minister on Saturday. He said the closure of temples has also adversely impacted the economic condition of priests and demanded special financial package for them.In his letter to the Prime Minister, Pathak said the religious sites can be reopened with some restrictions under the present circumstances. The government has banned congregations and closed temples and other religious sites, besides schools, colleges, malls and factories, to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 85,000 people and killed over 2,750 in the country so far. Pathak said India is perhaps facing the “wrath of deities” as they have been treated “at par with factories” during the ongoing lockdown. “Coronavirus is an asur (demon) and it can only be killed by divine forces. I am quite sure divinity would rescue devotees from the coronavirus after joint prayers,” he told reporters here. He said the closure of temples and shrines has widened the distance between gods and devotees, and the separation cannot be erased through prayers at home. He said though the portals of ‘Char Dham’ temples have been opened in Uttarakhand, entry of devotees has been banned. “The deities provide solace to a disturbed mind,” he said and demanded that devotees be allowed there. The opening of the temples under a guideline would also provide some financial support to priests who have been badly hit by the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. The organisation has requested the Prime Minister to bring priests and ‘pandas’ (religious guides) under the umbrella of an economic package being provided by the government to different categories of people. A copy of the letter has been sent to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Pathak said. The lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to combat the coronavirus pandemic. It was first extended till May 3 and again till May 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-demon-can-only-be-killed-by-divine-forces-priest-body-urges-pm-to-reopen-temples/story-sikwTUhOEZDwx9W4MG8D9O.html

Fishermen were also advised not to venture into north Bay of Bengal along and off north Odisha, West Bengal and the adjoining Bangladesh coast during May 18-20.“For now, we know the cyclone is likely to move towards the West Bengal and Odisha coasts. We will give details of landfall location on Sunday morning, and an evacuation strategy can be made after that. State governments are being alerted,” said IMD director general M Mohapatra. Sunita Devi, the IMD scientist in-charge of cyclones, said: “Adverse weather can be expected in the coastal areas of Odisha and West Bengal between May 18 and 20. These states are under pre-cyclone watch. Actions to be taken will be decided tomorrow as we get more details of its trajectory.”Squally winds with speeds reaching 45 kmph to 55 kmph, and gusting to 65 kmph are prevailing over southeast and southwest Bay of Bengal. The sppeeds are likely to increase to 90 kmph to 100 kmph, and gusting to 110 kmph over east-central and west-central Bay of Bengal by the morning of May 17, 120 kmph to 130kmph and gusting to 145 kmph over southern parts of central Bay of Bengal by May 18 morning, 155 kmph to 165 kmph and gusting to 180 kmph over northern parts of central and north Bay of Bengal on May 19, and 160 kmph to 170 kmph and gusting to 190 kmph over north Bay of Bengal by May 20.Sea conditions will be high (six to nine metres wave height/34-47 knots wind) over southwest and central Bay of Bengal from the night of May 16, and very high (nine to 14 metres wave height /38-63 knots wind) over the same region from the morning of May 17.

16-05-2020||India||Courting death and injury, scores of migrants killed in accidents on way home||Hit-and-runs, collisions and even a train speeding down the tracks have killed scores of migrants since the lockdown began and injured many more making a perilous journey home along roads that are empty, winding and seemingly endless.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs vehicles careen down deserted roads and lakhs of migrants are on the move -- packed into trucks and tempos, riding rickety cycles or just walking towards their villages, hundreds, maybe thousands, of kilometres away – the death count from accidents rises inexorably with each day of the lockdown. The SaveLife Foundation, a non-profit organisation working towards curbing road accidents in the country, has recorded nearly 2,000 road crashes and 368 deaths from March 25 when the lockdown began to May 16 (11 am).Of these, 139 deaths are of migrants travelling back home, 27 of essential workers and 202 of others, it said. “Of the total 368 deaths reported, over 100 were recorded from Uttar Pradesh alone. The top five states in this tally include Madhya Pradesh (30), Telangana (22), Maharashtra (19) and Punjab (17). The most common factor for these road crashes was speeding,” SaveLife Foundation CEO Piyush Tewari told PTI.As the numbers spiralled, slowly, steadily and then in what appeared to be a torrent, a pattern emerged. Many of the tragedies occurred in the dark, which is when it is cooler to walk, and many people were caught in their sleep.That’s what happened on Saturday too, when a trailer rammed into a stationary truck in the pre-dawn darkness around 3.30 am on a highway near Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh, killing at least 24 people and injuring 36. The vehicles, one headed from Delhi to Madhya Pradesh and the other to Rajasthan, were ferrying labourers to their homes, Some of the workers had stopped for tea and others were possibly sleeping by the roadside or in the vehicles when the crash occurred. Most of those killed were from Jharkhand and West Bengal, and some from Kushinagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh, officials said as reports suggested that some of the victims may have been crushed under cement bags loaded in one of the vehicles.A few hours later, tragedy unfolded in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, when five migrant workers going from Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh were killed when a truck carrying them overturned on the Sagar-Kanpur Road.The combination of no traffic and speeding vehicles has led to havoc, endangering the lives of those who found themselves without work or money in the coronavirus-induced lockdown and were frantic to get home, any which way. Over this week alone, there have been multiple accidents reported from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.In Guna, Madhya Pradesh, for instance, as many as 14 migrants were killed and around 60 injured in two different road accidents on Thursday and Friday.On Friday, six migrant workers were killed and 95 injured in separate road accidents across Uttar Pradesh.And the day before, six migrant workers walking from Punjab to Bihar were killed in Muzaffarnagar in the state when they were hit by a roadways bus on the Delhi-Saharanpur Highway, officials said.With no compass to guide them on their treacherous inter-state journey home and perhaps to escape the police, many people also walk along railway tracks. On May 8, it cost 16 lives.In perhaps the most gruesome of accidents, 16 migrant workers going to Madhya Pradesh were mowed down by freight train when they dozed off on the tracks near Aurangabad in Maharashtra. In a chilling reflection of the hunger and deprivation that led the group of 20 men working in a steel unit in Jalna – four of them survived – the ‘rotis’ they had packed to see them through the journey lay scattered on the tracks.The same morning, hundreds of kilometres away, a migrant labourer couple, Krishna Sahu (45) and his wife Pramila (40), were run over by an unidentified vehicle on their way from Lucknow to Chhattisgarh. The couple, on a bicycle, were with their two children, both under five years, who survived the crash. Reduced to statistics as they undertake their own personal odysseys, challenging the odds but not always triumphing them, there was a back story everywhere.Some lockdown induced road accidents were reported as early as March 28 when four migrants were run over by a truck on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. According to Indian Express, the four, part of a group of seven which wanted to reach their villages in Rajasthan after crossing into Gujarat, had just begun walking after taking some rest when a truck came from behind and rammed into them. Two days later, 40-year-old labourer Sukh Lal Ahirwar died in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh after a car hit him. Ahirwar and his wife had walked for two straight days from Delhi towards their home in Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and were resting on a road divider when the accident took place, reported the Hindi daily Nayi Duniya.Those who survive have no option but continue the journey.Like the group of 20 labourers who left in a tempo from Mumbai to Lucknow on May 10.   The 1,400-km journey had barely begun when the tempo met with an accident, killing their driver. The driver had spoken to the news channel NDTV just hours earlier.“There are lots of problems. We don’t have anything to eat. We had rations till now, so we were eating that. Now, we are heading out. We will travel somehow in this,” one of those in the group told the channel. There were also reports of a woman and her six-year-old daughter who were part of a group travelling between Maharashtra and Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh in an autorickshaw.  They had travelled almost 1,300 km when the autorickshaw was hit by a truck just short of their destination in Fatehpur.The Railways has organised “Shramik Special trains” and ferried at least 12 lakh migrants to their homes since May 1.“To bring back the workers till date, the Railways has operated 1,034 Shramik Special trains. Out of which 106 were operated yesterday (Friday). Uttar Pradesh and Bihar has taken steps positively and 80 per cent of the total Shramik Special trains have been operated by these two states,” Union minister Piyush Goyal tweeted on Saturday.But if the thousands of workers and their families still trudging their way home, however they can, is any indication, it might be too little too late. India accounts for one of the highest road crashes fatalities in the world with an estimated 1.5 lakh people killed in about five lakh accidents a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/courting-death-and-injury-scores-of-migrants-killed-in-accidents-on-way-home/story-HgPUI1yi7SUACcIyw3ru5N.html
16-05-2020||India||A bus from Assam to Goa: State goes to lengths to bring stranded residents back||Come Saturday evening, a bus will set off from Darjeeling in West Bengal with a sole passenger before picking up four from Kolkata for a 2,800 kilometre long journey back to Goa. This exemplifies the difficulty faced by the Goa government in bringing back the stranded residents that are scattered across the country but not in large numbers to warrant booking of special trains being run by the Indian Railways. Therefore, the government has begun dispatching buses both private and those run by the state transport corporation to bring stranded Goans home. The movement is being coordinated by the interstate movement cell set up for the purpose. So the bus mentioned above was dispatched to West Bengal earlier this week and arrived in Darjeeling on Friday to pick up a single passenger from a place near Assam border before heading to Kolkata on Saturday to pick up four others for a journey from one edge of the country to the other. Another bus has left Goa for Baleshwar (Balasore), Orissa.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19More than 6,200 persons have asked for assistance to return home. While most evacuation trips are of a shorter duration and involve bringing back students from Kerala or neighbouring Karnataka, the Kadamba Transport Corporation buses have travelled even to Udaipur in Rajasthan and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh to bring back stranded residents. The latter was an exchange trip in which students of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Delhi were dropped and JNV students from Goa picked up from Ratlam-- identified as the midpoint for the exchange. “The movement of buses is planned judiciously in consultation with nodal officials of different states,” the state government said in a statement. “Once they register on the Goa government portal, those wishing to be brought back are informed through SMS/calls by the control room once the travel plan for a particular destination is finalised,” the state government said. Besides this, over the last week, 15 buses have brought back 241 people from Kerala (Kasargod), Karnataka (Mangluru, Bengaluru, Belgaum,Hubli, Dharwad, Khanapur, Jamboti and Gadag), Maharashtra (Navi Mumbai, Pune), Gujarat (Ahmedabad,Vadodara and Surat), Dadra and Nagar Haveli.“Driving a Volvo is relaxing. However, crossing the state borders, changing routes due to blockages in Red Zones, waiting in long queues for several security checks was hectic. This will be indeed an unforgettable experience,” Savlo Parab, 55, a driver of the KTCL who drove to Ratlam, said. The journeys are fraught with risk as was evidenced when a Goa bound bus that was returning from Chennai via Bengaluru met with an accident injuring 21 passengers on board after the driver allegedly dozed off at 4:30 am in Gadag, Karnataka. However, the Goa government is confident its efforts are worth it. “Today, I am proud and feel more responsible. The government has arranged the trip well. Each person was provided with masks and sanitizers, food and other essentials. We did not halt anywhere except for food. Their zeal to be in their motherland was also a constant motivation for us,” Mahesh Khanolkar, 45, another driver said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-bus-from-assam-to-goa-state-goes-to-lengths-to-bring-stranded-residents-back/story-bQawOaT1CHuKVTxyo1WlfM.html

Of them, 700 tested positive and were isolated,” said Additional Chief Secretary Rajiv Gupta, who has been appointed to oversee works related to COVID-19 in Ahmedabad.Shops selling essential items reopened from May 15 on certain conditions in Ahmedabad which had been under a complete lockdown since May 7.“Even as grocery shops and vegetable vendors were allowed to resume their business from May 15, provided they carried health screening cards, at least 700 ‘super spreaders’ were isolated after around 12,500 people were tested for coornavirusinfection in a week-long exercise,” a senior official said.Before that about 350 “super spreaders” were detected to have contracted the viral infection in a campaign launched on April 20.Gupta said massive screening was conducted to ensure that the viral infection cannot get transmitted from the “super spreaders”.He appealed to citizens to buy only from vendors or shopkeepers who carry “health screening cards”.“These ‘super spreaders’ will have to renew their cards after 14 days,”he said.Gupta further said the situation was normalising on the front of supply of essential commodities, including grocery items and vegetables. He said these items are supplied in ample quantities after the week-long lockdown was lifted on Friday.Grocery shops and vegetable/fruit vendors can operate their business between 8 am and 3 pm.Besides, the AMC also allowed shops to remain open for a few hours in ten containment zones in the city.Ahmedabad reported 7,044 coronavirus positive cases, and 473 deaths, as per the data available on May 15 night.The number of active cases is 4,260 and that of discharged people is 2,311.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-700-super-spreaders-found-coronavirus-positive-in-a-week-in-ahmedabad/story-0sLYKcSnubV5JfvrXXiztK.html

Telangana has alleged that AP is drawing up to eight tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of water from the Krishna river daily. The board also cited that it had written two more letters to the AP government on earlier occasions this year – January 1 and May 13 – seeking the DPRs. However, the AP government is yet to furnish the details, it added.Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, stipulates that no new projects on Godavari and Krishna rivers can be taken up either by the Telangana or Andhra Pradesh governments without obtaining sanction from the Apex Council on River Water Resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-andhra-to-stop-construction-of-new-schemes-on-krishna-river/story-Cl4emPCpuGJcsBxMnSAGML.html

This, she said, will help the aluminium industry reduce electricity costs.She said the distinction between captive and non-captive mines will be removed to allow the transfer of mining leases and sale of surplus unused minerals, leading to better efficiency and production. It means mines whose rights have been purchased by one miner for captive purposes can be transferred to another party that wants to take over for a non-captive reason. A captive mine is one in which the miner has to necessarily use the mineral for their own purposes.Sitharaman said the government will also rationalise the stamp duty payable at the time of award of mining leases.The announcements were part of the fourth tranche details of the Rs 20 lakh crore package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his address to the nation on May 12, vowing to make India atmanirbhar or self-reliant.The finance minister held her first press conference to share details of the stimulus package on Wednesday.

16-05-2020||India||Structural reforms in 8 key sectors to boost economy, says FM Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced the fourth tranche of the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package focussing on structural reforms in various crucial sectors of the Indian economy. The reforms will provide an impetus to those sectors which are new areas of growth, unleash new investment opportunities, lead to more production and in turn generate more jobs, the minister said. “We are going to focus on a total of eight sectors today -- Coal, Minerals, Defence Production, Air Space Management and Airports, MROs, Power Distribution Companies, Space and Atomic Energy,” Sitharaman said at the daily news briefing to announce the Centre’s detailed economic package. “Many sectors need policy simplification, to make it simpler for people to understand what the sector can give, participate in activities and bring about transparency. Once we decongest these sectors, we can boost the sector, for growth and additional jobs,” the finance minister said. Incentive schemes for the promotion of New Champion Sectors will also be launched in Solar PV manufacturing and advanced cell battery storage among others.ALSO READ | FDI in defence sector hiked from 49% to 74%, says FM Nirmala SitharamanReferring to inclusiveness for states, the minister said states would be ranked on investment opportunities and the ability to attract new investments. “Schemes will be implemented in states through challenge mode for Industrial Cluster Upgradation of common infrastructure facilities and connectivity,” the finance minister said. In a consolidated effort towards a self-reliant India, policy reforms will be put on fast track and the ease of doing business will be further upgraded. Announcing the introduction of commercial mining in the coal sector, Sitharaman said, “The government will introduce competition, transparency, and private sector participation in the Coal sector through revenue sharing mechanism instead of the regime of fixed rupee per tonne.”“Commercial mining is being introduced in the coal sector and the age-old government monopoly is being removed. The commercial mining of coal will be done on a revenue sharing basis. An amount of Rs 50,000 crore is being provided for evacuation infrastructure in the coal sector,” Sitharaman said.ALSO READ | Govt will notify list of weapons for ban on import with year wise timelines: SitharamanRegulations are required when there is a shortage of raw material. Coal is not environment-friendly and it needs to be kept in mind that the country’s environment commitments are honoured while converting coal into gas or other fuel, the minister said. At least 500 mining blocks would be offered through an open and transparent auction process for the commercial mining initiative. There will also be a joint auction of bauxite and coal mineral blocks to enhance the Aluminum industry’s competitiveness.“The investment of Rs. 50,000 crore is for the evacuation of enhanced CIL’s (Coal India Limited) target of 1 billion tonnes of coal production by 2023-24 plus coal production from private blocks,” the finance minister said.There will be rationalisation of stamp duty payable at the time of awarding mining leases. The distinction between the captive and non- captive mines will be removed to allow transfer of mining leases and sale of surplus unused minerals in the Mineral sector. The Ministry of Mines is in the process of creating a Mining Index for different minerals as part of the structural reforms.In defence production, the finance minister said for self-reliance a list of weapons and platforms will be notified and a ban imposed on import with year-wise timelines. There will be indigenisation of imported spares so that defence equipment is both made and bought in India“We shall notify a list of weapons and platforms that will not be allowed for import…these will be banned and have to be bought in India. Those list of items which will be notified can now only be bought in India by the defence sector. To improve the autonomy accountability we intend to start corporatization of ordinance factory boards for better management and for subsequent listing on the stock market,” the minister said.Foreign Direct Investment limit in defence manufacturing under the automatic route is being raised from 49% to 74%, the government has decided.In Civil Aviation, Sitharaman indicated that “Restrictions on the utilisation of Indian Air Space will be eased so that civilian flying becomes more efficient. We will bring a total benefit of Rs 1000 crore per year for the aviation sector.”A total of six airports will be up for auction by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and it will be done on a Public Private Partnership basis. India will also be promoted as a MRO hub to save on additional costs for the aviation sector.Sitharaman on Saturday also announced that electricity distribution companies in Union Territories (UTs) will be privatised. A tariff policy that does not burden consumers with distribution companies’ inefficiencies will be guaranteed, she said while presenting the fourth tranche of the economic stimulus package.She also announced a hike in viability gap funding (VGF) for development of social infrastructure. In her fourth tranche of economic stimulus, she said Rs 8,100 crore will be provided as viability gap funding for development of social infrastructure.The finance minister said social infrastructure projects suffer from poor viability. Therefore, the government will enhance the quantum of viability gap funding up to 30 per cent each of the total project cost as VGF by central and state/statutory bodies. For other sectors, existing VGF support of 20 per cent each from the government of India and state/statutory bodies shall continue.For boosting private participation in space activities, the Centre will provide a level playing field for private companies in satellites, launches and space-based services.Also, the government will provide predictable policy and regulatory environment to private players, she said. The move ensures giving the private sector a role in India’s space programme, including in satellites, launches and space-based services.Future projects for India’s space programme and planetary exploration and outer space travel would be open for the private sector, the finance minister said, adding liberal geo-spatial data policy will provide remote-sensing data to tech-entrepreneurs in the country.This is the fourth phase of announcements by the Union Finance Ministry elaborating on the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package.Over the last few days, Sitharaman has been convening daily media briefings to put forth Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision and share more details on the economic package meant to revive the industry grappling with a 54-day nationwide lockdown.

The state governments failed to own their responsibility to help in such a critical situation,” BMS general secretary Vrijesh Upadhyay said in a statement.The BMS, which has also planned a nationwide protest on May 20 against the changes made to labour laws in several states, said workers have been left to their devices by their employers and contractors who they served for many years and contributed as wealth creators.“In many places neither the employer nor the contractors made efforts to take care of these workers who have been waiting patiently since March 25 onwards (when the lockdown was announced),” Upadhaya said.Referring to the accident in Aurangabad where 16 workers were run over by a train, the BMS functionary said it was “unwarranted interference” by the police authorities that forced workers to walk along tracks instead of taking the road.“Many more migrant workers lost their lives in road accidents while on their way home on foot,” he said, adding that the BMS state units will set up help desks at the district level to help workers travel and find jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-governments-failed-rss-backed-bharatiya-mazdoor-sangh-on-migrants-plight/story-y3DxOupCVWw1OYqgmQwvaN.html

Ban on import of certain defence equipment and the corporatization of defence ordinance factories were some other important steps announced by the minister.“It will have the security clearances and everything else as always,” Sitharaman said referring to the hike in FDI through the direct route. In other major reform in the defence sector, she announced a timebound defence procurement process and faster decision making by setting up of a Project Management Unit to support contract management.This will also include a “realistic” setting of General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQR) of weapons/platforms and overhauling of trial and testing procedure.“Sometimes unrealistic quality requirements are established and quite a lot of time is spent in searching for suppliers who will meet all those requirements, you will end up with just one supplier and since buying from a single supplier is not permitted, you do the entire circle all over again,” said Sitharaman.Govt will notify list of weapons for ban on import with year wise timelines: SitharamanIn perhaps the most defining reform in the defence procurement area, the government announced to notify a list of weapons or platforms that will be banned for imports with year-wise timelines.

16-05-2020||India||Anand Mahindra says army’s ‘tour of duty’ model good for youth||Industrialist Anand Mahindra has supported an army proposal that seeks to allow the country’s youth to serve the military for three years under a new “tour of duty” (ToD) model and said that the exposure would give them an “added advantage” in the next workplace they choose, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.The ToD model is similar to the short-service commission that allows officers to serve the armed forces for 10 to 14 years.In an e-mail to the Indian Army, Mahindra said his group would be happy to consider the candidature of ToD optees for corporate jobs.The email read, “I recently learnt that the Indian Army is considering a novel proposal, the ‘Tour of Duty’. The young, fit citizens of India will get an opportunity to gain operational experience in the Army both as soldiers and officers through this voluntary three year-programme.”If the proposal is accepted, the army could implement the ToD model - essentially an internship after military training - on trial basis for both officers and other ranks in a limited number of vacancies.“I definitely think military training will be an added advantage for Tour of Duty Graduates as they enter the workplace. In fact, considering the rigid standards of selection and training in the Indian Army, the Mahindra Group will be happy to consider their candidature,” Mahindra wrote in an e-mail.The ToD proposal, reviewed by Hindustan Times, stressed that the internship model would result in savings for the organisation. It said it will also brighten the prospects of the ToD optees in the corporate world.“The cumulative cost of pre-commission training, pay/allowances, proposed severance packages, leave encashment and other costs is nearly Rs 5.12 crore and Rs 6.83 crore for short-service commissioned (SSC) officers released after 10 and 14 years of service. However, similar costs for those released after three years will be just Rs 80 to Rs 85 lakh,” the proposal stated. It said the ToD model would eventually result in significant reduction in salary and pension budgets, too. The proposal cites a survey that has indicated that corporate houses would prefer employing individuals who have been trained by the military and join them at the age of 26-27 after a three-year ToD rather than college graduates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anand-mahindra-says-army-s-tour-of-duty-model-good-for-youth/story-II8Mg9aAiQMBDuUEsiw4fL.html

However, it was held on the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border for around eight hours, as the authorities were verifying the requisite approvals amid the lockdown restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Around 21 of us boarded the bus from Bengaluru. It met with an accident at around 4.30 am on Friday, and we found ourselves piled up on top of each other,” said a passenger, requesting anonymity. “Finally, one of the passengers managed to break the rear glass and we got out of the vehicle. Fortunately, all of us escaped with minor injuries except one girl, who suffered a gash on her forehead,” he added.Though the state government arranged a relief bus, it arrived after 10 hours at 2 pm on Friday.The relief bus arrived at the Karnataka-Goa border at around 8 pm on Friday, but the passengers had to wait, as per the protocol, till a police escort vehicle could take them to a Covid-19 testing facility and a quarantine centre. They arrived at their destination at around 5 am on Saturday.Over 6,200 stranded people from Goa have registered on the state government’s website, urging the authorities concerned to organise their return at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-bus-accident-21-injured-as-driver-loses-control-veers-off-the-road/story-A6vaJLZEvBae0Mm4ll46VJ.html

Their US counterparts are research units of two universities and the third is a biotechnology company.All three collaborations started in recent weeks as the coronavirus raged across the world, infecting millions of people and killing hundreds of thousands, a third of them in the United States, the pandemic’s epicenter.“I am proud to announce that the United States will donate ventilators to our friends in India. We stand with India and @narendrmodi during this pandemic,” the president wrote in the tweet, as he went on to acknowledge the vaccine projects, adding, “We’re also cooperating on vaccine development.”Indians appear to have been taken by surprise by the announcement specially as they had not sought it and he had not mentioned it in his response to a direct question about India at a news briefing shortly before. They have asked for more details about the numbers and the delivery schedule.Asked about the details of his offer including numbers, Trump hedged. “We’re sending a lot of ventilators to India. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi, and we’re sending quite a few ventilators to India. We have a tremendous supply of ventilators .”President Trump has often said the United States is the “king” of ventilators — a respiratory aid needed for severely ill hospitalized Covid-19 patients — as a result of an extraordinary push from his administration in response to early fears of an impeding shortage. He has since said the United States has more ventilators than its needs and it will be willing to share them with allies and partners.Indians are viewing Trump’s announcement on ventilators in the larger context of growing cooperation in the healthcare sector, even though it was in all probability just a thank-you gesture in return for the lifting of the ban on the export of selected drugs to allow a massive consignment of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine following Trump’s personal appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month.In a separate tweet hours later, the president’s National Security Council followed up with a full-bore acknowledgement of the vaccine projects. “The US and India are working together to fight #COVID19 and find a vaccine,” it said, adding, “the US-India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership has never been stronger.” There was no mention of the ventilators.Pune-based Serum Institute of India and Codagenix, a biotech company headquartered in New York, were the first to announce their collaboration. “Codagenix and Serum Institute are pursuing an accelerated development pathway with built-in redundancies to increase speed and likelihood of success,” they said in an announcement on February 17.Codagenix, clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops prophylactic vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies brings tot he table the research and Serum Institute the scalability, the ability to quickly roll out millions and millions of doses that will be needed to be rolled out if the vaccine works.Bharat Biotech, a Hyderabad pharmaceutical company, is part of the second project which was announced on April 2, The American partners are virologists at the University of Wisconsin and FluGen, a biotech company whose flu vaccine form the platform for the Covid-19 vaccine research.Bharat Biotech is also the Indian collaborator in the third project, with researchers at the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, in April end.More than 100 research projects are under way world wide to develop a vaccine against a virus that has killed more 300,000 people worldwide, a third of them in the United States.President Trump has said a vaccine is possible before year-end and “even before”. And the man he has appointed to head the hunt in a joint public-private partnership comparable to the World War II-era Manhattan Project to develop the first nuclear weapons, has said this is a “credible” target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/donald-trump-offers-india-ventilators-acknowledges-growing-collaboration-on-covid-19-vaccine/story-IenoGh0DeaBbJe0LY9sR6I.html

This pandemic is being fought collectively by all of us. In such times, it’s always important for nations to work together and do as much as possible to make our world healthier and free from COVID-19,” PM Modi tweeted.“More power to 🇮🇳 - 🇺🇸 friendship!” he added.Watch | ‘Spoke to PM Modi, sending a lot of ventilators to India’: US President Donald Trump Trump had announced the decision to send the ventilators on Twitter to underline close relations between the two countries. “I am proud to announce that the United States will donate ventilators to our friends in India. We stand with India and @narendrmodi during this pandemic,” the president wrote in the tweet, as he went on to acknowledge the vaccine projects.The United States will airlift 200 mobile ventilators to help Indians combat Covid-19, people familiar with the developments told HT. One ventilator will cost $13,000 (Rs 9.6 lakh at current exchange rates) approximately and India will have to pay $2.6 million (Rs 192 million) plus freight charges for all of them.Trump reiterated the point at his press conference later, referring to his India visit in February, the role played by Indian expatriates in the US and described PM Modi as a “good friend of mine”.“We are working closely with India,” he told reporters.Trump also said the US and India were cooperating to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 as more than 4.5 million people have contracted the disease and over 307,000 have died globally.The US move comes weeks after Prime Minister Modi acted on Trump’s request to reverse a ban on the export of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that was championed by the US president as a “game-changer” in the fight against the coronavirus disease. Hydroxychloroquine, or HCQ, is being used in India as prophylaxis for health workers at the frontline of the country’s response to the epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-power-to-india-us-friendship-pm-tweets-after-trump-s-ventilators-offer/story-MimP6jN3NvWEgeKsAMuL6K.html

FM may please clarify whether the sums she announced yesterday (Rs 500 crore and Rs. 13,343 crore) are subsumed in the Expenditure Budget numbers or additional sums of money,” tweeted Chidambaram.Announcing the details of the Rs 20 lakh crore package on Friday, Nirmala Sitharaman said the government will implement a Rs 500 crore scheme of infrastructure development for the country’s beekeepers, with special thrust on capacity building of women.“This will lead to an increase in income of 2 lakh bee-keepers,” Nirmala Sitharaman said.“Likewise, under Animal Disease Control Programme the fight against FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE has already been launched with a 5-year outlay of Rs 13,343 crore and allocation of Rs 1300 crore in 2020-21,” Chidambaram pointed out in another tweet.To improve animal husbandry incomes, which gives higher net returns compared to crops, Sitharaman had said: “We want to ensure 100% vaccination of nearly 530 million animals, a livestock size which is among the largest in the world. Despite Covid-19 lockdown, 15 million cows and buffaloes have been tagged and vaccinated.” To control foot and mouth diseases, which cripples milk output of afflicted animals, the FM announced Rs 13,343 crore.The government will set up an Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund worth Rs 15,000 crore to “support private investment in dairy processing, value addition and cattle feed infrastructure”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/p-chidambaram-s-the-new-r-d-tweet-swipe-at-fm-nirmala-sitharaman/story-82KeAVcVtFXQ09eoD6iJlM.html

At least 24 migrant workers were killed and 36 injured when a trailer rammed into a stationary truck, both carrying passengers, on a highway near Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh in the early hours of Saturday. “Extremely saddened to learn about the tragic road accident in Auraiya, Uttar Pradesh. Local administration is making all efforts to help those affected. Thoughts and prayers with the bereaved families and with those injured,” the president tweeted. According to police, some of the workers coming from Delhi had stopped for tea when the accident occurred between 3 am and 3.30 am on the Auraiya-Kanpur Dehat stretch of National Highway 19. The impact of the collision was so huge that both vehicles overturned and fell into a ditch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-ram-nath-kovind-expresses-deep-sorrow-over-loss-of-lives-in-up-road-accident/story-SDjkFBQGLSNbwbD5qu9zkM.html
16-05-2020||India||Govt should not become a moneylender, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday the government should not become a “sahukar” or money lender in his first structured response to the Rs 20 lakh crore financial package offered by the Centre to reboot the economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic. He argued in favour of cash assistance instead of loans that are being announced and warned of an impending economic crisis, asking the government to consider rolling out Congress’ NYAY scheme temporarily in urban areas. Gandhi insisted that the government must come up with a “national strategy for income.”“When a child is hurt, the mother doesn’t offer a loan. As a citizen, my disappointment is the (Rs 20 lakh crore) package should not be of loans but for giving money in their hands. The government should not be a sahukar,” Gandhi said during an interaction with reporters of regional electronic media as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been announcing the details of the schemes. Gandhi repeatedly pointed out to pet scheme NYAY—the cash-for-poor scheme that was pitched as the key plank in the 2019 election but didn’t find many takers.He clarified that the scheme should be implemented, albeit temporarily in urban areas while MGNREGS—a hallmark innovation of the UPA-era—must be strengthened in the rural areas.He, however, refused to indulge in a political blame game with the Modi government and said that his party will apply pressure “pyar se” on the government to accept their proposals.“I have heard the reason not to give money is to retain ratings. Our ratings are made by our farmers, our workers and businessmen. When people will start working, India’s ratings will improve,” he said as he warned the government of an economic storm which is impending.According to Gandhi, the most important thing now is to “fire demand and supply” and while infrastructure is certainly key, the government must give money in the hand of poor, echoing what many economists had been advocating.“If you want to start an engine you have put fuel in the carburettor. The fuel is cash. We must have a national strategy for income. We can’t sacrifice our economy as well as our elder generation,” Gandhi said suggesting that in the short time, small and medium business, farmers, migrant labourers and people in the high-risk category need to be protected.He refused to compare the current economic crisis with that of 1991 when the Congress government ushered in economic reforms. And while he narrated the steps taken by the Congress-ruled states to help the poor and migrant workers, he didn’t hesitate to draw the line of difference between the Congress and its coalition governments.When asked about the lack of services offered by Maharashtra for migrant workers, Gandhi said, “There is a difference between Congress and the alliance government. if you look at Congress states like Chhattisgarh, you will see a very aggressive strategy. But in an alliance, we try to put pressure through conversations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-should-not-become-a-moneylender-says-rahul-gandhi/story-1BSdhrNq9cDAGpmfNL7t1N.html

He should consider direct bank transfer, MGNREGA for 200 days and money to farmers directly, as these people are our future,” the Congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-bother-about-ratings-think-about-people-rahul-gandhi-tells-centre/story-ihyk6S1K8lL1m5ZTAsvoUN.html

The Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) shops were, however, shut in Chennai and Tiruvallur.The move comes after the Supreme Court on Friday stayed the Madras High Court order regarding the ban on opening of shops, observing that a decision in that respect rests with the state government. In a May 1 order, the central government allowed states to sell liquor in standalone shops and said social distancing should be followed in such outlets.As part of measures to avoid crowding and ensure social distancing, authorities implemented a colour-coded token system that specified the date and time allotted for the buyers at a designated outlet, reported news agency PTI.To prevent unmanageable crowds witnessed in several places when the shops reopened on May 7 after a 43-day dry spell, the authorities limited the number of tokens per day to 500 and 70 for an hour.The shops are open from 10 am to 5 pm.Adequate police personnel were deployed to regulate crowds and tokens were distributed at separate locations away from the liquor shops and only those who had the coloured slips were allowed to buy beverages at the outlets.Several men could be seen standing with umbrellas in districts like Erode, Tirupur and at Madurantakam in Kancheepuram district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-shops-open-again-in-tamil-nadu-after-a-week-long-queues-seen/story-IgEGckGEf0IG2iREQ0sbUI.html
16-05-2020||India||As Pak army pushes for 20% hike in budget, India’s ‘I told you so moment’||At the April 16 meeting of the International Monetary Fund that cleared Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s request for $1.4 million aid to deal with the coronavirus crisis, the Indian representative on the board Surjit Bhalla had sounded a cautionary note.Bhalla had noted a propensity in Islamabad to divert development funds for security and asked the IMF to track what Pakistan does with the money. The IMF should, Bhalla suggested, monitor to ensure that the Pakistan government’s resources freed up as a result of the IMF assistance are only used for emergency response to the Covid-19 situation and “there’s no diversion of these resources to other sectors such as security”. Or to service its huge debt liabilities.ALSO WATCH | ‘They want riots...’: PoK activist on Pakistan bid to hold Gilgit Baltistan pollsIn the past, Bhalla said, there were reports to indicate that Pakistan had done both.Less than a month later, there is some indication that the Indian economist’s cautionary note wasn’t out of place.Pakistan’s Defence ministry last week pitched for a 20% raise in salaries of their personnel for the next financial year.A leaked Defence Ministry memorandum says the Joint Staff Headquarters in consultation with the service headquarters had proposed the hike because personnel were feeling the crunch due to a devalued rupee and inflation.Pakistan watchers in India say the pressure from the military - the army gets the largest share of the budget - was part of a long-establishment pattern.Last year, the Pakistan government raised the defence expenditure by a modest 4.5% over the previous year’s budget estimate to Pakistani Rs 1.15 trillion ($ 7.6 billion). That increase came a much-publicised statement by Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa that the armed forces would ‘forego’ the routine hike in the defence budget due to the financial crisis.Also Read: Pak’s troubled economy is hurting more than Imran Khan wants to believe | OpinionThe Imran Khan government had also played along. Hammad Azhar, the then minister of revenue, told parliament in his budget speech that the defence budget would remain unchanged at Rs 1.15 trillion. But a news agency PTI analysis later indicated this was inaccurate; the budget documents indicated a 4.5% hike over the previous year’s budget estimate and 1.3% over the revised estimates.The military’s push for a budget hike this year comes when Pakistan’s financial crisis, like economies elsewhere in the world, just got worse due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Pakistan watchers in India insist that a hike in the defence budget to keep the army commanders in good humour was an erroneous proposition, irrespective of how you look at it. For one, it reduces the meagre resources available with the government to restart the economy, strengthen health infrastructure and help the millions who are suffering the most due to Covid-19 and the lockdown that it induced. Pakistan has already reported close to 39,000 cases and over 800 deaths.It would not do any good to the military either. If the military is starved of funds for operational planning and capital investment, the offensive capability of the military will take a hit. That could further increase the reliance of the military on its strategic arm, the jihadis, both on the eastern and western borders, and run the risk of destabilising the Indian subcontinent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-pak-army-pushes-for-20-hike-in-budget-india-s-i-told-you-so-moment/story-M8R8lJZqfUFacczXqyxbVP.html

Gandhi’s comments came during his interaction with the members of the regional electronic media. He went on to take questions and suggestions from them. The Congress MP also reacted to Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package and said that he has a “reservation” against the economic plan. He urged the Centre to rethink the package so as to provide immediate money to the needy, the farmers and the migrant labourers. Gandhi also said that the nationwide coronavirus lockdown will need to be lifted in an intelligent manner and carefully to ensure that the vulnerable people are not affected. “We need to take care of the vulnerable people. The elderly people, those suffering from diabetes, hypertension, kidney diseases, et cetera. They must be taken care of,” he said. “Lockdown is not an ‘on-off’ switch, it should be lifted intelligently, carefully,” Gandhi said. Prior to today’s press conference and interaction with members of regional electronic media, Gandhi had led online interactive sessions with intellectuals like former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-ll-suffer-greater-losses-than-those-cause-by-covid-19-if-demand-is-not-generated-rahul-gandhi-in-his-address/story-aZg4w8k88JLGSc8JeeYNCK.html

16-05-2020||India||‘Country staring at economic storm, need to lift lockdown wisely’: Highlights of Rahul Gandhi’s media interaction||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday interacted with the media during which he spoke about the situation of the migrants and the economic package announced by the Centre to help those affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and revive the economy.  “I will be taking questions from the electronic regional news media at 12 noon today. You can watch the press conference LIVE right here on Twitter or on my YouTube channel,” Gandhi had posted on Twitter on Saturday morning.Speaking with members of the press, the Wayanad MP asked the Modi government to rethink its Rs 20 lakh crore economic package. He said the Centre should put the money directly in the hands of the people by transferring it to their bank accounts instead of offering it as credit. The former Congress chief had addressed a video press conference earlier this month on May 8 and took questions on Covid-19 and the economic crisis.Here are the highlights of the his press interaction:- Rahul Gandhi thanks media for the role it has played in highlighting the issues related to Covid-19 outbreak.- On PM’s ‘local about vocal’ slogan, Rahul Gandhi said that a person can be vocal only if they aren’t hungry, again reiterating the demand to put money in the bank accounts of those affected. - Centre is not giving the money to the states that is due to them...all CMs saying this, even the BJP chief ministers- The Railways minister’s allegation of Congress-ruled states not giving NOCs to let trains go to their states, Rahul Gandhi says it is a wrong allegation since it was Congress which made the suggestion in the first place. He again reiterates that migrants should be sent back to their states safely and their needs taken care of.- The government’s economic package is a credit package under which the money is not reaching those affected directly. Which is what we are saying today. -States should get support from the Centre because only the states can lead and implement the fight against Covid-19 while the role of the central government is to manage. There are complaints that the Centre is not giving states their share of money. - States where we are in alliance, there is a conversation. But we are certainly putting pressure on these governments and aggressively pursuing this in Congress-ruled states to help migrant workers walking backing home.- Asked about how to strengthen MNREGA, Rahul Gandhi said - those in villages should be covered under MNREGA and in cities, should be covered under NYAY. We are asking government to implement a programme like NYAY scheme for those working in cities, give them money for a few months and then stop it after that. - I am sure the government will consider my suggestions. I have spoken to a lot of people who have said the same things about putting money in people’s hands. I want PM Modi to seriously think about these suggestions. - There is no choice between livelihood and people’s health. We need to lift lockdown....we have to revive our economy and take care of those at risk . That is what the planning all about. - In the short term, fire demand, protect small and medium businesses. In the medium term, these businesses should be given financial support. There should be a clear-cut policy for job creation.- I want to warn the government that the country is staring at economic storm and I am trying to put pressure on them. That is the work of the opposition- It is the duty of the government, Opposition and all of us to help the migrants and put money directly into their pockets. - Asked about who is responsible for the ‘condition of migrants’, Rahul Gandhi said, this isn’t the time to point fingers. He said the problem of migrants is very challenging.; all of us need to help those walking on the highways. --We have to open the lockdown but it should be lifted carefully and intelligently, protecting the vulnerable people like aged, heart patients etc at the same time.- The government should rethink its economic package. There is need to put money in the hands of the people, directly in their bank accounts because if we do not support our small businesses and farmers and others, our economy won’t start. - India is in a crisis , small business, labourers and every one is in a crisis; heartbreaking to see migrants walking on highways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-addresses-media-on-covid-19-situation-highlights/story-tHZfriS6ExMwGevQmZQd8N.html

At present, the state’s doubling rate – the number of days taken for cases to increase two-fold -- is a little over 10 days.Mumbai, which accounts for around 60% of all Covid-19 positive cases in the state, reported 933 new cases on Friday, as the total count rose to 17,671. The city also recorded 34 fresh deaths and 655 people have died in the country’s financial hub so far.Tope has requested Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to reserve 60% of beds in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients while anticipating a peak by end-June. The contingency plans are being put in place in line with the recommendations of the Dr. Sanjay Oak-led task force that the state government has formed to identify ways to reduce the mortality rate. The rest 40% of beds in these private hospitals would be reserved for non-Covid-19 patients, the minister said.Maharashtra’s positivity percentage is at 11.61% after 2,50,436 tests were conducted till Friday, of which 2,21,336 proved negative.

The HC has however said that the acceptance of suggestions would depend on whether they are realistic and within medical protocols. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AA Sayed on Friday was apprised by three petitioners namely Mehrwan Farshed, Dayanand Stalin and Mutahhar Khan, about the absence of requisite medical facilities being made available for non-Covid-19 patients.The petitioners through their respective public interest litigations (PILs) had pointed out that many non-Covid-19 patients had been unnecessarily suffering and even death without proper treatment. The petitioners further alleged that Covid-19 and non-coronavirus affected patients had been refused treatment in government as well as private hospitals leading to the death of a number of patients. Also read: India’s Covid-19 tally nears 86,000-mark; death toll at 2,752One of the petitioners also pointed out that families of elderly coronavirus-affected patients had been forced to wait day and night for hours just for routine medical examination.The petitioners had prayed that in light of these submissions, the HC should initiate necessary action against hospitals and institutions that refuse treatment to patients suffering from other ailments. The petitioners also sought directions for the provision of adequate ambulances to ferry Covid-19 and non-coronavirus patients and to convert state-run and private buses into ambulances if there was a shortage.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare appearing for the BMC vehemently opposed the petitioners’ allegations. He submitted that sufficient arrangements were in place to look after the needs of non-Covid-19 patients.After hearing the submissions through video conferencing, the bench observed, “Having regard to the havoc wreaked by Covid-19 and in the absence of any therapeutic cure of the disease, every possible option ought to be explored so that the suffering of the people at large can be minimised to the extent possible.” With regards to the suggestions of the petitioners and private institutions the bench said, “If indeed what the petitioners and the private institutions suggest are of any help or assistance to mankind, we see no reason as to why the State and the Corporation may not consider the same in its true perspective.”The bench then directed the petitioners and private institutions to compile a set of all their suggestions by Sunday and to forward it to the state and corporation for consideration upon due application of mind. “We make it clear that the suggestions shall be realistic so that they can be implemented and it shall also be ensured that the same are consistent with the extant medical protocol,” the court observed and directed the authorities to file a report indicating steps proposed to be taken based on suggestions and posted the hearing of the PILs on May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-suggestions-from-private-institutions-on-medical-facilities-for-non-covid-19-patients-bombay-hc-to-state-bmc/story-IihWh6m0Qfjtra0c4Muh5N.html

The RSS is the ideological mentor of the BJP.Asked if they would take along BMS since it was also opposed to the move, Reddy said this matter wasn’t discussed at Thursday’s meeting.“We have not approached the BMS. We have seen in the past how they were first keen to join us and later backtracked,” he said.The BMS has criticised the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat for doing away with labour laws, and also Rajasthan, Goa and Odisha for increasing working hours.The RSS affiliate described these changes as “unheard of in history” and “rare even in most undemocratic countries”.Why then are the unions not burying their differences to come together? BMS president Saji Narayanan said left-affiliated trade unions seldom overlook political considerations in taking up issues.He said while trade unions were vocal in criticising the Centre for the decision to withhold additional DA, they chose not to protest when the Kerala government used an ordinance to cut salaries.In April, the Pinarayi Vijayan government issued an ordinance to cut a month’s salary in five installments for all state-owned enterprises, public sector undertakings (PSUs), quasi-government organisations and universities, among others.Narayanan said there have been instances in the past when the unions came together but the arrangements did not last.A BMS functionary said trade unions, irrespective of their political affiliation, came together in the 1990s as the national campaign committee, but later broke up since differences emerged on the Ramjanamabhoomi issue.In December 2013, INTUC joined hands with Left-allied unions and called for a Bharat Bandh after the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government announced its decision to wind up eight PSUs.Eleven central trade unions came together against the proposed changes to labour laws by the then UPA government.A fresh attempt to bring the unions together was made in 2018, when BMS and a faction of INTUC formed a non-political group, the Confederation of Central Trade Unions or CONCENT, to bring together unions on common issues related to labour protection.Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja said though BMS had been part of some common platforms that were launched to bring together central trade unions, it began to withdraw from protests after the BJP came to power in 2014.“Dilution of labour laws cannot be justified by the government and they cannot be accepted. Labour laws were not given on a platter, they are hard-won,” he said.The issue has triggered a fresh slugfest between the BJP and the opposition, with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi saying on Monday the fight against the Coronavirus cannot be an excuse to exploit workers, suppress their voice and crush their human rights.The remarks came in the wake of states such as Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh amending labour laws.Gandhi also said there cannot be any compromise on basic principles by allowing unsafe workplaces.“Many states are amending labour laws. We are together fighting against corona, but this cannot be an excuse to crush human rights, allow unsafe workplaces, exploit workers and suppress their voice. There cannot be any compromise on these basic principles,” he tweeted.However, the BJP insisted that labour law reforms are a long-standing demand of unions and industries. “As it is in the concurrent list, the Centre had earlier consolidated 40 existing laws into four codes to streamline compliance and help formalisation of the labour force. Now, some state governments are working for further streamlining the functioning of industry and helping restart the economic cycle. These amendments are for the benefit of the economy as a whole, including workers,” BJP spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-cong-backed-unions-to-strike-over-labour-law-freeze/story-ros62jE3UvZJ6LTHszds9H.html
16-05-2020||India||India to privatise discoms in all Union Territories, explore PPP across states||India will privatize electricity distribution companies (discoms) in all its eight union territories, and explore public-private partnerships for power distribution in some states, Union power minister Raj Kumar Singh said.The Centre has informed the Union territories about the decision, Singh said at a digital interaction with power sector chief executives. Unlike discoms in states governed by the respective state governments, those in Union territories are directly administered by the central government.“So as far as the Union territories are concerned, we have decided that we will put in place a distribution system which is based on totally open, transparent, competitive, commercial principles. So, you people are welcome to compete,” Singh said at an event organised by lobby group Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The move comes in the backdrop of the government on Wednesday announcing a reform-linked ~90,000 crore bailout package for fund-starved discoms, along with concessional tariffs.“We will be bidding them out for distribution companies to take up. And all the Union territories have been told that we will have distribution companies that are from the private sector,” Singh added.India’s electricity distribution reforms scheme — tentatively named Atal Distribution System Improvement Yojana (Aditya)— aims to cut electricity losses below 12%. India’s average aggregate technical and commercial loss are currently at 21.4%. The scheme aims to ensure continuous supply of power, by privatizing state-run discoms and negating tariff gaps. Prepaid smart meters will be made mandatory across the power distribution chain, including 250 million households.Singh said the Union government will approach some other states for a public-private partnership (PPP) mode on the lines of Delhi or Odisha to bid out their distribution companies.Odisha was the first state to privatize its power distribution sector into four discoms in 1999. This was followed by Delhi, which privatised three of its discoms in July 2002: BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL), BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL) and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. There is a growing interest in power discoms. Mint reported on 12 May about at least eight investors showing initial interest in buying Reliance Infrastructure Ltd’s Delhi power distribution businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-privatise-discoms-in-all-union-territories-explore-ppp-across-states/story-pV1hTcCKF4l4qVfJUpGZfO.html

The findings were revealed in a survey conducted by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) in 27 states. Researchers have found that livelihood in rural areas of the country has had the worst effect, although the spread of coronavirus in these areas is quite low. The survey, which was conducted in April, included around 5800 families across the country. The data from the survey was analyzed by Marianne Bertrand, professor of economics at the University of Chicago and CMIE chief economist Kaushik Krishnan. The survey showed that the worst impact of the lockdown has been borne by five states, including Tripura in the North-east and the north Indian states of Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana.Also read: In long walk back home, migrants battle hunger, scourge of Covid-1934% of the families that were surveyed said that they would not be able to live even a week without additional financial help. The survey has seen a decrease in the income of high-paid people, most of them have permanent jobs and are also able to work from home during the lockdown. In the low-income group, only those associated with agricultural work and catering workers are able to get any work amid the lockdown.According to data from the CMIE and other institutions, about 10 crore Indians lost their jobs in a month after the lockdown was announced on March 25 in the country. Talking around the world, the income of 1.3 billion people has been affected extensively due to the ongoing lockdown in different countries.The number of coronavirus cases have breached the 81,000 mark. More than 2,500 people have lost their lives to the deadly contagion which has infected more than 4 million people across the globe. The third phase of the ongoing coronavirus lockdown will come to end on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-80-of-indians-witness-dip-in-earnings-amid-covid-19-lockdown-worst-impact-on-these-states/story-sIPYxA9ZrRmQYZHFMztlHN.html

16-05-2020||India||Lockdown 4.0: What states are saying about relaxations||Several state governments want complete shutdowns only in containment zones allowing space for the resumption of almost all activities, except large social gatherings and educational institutions, during lockdown 4.0.Officials in several states said the guidelines defining containment zones, a key guidance document for enforcing lockdown 4.0, would come by Saturday and it was likely to divide a district into red, orange and green zones, unlike the existing methodology of categorising an entire district as red, orange or green.Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePrime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Monday, had said that the lockdown 4.0 will have a “completely different form”, with new rules.The current period of lockdown—the third since it was enforced on March 25—is scheduled to end on Sunday. Here’s what is likely to happen during lockdown 4.0:* It appears from the viewpoint expressed by government officials that states are likely to allow resumption of all industrial activities, offices and standalone markets from May 18 onwards. * Public transport including autos and taxis would resume with certain restrictions on number of passengers along with intra-district travel, except for the containment zones. Interstate travel may also be opened up but only for those with travel passes.* Permission is also likely to be given for all types of home delivery of goods, officials said.* Educational institutions will continue to remain closed with several states expected to declare summer holidays from May end or June.* Religious and political meetings are unlikely to be allowed for some more time apart from other activities that require or encourage mass gatherings or community participation including shopping in malls and other public places.* Marriages and funerals would be allowed with limited attendees, officials said.What states want:* Maharashtra, which has the maximum number of Covid cases, submitted its position to the Centre on extending the lockdown. The state is in favour of extension with more relaxations in less affected zones, so as to ensure economic activities resume gradually.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the decision about red zones will be taken by May 18, but the state government is considering easing the lockdown in non-affected areas in red-zone districts too. Largely affected cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Nashik may also see relaxations in commercial operations.* Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said markets, malls, public transport, including the Delhi Metro, and all offices should be allowed to open with reduced footfall and staggered operations.* Gujarat, which has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases, wants to resume all economic activity in all major urban centres except Ahmedabad, which accounts for state’s 70% cases.* Some states may have state specific relaxations, for example, the Karnataka government is in the favour of resuming inter-state travel with mandatory 14-day quarantine for travellers.* Even Rajasthan government favours inter-state travel. Kerala, however, wants inter-state travel only on the basis of a pass while Bihar and Jharkhand are opposed to inter-state travel of individuals and have requested the Centre for a guidance document.* Telangana, which has extended lockdown till May 29, is likely to announce more relaxations in sectors such as information technology and real estate.* Kerala wants resumption of metro services, local trains, domestic flights, restaurants and hotels to revive the tourism sector.* Karnataka may open restaurants, hotels and gymnasiums. Andhra Pradesh has proposed resumption of all activities except in containment areas. Both Himachal and Uttarakhand would allow hotels and resorts to open with limited capacity.* Tamil Nadu, another industrial state, plans to open all places except containment areas.* Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has asked for an extension of the lockdown, stating during the meeting with PM Modi that “we must have strong lockdown. I will ensure a curfew”.* Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha want to continue with stricter lockdown as their Covid-19 cases are increasing due to the return of migrant workers. Jharkhand’s rural development minister Alamgir Alam said the state will allow all standalone shops and will provide work to migrant workers, who have returned home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-4-0-what-states-are-saying-about-relaxations/story-GVHykIiSwBaQVIFBjRyrkO.html

These employees for various reasons, such as non approval in case of added institutions and disciplinary cases, cannot get the new pay scale.The hike is applicable for state government employees and those of aided educational institutions drawing pay under ORSP Rules, 2008.Teaching and non-teaching staff of state universities, medical college teachers, subordinate judicial officers, work-charged employees drawing regular scale of pay and job contract workers will also be eligible for payment of increased DA.The increased DA will be paid in cash and can be drawn in the pay bill of May 2020 and onwards.

16-05-2020||India||Packed in Myanmar’s decision to deport 22 insurgents, a sharp message to others||The 22 northeastern insurgents from six outfits flown out of Myanmar in a special flight on Friday have landed in India and have been handed over to the police in Manipur and Assam.Myanmar’s decision marks a huge step forward for security cooperation between the two neighbours that New Delhi believes sets the template for other anti-India insurgents caught by Naypyidaw.But it has taken months of hard work and perseverance. Nine months, to be precise, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.The first step was taken during the India visit of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar Defence Services. One of the many meetings that Senior General Hlaing had in Delhi with the Indian leadership was with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. It was at this July-end meeting that Ajit Doval broached the topic.The 22 insurgents had been captured by Myanmar military during joint operations carried out a few months earlier along the borders of Myanmar’s Sagaing Region. The operations, codenamed “Operation Sunshine”, had started in February and continued through March.INSURGENTS DEPORTED FROM MYANMARNDFB (S)Rajen Daimary @ Rebgon, self-styled Home SecySelf-styled Capt Sansuma Basumatary @ SarontsaiGagaram Basumatary @ Capt.

The tactic, called “hammer and anvil”, involves one force pinning down the enemy while the other corners and slams them. The insurgents had been extorting money from Indian personnel working on the $ 484 million Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project in Myanmar funded by India.The second phase focused largely on anti-India insurgents; the Myanmar army action forced the insurgents to cross over and surrender to Indian border guards. It is during the second phase of the operation that the 22 insurgents deported on Friday were caught by Myanmar military.Senior security officials who have been closely associated with the exercise to get back the insurgents said NSA Ajit Doval and Home Minister Amit Shah oversaw the efforts that continued ever since the July meeting.The decision to deport these 22 insurgents, an official said, is a sharp contrast to the time when Myanmar would rarely act against the anti-India insurgents for one reason or the other. As a result of cooperation between security agencies of the two countries, Myanmar initially took some action and later conducted joint operations with Indian security forces.Also Read: Nudged by Ajit Doval, Myanmar army hands over 22 northeast insurgentsThis moved up a notch when Myanmar okayed joint operations Indian soldiers would move into its territory to back it up as happened during the 2019 operations. Indian soldiers had also provided military provisions and tactical support in the form of UAV and satellite imagery to the Myanmar units on the ground.Handing over insurgents is a huge leap, the official said, adding that this places security cooperation between India and Myanmar at a similar plane as the UAE which, due to synergy between security agencies of the two countries, isn’t a haven for criminals wanted in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/packed-in-myanmar-s-decision-to-deport-22-insurgents-a-sharp-message-to-others/story-e1Nen0xQkwhoBAUJjSlU3I.html
16-05-2020||India||The office is dead; long live the office||Work from home (WFH) is the new mantra — partly because it is safe and convenient, the most important things right now; and partly because it could mean lower real estate costs for companies struggling to cope with what the pandemic and the lockdown have done to their business. Not every job can be done from home, but even in jobs that can be, not everyone has the luxury of working from home. Yes, luxury. WFH assumes that people have the connectivity they need to work from home; that their homes have quiet (or not-so-quiet) corners from where they can work; and that they do not mind work becoming all consuming. Because it will. Many people are under the misapprehension that working from home will improve their work-life balance. It may, but largely in jobs that involve either making or listening to presentations (oh yes, there are many such). In other jobs, particularly operational roles that involve getting one’s hands dirty (figuratively; coding is an example), the balance will tilt strongly towards work. The term always-on acquires a new meaning in the context of working from home. Sure, as pointed out by reams of literature produced over the past few decades on how to work from home, the not-so-secret secret is switching off — except that companies may not want that.I’ve worked from home off and on over the past month, including one two-week period when I did not step out of home (not a quarantine; more a constraint necessitated by something else). I have the luxury of a study in a nice sunlit corner, good connectivity, a very quiet neighbourhood (April was mild, so I left the garden door open), and excellent company (as you can see from the photograph), but I hated it. For starters, I missed my commute. I’m probably in a minority here; I can’t think of someone in Mumbai or Bengaluru saying this (my commute involves being driven through the most beautiful part of Delhi); but the commute in gives me an opportunity to process the information I’ve assimilated since morning, catch up with my e-mail, and plan the day ahead. At home, my commute involved entering the study. I also missed my commute back. I usually leave office around 10pm, and spend the 20 minutes or so it takes to be driven back home catching up with news I might have missed in the course of the day. It’s the period of the day when the Page 1 team gets a barrage of messages from me, all links with the same question – “Do we have this?”Not having an average departure time also meant that I didn’t know when to switch off. My work day, which would usually end around 10pm, with messages being exchanged till 11.00, sometimes 11.30, stretched on and on. But maybe this was just me. I also missed the social interaction at the workplace — that accidental meeting and resulting conversation that results in a series; an all-hands bureau meeting; the Page 1 meeting at the hub table. Social media has trained us to build relationships with those we rarely encounter in the real world; better collaborative tools are enabling us work together without ever having to be in the same room (even country); but there is still something missing. For decades now, companies have spent money and effort on having the right kind of offices. They believed (note the past tense) that these encouraged preferred work processes and interactions, and contributed to building an organisational culture. From Google to Godrej, Infosys to ITC, and Hindustan Unilever to HT Media, they invested in offices and campuses. Now, health and economic reasons are making them swear by working from home. The question they will all have to answer is whether it is possible to build and maintain a culture minus the office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-office-is-dead-long-live-the-office/story-2dxD6LLHuZ4cHZ1yftDjNN.html

16-05-2020||India||IAS officer from Madhya Pradesh blames Maharashtra govt for chaos at inter-state border||A senior IAS officer from Madhya Pradesh on Friday blamed the Maharashtra government for a chaotic situation and crisis at the MP border, a charge refuted by Maharashtra government officials.Bijasan on the MP-Maharashtra border in Barwani district, 313 kilometres south west of Bhopal, has seen a good number of labourers from Maharashtra heading to various parts of MP, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan etc being dropped at the border by Maharashtra government’s state transport buses since Monday, officials said.This has led to a surge in the crowd of labourers and their family members coming in trucks, mini trucks, cars, taxis, auto-rickshaws, bikes etc and even walking and riding bicycles since lockdown restrictions were put in place from March 23, to cover hundreds of kilometres, according to officials.While the MP government arranged to send MP labourers to their destinations in buses from the border for quite some time, it added 100 more buses to the fleet to drop other states’ labourers at the UP border since Tuesday albeit with change of buses twice en route. But the number of buses provided by the MP government so far has been hardly able to accommodate the labourers with their number swelling leading to frayed tempers on the border on Thursday and stone pelting by a section of labourers on government personnel. However, none were injured, officials said.Responding to journalists’ questions on his visit to Bijasan on Friday, Commissioner of Indore division Akash Tripathi said, “It’s not our responsibility. Maharashtra should not do this. Also, they are dropping ‘wrong people at wrong places. People from eastern MP districts like Rewa, Satna etc are also being dropped here. Even eastern UP’s people are being dropped here on the western side. They should be dropped at a further point or they should be sent by trains. What is happening is wrong. But our chief minister has taken this stand on a humanitarian ground that since they are walking long distances we should use our buses to send them up to the UP border.”He said, “We have now increased the number of buses from 100 to 200 given the crowd of other states’ people and made available buses in the morning to avoid any chaotic situation. We are making all out efforts to see to it that the migrant labourers from other states don’t have to walk in such scorching heat but we have our own limitations of resources. If they have to send labourers to borders they should limit the number.”In reply to a question on social distancing norms thrown into disarray, the senior IAS officer said, “We are trying our best to see that they travel on seats in buses and are wearing masks but crowd management is a big issue here. In such a situation complete compliance of the norm is difficult. Besides, we see a huge crowd in trucks coming from Maharashtra and hardly any social distancing norms followed.”As per officials, after lockdown 2.0, the number of such labourers has gone up from 20,000 to 25,000 per day from a few thousands in the beginning.For the past about 12 days the district administration has allowed the other states’ labourers to enter the state without facing any hassles unlike earlier when the border was opened after intervals and it witnessed frequent confrontations between two sides. Three cops were injured in a stone pelting incident on May 3. Till the bus service was started for other states’ labourers by MP government since Tuesday those walking or riding bicycles used to be accommodated in trucks and other vehicles at the insistence of police personnel but a large number of workers continued to walk after finding no space in trucks and other vehicles, said officials.Nimad region in Madhya Pradesh comprising of Khandwa, Khargone, Burhanpur and Barwani districts witnesses higher temperatures than other parts of the state in summers. The nearest district in UP is Lalitpur district from Bijasan, about 600 kilometres away, while Jhansi which labourers mainly prefer to go to is about 650 kilometres away.Nitin Kareer, additional chief secretary, revenue department, Maharashtra government who is in charge of the operation related to workers said, “We are not leaving anyone on the border. We are ready to send them by train and also sending some of them by buses, only in the cases where we get permission from the Madhya Pradesh government. Some cases may have happened, I’m not denying that but otherwise we are in touch and have not heard anything like this from them (Madhya Pradesh government).(With inputs from HT Maharashtra bureau).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-officer-from-madhya-pradesh-blames-maharashtra-govt-for-chaos-at-inter-state-border/story-bMSZ48j1BVKorPBsjFkCTM.html
16-05-2020||India||In long walk back home, migrants battle hunger, scourge of Covid-19||On Wednesday, Ram Prakash Gautam, a migrant worker from Mumbai, has just reached Varanasi and he says he feels blessed.“I feel safe here,” he says, as he alights from a container truck carrying 49 workers from Mumbai, which was stopped by the police. “We found 49 people inside the container truck instead of goods mentioned in the documents,” says traffic circle office Awadhesh Pandey.The workers started their journey on May 9 after hiring a truck for Rs 1,50,000 lakh. “We were left with no choice ,” Gautam said, claiming that they got out of the container only twice during the four day journey. “We survived on biscuits and water.” Also Read: States look to ease curbs, restart interstate travel in lockdown 4.0A reverse migration, forced upon people by the loss of their livelihoods -- itself the result of the lockdown enforced to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease -- is playing out across India. Tens of thousands of workers are finally making their way back home. Some, the lucky ones, are on special trains organised by the government; others are on buses organised by the states; still others have hired trucks or stowed away on them; and there are those who are cycling back home -- or simply walking. Anything between Rs 1,50,000 to Rs 3,00,000 is being charged for an inhuman truck ride back home.On Thursday, 15 migrant workers died in accidents across three states, taking the total number of migrant workers who died to 110 since March 25 when the lockdown began.For almost a month, the only way the workers could return home was by walking , cycling, or hitching rides. Then, a few state governments started organising buses. The central government came out with a protocol on inter-state movement of migrants on buses -- all inter-state movement was barred until then -- in late April, and then, perhaps realising that trains were faster, safer, and could accommodate more, finally started running special Shramik trains on May 1, International Workers’ Day.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOn Friday evening, the Union home ministry asked all states and Union Territories to make sure that workers didn’t have to walk back home and to facilitate their travel through special buses trains. But despite the launch of the trains, some workers have hired trucks, paying up to Rs 4,000 per passenger, to return home. Social activists said the workers are not willing to wait to take trains or buses -- most states say it could take a week or 10 days to organise the trains or buses.Huddled in container boxes, concrete mixture bins, and cargo compartments, the workers have taken almost non-stop journeys of up to 100 hours to reach their villages in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, travelling from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana.Also Read: Govt officials propose more power to states in fight against Covid-19Maharashtra home minister Anil Deskmukh said the state government has provided migrant workers food and shelter and also transport to go back home. “We have also assured them that work will start soon and they should be patient,” he said. Yet, after weeks of the lockdown, many workers do not want to wait any longer. A report by Stranded Workers Action Network said that 79% of the workers returning are daily wage factory or construction workers and another 8% are domestic workers and drivers.“It is layered and a complex situation,” said Anandita Adhikhari, a doctorate student at Brown University, United States, who has anchored the network with close to 100 young volunteers from across India.SWAN’s study released on May 2 said around 72% of those returning home has almost run out of ration, usually provided by the local state government, and cash. Many said they did not receive salaries for March, nor cash handouts from the state.Adhikhari said most of the workers, including those who have stayed back in anticipation of work being available , have fallen into another cycle of debt as they have taken loans from landlords or local shopkeepers to sustain themselves during the lockdown.Also Read: Sops, reforms for farmers in third tranche of govt aidChhattisgarh based social activist Priyanka Shukla said most of the workers travelling have not received any help from their respective states. “They are on their own. Their stories are of pain and anguish, which should shame us all,” she said, directing a group of 40 migrant labourers, cycling from Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow on way to their village in state’s Champa district, towards a water cooler at a gas filling station in Bilaspur.Shukla, who has documented travel of about 1000 migrant workers crossing Bilaspur in the past one week said: “About 200 workers cross Bilaspur every night on foot or cycling as they avoid the heat of the day. They are from Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and are coming from the southern states and Maharashtra.”Sataria Hembrom, 31, walked back to his village in Jharkhand’s Chaibasa from Mumbai, a distance of more than 1,800 km, with six others. All the seven worked at a construction site in Navi Mumbai, where the work stopped on March 22. Initially, they bought food from their savings. They lasted a month. Then they started running low on money.“We had two options; face Covid without food or walk home. They started their journey on May 2 and ended it on May 13, walking and hitching rides. Hembrom, who has blisters on his feet because of the walking, appreciated the assistance of policemen all along the way. “At some places police helped us to get a lift in trucks,” he said. Otherwise, they would just walk.Many of the workers have no money; whatever they had, including savings, went towards food, and to pay truck and bus drivers. “It was a horrible journey. One man fell down from the truck and hurt himself,” recalled Lakshmi Morya, an autorickshaw driver, who paid Rs 3,000 to a truck driver, to travel back to his village in Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh. He reached on May 13, four days after starting from Goregaon in Mumbai, with 70 other people, all packed into the goods compartment of a truck.Joshana S, a resident of Pratiksha Nagar in Mumbai’s Sion, said two of her brothers-in-law have already left for Kanpur in trucks and two other relatives will leave on Thursday. “It is getting difficult to survive in Mumbai with no income for two months and all work avenues closed,” she said. Sunil Yadav, from the Pani Haq Samiti in Mumbai said small companies, where these migrants work, have stopped paying them or helping them with food.Some workers spent their money on cycles, paying anywhere between Rs 2000 to Rs 3000 to buy one and ride back home.And those that couldn’t afford either , simply walked -- like the 16 migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh, who were mowed down by a goods train while they were asleep on the tracks near Aurangabad in Maharashtra. Walking along railway tracks ensures two things, the workers said: one, there weren’t too many policemen around; and two, it kept them on the right track.Not all are on the road. many workers continue to languish in caps. Ramesh Kumar (26), a resident of Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, and two-dozen of his friends, all working in the construction sector in north Kerala, decided to wak to Mangaluru from where they heard they could catch a train to Delhi. That was back in March.They were intercepted by the Kerala police and sent to a government shelter -- where they remain. “Government is providing food to us. But we are jobless for two months. Some of our relatives are starving back home. We are not slaves. We are desperate to go back.” Thus far, Kerala has seen 24 Shramik trains t o take back workers , but the state still has around 4 lakh migrant workers housed in 12,000-odd camps across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-long-walk-back-home-migrants-battle-hunger-scourge-of-disease/story-TizRfUz69osJQ0Uqmm6jZN.html
16-05-2020||India||India goes past China in Covid-19 cases but withlower rate of fatalities||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India on Friday crossed the total count of infections in China, where the highly contagious disease originated late last year, even as experts pointed out that the outbreak has not been as deadly as in the neighbouring country at the same stage of transmissions.The Covid-19 cases in the country rose to 85,709 on Friday, according to HT’s dashboard, with 2,680 people having died so far of the respiratory illness. China has so far reported 82,933 Covid-19 cases, 4,633 of whom have died of the disease. Just four states – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi – together account for two-thirds of India’s cases.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIndia’s fatality rate was 3.23%, compared to the global death rate of 6.92%; the recovery rate was 34.06%, according to the latest figures released by the Union health ministry.Experts say that a national lockdown imposed in India on March 25 to slow the spread of the disease appeared to have been effective in slowing the infections. However, with the gradual easing of restrictions – necessitated by sluggish economic indicators – they expect the cases to rise in the coming days.China imposed a 76-day lockdown earlier this year in Wuhan, the city where the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen is believed to have jumped to humans. The move proved to be effective, with no Covid-19 death being reported in official figures in the neighbouring country over the last 30 days.Also Read: Concerns over infant mortality as Covid hits immunisation drives“Lowering the fraction of the people who test positive is a better indicator of whether new infections have been controlled than the doubling rate, which is flawed as it also takes into account old and active cases. A low fraction of positives among people tested indicates falling infection (rates) because as testing increases, so do the number of people who test positive,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.The spread of Covid-19 has been slower in India than in China and other parts of the world, according to epidemiologists.“The health systems in states haven’t been overwhelmed; there are no sudden unexplained hospitalisations and deaths, as seen during dengue or encephalitis outbreaks. The data from China is less reliable. There’s far more transparency in India, where attempts by some governments such as West Bengal to juggle death numbers have been quickly exposed,” said Dr Ambarish Dutta, associate professor of epidemiology and public health, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar. Also Read: IAS trainees gear up to join Covid-19 fight“We have more active cases (than in China) because the growth rate has been slow. The disease appears to be less severe in India; we still don’t have scientific evidence on why this is happening, it could be cross infections, it could be innate immunity or higher humidity and temperature, we still don’t know,” said Dutta.India’s recovery rate improved to 33.6%, up from 32.83% on Wednesday. Deaths in India are two per one million population, compared to three deaths per million in China. Data from the 50 countries with the most cases shows that deaths per million are the lowest in the two most populated nations in the world, except for Bangladesh.“If performance of hospitals is being compared, case fatality rate matters, but to assess an epidemic, state of the epidemic is being assessed, deaths per million is the statistic that tells us whether a district or state is in a safer zone than another,” said Reddy.With most states moving towards a staggered lifting of the lockdown, experts say the progress of the outbreak over the next few weeks will depend on the lessons learned so far.“You can’t police social distancing; people must learn to protect themselves. The acid test will be how we behave as we exit from the lockdown in the next few days,” said Dutta.Reddy said the lockdown imposed in China was largely effective in containing the infections. “China’s success is that it prevented the spread across the country with its rapid and complete lockdown. It locked down very quickly, and stopped domestic travel using the hukou system very rapidly, unlike India, where domestic travel was allowed till March 24, which led to multiple seeding of infection before lockdown,” said Reddy.The hukou system is a family registration programme that works as a domestic passport and is used to regulate travel and control population distribution.“The focus for India now is not rising cases, but the rate of spread of the disease. Covid-19 is here to stay, cases will go up; we have to be prepared for managing severe disease. India’s R0 is 1.4, we have to work to bring it below one to reverse the pandemic,” said an epidemiologist at the health ministry, requesting anonymity. To transition into a “new normal” in which social and economic life can function, the WHO recommends identifying hot spots and clusters, and building capacity of systems and responders to find, isolate and care for cases. “There can be no illusions, we are in this for the long haul. Covid-19 importation to Thailand was on January 13, but early and aggressive measures, including unprecedented physical distancing measures, have helped keep the number of cases low in the region as compared to other parts of the world,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-goes-past-china-in-covid-cases-but-withlower-rate-of-fatalities/story-1rlSwXO3Z2oVLNGDjpknYM.html
16-05-2020||India||‘How can we stop migrants from walking’, asks SC as it nixes plea||“How can we stop them from walking,” one of the judges on the bench remarked as the Supreme Court on Friday declined to entertain an application that sought a direction to the Union government to identify stranded migrant workers, take care of their needs, and provide free transport to them. The application, filed by lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava cited the accident in Aurangabad on May 8 when 16 migrant workers walking back home to Madhya Pradesh from Maharashtra were mowed down by a goods train. The nationwide lockdown enforced by India on March 25 to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease left migrant workers without jobs and a way to get back home. It was only in late April that some states started transporting their workers back from other states using buses and only on May 1 that the government started running special trains for them. Srivastava had earlier filed a petition in March, citing efforts by the workers to walk back home to which the Centre responded in an affidavit on March 31, detailing various steps taken by it to address the issues raised in the petition. The new application filed by the petitioner referred to comments by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, when filing the earlier affidavit -- that “there is no person walking on the roads in an attempt to reach his/her home towns/villages.”The central government, in response to the earlier petition, had said that there were 26,476 relief and shelter camps across the country housing about one million migrant workers and other people in need.The court disposed of that case on April 27.On Friday, the bench headed by justice L Nageswara Rao left it to the states concerned to take action to deal with the problem, maintaining that it could not pass orders based on media reports. “ It is impossible for this court to monitor who is walking and who is not walking,” justice Rao said.The central government told the court that migrant workers were leaving cities on foot, though travel arrangements were made by way of running of special trains. “They are not waiting for their turn and they start walking. They may wait for their turn rather than starting on foot,” solicitor general Mehta, who was representing the central government, told the court. Mehta also said that using force to stop migrant workers from walking home would be counterproductive.“Your knowledge is based on newspaper reports. How can you expect us to pass orders? Let the states take action,” the SC bench told the petitioner, dismissing his application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-we-stop-migrants-from-walking-asks-sc-as-it-nixes-plea/story-hTGOakTTSV1dPSpbZFdk3I.html
16-05-2020||India||Sops, reforms for farmers in third tranche of govt aid||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday announced a mix of financial, legislative and reform measures aimed largely at increasing the pricing power of farmers – or share of profits in farm incomes – by proposing to dismantle historical domestic trade barriers, bring new laws for freer food and commodities markets, and better infrastructure. Sitharaman’s third tranche of measures, aggregating Rs 1.63 lakh crore and part of a larger Rs 20-lakh crore stimulus, did not contain any direct cash transfer programme for farmers, or money in hand, but is a mix of new allocations and top-up to existing agriculturally critical schemes, some them announced in Budget 2020-21 in February. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIt is also an attempt to push through critical legislative reforms that can free up India’s agricultural markets and improve farm incomes. Farming, the largest source of livelihoods, supports nearly half of all Indians and it has been hobbled by myriad archaic regulations. According to estimates by economists and securities research firms, the measures announced thus far add up to around Rs 18.3 lakh crore (including around Rs 5.7 lakh crore of monetary measures taken in March by the central bank, and the Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package announced in late March ). Finance ministry officials said there will be two more tranches -- one to be announced on Saturday and the other on Sunday. DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at consultancy firm EY India, said, “One salient feature of this tranche is that the direct fiscal cost (or cash spending) accounts for nearly 30% of the estimated benefit, which is much higher than that in earlier two tranches.”His reference is to the fact that the fiscal cost of the previous tranches is estimated by economists at a fraction of the overall number – a Credit Suisse report put the fiscal cost of the Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package, the Rs 5.7 lakh crore monetary measures, and the first tranche of Rs 5.94 lakh crore announced on Wednesday at around Rs 55,000 crore. On Friday, the finance minister announced Rs 1 lakh crore to fund new farm-gate infrastructure, or simply agricultural produce markets, harvest management facilities, and a law to permit farmers to freely sell their produce to any trader of their choice, potentially ending persistent trade barriers in food trade that have been characterised by so-called agricultural market produce committees (APMCs). Sitharaman said a mechanism would be fixed to assure profitable prices for farmers, which means at least a baseline profitable price signal available at the “time of sowing”. This is referred to as price discovery, whereby farmers will be able to estimate crop prices before taking sowing decisions so that they are able to grow commodities for which there will be demand. “A central law will be formulated to provide adequate choices to farmers to sell produce at attractive price, barrier-free inter-state trade and a framework for e-trading of agriculture produce.”She also outlined proposed changes to an existing commodity rationing law, The Essential Commodities Act (ESA), to ease farm trade. “The government will amend the Essential Commodities Act to enable better price realisation for farmers by attracting investments and making agriculture sector competitive,” she said.The indication is that the government will use the law more sparingly, a proposal for which had been made by an interministerial panel to reform the sector in January. The ESA allows the government to decide how much stock wholesale traders or even retailers can store, legally called “stock limits”. Cereals, edible oils, oilseeds, pulses, onions and potato will be deregulated, she said. Stock limits will be imposed under very exceptional circumstances, such as national calamities or during price gouging. The finance minister, responding to a question, rejected the Opposition’s charges that much of her announcements were re-allocated spending and had included taxpayer refunds. “We have included schemes announced in the Budget. But amounts are being disbursed now. When was the Budget? In February. When we are giving expedited tax refunds, it is taxpayers money. I am specifically saying that,” Sitharaman said.These reforms in “agricultural marketing”, or the mandi system that controls buying and selling of farm produce, have been a long time in the making. Various government panels and economists have often argued for changing the existing structures of agricultural trade. APMC regulations require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where a farmer resides, rather than in an open market.They often act as cartels, evidence suggests. In December 2019, when prices peaked during the last major spike, a probe by the country’s statutory anti-monopoly body, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), revealed that one firm accounted for nearly a fifth of the total onion trading for that month at Lasalgoan APMC, Asia’s largest onion market in Maharashtra’s Nashik.Ushered in during the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere. These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling.Under the APMC system, farmers have to go through smaller crop aggregators to access bulk buyers. Over time, this has spawned layers of intermediaries spanning the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large “price spread”, or the fragmentation of profit shares due to the presence of several middlemen. Farmers often get the lowest shares.EY’s Srivastava added that “the focus on agriculture and allied sectors in this third tranche of the stimulus package may be justified due to its large share in employment. These reforms are both welfare-improving and efficiency-augmenting”.“Terms of trade has moved away from agriculture. That is what the government appears to have realised and trying to correct,” said economist YK Alagh. His reference is to the total prices paid by farmers in running their households versus total prices received by selling their produce.Agriculture in India suffers negative total revenues, or negative terms of trade implying that assets going out of the sector are more than those flowing in. Farming, therefore, has steadily become an unprofitable occupation, according to a landmark 2018 study by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a grouping of 36 countries, and the New Delhi-based think-tank ICRIER.The government will bring in a facilitative legal framework to enable farmers for engaging with processors, aggregators, large retailers, exporters, etc, in a fair and transparent manner, the minister said. “This will ensure assured returns and risk mitigation for farmers.” “A central law to enable farmers to sell to a buyer of their choice including online channels and marketplaces is expected to go a long way in maximizing farmer realisations while minimizing intermediary transaction costs. Farmers would be able to avail of price discovery and sell their products on both government platforms like e-NAM and private online grocery platforms,” said Arindam Guha, an economist with Deloitte India. To improve animal husbandry incomes, which gives higher net returns compared to crops, Sitharaman said: “We want to ensure 100% vaccination of nearly 530 million animals, a livestock size which is among the largest in the world. Despite Covid-19 lockdown, 15 million cows and buffaloes have been tagged and vaccinated.” To control foot and mouth diseases, which cripples milk output of afflicted animals, the FM announced Rs 13,343 crore. The government will set up an Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund worth Rs 15,000 crore to “support private investment in dairy processing, value addition and cattle feed infrastructure”.The government will implement a scheme for infrastructure development related to beekeeping, according to the finance minister, aiming to increase incomes of 200,000 beekeepers. The government has extended the Operation Greens for Tomatoes, Onion and Potatoes (TOP) to all fruits and vegetables. Under this, 50% subsidy would be given on transportation from surplus to deficient markets and 50% subsidy on storage. The finance minister also allotted Rs 4,000 crore for herbal plantations. “These initiatives may prove good in the long run but they do not solve the problem of farmers whose harvests perished because of the lockdown. It is clear that the government is in no mood to compensate these losses directly,” said economist Sudhir Panwar, a former member of the erstwhile UP State Planning Commission. All told, the government on Friday announced funding worth Rs 1.63 lakh crore. This includes Rs 10,000 crore for micro food enterprises, Rs 20,000 crore for fisheries, Rs 500 crore for beekeeping and another Rs 500 crore for Operation TOPs, the vegetables mission. So far, the government has unveiled measures worth over Rs 9.1 lakh crore in the earlier two tranches since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on May 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sops-reforms-for-farmers-in-third-tranche-of-govt-aid/story-A8ehBXnhqtJR5EpBOJkQ1J.html
16-05-2020||India||3 hunters, 50 officials pursue tiger under shadow of pandemic in Kerala||For almost a week now, three hunters, 50 forest and district officials and some of the residents of Thannithode, a village in central Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district, are on the trail of a big cat which strayed into a human habitation and killed a rubber tapper last week.The cat is smart. The hunters tried to bait the tiger with a live goat, but while they were waiting for it, the tiger attacked and killed a cow elsewhere in the village.It’s since been seen at many places around the village, attacked more cows, even goats and dogs; forest department officials have been using night vision cameras and drones, but while the tiger has been spotted several times, it has eluded all efforts to capture it.  Meanwhile, the 13,000-odd villagers of Thannithode are reeling under the impact of a double lockdown. The village is surrounded by sparse forests. The closest deep forest is at least 25 km away. And the closest tiger reserve, Periyar, is 105km away. To be sure, it isn’t strange to find a tiger outside the reserve, although it is unusual for the apex predator to come close to a human habitation. That’s more like how leopards behave. It all began with the attack on rubber tapper Bineesh Mathew (38) on May 6 who was attacked in a rubber plantation in Thannithode when he went to tap trees. When his colleagues heard his cries , they rushed to where he was, just in time to see a tiger dragging him away. They pelted stones and yelled, and the tiger dropped him and escaped into the forest. Mathew suffered deep gashes on his throat and chest and died on the spot. Later, Pathanamthitta district collector PB Nooh issued prohibitory orders in the village, ensuring people didn’t move around.“It is a big tiger. It could either be old or injured. The attack happened around 12 noon,” said T Mathew, another tapper, who witnessed the attack.“We have faced threats of elephants, wild boars and other animals. But this is the first time we are facing a tiger. We really dread to allow our children outside our house,” said MS Indira, a panchyat member .Wildlife experts said tiger attacks are very rare in Kerala which houses two tiger reserves and five wildlife sanctuaries.The state has 190 tigers, according to the last tiger census in 2019.“We are trying our best to tranquillise it and shift it to deep forests. Many top forest and veterinary department officials are camping in the area and we will try our best to capture the tiger alive. If this fails, we will shoot it,” said state forest minister K Raju, who announced a relief of ₹10 lakh to the family members of the victim. Conservationists have asked the government to try and relocate the animal.“Though shooting order was given by the chief wildlife warden, it will be our last option. We had set up four different cages but the animal has eluded them all. Some of the best vets and tranquilliser experts like Dr Arun Zachariah are on the job,” the minister said.Conservationists have asked the government to try and relocate the animal. “Shooting a tiger needs special permission from the National Conservation Authority. One has to be 100% certain that the animal is a man-eater. The killing of a human being could have been accidental. It is easy to kill a big cat, but before arriving at a decision we should be sure about it. The best way forward would be to capture the tiger and relocate it,” Dr PS Esa, wildlife expert and activist, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-hunters-50-officials-pursue-tiger-under-shadow-of-pandemic/story-HaImSH7BLqBY1BzagJ0zVL.html
16-05-2020||India||IAS trainees gear up to join Covid-19 fight||A majority of trainee Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers--96 out of 182--left Mussoorie’s Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration for their respective districts by road amid the national Covid-19 lockdown last week to begin their year-long field training as assistant collectors. The rest, allotted postings in farther states, are awaiting the resumption of flights to follow suit, officials aware of the matter said. Trainee officers normally spend anywhere between a month and three months at state academies mostly at the beginning of their field training and attend lectures. Officials said due to the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, they are being moved directly to districts. “Those who could travel by road left on Saturday morning for their respective districts. The others, who will be travelling to states such as Sikkim, Assam, Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal, are waiting for flights to resume,” said an official at the Academy, which is India’s premier training institution for civil servants. The official said the trainees left after their convocation was held on May 8.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSome of the 96 officers travelled in cars sent by their respective states to pick them up from the Academy while others first travelled on 30-seater buses from Mussoorie to Delhi before leaving for their districts. “There were 15 of us on each bus to ensure social distancing norms,” said a Rajasthan cadre trainee officer. “Once we reached Delhi, seven of us were screened at the Rajasthan House, where we stopped for lunch.” The officer said after that, they took cars and reached Jaipur on Saturday evening. Each car had two people. The officer said normally, they have month-long lectures at the state academy. “But this year, we are moving directly to our districts... on Wednesday.” The officer said he had been in touch with the collector of his district. “My district is in a red zone... We have also had call-ins with various additional secretaries to understand what [our] different roles will entail.” The officer said there was a feeling of apprehension, anxiety and excitement at starting work during the pandemic. “This is a once in a lifetime learning opportunity. We have a lot of questions but are eager to learn.”A second trainee officer, who was picked up from the academy, said he reported directly at his district, a Covid-19 hotspot, in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. “... I went to one of the areas where people had tested positive for Covid-19,” the second trainee said. “Today, I was attached to the DC at the railway station where a train with migrant labourers from Ahmedabad arrived.”The second officer said he observed the overall process of screening of the labourers, understood the quarantine norms and how to distribute rations. “It is a great first-hand learning experience.”Those, who are still at the academy, are brushing up their regional language skills and getting clued in about the state administrations. “Since many of them are not familiar with the regional languages, they are taking language courses, watching films and keeping tabs on the local news,” said the official cited above. “Many are also in touch with the respective state administrations. ...the West Bengal trainees had a video call with the principal secretary of health over the weekend.”A trainee from the Assam cadre said they were in touch with the state government to work out the transportation details. “Travel by road or trains to our districts, nearly 2,000 km away, would not have been feasible. So we are waiting for flights to resume.” The Assam cadre trainee said they spoke to officials about their roles, the procedures they will have to follow, especially in light of the pandemic, once they reach their districts. “We are using the Microsoft Teams app to do our video calls with senior officials and learning how schemes like MGNREGS [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme] will play a crucial role in the coming days.” Padamvir Singh, the former Academy director, said the role of assistant collectors under training depends on their supervisors--the district collectors (DCs) and district magistrates (DMs). “This is the time they spend learning about the different departments they will be in charge of as DCs and DMs,” said Singh. “However, in this pandemic situation, they can be used to collect data and help out in administration. They have no legal powers. So their role will be ancillary.”Singh added that after spending some time under training, an officer can also be put in charge of their own projects. “Since they have no legal powers yet, they can effectively act as helping hands so long as their training is not hampered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-trainees-gear-up-to-join-covid-19-fight/story-nd4nNuDaoBG8SW8edlwImJ.html
16-05-2020||India||In Covid-19 crisis diplomacy, demarches served on phone, credentials presented via video calls||The Covid-19 crisis has led to significant changes in the conduct of diplomacy, with demarches being served over the telephone and Indian envoys presenting their credentials to foreign governments via video conference.The external affairs ministry has also significantly stepped up the use of video conferences, both for internal meetings and multilateral and bilateral engagements since Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted a virtual meeting of heads of government of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) on March 15.People familiar with developments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least four demarches or formal diplomatic representations were served on Pakistani diplomats based in New Delhi by being read out over telephone. This included a demarche served on May 4 to protest against the Pakistan government’s plans to conduct elections in Gilgit-Baltistan.The serving of demarches is usually elaborate affairs, with diplomats usually being summoned to the ministry to be formally handed over the note of protest. Such meetings are also arranged after a certain amount of coordination between the two sides, but the people said such meetings are being are currently being avoided to prevent the possible spread of infections.On May 14, India’s envoy to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay, presented his credentials to the island country’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa via video conference. This ceremony – during which an envoy hands over a letter regarding his appointment to the head of state of the host country – is necessary for the envoy to formally begin his official duties.Baglay was in his office, wearing a face mask and with a bottle of sanitiser on his table, and held up the official letter during the ceremony which was joined by Rajapaksa over a video link. “#Technology in step with time leads the way! In an important innovative initiative, High Commissioner HE Gopal Baglay presented Letter of Credence to President HE @GotabayaR today in a ceremony held thru video-conferencing,” the Indian mission tweeted.A few days earlier, Baglay had arrived in Colombo in unusual circumstances.After being unable to join his post for more than two months because of Covid-19-related travel restrictions, Baglay flew to Colombo on May 8 in an air force transport aircraft that ferried 12.5 tonnes of medical supplies. Several other diplomats posted to foreign missions are still waiting to join their new assignments.The external affairs ministry recently considered a proposal to allow several foreign ambassadors-designate posted to New Delhi to present their credentials via video conference, but the move was shot down at the higher level, the people cited above said.“There was a feeling that the ambassadors-designate would miss out on the colourful and unique ceremonies held at Rashtrapati Bhavan to present their credentials,” said one of the people cited above.However, the foreign envoys who are yet to present their credentials were informed that they could function as full-fledged ambassadors in view of unusual circumstances caused by the pandemic, the people said.As the use of video conferences has increased, some of the more tech savvy foreign envoys based in New Delhi have been briefing the media using a variety of apps. The UK high commission, which usually hosts an iftar during Ramzan, has scheduled a “virtual iftar” on May 21 that will be addressed by acting high commissioner Jan Thompson and inter-faith leaders.There has also been an uptick in video conferences that are being joined by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, both for multilateral and bilateral consultations. One of the most important such meetings was the video conference hosted on May 11 by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo that was joined by Jaishankar and his counterparts from Australia, Japan, Brazil, Israel and South Korea.“These conferences aren’t totally unique because diplomacy is also about picking up the phone to get in touch with our foreign counterparts on important issues. It’s just that we are using such methods more often now,” said a second person who declined to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-post-covid-diplomacy-demarches-served-on-phone-credentials-presented-via-video-calls/story-iX3h03C6YmUUiui02YO5EO.html
16-05-2020||India||Concerns over infant mortality as Covid-19 hits immunisation drives||The involvement of accredited social health activists (Asha) and anganwadi workers primarily in Covid-19 related activities has triggered fears about its possible fallout on efforts to check infant mortality because of their basic work related to immunisation and meeting nutritional requirements for children in rural areas.The work of anganwadi workers includes the supply of nutritious food to children in villages while the promotion of universal immunisation is among the key responsibilities of an Asha.“With the immunisation drive in India coming to a standstill, and as we are diverting our resources to Covid-related activities, the fear is that this might undo any good progress...,” said an official of government think-tank Niti Aayog, which is involved in the Poshan Abhiyaan to check malnutrition. According to the 2018 Sample Registration System Bulletin released on May 9, India’s infant mortality rate has declined from 33 deaths per 1000 live births in 2017 to 32 in 2018. The rate rose in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand. National Institute of Nutrition (Hyderabad) director R Hemalatha said these numbers mean that India is missing the targets for the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, or a to-do list for tackling conflict, hunger, land degradation, gender inequality, and climate crisis. “India will miss the same targets for neonatal mortality rate, or infant mortality rate, which require us to have 12 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030. If the same trends continue, we might be able to realise the under-5 mortality rate of 25 deaths per 1000 live births,” said Hemlatha.The National Institute of Nutrition was involved in the drafting of the bulletin. The Niti Aayog official cited above said the one-point decline in the national infant mortality rate shows that the pace of decline has been arrested. The rate in 2013 was 40, 39 in 2014 and 37 in 2015. It fell to 34 in 2016. In 2017 and 2018, the rate was 33 and 32.Anganwadi workers and helpers under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme visit homes to teach women about the importance of nutrition, hygiene, pregnancy care and the immunisation among other things. They help supply supplementary nutrition and collect the data needed for the delivery of services. India faces a shortage of health workers with a doctor-population ratio of 1:1,457 against a prescribed 1:1,000 and relies heavily on the anganwadi and Asha network for public health duties. Asha and anganwadi workers have been engaged in contact tracing of Covid-19 patients in their localities across the country as their centres have been shut down since the lockdown to check the spread of the pandemic was announced in late March. Bihar principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar said the immunisation was stopped on March 24 before it was restarted on May 6. He said the immunisation has played a key role in Bihar’s 3-point decline in the infant mortality rate. He said anemia is a key problem in Bihar and the ICDS resources the anganwadi network delivers are crucial.Assam chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna said Asha and anganwadi workers have over the last three months been primarily engaged in contact tracing duties. “But we decided that the immunisation has to go on...”Rakhi Dandona, a professor at the Public Health Foundation of India, said the effect of this year’s activities will be found in a few years, but there is a genuine concern among health practitioners. “We had made a lot of gains in maternal care, and are we going to lose some of that? We do not know yet. But we know home deliveries would have gone up, and antenatal care and the immunisation activities have gone down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-infant-mortality-as-covid-hits-immunisation-drives/story-NHHjoyN5vcIWAle3nV0Z5M.html
16-05-2020||India||Govt notifies guidelines for practising telemedicine||The government has gazette notified guidelines to practice telemedicine in India, a significant step as telemedicine consultation was a grey area in India.The experts in the centre had been working on drafting standard guidelines that doctors could refer to because of the challenges posed for in-person consultation owing to the country’s large size and varied topography.Telemedicine is referred to the delivery and facilitation of health and health-related services including medical care, provider and patient education, health information services, and self-care via telecommunications and digital communication technologies, a practice that has gained significance globally over the past few years with advances in technology. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn India it had been a somewhat grey area because there was no central guideline regulating the practice even though some states had come out with individual guidelines. The centre had been in the process of drafting these guidelines for sometime that got expedited because of the restrictions imposed by the sudden lockdown.The Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India (MCI), has been working on the guidelines amended the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, to include telemedicine consultation. However, the guidelines prohibit use of digital technology to conduct surgical or invasive procedures remotely.“We had already put in six months of work into the guidelines and, when the coronavirus pandemic happened, we expedited it. Technology platforms were something available and being used, but were not regulated, which exposed both patients and providers to challenges…” Dr Nikhil Tandon, head, department of endocrinology and metabolism, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, had explained earlier when the draft was out during March end. Dr Tandon is a member of the Board of Governors, MCI.The release of guidelines that aim at protecting both patients and practitioners got expedited because of the restrictions on movement imposed during the national lockdown to contain the pandemic, as the practice provides patient’s safety, as well as health workers’ safety, especially in situations where there is risk of contagious infections.“Disasters and pandemics pose unique challenges to providing health care. Though telemedicine will not solve them all, it is well suited for scenarios in which medical practitioners can evaluate and manage patients. A telemedicine visit can be conducted without exposing staff to viruses/infections in the times of such outbreaks. Telemedicine practice can prevent the transmission of infectious diseases reducing the risks to both health care workers and patients,” the guidelines say.“…It can provide rapid access to medical practitioners who may not be immediately available in person. In addition, it makes available extra working hands to provide physical care at the respective health institutions. Thus, health systems that are invested in telemedicine are well positioned to ensure that patients with Covid-19 kind of issues receive the care they need.”In the long run, there is a special focus on Health and Wellness Centres that provide preventive and primary healthcare within a 5 km radius at the grassroots level, especially in remote and largely inaccessible areas.There are a number of benefits of telemedicine. It increases timely access to appropriate interventions, including faster access to services that may not otherwise be available.One of the major advantages of telemedicine, say experts, can be saving cost and effort, especially of rural patients, as they need not travel long distances for obtaining consultation and treatment.The practice can be particularly helpful for patients who need a follow up consultation but do not have to be physically present for a check-up, which will, in turn, reduce the burden on the secondary hospitals.“There are a number of technologies that can be used in telemedicine, which can help patients adhere better to their medication regimens and manage their diseases better. Telemedicine can also enable the availability of vital parameters of the patient to the physician with the help of medical devices such as for blood pressure, blood glucose, etc management,”the guidelines further mention.The results from the home montiring devices can be directly uploaded online for a physician to access, and advise accordingly.The expert document has also provided a list of medicines that can be prescribed by doctors to treat patients.Telemedicine includes all channels of communication with the patient that leverage information technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange.However, telemedicine services cannot be used for providing emergency care when alternative in-person care is available. Also, it should largely be limited to first aid, life-saving measure, counselling and advice on referral.Health care providers say it is a welcome move, not just the under current circumstances but also in the long run, when physical examination is not required.“It will help to have a standard operating guidelines in place as earlier different guidelines were emerging from different states. Apollo has a telemedicine programme running for long, and through our network we cater to states such as Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, and higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh such as Kaza and Keylong. The formal notification will help us scale up and reach out to a larger population base. It anyway doesn’t make sense for a patient to come all the way to a health facility just to show, say, blood reports,” says Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.“Also, telehealth is definitely going to be a key component of the new normal that we are going to see in the post-pandemic world,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-notifies-guidelines-for-practisingtelemedicine/story-zSVg6KuS98xedy8rHGQdIL.html
16-05-2020||India||Govt officials propose more power to states in fight against Covid-19||The country may continue to be divided into red, orange, and green zones, after the current phase of lockdown ends on May 17, but it could be the states deciding the classification, officials involved in the Central government’s deliberations on the matter said. To be sure, no decision has been taken on this. The Centre is currently evaluating suggestions from the states on the next phase of the lockdown (or if there should be one) and is expected to issue guidelines shortly. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAt the meeting between the Prime Minister and chief ministers last week, several CMs raised the issue of zoning and also pointed out that focusing on containment zones, and classifying them as red, orange, and green, would probably work better than classifying an entire district. Also Read: Need to wait on resuming air travel: Niti Aayog memberThe discussions, the officials added, are also looking at whether smaller areas within districts can be used for the classification. The aim is to open up more areas for economic activities.One plan is for the Centre to define the three zones and leave the rest to the states, one of the officials said, asking not to be named. Under the current system, the union government divides different districts into red, orange and green zones based on the data provided by the state and then shares the details with the states every week.At the meeting between the PM and the CMs last week, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, and Punja CM, Captain Amarinder Singh asked the centre to give them more powers to demarcate red or orange zones to allow more economic activities.According to functionaries present in the meeting, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal proposed a division based on containment and non-containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-officials-propose-more-power-to-states/story-jsiX6SJgAQfdMxlCt7WLlO.html
16-05-2020||India||‘Need to wait on resuming air travel’: Niti Aayog member||India needs to wait for flights to resume because the air that circulates inside the plane’s pressurised cabin may be conducive to the spread of the coronavirus disease, a senior member of the government’s team to combat Covid-19 said on Friday. The comments by Dr Vinod Paul, Niti Aayog member and head of the empowered group overseeing the Covid-19 medical emergency management plan, came even as a senior civil aviation ministry official told HT that the ministry was now ready to begin operations, which were suspended when a nationwide lockdown was clamped on March 25. International operations were stopped three days earlier. “We should wait for flights to start,’’ said Dr Paul said on a day the Airports Authority of India (AAI) issued standard operating procedures for passengers to follow when flights resume.“There are issues which need further study,’’ he added. “Mainly the issue is of the pressurised cabin. This could be conducive to the spread of the disease. Also, it’s the same air which will be shared by all. So we have to think very carefully before we begin flying about the implications of it all.’’To be sure, a final decision on when to resume flying is yet to be taken. Globally, research has suggested that the virus can be transmitted through air conditioning but no conclusive studies have proven that air travel is any worse than surface transport. A senior government official said on condition of anonymity said that the view that the condition was not right for air travel to resume was a view expressed by not just Dr Paul but other health professionals that the government was consulting. These professionals included experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research, the country’s apex biomedical research body. However, the official said that there were economic costs to suspending air travel and that the government may have to eventually find a way around the problem. “There are many countries which never stopped flights,’’ said this official. “The air in a pressurised cabin is recycled and is perhaps cleaner than regular air.’’ The concern about air conditioning has been expressed before, especially when the Railways resumed services for migrant labourers and later, special passenger trains, last week. “As per the ministry of health guidelines, centralised AC is acceptable provided complete air change inside an AC coach takes place at least 12 times per hour,’’ the national transporter said in a statement. When asked about the resumption of rail services, Dr Paul said airlines would also resume but only after the authorities found way to minimise the risks. It could be in the form of allowing only those who had tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, for instance, he added. Earlier in the day, the AAI, which manages 100-odd airports in India, said air travelers must maintain a distance of four feet from co-passengers, wear a mask and other protective gear, wash or sanitise their hands frequently and carry a 350 ml bottle of sanitiser all the time. Downloading the Aarogya Setu app in mobile phones will be mandatory and passengers will have to do a web check-in before the journey and a carry a print out of the boarding pass.The stamping of boarding passes has also been suspended to reduce contact between passengers and security staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-wait-on-resuming-air-travel-niti-aayog-member/story-ridY6sQIog1CHrWvKOH0IO.html
16-05-2020||India||States look to ease curbs, restart interstate travel in lockdown 4.0||Several states on Friday submitted their proposals for Covid-19 lockdown 4.0, asking the Centre to allow interstate travel, easier movement in non-containment zones and sectors like tourism and hospitality to restart work to revive the economy, multiple officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said suggestions from the states would be considered for formulating guidelines for the next phase of the lockdown to check the pandemic spread, which is expected to begin from May 18. He said the next set of the curbs are going to be different from the earlier lockdowns. The Centre is likely to allow more flexibility to the states in formulating the fresh lockdown guidelines.Officials said Punjab has suggested doing away with the zoning system (red, orange and green) based on the scale of the Covid-19 cases with no activity allowed in the areas falling under the first category. It wants all activities to be allowed in non-containment areas. “We have also suggested that all public transport buses should run and shops, except malls, be allowed to open,” said an official on condition of anonymity. The state wants the lockdown to be extended till May end, the official added. Also Read: Delhi wants to restart life from Monday — with social distanceAssam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said they have written to the Centre seeking an extension of the lockdown by another two weeks and financial help. Sonowal said providing employment to a large number of migrants workers, who have returned to the state because of the lockdown, remains a big challenge.Uttarkhand has sought permission to allow Char Dham pilgrimage and tourist activities, which are the mainstay of the state’s economy. “We have requested the Centre to allow some tourism activities in green zones and the opening of a few holy shrines. We also want work under the MGNREGS [National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme] to be allowed for 150 days [from 100 days annually],” said Uttarakhand minister Madan Kaushik.Kaushik echoed ministers in other Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states and said they will follow the Centre’s guidelines on the next phase of curbs. Also Read: Delhi to await Centre guidelines before taking call on liquor stores, home deliveriesOfficials in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh said the chief ministers of these states have submitted their suggestions to the Centre and will provide details only after the notification on fresh guidelines is issued.The Kolkata Municipal Corporation on Friday announced buses in the city will run from Monday with a maximum 20 passengers on each bus and that police will ensure social distancing is maintained even as transport operators appeared sceptical. “It would be a difficult task [to limit passengers to 20] but we are making plans,” said Bengal Bus Syndicate honorary secretary Subrata Ghosh. The traditional yellow-coloured cabs will also resume services in Kolkata from Monday with increased fares. “Passengers will have to pay 30% extra... Not more than two passengers will be allowed and they will have to sit on the back seat. They will also need to wear masks and sanitise their hands,” said Bengal Taxi Association general secretary Bimal Guha.Gujarat has suggested the lockdown should be reviewed after two weeks. “We should see how people react to the relaxations and their impact on Covid-19 cases,” an official said, and added authorities have been asked to strictly monitor the impact of the next phase of the lockdown. “Shops and private offices may be opened on a rotational basis. Rules for rickshaws, taxis, city buses and other transport would be decided soon. Also, multiplexes, malls, gyms, and clubs will remain closed...”Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said he will urge the Centre to allow all activities and take measures to restart the hospitality industry. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAn official said the decision on reopening hotels and restaurants would be taken after the Centre’s guidelines on the next lockdown.Jharkhand finance minister Rameshwar Oraon said liquor shops will remain closed even though the state is considering reopening more shops and public transport with some restrictions. The state did not implement the relaxations allowed during the ongoing third phase of the lockdown because of a spurt in Covid-19 cases due to the return of the migrant workers.Officials in Himachal Pradesh said bus services will resume from May 18 between district headquarters even as the lockdown restrictions will continue till May end. “This has been done keeping in mind the difficulties faced by the people in commuting,” said principal secretary (revenue) Onkar Chand Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-look-to-ease-curbs-restart-interstate-travel-in-lockdown-4-0/story-LeTMImPbdxYK2WRpA97awI.html
16-05-2020||India||30 areas reporting most cases: Centre||Thirty municipal areas account for 79% of India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caseload, but the country has done better than others in terms of reducing the fatality rate, the government said on Friday. While caseload of an area means the number of total cases that place is reporting, fatality rate refers to the percentage of deaths among those infected. India’s death rate, containment strategy and medical infrastructure, among other issues, were discussed on Friday at the 15th meeting of a high-level group of ministers (GoM) headed by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.According to the government, authorities will focus on states with highest number of cases and fatalities. Priority will also be given to treatment and fatality management. Timely detection of fresh infections and contact tracing will be strengthened.Also Read: US will donate ventilators to help India fight Covid-19: TrumpA health ministry statement said the GoM was informed that worldwide Covid-19 cases stood at 42,48,389 with 294,046 deaths. The fatality rate of 6.92% was higher than India’s 3.23%, the statement said, putting the total number of cases in the country at 81,970 and deaths at 2,649.So far, a total of 27,920 people have been cured of the viral infection. The number for the last 24 hours was 1,685 patients. “This takes the total recovery rate at 34.06%,” said the statement.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA senior health ministry official, who did not want to be named, said states are now facing challenges with the return of migrant workers from different parts of the country as well as with people returning from aboard.“...measures are being taken to ensure there is no spread of infection. States will also start testing the target population to check for prevalence of the disease in this category. Whatever needs to be done is being done,” the official said.The health ministry statement noted that while India’s case doubling rate before the lockdown announced on March 25 was 3.4 days, the number stood at 12.9 days in the past week.Also Read: Mumbai reports 933 Covid-19 cases in one dayThe group also discussed India’s containment strategy to deal with the contagion, and the measures being taken by the Centre and states.Civil aviation minister Hardeep S Puri, foreign minister S Jaishankar, MoS home Nityanand Rai, MoS health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS shipping and chemical and fertilizers Mansukh Lal Mandaviya, and chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat were among those present in the meeting.The high-level team also discussed India’s medical infrastructure.At present, a total of 8,694 facilities comprising 919 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals; 2,036 Covid-19 health centres; and 5,739 Covid-19 care centres are available in the country, health minister Vardhan said.These facilities have a total of 277,429 beds for severe and critical cases; 29,701 intensive care unit beds (ICU); and 515,250 isolation beds. Also, 18,855 ventilators are now available to take care of critically ill patients as compared to 14,000 in March-end.The Centre has also provided 8.4 million N-95 masks and 4.8 million Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits to states and institutions under the central government. Domestic manufacturers have reached the production capacity of nearly 300,000 PPE kits, and about as many N-95 masks a day — sufficient to meet the requirement of the country in the near future, according to health ministry data.In addition, manufacturing of ventilators by domestic players has also started and orders have been placed. “We are comfortably placed as of now, and there is no cause for concern,” said the official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-areas-reporting-most-cases-centre/story-pn2RbzgGsv9W8aB6ohFNAI.html

However, it will continue to work through videoconferencing.In a notification, the court’s registrar said the vacation, which was scheduled to commence on May 18, stands rescheduled. The court will work during the five-week period from May 18 till June 19, he added.Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde took the decision to reschedule the vacation after taking into account views of the Supreme Court judges, people aware of the matter said.“The five-week period from May 18, 2020 to June 19, 2020 (both days inclusive) of the summer vacation of the Supreme Court calendar has been rescheduled and declared as period of functioning for the court,” the notification said.An earlier October 2019 notification on the list of holidays for the Supreme Court in 2020 has been modified to reflect this change.The Supreme Court’s month-and-half-long summer vacation usually begins in mid-May. Friday was expected to be the last working day of the top court ahead of the vacation this year. The court was to reopen on July 6. The CJI will now take a call on the summer vacation later. Supreme Court advocate M F Philip said the deferment will make up for the loss of working days. “They should have taken this decision earlier and not at the eleventh hour, and I would suggest that lawyers should be allowed to access their chambers within court premises.” Many high courts, including the Delhi High Court have already cancelled their summer vacations to make up for the loss of working hours due to the Covid-19 lockdown.The Supreme Court Bar Association passed a resolution on April 11 expressing willingness to work through the summer vacation. It had requested the CJI to cancel the summer vacation.The Supreme Court issued a circular on March 23 suspending entry of lawyers and litigants into the court premises. The court said that only extremely urgent cases will be taken up for hearings through video conferencing during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-defers-summer-vacation-till-jun-19-to-make-up-for-time-lost/story-bQqROamKW46Xisd8KA4cWN.html
16-05-2020||India||Tamil Nadu vegetable market cluster pushes state’s Covid-19 tally past 10k||As Tamil Nadu crossed 10,000 cases on Friday — the first case, a 45-year-old man with a travel history to Oman, was detected in early March — a wholesale market of fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers in Chennai became the latest warzone for the administration battling the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.According to a state government official, around 4,000 people linked to the market have already been tested out of which 1,000 are primary contacts. At least 2,500 positive cases currently pertain to the Koyambedu Market cluster, which is higher than the 1350 cases in the state linked to the Tablighi Jamaat religious conference.The Koyambedu hotspot is also responsible for cases in 10 districts other than Chennai. “We have either carried out facility quarantine or home quarantine of those who started the journey from Koyambedu,” the official quoted above said.Spread over 54 acres, Koyambedu market complex is one of the largest wholesale market complexes for perishable goods in India. It houses more than 1000 wholesalers and over 2000 retail shops. On May 4, 300 of the 527 new cases reported were found to be linked to the market. Within hours, it was shut down. According to S Ram Mohan, a core committee member of the Joint Action Committee of vegetable vendors’ associations at Koyambedu market, the district administration had shut down flower and fruit sales well before May 4. By then, even the vegetable retailers had stopped operations.On April 28, retail traders and fruit sellers from Koyambedu were relocated to a suburb. Expecting wholesalers to do likewise would have been difficult as few open spaces in the city have the capacity to handle 3,000 tonnes of vegetables each day, GD Rajasekaran, president, Koyambedu Periyar Market Association, said.On April 24, the state government announced a hard lockdown for four days, between April 26 and 29. This led to a spate in panic buying. Mohan recounted scenes of utter chaos in Koyambedu in the two days before the hard lockdown was enforced. On April 30, another round of panic buying ensued after people realized that the second leg of the national lockdown, which was expected to end on May 3, would likely be extended.Last week, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami blamed the traders for not vacating the market in March itself. “Now, because many from Koyambedu had travelled to other districts, the number of infected there has gone up. This is the reason for the spike in cases in Chennai also,” he said. However, Mohan countered this and said that no official meeting was held between the wholesale vendors and the authorities in March or April.Super-spreading events have played a much bigger role in the virus spread in Tamil Nadu than in Maharashtra and Gujarat — two other states that have seen huge numbers of Covid-19 cases, experts said.The spike in numbers due to the Koyambedu cluster is immediately noticeable. Between April 24 and May 3, the average daily new cases reported in Tamil Nadu were 134; from May 4 to May 13, the average grew to 620 a day. Persons linked to the market have spread the virus the neighbouring states of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.T Jacob John, a former professor of Virology, Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore blamed ad-hoc decisions and panic among people because of the total lockdown. To contain the disease, all people must wear masks outside their home and maintain hand hygiene, he said.The good news is that the state is testing much more than it was even last month. The state had conducted the highest total number of tests as per the HT dashboard at 280,023 as of Thursday night, which translates into 4179 tests per million people, far higher than the national average of 1540 per million people.“The more you test, the more you find. Tamil Nadu is finding more cases because they are testing more,” said Dr V Ramana Dhara, professor at Indian Institute of Public Health-Hyderabad. “These cases are probably occurring in other states too, but they are not testing more,” he added.“The increase in number of cases is something to be expected especially as the most stringent components of the lockdown are relaxed. We are seeing the residual of a couple of major clusters, for instance, the Koyambedu cluster,” Dr Ram Gopalakrishnan, an infectious disease specialist said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-veggie-market-cluster-pushes-state-tally-past-10k/story-R1PnP3tSPGqM3VjcUxdXBP.html
16-05-2020||India||IAF to get first batch of Rafale jets by July-end||The Indian Air Force is likely to get the delivery of the first batch of four Rafale jets from France by July-end, people aware of the developments said on Friday. The four fighters were supposed to fly to their home base in India in May 2020, but the plan was delayed due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Confinement measures announced by France to battle the outbreak temporarily halted production at aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation’s Merignac facility.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the air force’s combat capabilities.According to the delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) are supposed to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8, 2019, which coincided with the IAF’s 87th founding day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-to-get-first-batch-of-rafale-jets-by-july-end/story-7MsrcyBC38Jq0twGHmU7zH.html
16-05-2020||India||Humans can pass Covid-19 infection to animals, shows research||Two dogs who were reported to have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) recently likely got the infection from their owners, according to a new research paper that analysed cases in animals in Hong Kong.“An analysis of viral genetic sequences from the dogs showed them to be identical to those in the infected people,” an article on the findings in Nature said.While the paper didn’t study if animal-to-animal transmission could occur, the authors recommended that for precaution, pets belonging to Covid-19 patients be isolated and tested, as is already being done in Hong Kong.The paper, published in Nature journal on Thursday, found that two of 15 dogs from households with confirmed human cases of Covid-19 in Hong Kong were found to be infected. These two were a 17-year-old neutered Pomeranian and a 2.5-year-old German Shepherd. They were tested using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) kits and the virus was later isolated and sequenced.Canine ACE-2 (an enzyme the Sars-CoV-2 virus uses to enter the body) is similar to the enzyme found in humans. Of 18 amino acids that are known to be involved in interaction between ACE-2 and the spike receptor binding domain of Sars-CoV-2 (which Sars-CoV-2 uses to bind to its host’s cells), there are five that differ between humans and dogs, the study led by Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong said.“The evidence suggests that human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur. We do not have information on whether this virus can cause illness in dogs but no specific signs were seen in either of the infected dogs during the time they were shedding virus,” the paper said. The Pomeranian died two days after release from isolation but very likely due to other underlying diseases. The German Shepherd was kept with a second cross-breed dog but the second dog didn’t get infected.“The limited implications of these findings are that there is now increasing evidence for human to animal transmission, especially to pet animals that are in close contact with infected humans. There is as yet no evidence for any subsequent animal to animal transmission,” said Abi Tamim Vanak, Fellow, DBT India Alliance Program and senior fellow at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE).“However, given that high viral loads were found in nasal swabs of infected animals, as well as in rectal swabs, there is a possibility of onward transmission to other animals, especially if an infected pet is free-ranging and regularly comes in to contact with other animals or humans. Again, this is only speculative, and it would require experimental challenge studies to determine if animal to animal transmission is a viable route of spread for this virus. If such evidence is found, then it will make the control of this disease much harder, because many regions of the world have fairly large populations of free-ranging domestic animals (e.g. India has ~60 million dogs), which do not receive even the most basic healthcare, such as anti-rabies vaccinations,” he added.The findings also have implications for future zoonotic transmission events. Dogs, other canids and felids can be sold in or found near wild-game animal markets like in Wuhan from where Sars-CoV-2 is understood to have transmitted to humans. These domestic animals should also be tested during investigations into the origin of the virus to determine if they play any role in spillover events, the authors concluded.Earlier, a study by Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and National High Containment Laboratory for Animal Diseases Control and Prevention in China had suggested that cats are highly susceptible to contracting Sars-CoV-2 but dogs, ducks, chickens and pigs were not as susceptible. The study was based on lab experiments and not real-life cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humans-can-pass-infection-to-animals-shows-research/story-VJmn6oimK3jvYcETnn9nlO.html
16-05-2020||India||World Bank gives $1 billion to India to aid social safety||The World Bank on Friday announced a US$1-billion “Accelerating India’s Covid-19 Social Protection Response Programme”, aimed at integrating India’s 400-plus fragmented social-security programmes for migrant workers hit by the outbreak, part of an initiative that seeks to rebalance access to safety nets between rural and urban India.The programme will especially focus on making social benefits such as subsidised food under the National Food Security Act, cash transfers and pensions portable so that beneficiaries can access them from anywhere in the country, not just from their home districts, the bank said.Portability simply refers to a digitised, universal and always-on platform, which ensures benefits move along with the migrants.Also Read: States look to ease curbs, restart interstate travel in lockdown 4.0“Very clearly, everybody recognises the shock (from the pandemic). The choice is being said to be between lives and livelihoods. This is not a choice the government of India is making,” Junaid Ahmad, country director of the bank said.Ahmad also said this is a “watershed moment” in social security of the country because the government has, for the first time, opened up an “important window” in the form of the state disaster response fund, which is now linked to social safety.The Union government, in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, allowed states to use the fund freely without usual approvals to provide social protection.A national lockdown that took effect from March 25 shuttered shops, factories and construction sites, pushing millions of migrant workers out of jobs. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday announced free food assistance to 80 million migrant workers worth Rs 3500 core, part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Rs 20 lakh crore (Rs 20 trillion) economic package to pull the economy out of a slump.The first phase of the World Bank operation will be implemented countrywide through the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). It will immediately help scale up cash transfers and food benefits, using a core set of pre-existing national platforms and programmes such as the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT), the bank said.Jobless migrant workers, hit by the lockdown, have fallen through the cracks because static social safety nets did not reach them in the absence of portability. “If the World Bank wants to streamline our social safety nets, first off, they are getting into very complicated things. The issue sometimes is not so much about how to reach the people as it is about how to get two wings of the government talking,” said economist Abhijit Sen, former member of the erstwhile Planning Commission. The arguments are on two things, Sen said: “One, don’t overcentralise things. Where the World Bank can intervene and should, is portability. Two, if I had to give out a billion dollars, then, I would give very little of that to the federal government and most of it to the states; in fact, more to the municipalities.”Over 90% of India’s workforce is employed in the informal sector, without access to basic savings or pensions, or paid leave from work.“There are large transfers to the rural poor. Look at the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. The idea is to make social benefits such as food and cash transfers just as easily accessible for urban informal workers and migrants,” said World Bank lead of the project, Shrayana Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-bank-gives-1-billion-to-india-to-aid-social-safety/story-nIDccieXNOSrFV3TRR01LL.html
16-05-2020||India||States see higher tax revenue in third phase||Revenue collections of states have shown signs of recovery during the third phase of the Covid-19 lockdown with a higher collection of excise and Goods and Services Tax (GST) as industrial activities have increased and many government offices have resumed work, multiple officials across the country said.State governments last month reported a revenue dip of up to 90% and triggered fears that many of them may be unable to pay salaries for April. The relaxation in lockdown norms this month and the resumption of liquor sales have since boosted the revenue collections.Almost all states except Kerala, which have higher per capita liquor consumption, have allowed alcohol sales. Kerala has increased the tax on liquor ahead of the resumption of its sale from May 18 when the next phase of the lockdown will begin with new rules. The state will impose a 10% Covid-19 tax on beer and wine bottles priced below Rs 600. For the rest of the alcoholic beverages, the tax will be 35%. Punjab opened its liquor vends on Thursday.The officials cited above said the revenues, however, remain much less than what the states usually collect. The revenues from alcohol sales have also fallen after an initial rush at liquor shops once they were opened. Several officials said they were awaiting the Centre’s help in bridging the revenue gap, which is expected to continue because of a huge dip in demand.Haryana, where liquor sales were allowed from May 6, earned a revenue of Rs 93 crore till May 12 from them, state officials said. It is slightly higher than the tax collected during the same period last year--Rs 91.5 crore. In the first 12 days of this month, officials said Haryana has collected GST revenue worth Rs 340 crore compared to Rs 1,200 crore collected in May 2019.Officials said the stamp duty has also increased from May 1 when Haryana allowed registration of properties. “We expect better revenue from May 18 when the lockdown is expected to apply only to the containment zones,” said a Haryana official, who did not want to be named.Uttar Pradesh has reported liquor sales worth Rs 665 crore since May 4 when the state allowed them. State excise department officials said it is around Rs 250 to Rs 300 crore less than the sales recorded during the same period last year. “The lockdown is yet to be fully lifted and sales have been curtailed by three hours,” an official said, explaining less than expected liquor sales. Liquor sellers have appealed to the state government for more relaxations like not paying license fees for the lockdown period. “The government must give us a hearing. What are we going to do if the business crashes,” said Lucknow Liquor Sellers Welfare Association office-bearer Kanhaiyalal Maurya.An official in Rajasthan said the daily sales following the resumption of alcohol sale were as high as Rs 65 crore but the excitement is over. “Now it is Rs 45 crore, which is similar to daily revenue earned in May last year,” said the official on condition of anonymity. “The spirits have been dampened by adverse publicity by media,” the official said, referring to negative coverage over long queues at liquor shops in violation of the social distancing norms.Revenue from liquor sales in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state by the pandemic, from May 4-12 was half of what it earned during the same period last year. Officials said this was because restaurants and bars have remained closed and liquor sales were happening only through vends. Civic bodies in major cities like Mumbai and Nagpur have also not allowed liquor shops to open. Telangana, where the liquor sales started from May 6, revenue from them has also dipped after a good start. On May 6, the state earned 75 crore (as against average daily sales of Rs 60 crore), despite an increase in prices by 16%. “Since then, there been a fall in liquor sales by at least 60%,” said Telangana Wine Dealers’ Association president D Venkateshwar Rao.The government earned Rs 68.50 crore revenue despite a 50% increase in liquor prices on May 4 when the alcohol shops opened in Andhra Pradesh. On the second day, the revenue dipped as the prices were raised by another 25%. “The second-day sales were Rs 50-55 crore. It has almost been the same since then,” said special chief secretary (excise revenue) Rajat Bhargava.Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have reported a significant rise in revenue from the sale of stamps papers even as it remained less than what they collected during the same period in 2019. Officials in Karnataka said there has been a jump in the GST and other revenue collection. They said revenue from liquor sales was now back to the normal level of Rs 50-60 crore daily.Chhattisgarh has reported about an 80% increase in excise revenue in the first 12 days of May, as compared to April. Niranjan Das, the state’s excise commissioner, said there was about a 50% increase in liquor sales in the first two days of the resumption of liquor sales with per day average of Rs 28-30 crore. “Now, it is back to normal revenue of Rs 18-19 crore, including two crore from the online sale of liquor,” Das said. Officials said GST and stamp duty revenue has also seen some improvement.The government in Assam collected excise revenue of about Rs 150 crore in a week since the resumption of liquor sales. It is almost three times of what the state earned from the sale of liquor during the same time in 2019. “Last year, we collected Rs 2,700 crore from sale of liquor, and with the 25% hike [in prices from May 8], we expect to increase revenue by another Rs 1,000 crore,” said Assam excise minister Parimal Suklabaidya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-see-higher-tax-revenue-in-third-phase/story-twUXeTR5t8HQv4NaJ7vmuM.html
16-05-2020||India||Monsoon to be late by 4 days in Kerala||The onset of south-west monsoon over Kerala is likely to be delayed by four days and is expected to arrive on June 5, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday. The monsoon, however, is likely to arrive over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands four days in advance over the next 48 hours, it added.The onset over Kerala marks the beginning of the four-month monsoon season when India receives 70% of its annual rainfall. IMD’s south-west monsoon forecasts provide critical information to at least 700 million people in India, who are directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture for livelihood. The delay could have implications for farmers impacted by economic slowdown associated with the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread. The lockdown has disrupted the traditional farm-to-fork supply chains.The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people. The monsoon generally starts in June before it begins to retreat by Sept 1. In 2019, the monsoon started with the driest June in five years. Below-average precipitation followed in July before heavy rains caused flooding in August.An abnormally higher number of western disturbances affecting the western Himalayan are among the reasons that can make monsoon advancement slightly sluggish and delay its onset over Kerala. Western disturbances are low-pressure systems that generally originate over the Mediterranean region and are known to bring winter rain in India. Their intensity reduces in summer when they move to upper latitudes. “We are seeing stronger mid-latitude westerly activity, which will delay the establishment of monsoon flow over the Southern Peninsula,” said DS Pai, a senior scientist and monsoon expert at IMD, Pune.“At the same time, the development of cyclone near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is pulling the monsoon winds to that region. So even if the monsoon is established, monsoon flow will get delayed; its progression will be impacted,” added Pai.There is a well-marked low-pressure area over the south-east Bay of Bengal and its neighbourhood. It is likely to concentrate into a depression over the same region during the next 12 hours and further intensify into a cyclonic storm, Amphan, over central parts of south Bay of Bengal by May 16. Due to the development of the cyclone, conditions are likely to become favourable for the advancement of Southwest monsoon into the Andaman Sea, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and some parts of southeast Bay of Bengal, during next 48 hours, the IMD said in a statement.Past data suggests that there is no association of the date of monsoon advance over the Andaman Sea either with the date of monsoon onset over Kerala or with the seasonal monsoon rainfall over the country, the statement added.Union earth sciences secretary M Rajeevan said there will be some rains in Kerala associated with the development of the cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal. “But those will not be monsoon rains. For monsoon advancement, several parameters have to be met including temperature, wind speed, convection north of Australia, and many others.”Rajeevan said the onset of the monsoon over Kerala is not a local phenomenon. “There are many large-scale changes. It has also been seen when there is cyclone development over the Bay of Bengal, the advancement of monsoon is slightly delayed as monsoon winds are pulled there.”When asked if the unusually high westerly activity this year is a result of the climate crisis, Pai said it will be too early to say that. “The reasons have not been studied. It may be a result of natural variability but a high number of western disturbances can impact the flow of the monsoon. We have to see how monsoon progresses after June 5 depending on other factors,” Pai added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-to-be-late-by-4-days-in-kerala/story-JvmnlviZ3ShAM79lapdXiN.html

The insurgents, wanted in Manipur and Assam, have been brought back by a special plane, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.“This is a huge step for the Myanmar government and a reflection of the deepening ties between the two countries,” a top government official said soon after an aircraft with a planeload of insurgents took off from Myanmar.The plane first made a stopover in Manipur capital Imphal, before heading to Assam’s Guwahati. The insurgents have been handed over to the local police in the two states.Also Read: Packed in Myanmar’s decision to deport 22 insurgents, a sharp message to others“This is the first time that the Myanmar government has acted on India’s request to hand over leaders of the northeast insurgent groups,” a senior national security planner said about the operation driven by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. This is seen as a result of increasing intelligence and defence cooperation between the two countries from both sides.Among those deported by Myanmar are some senior and long-wanted Indian insurgent leaders such as NDFB (S) self-styled home secretary Rajen Daimary, Capt Sanatomba Ningthoujam of UNLF and Lt Pashuram Laishram of PREPAK (Pro).12 of the 22 insurgents are linked to four insurgent groups in Manipur: UNLF, PREPAK (Pro), KYKL and PLA.

The Myanmar army attacked multi-group terror camps at Taga in the north of the country across the Vijaynagar salient in Arunachal Pradesh in the first phase, and decimated Arakan, Nilgiri and Haukyat camps in the second.The 22 insurgents were caught by the Myanmar army in Sagaing Region in these operations.Also Read: In 2019 joint op with Myanmar, Indian army deployed ‘hammer and anvil’ tacticsA national security official said Myanmar’s decision to hand over the insurgents is a huge message to the outfits that Naypyidaw is in sync with New Delhi on dealing with them.Indian officials expect Myanmar’s action to be a deterrent to groups that had assumed the dense forests across the border could insulate them from action.

16-05-2020||India||Reverse migration, dip in output spell tough times for industries||As thousands of migrant workers return home amid a slump in demand, industries are looking at a difficult road ahead in terms of full resumption of operations even as governments are working on incentives for them to boost production.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a ₹20 lakh crore stimulus package aimed at making India self reliant, with a special focus on economy and industry. The PM said that the package will lead to reforms in land, labour, liquidity and laws, and would provide relief to small and medium enterprises, which employ most of the migrant workers. Resumption of industries could help state governments deal with reverse migration of workers and improve state finances, which have been wrecked by the national lockdown that was first imposed on March 25 and since extended twice. The states have been looking at the Centre for a stimulus package, especially for small and medium industries, which finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to announce from Wednesday onwards, the PM said.Even though the Centre and the state governments have given several lockdown relaxations, industrial production has not reached the level the state governments had expected. Officials in several states said only about 15%-20% of industries resumed operations, and that, too, with limited capacity, till Monday.Industry leaders urged the government to lift the strict lockdown conditions to kickstart industrial production. They want all shops and offices to open to spur demand, which has plummeted during the lockdown. The small and medium industries are also seeking a financial bailout package. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the meeting between the Prime Minister and chief ministers that about 25,000 of the total 125,000 industries in the state had resumed operations, employing about 650,000 workers. “We are expecting the rest of the industrial units will also start their operations in the coming days,” said a senior official from the state industries department. Rajasthan’s additional chief secretary, industries, Subodh Agarwal, said about 12,000 medium and small scale industries had become operational. “These industries are working with a strength of 30%-40% labourers, and less than 50% production capacity. Over two lakh {200,000} labourers are working in these industries,” he said. In northern India’s most industralised state, Punjab, only 16,000, or 6%, of the total of 252,000 industries have resumed operations. These industries include some big manufacturers, such as Hero Cycles in Ludhiana. Vini Mahajan, Punjab’s additional chief secretary, industries, said despite issues related to supply chain, demand and working capital, industries were working to restart operations. Telangana’s industries secretary, Jayesh Ranjan, said nearly 90% of the total of 56,000 functional industries in the state had resumed operations even though most of the factories were running much below their full capacity. Telangana has extended the lockdown till May 29.In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, about 70% of the industrial units have started operations, up from about 10% on April 20, when industries resumed operation in the lockdown. “Now, industrial activity has picked up in all major industrial estates and SEZs [special economic zones],” an official in the industries department said.In Bihar, only about 3,000 of a total 25,000 industries have started. Government officials said industrial activity will remain poor as the focus of the state was on containing the spread of the pandemic arising from migrant workers returning from different states. In Uttar Pradesh, about 30% of the industries have got permission to resume operations. In Chattisgarh and Jharkhand, not more than 10% of the industries have started operations. “We have small industries, which are totally dependent on workers from outside the state. With workers going back, the industries have failed to resume work,” said a Chhattisgarh government official, who was not willing to be named. An official in Jharkhand said the mining operations have now resumed fully even though other industrial activity was meagre.Industry leader voiceMore than workers leaving, factory owners are concerned about dipping demand and they said the demand will not pick up till the lockdown is fully lifted. Some factory owners in sectors, such as textiles, said they need the government’s financial support to restart their businesses.Kamal Dalmia, chairman of Amritsar’s Focal Point Industries Association, said :”Unless the entire {supply} chain is restored, the units cannot resume operations at full strength.”Vishal Baid, chairman of the Rajasthan chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said although the state government had been as a facilitator, the association was concerned about the absence of workers and poor demand. “Even if we manufacture, there are issues with transportation and there are no buyers as the shops are closed. Unless all shops open and economic activity starts in cities, the demand will not improve,” he said.“To improve demand, the government should allow opening of offices,” said promoter of Bihar based Hebe Ispat, Sanjay Goenka. Deepak Patra, spokesperson for Dalmia Bharat, said the company’s factory was running at full capacity but there were not enough buyers to lift the finished products.Chandrakant Salunkhe, President, Maharashtra Industrial and Economic Development Association (MIEDA), said the industries need a good “financial” package from the government to survive this “unprecedented” dip in demand across sectors. “Whatever non-essential good companies have produced in the last 10 days have no buyers. People are not buying anything except essential goods,” he said.Telangana Industrialists Federation president, K Sudhir Reddy, said the industries were working with 30 to 40% capacity because of restricted timings of operations – only between 7 am and 6 pm --- and shortage of workers and raw material. “We are asking for permission of night shift operations so that the production can go on without interruption,” Reddy said.Pankaj Kumar, national president, Indian Industries Association (IIA), an industry lobby body of the MSME sector in Uttar Pradesh, said, “An NCR pass must be issued for free movement of labourers in the region.” Manmohan Agarwal, who has a chemical plant in the Talkatora Industrial Area in Lucknow, said he cannot open his factory as workers cannot return because of the lockdown. “I was all set to restart plant from Monday, but could not do so due to the labour crisis,” said Agarwal. Some industry owners, such as Vijay Ahuja, a garment manufacturer in Rajasthan, are thinking of closing their businesses. “In the present circumstances, the business is not viable for us. Most of the orders in India and abroad have been put on hold. We will be able to resume operations only if the government provides monetary help and relaxes labour laws,” he said. Raipur-based industry owner, Vishal Sharma, said he cannot resume operations without skilled workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, who have gone home, a concern raised by factory owners in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Industry versus state financesSeveral state government functionaries hoped the situation will improve after the lockdown ends on May 17. “More industries will be allowed even in the red zones after May 17. We expect to allow operation of industries in Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, the red zones, from next week,” said Maharashtra industries minister Subhash Desai.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday told the PM that they need to waive restrictions for industrial areas even in red zones to boost economic activity as Covid-19 cases were not coming down. “We are also of the view that after May 17, industries can further be allowed with fewer restrictions after doing a risk analysis in a measured and staggered manner,” Gehlot said.Officials in states such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan said they were working on some financial package for small and medium industries and expected a bigger bailout from the Central government, which has formed a working group to examine stimulus for industry. UP industries minister Satish Mahana said the administration was working on easing problems of industrialists across the state.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reverse-migration-dip-in-output-spell-tough-times-for-industries/story-oQghUEqzs8bNt2XXwXFdOM.html
