On May 1, the Union health ministry had listed 10 of Bengal’s 23 districts as red zones, eight as green zones and four as orange zones. Bengal, at present, has 556 containment zones, out of which 326 are in Kolkata and the rest mostly in the districts of Howrah, North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, and Hooghly.“I have asked the district magistrates, police supers and health department heads to chalk-out district-wise plan for creating the ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ zones and list the activities that could be allowed and submit the plan to me on May 15,” she said at the state secretariat. After May 21, relaxations will also be increased in districts listed as green and orange zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-plans-more-relaxations-in-red-zone-areas/story-lUU3tOeR6FfwBdYPRIGDTM.html

She is the only child of her parents.“My father has been ailing for the past 18 years. He cannot walk. My mother sells vegetables in Borbaruah market. I have been helping her for two years,” said Janmoni, who lives in a village in Bogibeel area of Dibrugarh district. After the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, she started selling vegetables door to door carrying her wares on a bicycle as it was not possible to go to Borbaruah market.Top officers of the district police, including SP Srijith T, came to know about her from mainstream and social media and asked her if she needed any help.“Her self-respect prevented her from taking monetary help. So we came up with the idea of gifting her a two-wheeler so that she can carry her vegetables more comfortably and in larger quantities,” Deputy Superintendent of Police Pallavi Mazumder said.Handing her over the two-wheeler on Monday, Mazumder said, “At a time when everyone is indoors, Janmoni came out to support her family.” Janmoni, who nurtures a dream of pursuing higher education, expressed her gratitude to the state police, the SP and the DSP. “I earn a meagre amount by selling vegetables.Sometimes I have to return home without earning anything. The two-wheeler will ease my problem of ferrying vegetables far. I am now determined to work harder,” she said.Her mother Monomoti said, “If my daughter did not sell vegetables on a bicycle, it would have been tough for us to sustain during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-police-gifts-2-wheeler-to-young-woman-who-sells-vegetables-on-bicycle/story-6gcLDkbKqfJwOWvPCljZQO.html
12-05-2020||India||In Odisha village without quarantine centre, man spends 3 days in toilet||A 30-year-old man in Odisha’s Balasore district had to spend three days in the toilet of his home before he was shifted to a school Monday night because the village does not have a quarantine centre.Kalia Bindhani of Sarkarnagar village under Saraswatipur granpanchayat of Balasore district returned home on May 9, after losing his job in Ganjam district due to the lockdown. As he did not show any symptoms of Covid-19, he was asked by the local sarpanch to stay in home quarantine for 14 days.However, with no space available in his one-room thatched house, Bindhani chose the public toilet next to his house for quarantine. “In my home there are 12 people. How can I stay with others in the house and possibly infect others? So I chose the toilet,” said Bindhani. A quarantine sticker too was pasted on the toilet wall indicating Bidhani’s date of arrival in his village and the end of quarantine date.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Bindhani would have probably stayed a few more days in the toilet had the Naib sarpanch not raised the issue with the local sarpanch and BDO. Naib sarpanch of the panchayat, Manoj Sethi said the confusion started over lack of guidelines over arrival of migrant workers from other districts. “As he had arrived from the Covid-19 epicentre of Ganjam, he wanted to be quarantined. But we had no official quarantine centre in the village. So I asked him to stay in the toilet,” said Sethi.After higher officials got to know about the matter, Bindhani was shifted to a primary school in the village on Monday night. But his woes are far from over as the school has no quarantine bed. “I have to sleep on the floor. But how would I get food on time,” he asked.Bindhani is the latest case in a long string of complaints from several quarantine centres in Odisha where migrant workers returning from other States have been kept. On Monday, several migrant workers in a quarantine centre of Ganjam’s Belguntha block threw away the rice alleging that it was overcooked while in another quarantine centre of the same block, migrant workers did not take the upma served at breakfast calling it inedible.Last week, over 150 migrant workers in Ganjam district had fled the quarantine centre alleging lack of water and low quality food.Following numerous such complaints, state panchayatiraj secretary DK Singh wrote to all district collectors on Tuesday to ensure good quality food and sanitation in the quarantine centres.Of the 437 positive cases reported in Odisha so far, more than 300 have been reported from people staying in quarantine centres. After families of the quarantined people started crowding the centres in Ganjam district, the district administration declared the quarantine centres as containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-village-without-quarantine-centre-man-spends-3-days-in-toilet/story-p2qskPJpGZNHOxmlt1JNKL.html
12-05-2020||India||India condemns attack on maternity hospital in Afghanistan capital||India on Tuesday strongly condemned a string of terror attacks in Afghanistan, including one on a maternity hospital in a Shia-dominated area of Kabul that killed two newborn babies and a dozen others, and tacitly pointed the finger of blame at Pakistan-based terror groups.Tuesday’s attack on the maternity hospital in Dasht-e-Barchi area of Kabul prompted Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to switch from an “active defensive” mode to an “offensive” mode and to resume attacks on the Taliban.A statement from the external affairs ministry said: “India strongly condemns the barbaric terrorist attacks against innocent civilians, including women and children, at the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital maternity ward, [a] funeral in Nangarhar province and the army check post in Laghman province on 11-12 May.”It added, “Such reprehensible attacks, including on mothers, newly born children, nurses and mourning families are appalling and constitute crimes against humanity.”In an apparent reference to Pakistan, India said the perpetrators of such attacks “should be forced to eradicate safe havens and sanctuaries that have abetted terrorism in the region for decades and caused immense miseries to untold number of people in the region”.India further said there could be “no justification for such continued acts of terrorism” and the “perpetrators of such heinous acts and their sponsors and supporters should be held accountable and brought to justice”.The statement said India would stand with the people, government and security forces of Afghanistan in their efforts to bring peace and stability to the nation.“The holy month of Ramzan should be a period of fasting, prayer and reflection. We call for an immediate cessation of terrorist violence and cooperation to deal with the humanitarian situation arising from the spread of Coronavirus in Afghanistan,” the statement added.The Taliban distanced itself from the attack on the maternity hospital, which was carried out by four suicide attackers clad in military uniforms, according to reports in the Afghan media. All the attackers were also killed.Afghan security forces rescued more than 40 people, including several infants, from the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-attack-on-maternity-hospital-in-afghanistan-capital/story-czfmiB3gCD5wUwtDRRqJzJ.html

They were later sent to a detention centre. According to Superintendent of Police (Special Branch) Shobit Saksena, the four -- three Nigerians and one Kenyan -- have been booked for violations of the Foreigners Act. The owners of the premises where they were staying have also been booked. “They were found staying without any passport, visa or identification documents. While the three male foreigners claim to be from Nigeria and the lady from Kenya, their identities are being determined,” Saksena said. “They have been lodged at the detention centre for deportation and blacklisting,” Saksena added. This is the second such case in the state in the last two weeks. On April 30, a surveillance drive in Arambol in North Goa for those violating the lockdown found two Nigerians loitering around the beach shacks which are now shut. The duo was unable to produce any valid documents when asked. They, too, were then sent to the detention centre.Since the cessation of international travel due to restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, the foreigners registration office in Goa has been granting visa extensions to those foreigners and tourists stranded in the state apply for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-foreigners-detained-for-staying-in-goa-without-valid-documents/story-eTIh3kyGjx4qdiU3QHjtAO.html
12-05-2020||India||Goa latest state to hike excise duty on liquor||Goa on Tuesday became the latest state to hike excise duty on liquor amid the slowing down of the economy due to the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. With the increase, announced through a government notification, excise duty on the cheapest quality on Indian Made Foreign Liquor has been hiked from Rs 25 to 30 per bulk litre, while that of the highest quality liquor has been hiked from Rs 2,000 to 2,400. Excise duty has gone up from Rs 22 to Rs 30 for the cheapest quality beer and from Rs 38 to 50 per bulk litre for the more expensive versions of beer. Similarly, prices for the manufacture of milk punch, wines and other varieties of alcohol have also been hiked in varying degrees. The hiked rates will be effective from May 15.The increase in excise duty on liquor was announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant during budget earlier this year. But it wasn’t formally notified owing to pressure from the retailers and liquor traders who had, back then, said that the hike would mean liquor rates in Goa would be on par with other states which would,in turn,affect the tourism sector in the state. Liquor retailers and traders had at that time petitioned chief minister for a rollback of excise hike who then announced that the hike would be reconsidered. The Covid-19 crisis, however, forced the state government’s hand forcing it to raise the excise duty on liquor.There are over 10,000 liquor retailers in Goa and the liquor industry contributes over Rs 400 crore a year to the state exchequer in form of taxes, according to IANS.After stand alone liquor shops were recently allowed to open from May 3 by the Centre, many states including Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal decided to raise taxes on liquor to mop up revenue to fight Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-latest-state-to-hike-excise-duty-on-liquor/story-cA3nk6ecmUiO6w3xk7MA1M.html

12-05-2020||India||Kashmir’s first doctor infected by Covid-19 anxious to return to work||For 43-year-old Dr Javid Iqbal Monga, the most depressing and shocking news of his life came when he tested positive for coronavirus on April 19.He became Kashmir’s first doctor and frontline worker to test positive for the virus. Authorities promptly put him and his family in quarantine at the Medical College itself and began efforts to trace all his contacts. Fortunately, Dr Monga had already taken enough precautions as he was aware about consequences of the virus and had seen from close quarters the death of his colleagues in Saudi Arabia due to SARS while they were on duty in the city of Taif, where the doctor had spent around two decades of his life.“I had a sore throat for a couple of days before testing positive. I thought that since I am allergic to certain things it could be the fallout of that only. Once I was declared Covid positive, I started thinking where from I could have got this deadly disease.”Dr Monga suspects that he contracted Covid-19 from a patient during a 24-hour shift at the emergency of Medical College spread over April 13 and 14.“I examined many patients. I used to spend good time with my patients, especially the sick ones. It was an old man who was very sick who came to the hospital in the middle of night. I spent two hours with him and performed his intubation. But despite my efforts he passed away and it’s possible that I got the virus from him.’’Dr Monga and his wife were initially shifted to a local hotel just 100 hundred meters away from the hospital. However, after spending a few hours inside the hotel in a comfortable room while getting treatment according to protocol for his chills and throat infection, some local residents raised objections for his stay in the hotel. “I was shifted to the hospital’s isolation room during the night as my fever was shooting up and my wife too had chills and was feeling unwell. My only worry was about my young daughter and son. Next day, my wife’s report also came positive which put more stress on me and my 14- year-old daughter was also coughing. Though I was getting good treatment at Medical College but my condition wasn’t getting any better and I was in panic as I knew a lot more about this disease. Finally, I asked hospital administration to shift me to SKIMS.’’For the doctor and his wife the first good news came when their daughter tested negative. “There was congestion in my chest and fever was not subsiding. I tried to maintain extra calm but things were going from bad to worse with every passing hour. At times i thought I had developed pneumonia which is an indication of the severity of the viral load and I knew the consequences could be far worse.”Slowly efforts of doctors and his own resilience started showing impact and on April 28 his fever started to subside. “My wife got better within days as her viral load was low and had mild symptoms. And finally I was on path to recovery.’’Dr Monga was all praise for his colleagues in Baramulla and Srinagar. “My HoD, Nisar Ahmed Khan, Dr Yasir Bashir Asst Prof medicine at GMC Baramulla, Dr Afshan, consultant medicine, Dr Mushtaq Professor Medicine and Dr Zubair, Dr Farooq, Dr Mushtaq and senior resident Dr Ishrat and Dr Abdul Waheed Mir, Associate professor of ICU SKIMS who remained with me almost all the time and made me comfortable,’’ he said.The doctor is now staying at his home in Baramulla. “I used to maintain extra caution so that my children didn’t get this disease and stayed away from my aged parents,’’ he said, adding that since he has passed through this disease, now he wants to help to make people aware about this disease.He expects to return to work around May 20.“I am eager to join my duties back and could be serving my people soon.’’A graduate of the Medical College Srinagar, Dr Monga served in Kashmir for a couple of years before moving to Saudi Arabia where he worked at premier institutions. He also worked in Mecca city inside Grand Mosque Al-Haram during Hajj for one month for consecutive ten years which helped him to gain exposure and experience in critical care medicine especially in emergency situations.“I had left Kashmir because there was no job at that time but to serve my people was always my dream. Finally when the hospital in my home town was declared as Medical College, I applied for a job and got it. I had a well-paid job at Taif city which I left even took a huge salary cut to work at my native place.’’After beating the virus, Dr Monga said his commitment towards his patients will be stronger. ‘’The only thing which pained me was when I was told by some colleagues that few people had objected to my stay in the hotel which was meant for the purpose. Tomorrow, God forbid, if some of them will have any disease I will be the first person to help them,” he said adding that the disease has taught him many lessons and people who are afflicted by it should face it strongly.“We can beat this disease only if we keep calm and face it strongly.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-s-first-doctor-infected-by-covid-19-anxious-to-return-to-work/story-2cDHtXNNxQ2aUKowbhhbYI.html

Relaxation of lockdown norms has meant that districts like Kolar which were in the green zone, have now reported positive cases.“Today is again it not a good day in terms of numbers... most cases are those with the travel history to Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Odisha and Chennai,” state minister S Suresh Kumar, the spokesperson for Covid-19 in Karnataka, told reporters, according to news agency PTI. He said most of the cases were those who recently returned to the state.“After their return, we placed them under quarantine. On screening and testing them during quarantine, they turned out to be positive,” he said.According to the health department’s bulletin, out of the 460 active cases, a total of 449 Covid-19 patients were in isolation at designated hospitals and stable while 11 were undergoing treatment in intensive care units, reports PTI.Seven patients who have recovered, were discharged on Tuesday.Meanwhile, 101 migrant labourers including men, women and children who were travelling in the back of a goods truck to Rajasthan were detained on the Bangalore - Pune highway near Hirebagewadi check-post of Belgavi district.After one of them was found to be running high temperature, he was admitted to a hospital in Belgavi to check for Covid-19 symptoms. The rest of the group was sent for medical check up and later to an institutional quarantine at Nehru Nagar in the city.The state government is examining how the truck with so many people was able to evade several checkposts till it was finally caught.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-s-covid-19-tally-reaches-925-with-record-single-day-spike-of-63-cases/story-wcy2vA7rq6aNXA1k2BAtrN.html

12-05-2020||India||PM Modi announces economic package worth Rs 20 lakh crore, details to be announced in the next few days||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a special economic package worth Rs several lakh crore to assist labourers, farmers, tax payers, MSMEs and cottage industry and added that it will emphasis on land, labour, liquidity and laws.PM Modi said the details of the new package will be announced by the finance minister over the next several days beginning tomorrow.“I announce a special economic package today. This will be an important link in the self-reliant India campaign. If we add the value of the announcements made by the government recently and the decisions taken by the RBI, then this package is worth Rs 20 lakh crore. This is 10% of India’s GDP,” PM Narendra Modi said.He added that this package will provide new impetus to India’s ambition for self-reliance in the year 2020.“This package is for MSMEs and cottage industries that provide jobs to crores of people and form the foundation of a self-reliant India, it is for the labourers and the farmers who toil day and night in all sorts of difficult conditions, it is for the middle class that honestly pays its taxes, it is for the business world that is committed to further raising India’s economic heft,” said PM Modi.He added that it was essential for India to march forward with bold reforms to reach the goal of self-reliance and claimed that the reforms undertaken in the last few years such as direct cash transfers and opening of bank accounts for the poor and the women in rural India have already delivered big results.“The reforms undertaken in the last few years have ensured that every single paise meant for the poor reaches their accounts,” he said.Giving an indication that the future reforms will be wide ranging, the prime minister first mentioned the need to reform the entire supply chain linking the agriculture sector.“It will ensure that a crisis like the one started by the coronavirus has limited impact on agriculture in the future,” he said before adding, “These reforms will be for building a rational tax system, simple and clear laws, top class infrastructure, capable human resources and strong financial system.”He added that these reforms will further promote business and attract investment while strengthening the make in India initiative.Prime Minister said India will modernize its supply chain, produce products of the highest quality to mark its emergence as the new economic power house.He identified the five pillars -- economy, infrastructure, technology driven system, vibrant demography and demand—that will drive India’s vision in this respect.PM Modi said the first pillar is economy which doesn’t get caught up in incremental changes but makes a quantum jump.The second pillar, he said, is infrastructure that becomes the identity of modern India.The third pillar is system, one that doesn’t follow the rules of the past century but is based on technology-driven systems that can realize the dreams of the 21st century.Demography, he said, is the fourth pillar, “Vibrant demography of world’s largest democracy is its strength and it is also the source of the energy for a self-reliant India.”He identified the fifth pillar as demand: “The cycle of demand and supply chain needs to be leveraged to its full potential. To increase demand in the country, it is important for every stake holder of our supply chain to be strengthened.”Prime Minister’s announcement follows interventions made by the finance ministry and the RBI to mitigate the disastrouos impact of Coved-19 on all sectors of economy. While the finance ministry had announced an economic stimulus worth Rs 1.70 lakh crore, the RBI had made several policy decisions to ease liquidity pressure in the market.It also assumes significance in the light of government’s push to create necessary infrastructure to attract investors who may flee China after the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-announces-economic-package-worth-rs-20-lakh-crore-details-to-be-announced-in-the-next-few-days/story-kLbHUw5K3pfg2Yub6vfNDL.html
12-05-2020||India||Kerala expresses concern over AC coaches for special trains||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said it is not ideal to travel in air-conditioned coaches during the Covid-19 pandemic and asked the railway ministry to deploy non-AC compartments for long-distance travel.Talking to media in the state capital, Vijayan said in last two months all were talking about problems of air-conditioned environment in the present scenario and the railway move to run AC special trains was a big surprise.“We have many instances before us. In Punjab many pilgrims who travelled in AC buses during Hazur Sahib pilgrimage were tested positive. Health experts have warned that closed environ is ideal for the virus to spread. We have asked the railways to deploy non-AC coaches,” he said, adding the state has also sought more stops for special trains. Many health experts have also questioned the move to run full AC trains.“The railways said these trains will be run on the lines of the Rajdhani Express. In that case it has to ensure Rajdhani stoppages. For New Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram train there are only two stops in the state. Since the train is coming from the containment zone passengers are forced to travel a lot on road and it will pose more problems,” he said, adding the chief secretary has taken up these issues with the railways. On Tuesday the state reported five new cases--four are foreign returnees. Out of 524 cases, 32 are active cases. The CM said at least 70 per cent of cases came from outside the state and foreign countries and secondary infection rate was very low. He said cases will go up as immigrants from the middle-east and people stranded in other parts of the country started flocking the state in large numbers.“We have requested the centre to make anti-body tests compulsory for the evacuees from the middle-east. Some of them are coming with symptoms and they pose problems to other travellers.

There might be major health complications among the victims in future and we shall work out strategies to attend to the same,” Minister for industries Mekapati Gautam Reddy told Hindustan Times.He said the victims would need periodical health check-ups for the next one year. “We shall organise health camps in the affected villages to regularly monitor their health conditions and provide them necessary treatment,” the minister said.Stating that all the affected people were brought under Arogya Sri scheme in which they would be given treatment free of cost, Reddy said the government would take complete responsibility for their treatment life long, should there be any health issues arising out of gas leakage.Meanwhile, 367 people affected by the gas leakage from LG Polymers plant were still undergoing treatment in different hospitals, while 200 others having recovered were discharged on Tuesday, agriculture minister K Kanna Babu, who is in-charge of Visakhapatnam, told reporters.“Apart from bearing the cost of treatment, the government is also extending compensation to every victim,” said Kanna Babu after calling on the people undergoing treatment at King George Hospitals. He was accompanied by Rajya Sabha member V Vijay Sai Reddy and tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao.The minister said the situation in the affected villages had come back to normal and there were no complaints from the people. “Apart from four of our cabinet colleagues, MP Vijay Sai Reddy and others also had a night stay in the affected villages. A team of five doctors would regularly visit the villages to conduct tests on the people to find out their health status,” he said.Some of the affected people refused to get discharged from KGH stating that they were yet to recover from the ill-effects of the gas. As a result, the doctors allowed them to return to the wards to stay for some more time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-to-bear-life-long-treatment-cost-of-those-hit-by-vizag-gas-leak/story-tsGVSYhIJpnX90sgboIrqN.html
12-05-2020||India||Kerala high court refuses stay on mandatory use of Arogya setu app||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday refused to pass an interim order to stay the mandatory downloading of ‘Arogya Setu’ app on employees’ phones and sought a statement from the central government on data safeguards of the app being developed by the National Informatics Centre.A bench comprising Justices Anu Sivaraman and M R Anitha asked the Centre whether it can give a guarantee that the information collected by the app would not be misused at any time. The counsel for the central government said privacy of data was ensured and it will submit a detailed statement in this regard during the next hearing. He said it has been recognised as the best app in the world fighting the Covid-19 and lakhs of people have already downloaded it.“Extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures, we will come back to it in normal circumstances,” the bench observed while posting the matter for further hearing on May 18. Last month the court had also refused to stay the Kerala Government’s decision to engage a US firm ‘Sprinklr’ in vetting the data collected by health workers. Last week Thrissur District Congress Committee general secretary John Daniel had moved the court saying the Centre’s directive to download the ‘Arogya Setu’ app compulsorily violated the fundamental rights of citizens and there were also chances of misusing personal data collected through the app. He also pointed out the Centre’s guidelines made it clear that employees who do not comply with the directive will have to face prosecution under the Disaster Management Act.On April 29, the Centre had directed all officers and other employees of the government to download the ‘Arogya Setu’ app on their mobile phones immediately. Similarly it also instructed rail and air passengers to download the app for their travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-refuses-stay-on-mandatory-use-of-arogya-setu-app/story-VoW5R26b4eNR76JkDKnrwM.html

It was seen as a double barrelled reference to people turning to local products that were available in neighbourhood shops that have taken a hit earlier due to online shopping portals such as Amazon and Flipkart.In his address, Prime Minister Modi stressed that self-reliance will prepare the country for tough competition in the global supply chain, and it is important that the country wins this competition. The package had been designed, he added, to encourage local manufacturing and will not only increase efficiency in various sectors but also ensure quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-focus-to-economic-revival-replaces-daily-health-briefing-with-bulletins/story-SP7eZ8wtgPP3OmKX5otQZP.html

We have been told since the last century that the 21st century belongs to India,” PM said.He then spoke about the need for self-dependence and how it was the key to transforming India.“It is not just India’s destiny to make this century its own but also its responsibility.

But everyone coming back to Assam will have to undergo a mandatory quarantine between nine and 14 days,” state health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.Earlier, the state government had decided to test all the Assam-bound passengers, but the plan was abandoned because of the influx and the strategy was tweaked in line with the Centre’s directives. “So far, we’re dealing with a few Covid-19 positive cases. But, the scenario has changed since Tuesday. It’ll be impossible to test thousands of passengers returning by trains, as it’ll take days to get the results,” Sarma said.The first train, carrying around 1,000 passengers from Delhi, will reach Dibrugarh in Upper Assam on Wednesday.Around 7,000 passengers are likely to come back to Assam by seven trains from Delhi over the next week.The state government had requested the Union Ministry of Railways to arrange 12 trains, including the seven from Delhi, to repatriate people to the state, who were stranded across the country, including south and west India.Passengers arriving by trains would be screened at railways stations, where they would disembark. The symptomatic patients would be directly taken to dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and the others would be lodged in state-run quarantine facilities.The passengers would be placed in isolation at their respective homes after completion of their 9-14-day mandatory quarantine.Committees are being formed in each block and village to ensure compliance with home quarantine guidelines.“We’ve asked all the 33 districts in the state to set up quarantine facilities for up to 2,500 people each. If the influx of returnees go up, then we’ll have to set up quarantine facilities in each of the 126 assembly constituencies in the state,” Sarma said.A total of 3,597 people, stranded in other parts of the country, have arrived in Assam between May 4 and Tuesday either by their own vehicles or buses.Similarly, 3,507 people stranded in other states in the north-east have returned to Assam.“We’re receiving the results of the test of the returnees. All of them, except one, have tested negative and they would soon be released from the quarantine facilities,” the minister added.Assam has reported 65 Covid-19 positive cases to date, of which two persons have died and 40 have recovered. Another 23 are still undergoing treatment in various Covid-19 dedicated hospitals in the state.Sarma said that the community surveillance initiative started last week by teams of doctors, nurses and laboratory technicians have so far covered 10,000 villages and detected 7,782 people with symptoms of fever, cough, and respiratory ailments. The teams will visit another 10,000 villages over the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-train-passengers-returning-to-assam-to-be-quarantined-only-symptomatic-persons-will-be-tested/story-GZLGHWcF73FwLmCARrUaiJ.html

Samant further informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice A A Sayed that the state of Maharashtra was implementing the National Food Security Act diligently. The act stipulates that anyone holding a valid ration card is eligible to get subsidised ration provided by the government. Samant said that Maharashtra had entered into an agreement with 11 states to allow their natives living in Maharashtra to draw rations based on ration cards issued in their home states. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder and posted the matter for hearing on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-has-allowed-porting-of-ration-cards-for-natives-of-11-states-govt-tells-hc/story-M4vj0AfIiuxtX0JA2ZRdPI.html

12-05-2020||India||How UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh plan to provide jobs to returning migrants||As the number of migrant workers returning to their native states begins to swell, several Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states are preparing to address the challenge of creating jobs for the returnees.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday announced that the state government is making efforts to provide jobs to 20 lakh migrant workers. In Bihar, where the BJP is in alliance with the JDU, the state has issued orders to draw up a plan to cater to a similar number, while in Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said 16 lakh workers have already been given work under the MGNREGA.According to a person aware of the details, the issue of providing employment to the workers, most of whom had to undertake harrowing journeys, was flagged at the meetings that the party high command had with the state units.“Apart from the immediate help such as cash and food for workers who have been out of jobs owing to the nationwide shutdown, states have been asked to ensure that employment avenues are tapped and that people are not left without work and means to earn their livelihood. Unemployment can lead to social unrest,” said a party functionary privy to the details.While states such as Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were criticised for amending existing labour laws, the governments in these states have defended the move on the grounds that it will pave the way for more employment avenues.“Care is being taken to ensure that while newer investment gets a boost; the rights of labourers are protected too,” the functionary quoted above said. But are states, struggling under the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, equipped to bear the strain that reverse migration will exert on their coffers?In UP, where over nine lakh migrant workers have returned so far, minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the numbers are not unrealistic as the state already has schemes that can absorb the additional workforce. He said, the UP chief minister had set up a task force under the agriculture production commissioner, which includes people from the Panchayati Raj, the MSME sector, rural development, labour and skilling ministries to work out areas, where through coordinated efforts jobs will be generated.“There are various schemes in existence already, for instance the MSME has the one district, one product scheme, there are many schemes under rural development that are linked to MGNREGA; we have also set a target of skilling about 20 lakh people and offering them stipend. Targets have been given, we are also mapping the migrant quarantining facilities and so it doesn’t seem difficult to generate jobs,” he said.In Bihar, a massive data collation exercise is underway, said minister Sanjay Jha. He said the administration is collecting details of all those who arrive at the quarantine centres set up across all blocs in the state to get a sense of the skills and proficiency of the workers.“When the workers began to arrive, the chief minister gave instructions to make a data bank of their skill sets so that as soon as avenues for investment open up, we can go all out to ensure they are gainfully employed,” he said.Jha said the scepticism over reverse migration is unfounded since a lot of workers who have returned to Bihar from other states, showed inclination to stay back. In Haryana, a party functionary said efforts are underway to ensure economic activity picks up in the industrial belt so that workers who left for their native places are encouraged to move back.“If states don’t make efforts to reboot quickly, there will be a massive labour shortfall,” the second functionary said.Prof Amitabh Kundu, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said the reverse migration is only temporary.“It is good if state governments create jobs. But reverse migration won’t last because there is massive regional inequality between the Northern and southern regions. Also, in states such as UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, etc the population growth is much above the national average; whereas the southern states have stabilised their growth. So migration will occur again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-up-bihar-madhya-pradesh-plan-to-provide-jobs-to-returning-migrants/story-WHy83ZP9OvfYjuVzXsKWHI.html

The bird is the first among our current batch of tagged birds,” WII scientist R Suresh Kumar, who is currently monitoring the route of the migratory bird, said.“Chiulon clocked 9,600 km in 15 days since leaving the Somali coast on April 23. Whether he will stop here to breed or continue to move further to the North we will have to wait and see.”Chiulon, named after a village in Manipur’s Tamenglong district and four other falcons namely Puching, Phalong-both names of villages in Tamenglong district, Irang and Barak - both names of rivers of the district, were radio tagged with satellite transmitters by the forest department in collaboration with WII scientists to study the flight route of these long-distance migratory birds and environmental patterns along the route.Though all the falcons are sharing their data during this radio tagging programme, Puching and Phalong failed to transmit any data few days after they were tagged.Irang was in the mountainous tracts of Myanmar’s Mandalay region while Barak was last located over Odisha. On the other hand Longleng, a female Amur falcon named after Nagaland’s district was radio-tagged in October 2016 in Nagaland was last located 600 km south of Beijing.“I think she will arrive at the same woodland patch to breed which is another 600 km northeast of Beijing,” Kumar said.On WMBD, he said, “Migratory birds know no boundary. They connect our planet, connect landscapes and as we know now from our Amur falcons they connect communities. It is one world for all of us.”In their annual migratory flight to South Africa from northern China, Amur falcons pass through northeast India, particularly Manipur and Nagaland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/radio-tagged-amur-falcon-reaches-breeding-ground-in-china-from-ne-india/story-pq0gompPslIASLK851iYfK.html
12-05-2020||India||2 Lashkar terrorists who shot 3 CRPF jawans identified, one was from Pak||Two terrorists who killed three CRPF jawans at a security checkpost in Handwara last week are linked to the Lashkar-e-Taiba, a senior police officer said on Tuesday. The officer said one of them was a Pakistani national Usman. The other was a Kashmiri.The two shot dead three jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force who were at a security checkpoint when they were distracted by some movement at the orchard along the road at Handwara’s Wangam. The terrorists had taken away the rifles of the soldiers after cutting the sling before escaping from the spot.A 14-year-old was killed in the crossfire.The ambush in Kupwara district had taken place just a day after five security personnel including Colonel Ashutosh Sharma and Major Anuj Sood laid down their lives in an encounter near Handwara’s Rajbhar forest in an overnight gunbattle. Two Lashkar terrorists including one Pakistani national Haider were also killed in this incident.“We are looking at the possibility that the two terrorists who killed the CRPF jawans may have had a role to play in the gunbattle that cost the security forces five lives,” a senior police officer said.“It is not certain what kind of a role these two terrorists may have played. Whether they were in the house when the security forces mounted the operation to secure the family being held hostage or had left by then.” the officer said.A top security official had told Hindustan Times after the 13-hour Handwara gunbattle that the agencies would keep an open mind on the number of terrorists involved in the encounter. “We will be led by the evidence that we find,” he said on Tuesday.Handwara falls along the route for terrorists infiltrating from the Leepa Valley, the route that has been much in use by terrorists coming into the Keran sector from Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Intelligence agencies have cautioned that north Kashmir’s Handwara, Baramulla and Sopore triangle could be the hotbed of terror activity this summer as Pakistan’s deep state looks to escalate the violence here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-lashkar-terrorists-who-shot-3-crpf-jawans-identified-one-was-from-pak/story-4WLTIbGdN8fKwfSHqxavXK.html
12-05-2020||India||India needs basic income scheme to make lockdown work: French economist||India needs to come out with a basic income scheme to make the lockdown work, noted French economist Thomas Piketty said on Tuesday.He also said that India has the potential to become the global democratic leader of the 21st century if it manages to address the issue of inequality. The government has imposed lockdown from March 25 to curb the spread of coronavirus and since then extended the restrictions twice.  “I think the government would be well advised to introduce a basic income scheme, and more generally to develop a safety net in India. I do not see how a lockdown can work without a system of income maintenance,” Piketty told PTI in an interview. Interestingly, the idea of universal basic income was mooted in Economic Survey 2016-17 by the then chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian and there was a discussion last year during the electoral campaign to introduce a basic income in India.Piketty also pitched for more equitable and progressive taxation including a wealth tax and inheritance tax in India.“India has the potential to become the global democratic leader of the 21st century, assuming the country manages to come to terms with its legacy of inequality,” the eminent economist emphasised. “The attention that was put to the reservation system was not matched by sufficient attention to other issues, including land reform and the redistribution of property, and the funding of adequate education, infrastructure and health investment through a more equitable and progressive tax system (including a wealth tax and inheritance tax),” he said. Piketty, who recently wrote a book ‘Capital and Ideology’, noted that a pandemic like Covid-19 can have contradictory effects on inequality. “On the one hand, it can raise the legitimacy of public investment in health, infrastructure and education. But on the other hand, it can also raise the fear of strangers and reinforce the preexisting trends toward sectarian conflicts,” he said. Before the pandemic, Piketty said the trend toward sectarian conflict reflected the lack of political ambition to change the economic system and to put in place a system that is truly based on economic justice. “This will be even more true after the pandemic: we need to think again about how to reconcile prosperity and equality,” he said adding that in his book, he explored the possibility of a system based upon educational justice and participatory socialism, involving private property for all and the permanent circulation of wealth and power. Asked how coronavirus pandemic will impact India’s rising inequality, Piketty said the experience of the Spanish flu of 1918-20 is frightening. “According to some studies, mortality rates were as large as 5 per cent in India or Indonesia, as compared to 0.5 - 1 per cent in Western Europe and the US (which was already very high). “It seems unlikely that things can get so bad today, but this means that we have to be very careful,” Piketty, who is currently a professor at Paris School of Economics, said. The French economist, who has worked extensively on issues like inequality and poverty, said by looking at a broader range of historical trajectories, he has also come to stress the key role of ideological and political change in the evolution of inequality. “The main determinants of inequality are not economic and technological: they are ideological and political,” he argued. Piketty’s previous book ‘Capital in the Twenty-First Century ‘ became the best-selling work in the history of Harvard University Press and made him a household name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-needs-basic-income-scheme-to-make-lockdown-work-french-economist/story-Dtz64oxSG8JbzIKqrv2JOM.html
12-05-2020||India||2G mobile internet services restored in Kashmir||The Jammu and Kashmir administration restored 2G internet connectivity across the Union Territory on Tuesday, six days after the service was snapped during an operation by security forces that resulted in the killing of militant commander Riyaz Naikoo. Last week, internet connectivity and prepaid mobile phone services across Kashmir were snapped during a gun battle in which Naikoo, the operations commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, and his aide were killed at Beighpora Gulzarpora village in South Kashmir’s Pulwama district.Prepaid mobile phone services were restored on Friday, but mobile internet connectivity remained suspended till May 11, or the 17th day of the holy month of Ramzan, due to apprehensions about possible militant attacks.Principal secretary (home) Shaleen Kabra issued an order for restoring mobile internet services across Kashmir.On Monday, the Supreme Court had refused to order the restoration of 4G services on mobile devices in Jammu and Kashmir, but issued directions for forming a special committee to address issues raised by petitioners who had challenged the snapping of internet connectivity in the region.All internet services were snapped in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir on August 4 last year, hours before the Centre announced its decision to bifurcate the state into the union territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.Since then, whenever there is a major attack by militants or a gun battle in any part of Kashmir, the government snaps mobile internet services as officials fear these developments could trigger fresh protests. For many people, the frequent disruption of internet connectivity has become a headache.“It’s now a big problem. First, we were barred from using high speed internet and now even 2G is being snapped frequently,” said a local resident who declined to be named.Officials were anticipating attacks on security forces across Kashmir on the 17th day of Ramzan, or the day of Badr, when a few hundred Muslims led by Prophet Mohammed took on their powerful opponents in Arabia and won. There was speculation about an attack as militants have targeted security forces in the Kashmir Valley on this day in the past. Last year, there were similar reports about possible attacks on the 17th day of Ramzan.However, authorities decided last week to restore 2G internet connectivity after the 17th of Ramzan passed off peacefully. As there were no incidents on the day, officials restored mobile internet services with slow speed on Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2g-mobile-internet-services-restored-in-kashmir/story-qbJDsieDjnWYSIdcJ0FWuO.html
12-05-2020||India||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh face of over Krishna river water||The bonhomie between Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his Andhra Pradesh counterpart Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in the last one year seems all but over as the two states brace for a fight over the Krishna river waters.The bone of contention between the two states is an order issued by the Andhra Pradesh irrigation department (GO Ms. No. 203) on May 5 according administrative approval to a series of schemes worth over Rs 7,000 crore aimed at drawing an additional quantity of six to eight tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of water per day from Srisailam reservoir on the Krishna river.While the Telangana government described the order as illegal, unilateral and against the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, the Andhra Pradesh government defended the same stating that the new schemes were well within the state’s rights. The AP government also accused Telangana of constructing projects like Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift scheme which was in violation of the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal.As per the latest GO, the new schemes proposed by the AP government include construction of Rayalaseema lift scheme aimed at pumping three tmc of water from Sangameshwara into Srisailam Right Main Canal, upgradation of Pothireddypadu head regulator canal system to draw 80,000 cusecs of water from foreshore of Srisailam reservoir and other upgradation various works in existing canal system of Galeru-Nagari project to draw another 70,000 cusecs of water from Srisailam.The Telangana chief minister, who held an emergency meeting with the irrigation department authorities late Monday night, regretted that the Jagan government had taken a unilateral decision at a time when the Telangana government was extending a friendly hand to its neighbour.He said river waters should be utilised for the benefit of farmers in both the states setting aside all the differences and disputes of the past.“I have taken the initiative by saying there should not be any ego or water basin problems in utilizing the water. It is very painful that despite this, the AP government declared a new scheme without even consulting with the Telangana state to lift water from Srisailam project unilaterally. This dented the very spirit with which water should be utilised by the two states with mutual cooperation,” he said.KCR said the Jagan government’s move was highly objectionable and asked the officials to file a complaint in the Krishna Water Management Board and also the apex council under the Union water resources ministry. He also instructed the officials to approach the Supreme Court, if necessary.The issue is likely to figure in the meeting of Krishna River Management Board to be held on Wednesday through video-conferencing.KCR pointed out that the AP State Reorganization Act had clearly stipulated that if new irrigation projects are planned in AP or Telangana, they should get clearance from the apex committee. “But the AP government did not get any such approval. Srisailam project is a combined project of both AP and Telangana and water from this project should be utilised by both the States and AP cannot construct new projects unilaterally,” he argued.Andhra Pradesh irrigation minister P Anil Kumar, however, clarified to reporters that the AP government was proposing the new schemes only to utilise surplus waters of Krishna river and was not trespassing into the rights of Telangana.“Because of the disputes between the two states in the past, more than 800 tmc of Krishna water had gone waste into the sea. We are only trying to utilise a part of it during the flood season,” he explained.Another senior YSRC lawmaker Malladi Vishnu said it was Telangana government which had constructed new projects like Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift irrigation scheme on Krishna waters without apex council approval. “We are taking up projects well within our rights,” he asserted.Last year, both the chief ministers had proposed to take up a joint irrigation project to divert surplus Godavari waters to Krishna basin so as to bring in more area under irrigation. Both KCR and Jagan held a few rounds of talks, followed by official-level meetings, but they have not made any headway till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tealangana-andhra-pradesh-face-of-over-krishna-river-water/story-PrTmh6t2VKvcGHhkvx6ZDN.html

The CM added that more relaxations will be given in these zones.“The red zones would be further divided into three categories. Steps would also be taken to restart the 100-day work scheme in the non-containment areas,” said Mamata Banerjee.There are at least 566 containment zones in the state. Out of them, Kolkata has 326 containment areas.Banerjee claimed that people were facing problems since the imposition of the lockdown on March 25 as the move was “poorly planned”.“Don’t think we will get relief from the Covid-19 crisis anytime soon. We should have a three-month short term plan in place to tackle the situation,” she said after a review meeting with state officials.Talking about her interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his video conference with chief ministers on Monday, Banerjee said Bengal gained nothing from the meeting and was left “empty-handed”.The Centre is yet to clear the “legitimate financial dues” of the state, she claimed.“I have raised several issues during the meeting with PM. But I must say we always return empty-handed after our meetings with the PM. We are yet to get our dues,” the chief minister said.Referring to the communal clashes that broke out in Hooghly district last week, Banerjee said action will be taken against those found guilty.“Stern action will be taken against those involved in communal clashes amid the lockdown.

12-05-2020||India||To counter RSS’ Balagokulam, Congress plans Jawahar Bal Manch for children||The Congress is launching a new organisation for children aged between 10 and 17 years to prepare them for the future and inculcate “constitutional values” in them in a bid to counter the Balagokulam initiative of the RSS.The party decided to launch Jawahar Bal Manch (JBM) nationwide following the success of a similar concept in Kerala, people familiar with developments said.The former Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president in Kerala, Ramesh Chennithala, had launched Jawahar Balajana Vedi (JBV) as part of the state unit in 2007.“The idea is to inculcate constitutional values and a spirit of nationalism and instil secular principles in children, besides developing their artistic and cultural talents,” JBV chairman GV Hari told HT.“Apart from emphatically upholding slogans of democracy, secularism and socialism, JBM seeks to sustain in children the qualities of fraternity, equality and compassion as their ideals of life,” he said.To kick-start the project, the JBM will organise an online National Dream Photography Contest on May 21, the 29th anniversary of the death of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.The JBV in Kerala was set up in response to Balagokulam initiative of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This initiative was started in the southern state in 1975 and later registered as a nationwide cultural movement in 1981.Through this, the RSS sought to inculcate moral values in children and weekly cultural and moral science classes are held for those up to 18 years of age.Hari said the JBV in Kerala currently has a membership of 250,000 children and 32 of its previous members now hold key positions in the National Students Union of India (NSUI), a frontal organisation of the grand old party.“In terms of branding, the JBM will be completely apolitical but we will aggressively promote it as a strong counter to the RSS, which runs the ‘operation catch them young’ in many parts of the country,” a senior All India Congress Committee (AICC) functionary said on condition of anonymity.He said discussions in this regard were held with Congress president Sonia Gandhi last December. “The meeting decided to keep JBM non-political, but strong emphasis was given on its position and strategic importance in terms of sending the right message to the children’s community through activities and storytelling,” he added.Hari said the Kerala model is being replicated in other states in view of its “huge success”. “We have already run pilots in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab and will start soon in Rajasthan. We were going to give it a big launch push in April but had to defer it due to the coronavirus pandemic,” said Hari, who is overseeing the project’s expansion across the country.Apart from student exchange programmes, JBM plans to hold annual cultural festivals in different states.“We are also planning to develop a unified volunteer work force that is ready to lend a helping hand in times of distress.

12-05-2020||India||In Chhattisgarh, spending in govt departments cut by 30% to fight slowdown||The Chhattisgarh government has lowered the expenditure limit in the departments after the decrease in revenue receipts due to economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In an order issued on Monday, the departments will now be able to spend only 70 percent of their allotted budget.The order states that the expenditure limit in the first quarter of the financial year shall not exceed 20 percent of the total budget provision. In case of excessive need by the department, the proposal will have to be submitted to the finance department with justification for relaxing this expenditure limit.It has been directed that the departments, including construction departments, which made provision for expenditure under the capital expenditure head in the budget for the year 2020-21, the priority should be decided by the departments based on the urgency of the works.“Departments should prioritise completion of the works under construction as much as possible and in case of new tasks becoming very urgent, they should be considered for approval as per the delegation of financial rights on priority basis. The new items for which the proposal for approval is to be forwarded to the finance department should be submitted only after deciding the priority with administrative approval of the minister of the department,” a press release issued by the government said.The finance department has prepared a department-wise time schedule to discuss the economy keeping in mind the effect that the nationwide lockdown has had on the state and the economic growth.As per Additional chief secretary, finance, Amitabh Jain, the total budget allocated to all the departments this year was about Rs 95,000 crore in the budget.“By this cut of 30 percent in the allotted budget to the departments, we are hoping to save close to Rs 25,000 crore of the government’s money,” said Jain.Senior BJP leader and spokesperson Sacchinand Upasane said that the state government has done nothing on development front since coming into power.“Nothing on the development front has been done. All development works are stopped since the government was formed in 2018. Everyone in the state is facing debt. This decision will certainly not help them,” said Upasane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-chhattisgarh-spending-in-govt-departments-cut-by-30-to-fight-slowdown/story-kKSRzmSIGCjo7Dsi2zh1EI.html

Similarly, the registration link for migrants stranded in Delhi is not posted on the Delhi government website; rather it is on the website of Delhi Shelter Board. In other instances complicating matters, Bihar government’s portal is non-functional, it said. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn MHA’s standard operating procedures (SOP), issued on Monday, the letter states that it doesn’t detail how online and offline registrations will be coordinated and added that the logistics and the basis for allotment of passengers to trains was ‘unclear’ too.It further pointed out that there were no protocols regarding information dissemination to workers about the travel plan and schedule in an easily accessible manner. The SOPs also don’t provide any way for workers to track their application status and that the cost considerations for the workers and the protocols for intra-state travels were not clear.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The SOPs, the letter states, also don’t provide any offline registration protocol as well as any criteria for prioritising passengers such as the elderly, differently-abled etc. On a query by HT, there was no response from the ministry of home affairs till filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gaps-in-government-s-migrants-transfer-plan-highlighted-remedies-sought/story-270gp9ckUTPq8mimS6mHuK.html
12-05-2020||India||US CDC provides $3.6 million to support Covid-19 response in India||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will provide $3.6 million to assist the Indian government’s response to the Covid-19 epidemic, including prevention and preparedness activities in the country. This initial tranche of funding from the CDC aims to strengthen and support the Indian government’s efforts to increase laboratory capacity for SARS-COV-2 testing, including molecular diagnostics and serology, said a statement issued by the US embassy on Tuesday. The funding will also be used to support the development of infection prevention and control (IPC) centres of excellence that can improve the ability of hospital networks to detect Covid-19 and strengthen local health systems through enhanced surveillance and monitoring. The CDC will work with local partners to assist in the development of a strong public health workforce to support India’s capacity to respond to the current pandemic and future threats. “The scope of support will include planning for health emergency operations centres to further strengthen public health emergency management capacities. In addition, the CDC India program will provide technical assistance for the government of India’s ongoing crisis emergency and risk communication efforts,” the statement said.Since early January, the CDC’s India office has collaborated with sub-national and national government bodies to support the Covid-19 response. These efforts have focused on laboratory strengthening, infection prevention and control, health workforce development, emergency management, risk communication, and community engagement. The CDC has conducted training courses across India for healthcare administrators, physicians, nurses, and hospital staff on preparedness and response, infection prevention, laboratory operations, and field epidemiology to equip frontline workers with skills to collect, analyse and interpret data, and contribute to evidence-based decisions.The goal of the CDC’s global health response to Covid-19 is to limit human-to-human transmission and minimise the pandemic’s impact through partnerships with country and non-governmental partners to mitigate vulnerabilities. The CDC has a long-standing technical collaboration with India’s health ministry to control HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, eradicate polio, and prepare responses to influenza and other pandemic diseases. Over the past two decades, this partnership has deepened mutual cooperation through the exchange of scientific knowledge and technology. In India, US government agencies, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the CDC and other department of health and human services agencies, have provided more than $1.4 billion in health assistance and nearly $2.8 billion in total assistance over the last 20 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-cdc-provides-3-6-mn-to-support-covid-19-response-in-india/story-WrkKC3NMjZAr4LmUW6BD5J.html

12-05-2020||India||Kerala nurse who survived nipah wants to care for Covid -19 patients||Two years after she became the first patient in Kerala to recover from the dreaded nipah virus, M Anjanya, now a qualified nurse, wants to work in Covid hospital as a mark of gratitude to those who had prayed for her. The nipah virus which had an 80 per cent mortality rate had put her on ventilator for more than a week. But her recovery became a story of her resistance and the resolve of a team of dedicated medical professionals. It was also dubbed as a wonder in the medical world.Ajanya who was then a nursing intern, graduated from the Government Nursing College in Kozhikkode with distinction in January is waiting for employment.The 21-year-old GNM (general nursing and midwifery) graduate said, “I am yearning to work in a Covid hospital. I am sure we will overcome this challenge also. I love my profession more now. Many prayed for my life and it is time for me to pay back,” she said.“Today is the World Nurses Day. Many frontline warriors have fallen prey to the monstrous virus. But their sacrifice inspires people like me and I am sure we will tame it soon,” she said.The daughter of a farm labourer and ‘anganwadi’ worker she was afflicted with nipah while she was doing her internship at the Kozhikkode medical college hospital in 2018. “I was in the ICU ward looking after my patients as part of my training. On May 18 I developed high fever and other ailments and got admitted at the same ward. Two days later I lost my consciousness. I was later told Lini Puthussery was in the same ward,” she said.Lini, another nurse, was not lucky like her and died. Last year the state government instituted an award in Lini’s memory and the World Health Organization also lauded her contributions.“I consider it as one of the noblest professions in the world. Becoming a nurse was my childhood dream. I feel I am nearer to my dream. I have applied at several places I am waiting for the call. As a beginner it is time for me to take challenges head on. I would love to care for Covid-19 patients,” she said.Among the 19 infected with nipah Ajanya was the first to come out of the hospital and later Ubeesh, a male nurse, was also discharged but 17 others including Lini succumbed to the disease. “After Lini’s death it was a big challenge for the medical team. A head nurse stayed at the hospital for a week noting down Ajanya’s condition every minute. It is great she is ready to take up the profession,” recalled district medical officer Dr V Jayasree. She also said that the nipah battle had made medical professionals in north Kerala bolder. Nipah was an unknown virus, with no medicine or history of treatment or carriers and health experts hit a blind alley in the initial stages of the outbreak but they fought back valiantly and contained its secondary infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/payback-time-says-kerala-nurse-who-wants-to-care-for-covid-19-patients/story-vPVWL2xClRAhmN5AffRExM.html
12-05-2020||India||Lockdown tale of Uttarakhand driver: 40 days in a truck and now 14 days in quarantine||A driver from Uttarakhand spent 40 days in his truck near the border with Rajasthan amid the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, before he reached his home district of Champawat, where he has been isolated for 14 days by local authorities.Forty-seven days after he began his journey, Sunil Kumar reached Champawat on Saturday. Kumar, a resident of Munch area of Champawat, has been driving a truck while based in Delhi for the past six years.According to Kumar, he was stuck due to the lockdown and spent 40 days in his truck near the border with Rajasthan.“I left for Hyderabad from Delhi on March 22. I reached Shahpura area near the Delhi-Rajasthan border on March 23, and I was stranded there due to the lockdown,” he said.“Rajasthan Police didn’t allow me to proceed and Delhi Police didn’t allow me to go back. So there was no way to go anywhere. I decided to wait in the truck. I had a stove and rations for a few days and I cooked food inside the truck. Later I bought food from a nearby grocery shop,” he said.Kumar added, “It was a very difficult time, waiting day in and day out. Sometimes, the difference between days and nights didn’t seem to matter. I would spend my nights counting the stars. I was hoping the lockdown would end on April 24, and then I would be able to go home or to Hyderabad. But the lockdown was extended and my difficulties continued.”He faced many problems while living in the truck – he wasn’t able to charge his mobile phone after some time and couldn’t remain in touch with his family.“Weird thoughts would cross my mind. I missed my family, especially my pregnant wife. There were times when I thought whether I would ever reach my home,” Kumar said.When the lockdown was relaxed and commercial vehicles were allowed to ply on May 3, he moved out and reached Delhi two days later.“In Delhi, l left my truck at my transport agency’s office. I registered to return on my state government’s website. My health screening was done and I boarded a bus for Uttarakhand. With the help of authorities from my state, I finally reached Champawat on the morning of May 9,” he said.“The local authorities quarantined me in a shelter and took my samples for the coronavirus test. When my report came negative on Sunday, they sent me for home quarantine for 14 days.”Kumar said he was happy to be finally home. “Now I will go to Delhi only after my wife delivers the baby. Sometimes in my sleep, I still feel I am in the truck,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-tale-of-uttarakhand-driver-40-days-in-a-truck-and-now-14-days-in-quarantine/story-cagT9fUKnDBzrLhPGTkgSO.html
12-05-2020||India||‘Covid-19 quarantine period over 14 days must be justified by authorities’: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday held that the Delhi government will have to give a reason for keeping a person in quarantine for more than 14 days, else lift the lockdown on the person, observing that the period of 14 days is “not mandatory but to serve a general guideline”.Justice C Hari Shankar said that as of now, there is no certainty of opinion regarding the extent of virulence of the Covid-19 virus, its actual period of gestation, the period taken for symptoms, in an infected person, to manifest themselves, or the period for which a person, once infected, remains a potential source of infection to others. It remarked that the medical community, the world over, is yet to come to grips with this virus, and isolate its individual characteristics.The court was hearing a plea by photojournalist Amit Bhargava, who had sought formulation of quarantine rules for the people while indicating whether the quarantine starts from the day of contact with the infected person or the date of diagnosis of the infected person.Also read: PM Modi to address nation at 8pm today, day after meeting with CMs In a judgment passed on Monday, Justice Hari Shankar said it is “unwilling to hold that in each and in every case, the period of home quarantine must stand limited to 14 days, and no more” while also observing that unjustified quarantine also has “deleterious civil consequences”.“……this court is of the opinion that, at this juncture, the interests of justice would be abundantly protected by a direction, to the effect that if any person, who does not display Covid-19 symptoms, and has not tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, is home quarantined for over 14 days, he shall have a right to represent to the authorities against such continued quarantine and, if he so represents, the authorities would be bound either to lift the quarantine forthwith or to explain, to the person concerned, as expeditiously as possible and without any undue delay, the reason for keeping him in home quarantine for over 14 days,” the court said in a 22-page judgment.Advocate Shyel Trehan, appearing for the petitioner, contended that the persons, who are under home quarantine, are unaware of the officer, who is required to be contacted, should any exigency arise during the period of home quarantine.Following this, counsel for the Delhi government, advocate Shobhana Takiar, submitted that a helpline number, on which persons, under home quarantine, can establish contact with the Ministry/Departments, would be displayed on the official website of the Government of NCT of Delhi (GNCTD).The judge also said that in formulating and implementing its policy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic the executive administration is traversing uncharted territory.“The executive must, in such a circumstance, be afforded the requisite play in the joints, so as to formulate, and implement, its policy as meaningfully and efficiently as possible. Absent any legal or constitutional infraction, therefore, courts have necessarily to be slow in subjecting executive action, taken in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, to searching judicial scrutiny,” the court said.It also said that the Delhi government should have issued a show-cause notice to anyone who is found to have breached the quarantine or the lockdown, even before the issuance of a warning to him to desist from doing so.“Besides the fact that the law does not require the issuance of any such notice before issuing a warning, any such mandate, if issued, would have the potential of seriously derailing the efforts, of the executive administration, to enforce discipline during the period of lockdown/quarantine,” the court said.The plea had contended that the petitioner was kept under quarantine beyond the necessary period of 14 days and the authorities had wrongly calculated the quarantine period. He also stated that on April 20 he got a disciplinary notice from the SDM, warning punitive action if he violated the norms. “There appears to be no basis for the calculation of a home quarantine basis for a period of over 30 days from the date of contact with the infected person, either clinically, or in law,” the plea had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unjustified-covid-19-quarantine-can-be-challenged-delhi-high-court/story-d0enRb6LhbaeuFQl5kHIDM.html

Thus, for culling we need huge financial support from the central government,” IANS quoted Das as saying.The Kaziranga National Park authority has dug a two-km long and six-feet deep trench to protect wild boars from the ASF infection.According to the 2019 census, Assam had over 21 lakh pigs, which the authorities say could have increased to around 30 lakh now.After the outbreak in Assam, all the North-East states have sounded high alert and asked people, especially owners of piggeries, to refrain from bringing pigs from other states.The North-East’s annual pork business is worth around Rs 8,000-10,000 crore, with Assam being the largest supplier.What is African swine fever?African swine fever (ASF) is a severe, highly-contagious haemorrhagic viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. This transboundary animal disease (TAD) can be spread by live or dead pigs, domestic or wild, and pork products.It is caused by a large DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family, which also infects ticks of the genus Ornithodoros.Signs of African swine fever and classical swine fever (CSF) may be similar but the ASF virus is unrelated to the CSF virus.African swine fever is a disease listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/african-swine-fever-infects-over-14-000-pigs-in-assam-alert-in-north-east/story-YTiRhySP8YWinWQxjMpGUO.html

One of these four patients is a 25-year-old nursing staff from the district’s Janpigur state hospital. The rest are men, aged 30, 58 and 65 years. Murshidabad and Malda districts are among the top contributors to the migrant workforce from West Bengal. “The swab samples of these four patients were collected by Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital on May 6. The results were released on May 10. This is a cause for concern,” Dr Koushik Chaki, secretary of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, said.“The state government needs to carry out more tests. More and more doctors and nursing staff across Bengal are getting infected and frontline warriors are not getting personal protection equipment (PPE) in adequate quantity,” said Dr Chaki.The prominent body of physicians wrote its second letter in four days on Monday to chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, highlighting the issue.“Without robust testing facilities all across the state, normalisation of all healthcare facilities cannot be resolved,” said the letter. Incidentally, a train carrying 1,224 migrant workers from Kerala reached Berhampore station in Murshidabad on May 6. The administration collected swab samples from some of the passengers of this train and the test results are awaited. The three men who tested positive on Sunday night, however, came from Delhi by the road a week ago, health officials said. The patients live in different villages in the Suti-II community block area. The district administration has barricaded these villages.There are 70 quarantine centres in Murshidabad but most are lying empty, health department officials said. The number of Covid-19 patients in the district has reached five after the new detections.“We may find a quite different number if tests are carried out extensively,” said a senior doctor who did not wish to be named.Chief medical officer of health (Murshidabad), Dr Prasanta Biswas, said, “All four patients have been admitted to the Covid-19 hospital in Berhampore.”Three migrant workers, who recently returned from Ajmer in Rajasthan to Malda district, tested positive on Saturday. They came in a train that also carried a large number of pilgrims who went to Ajmer Sharif in the desert state. “Our government has made all arrangement for treatment of the patients,” Asok Das, Murshidabad district’s Trinamool Congress vice-president, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infection-among-migrant-workers-in-2-bengal-districts-trigger-demand-for-more-covid-19-tests/story-W1tME8XDTkdYOENmxZg1FP.html

Downloading the Aarogya Setu app will be mandatory for all the passengers. Only those with a “green status” will be allowed to enter the airport. Airlines have been asked to open check-in counters three hours prior to departure time and close them 60 to 75 minutes prior to departure. Boarding will commence an hour prior to departure time and the gates will close 20 minutes before.Frisking of passengers has been asked to be minimised and to be carried out only if the door frame metal detector beeps. The draft SOPs also ask the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to not stamp passenger’s boarding pass in this phase. The airlines have been told to conduct a secondary temperature check at the boarding gate before the passengers enter their flight. The document also suggests that the same set of crew (pilots and cabin attendants) be rostered on a flight as long as possible to minimise the risk of infection.Passengers will not be served meals on board. Water will be available in cups and bottles in the galley. The last three rows of the aircraft will be kept vacant for isolation of any passenger who develops a medical condition.

12-05-2020||India||HC grants interim protection to Delhi Minorities Commission chairman||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday granted interim protection from arrest to Zafar-ul-Islam, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission till June 22 following a plea for anticipatory bail after the police booked him for sedition for his social media posts earlier this month.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri said that no coercive action should be taken against Islam till the next date of hearing (June 22) after he had moved the high court apprehending arrest in “a motivated, untenable and absolutely frivolous complaint” registered at the Lodhi Colony police station.He had also pleaded that the facts and grounds demonstrate that the registration of the FIR was a gross abuse of the process of law and also establish his innocence.On Tuesday, advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, told the court that no case was being made against their client. The plea said that Islam, in his social media posts highlighted the targeting of Muslims by “bigots” in India and expressed his thanks to Kuwait, for expressing concern on the issue harassment of Muslims in India.“It is noteworthy that his social media posts make it evident that while acknowledging the international community’s support, he has emphatically stated that Indian Muslims do not seek or require external help in India. Despite offers of solidarity from foreign countries, he (Islam) has firmly taken the position of non-interference in India’s internal affairs,” the petition said.The court sought to know from the Delhi police about the actions taken by them on the FIR. Appearing for the city police, advocate Chaitnaya Gosain, told the court that a notice has been issued to Islam under relevant section of the CrPC. He said that Islam has submitted some documents and information as sought by them.Grover told the court that her client is ready to cooperate in the investigation but prior notice should be given because of his age and the lockdown. The court then directed the Delhi police to give advance notice to Islam for questioning.The petition had contended that a substantial portion of the hate speech and attacks on the Muslim community was in the form of spreading fake and fabricated news that vilifies Muslims and portrays them as spreading coronavirus. Misinformation was spread to target Muslims as carriers and spreaders of coronavirus. Such misinformation, including that members of the Tablighi Jamaat misbehaved with doctors was refuted by the local police on more than one instance.Sedition is a non-bailable offence under the Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code and the punishment ranges from imprisonment up to three years to a life term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-interim-protection-to-delhi-minorities-commission-chairman/story-blpyIiNWHC3siPyw4Az4HN.html

Videos of KTR, son of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, frequently sneezing into his towel went viral on social media. The minister seemed in a bit of discomfort while attending a series of programmes and interacting with officials.In light of the growing number of Covid-19 cases in the state, enquiries about the minister’s health gathered pace.“@KTRTRS Sir. Disturbed to know that you were down with flu symptoms yesterday in Sircilla. Concerned about your health. You have been a Covid warrior since the virus engulfed us, unmindful of your health. Please reassure about your health. You are our hope. Please take care,” tweeted one of his followers.There were also comments in private conversations that KTR should have gone to the hospital for a Covid-19 test, as the health protocol mandates that people with symptoms of cold, flu, running nose, sore throat and fever should visit the nearest hospital.KTR, taking note of the tweet, clarified that he was perfectly well and apologised for any inconvenience he may have caused. “Many thanks for your concern sir. Perfectly well now. Developed an allergic cold (struggling for many years) en route to Siricilla. Didn’t want to cancel my visit suddenly as it would inconvenience many people. Apologies for any inconvenience I may have caused inadvertently,” he tweeted, in reply to his follower’s query.The minister inaugurated the central lighting system, administrative building, workers’ canteen and sewing training centre at the Textile Park in Baddenapalli of Thangallapalli block in Siricilla, his home constituency on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-sneezing-ktr-during-a-state-function-causes-flutter-in-telangana/story-8cJXhoFHJ3SLpCw9xYOuWP.html

12-05-2020||India||Economic stimulus by governments may be exploited by terrorists, says FATF||Global money laundering watchdog – Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – has claimed that the stimulus measures and international financial assistance announced by various countries to mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic are likely to be exploited by the terrorists and criminals by posing as genuine businesses seeking assistance, according to report released by it.It warns that terrorists and criminals will use this economic downturn to move to new cash-incentive and high-liquidity lines of business in developing countries – both for laundering of proceeds as well as fund their terror operations.“In an economic downturn, criminals may seek to invest in real estate or troubled businesses to generate cash and mask illicit proceeds. Criminal groups can also introduce illicit proceeds into the financial system by restructuring existing loans and lines of credit. In addition, corporate insolvency proceedings can free up illicit cash contained in businesses whilst masking the funds’ origins,” FATF says in the first such report since the pandemic forced worldwide shutdowns in February-March this year.Tax evasion and related crimes may increase as individuals and companies facing economic difficulties look to reduce their fiscal burdens, the report adds.Many countries are reporting an “overall” increase in banknote withdrawals, which the FATF claims is likely to be used by criminals/terrorists to cover their illicit funds with “redeposit funds” when the markets stabilise. “Banknotes can be used to purchase safe haven assets (e.g. gold), which are less easily traceable,” the FATF states.Some of the countries have also reported an increase in fundraising scams where criminals posing as international organizations or charities circulate emails requesting donations for Covid-19 related fundraising campaigns (purportedly for research, victims and/or products), according to the report.The health crisis, the Paris-based body says, is also impacting the government and private sectors’ abilities to implement anti-money laundering measures and counter terrorist financing as well as international cooperation. Formal cooperation, such as mutual legal assistance and extradition are already impacted by the crisis due to limitation or suspension of court operations, and the delayed execution of orders caused by travel restrictions.The anti-money laundering/counter terror financing (AML/CFT) ‘on-site’ inspections have been postponed or substituted with desk-based inspections. Several countries, according to the report, have even suspended their decisions to impose monetary penalties on the violators. In fact, some Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) in lower capacity countries are either significantly “reducing their operations” or even “shutting down completely”. There is also reporting of delay or postponement of prosecutions due to suspension of trials and hearings.“There are reports that diversion of law enforcement and security resources to Covid-19 responses in high-risk, poorly resourced countries, may embolden terrorists and terrorist financiers in their activities,” FATF states.While banks worldwide are trying to follow anti-money laundering measures, several countries have flagged that there is increased activity in non-banking sectors like online gambling, the insurance sector, dealers in precious metals and stones and securities, while there is decreased activity in other sectors like real estate and casinos.The movement of migrant workers in various countries – India is one of them – will particularly cause disruption for money value transfer service sector due to confinement measures and company shutdowns.“Should the current economic situation further deteriorate, there is a risk that financial institutions may re-prioritize their AML/CFL efforts and focus on broader prudential and stability measures,” FATF notes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economic-stimulus-by-governments-may-be-exploited-by-terrorists-says-fatf/story-yXL8rwK2Fhz5jRiUrzXAeJ.html
12-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Testing all those returning back pose a challenge to most NE states||Guwahati: The North-East, home to around 3.5% of the country’s population, is staring at a major challenge as thousands of stranded people are set to return to their respective native places amid the Central government’s bid to ease lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Inadequate testing facilities in the entire region, comprising seven states, have become a cause for concern, as most of them are dependent on Assam.The state governments in the region are worried about the daily spike in Covid-19 positive cases from other parts of the country from where the stranded people are trying to return home.Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu sought the Centre’s support in procuring an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved TrueNat machine during Monday’s video-conference that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had convened to seek all the CMs’ feedback on whether to ease or extend lockdown restrictions.TrueNat, which has been used to detect tuberculosis (TB) and also approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO), is a small battery-operated user-friendly machine that can conduct Covid-19 tests and the results are obtained within an hour.Khandu said that the machine is needed for conducting “faster and effective tests amid a rise in interstate travellers entering Arunachal Pradesh”.The CM’s concerns stem from the fact that Arunachal has only one Covid-19 testing laboratory in Naharlagun, whose daily capacity is around 70. The state is completely dependent on neighbouring Assam to test more swab samples.“We expect around 12,000 stranded people to return home and each one of them needs to undergo a Covid-19 test. However, we don’t have the bandwidth to conduct so many tests in such a short span of time. We’re working on setting up another laboratory in the eastern part of the state by end-May to ease the burden on the Naharlagun facility,” said Arunachal health minister Alo Libang.Arunachal has recorded only one Covid-19 positive case to date and the patient has also recovered. But, the remote and the largest state in the north-east could be staring at a healthcare emergency, as thousands of stranded people are expected to return home soon, as concerns are raised about scant testing facilities.Other states in the region are also feeling the heat due to screening and testing inadequacies, as the stranded people are headed home after the government announced the easing of lockdown restrictions.“Around 10,000 people are expected to return to Mizoram and all of them will undergo tests. However, they can’t be tested at one go. Initially, all the returnees will be quarantined and then the tests will be conducted on a priority basis. We’re working overtime to set up more laboratories,” said Mizoram CM Zoramthanga.Mizoram’s lone Covid-19 positive patient, a pastor, has also recovered. So far, the state, which has its lone laboratory in the state capital Aizawl, has conducted only 206 tests.Meghalaya is expecting around 13,000 people to return to the state. Though the state health authorities plan to screen all the returnees, tests will be conducted only on symptomatic patients.Meghalaya, too, had only one laboratory at the North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS) in the state capital, Shillong, till recently. A second laboratory, set up at Tura in the Garo Hills, however, has become functional.“The daily testing capacity at the NEIGRIHMS and Tura is over 200 and below 100, respectively,” said Meghalaya health minister AL Hek.Assam is expecting nearly one lakh people to return home and the state government is pulling out all stops to ramp up its screening and testing facilities. Plans are afoot to allow a staggered entry of returnees in a bid to ensure an effective administrative control.The state government has requisitioned five trains from Indian Railways to bring back stranded migrant workers. The trains will repatriate up to 10,000 people, who have been stranded in Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad, from Tuesday. The trains will run till May 24.Though Assam has seven testing laboratories – the highest in the region – neighbouring states such as Arunachal, Meghalaya and Nagaland are also utilising these facilities.Around 17,000 stranded people from Tripura have registered themselves on the state government portal, seeking to return home at the earliest.Tripura has a single testing laboratory at Agartala’s GB Pant Hospital, and two more are likely to become operational soon. The state government plans to conduct mandatory and random tests on symptomatic and asymptomatic people, respectively.Manipur has two testing laboratories in its state capital Imphal, but the state government is under tremendous pressure, as around 34,000 stranded people are planning to return home soon.Nagaland, which has not registered a single Covid-19 positive case yet, launched a state government-run website on May 7, urging the stranded people to register on the portal if they wish to return home. The registration closed on Monday, and around 18,000 are waiting to come back to Nagaland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-cm-seeks-centre-s-help-in-procuring-covid-19-machines-for-faster-testing/story-2thwmcDFoHmnC4YfMsbmjJ.html

12-05-2020||India||In Pompeo’s 7-nation concall, focus on China over accountability, dependency||At a 75-minute video conference initiated by United States secretary of state Mike Pompeo, foreign ministers of seven countries including India, Israel and South Korea on Monday evening discussed the coronavirus pandemic, its fallout on the world economy and the way ahead.The conference, which is being described as ‘experimental online diplomacy’, also discussed resilience in supply chains, diplomatese for dependence on only one country for supplies. In this case, China.The Trump administration has spoken about plans to move industrial supply chains out of China for some time.Beijing’s handling of the outbreak and the subsequent response appears to have amplified the urgency. As one US official recently described it, the pandemic has turned out to be the ‘perfect storm’ that crystallised the worries that countries have had about dependence on China.Mike Pompeo had alluded to Monday’s video conference on April 29 when he declared that the US government was working with Australia, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Vietnam to “move the global economy forward” and explore restructuring “supply chains to prevent something like this from ever happening again”.Monday’s video conference is seen to be the first big step, joined by India’s Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, Australia’s Marise Payne, Israel’s Yisrael Katz, Japan’s Taro Kono, Brazil’s Ernesto Araújo and South Korea’s Kang Kyung-wha.Also Read: What does the US-China rift mean for the world? | OpinionTo be sure, the video conference wasn’t a single-agenda initiative.Jaishankar tweeted the conversation covered pandemic response, global health management, medical cooperation, economic recovery and travel norms. “Look forward to continuing this engagement,” he said.People familiar with the development told Hindustan Times that more friendly countries were expected to join similar engagements in future.At the Monday conference, they said each country shared its experience in handling the outbreak and how they could help. For instance, Israel talked about the vaccine that it believes is within its grasp, Pompeo about economic recovery.The sentiment was that recovering from this pandemic - which was quite unlike previous virus outbreaks that were limited to particular parts of the world - is going to be a long haul. That the countries should prepare for long-term solutions and cooperation among friendly countries is going to be the essence of any recovery plan.Also Read: ‘Replace China’: India looks to lure more than 1,000 US businessesBut China and its response to the pandemic may have been a recurring theme through the conversation.A US state department readout of the video conference said the foreign ministers had discussed the importance of international cooperation, transparency and accountability in “combating the Covid-19 pandemic and in addressing its causes”.The United States has accused Beijing of suppressing early information about the outbreak of the virus first detected in the central city of Wuhan, and downplaying its risks. Last month, President Donald Trump also announced that Washington would hold back its $ 400 million funding to the World Health Organisation that has been blamed for playing along with Beijing.The US decision to hold back the money - it funded 15% of the WHO’s budget - has spotlighted the role of the World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and ignited calls from other countries for transparency and accountability for the pandemic.State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the seven leaders “also discussed collaboration toward preventing future global health crises and reaffirmed the importance of the rules-based international order.“The rule of law, transparency, and accountability will be key to our shared success,” Pompeo later tweeted. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne’s office also made the same point on transparency, underlining that “learning the lessons of this pandemic are critical to prevent future global health crises”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pompeo-s-7-nation-concall-focus-on-china-over-accountability-dependency/story-sCGISlbjGj0fR1btWAGcyO.html

Ziebart was scanned for coronavirus infection before he got on to the flight around 3 am with 291 other passengers and was found to be healthy. In his self-reporting form Ziebart mentioned T3 as his house and Indira Gandhi International airport as the place of his stay in India, officials said.HT reported on Monday that Ziebart had been living in the airport since March 18, after he arrived in New Delhi from Hanoi as a transit passenger on his way to Istanbul. March 18 was the day India banned all flights to Turkey to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Four days later, India banned all international flights. Stranded, Ziebart could neither exit India, nor the airport’s transit area because he does not have an Indian visa.An airport official indicated that Ziebart, who has not applied for an Indian visa, was unlikely to get one even if he did because of a prior criminal record in Germany.A senior officer from the Delhi airport, who wished not to be named, said Ziebart had told them on Monday that he will leave India soon as a flight is available. “Around 3 am, he boarded a flight KL872. There were total 292 passengers on-board that flight. It was a special flight being operated from Delhi to Amsterdam. Because he was eligible to go to Europe, he was allowed to leave. His tickets cost him around Rs 43,000. He paid for his tickets on his own,” the officer said.In his self reporting form, that has been mandated by the ministry of health and family welfare for all international passengers, Ziebart mentioned Terminal 3 as his house and Delhi’s IGI airport as his place of stay in India. He told the medical staff that he was not feeling fever, coughing or any respiratory disorder, officer added.The Indian authorities had recently served a “Leave India Notice” to Ziebart and he had assured them that he will leave the country soon as a flight is made available, officer said.Last week, Indian authorities had tried to accommodate Ziebart on a relief flight to Ankara, but Turkish authorities refused to accept him on-board since the flight was only for their citizens or permanent card holders. When German embassy officials contacted him and offered him a passage back to his home country, he had declined their offer, a spokesman for the German embassy in New Delhi told HT on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/german-man-living-at-delhi-airport-since-march-18-leaves-for-amsterdam-on-a-relief-flight/story-eJ5KeO9muVS7uxKWPQShiN.html
12-05-2020||India||Maharashtra panel decides to release 50% of prisoners on temporary bail to prevent spread of Covid-19||A high powered committee in Maharashtra has decided to release 50% of the 35,239 prisoners in jails across the state on temporary bail as part of measures to control the spread of Covid-19. The order, which came a week after 184 prisoners at Arthur Road Central Prison in Mumbai tested positive for Covid-19, doesn’t give a timeframe for the release or state which category of prisoners will be sent home.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The committee, headed by Justice AA Sayed and comprising additional chief secretary (home) Sanjay Chahande and director general of prisons SN Pandey, has said due process will be followed and the prisoners being released will have to secure bail.No prisoners either charged or convicted under provisions of special laws, such as the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act (MCOCA) of 1999, the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), will be released on temporary bail because of the coronavirus pandemic.Chahande said, “They (prisoners) will have to get bail. That means the due process of law will have to be followed.” For temporary bail, eligible prisoners will have to approach the concerned court and obtain an order. Parole leave can be secured at the prisons, he said.While deciding to release 50% of the state’s prison population, the committee on Monday rejected a representation by advocate SB Talekar, which contended the decision to not release prisoners charged or convicted under special statutes was discriminatory. Talekar argued that blanket exclusion of the prisoners charged or convicted for offences under the special acts was arbitrary and defeated the thrust of the Supreme Court’s March 23 order to decongest prisons in the wake of the pandemic.“In any event, the prisoners charged/convicted under the special acts including MPID Act cannot claim to be released from prison as of right. It is required to be noted that the offences under MPID Act are against large number of victims who are mostly poor depositors, and whose interests are required to be safeguarded and recoveries made from properties. The MPID Act is enacted to protect the interest of the depositors and the prisoners charged/convicted for offences under the MPID Act cannot be treated as belonging to the same class of prisoners who are to be released on interim bail or parole,” the committee said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The Supreme Court had left it to the discretion of the high powered committee to determine which class or category of prisoners can be released on interim bail or parole, depending on the nature and severity of the offence or any other relevant factor, the Committee said while rejecting Talekar’s representation.The Supreme Court, in its order, said, “We direct that each State/Union Territory shall constitute a High Powered Committee comprising of (I) Chairman of the State Legal Services Committee, (ii) the Principal Secretary (Home/Prison) by whatever designation is known as, (ii) Director General of Prison(s), to determine which class of prisoners can be released on parole or an interim bail for such period as may be thought appropriate.”The apex court had cited an instance and said, “For instance, the State/Union Territory could consider the release of prisoners who have been convicted or are under-trial for offences for which prescribed punishment is up to 7 years or less, with or without fine and the prisoner has been convicted for a lesser number of years than the maximum.” In a subsequent order dated April 13, the Supreme Court clarified it had not directed states or union territories to compulsorily release prisoners from their prisons.Justice BN Srikrishna, former Supreme Court judge said, “If this is what the high-powered committee has stated then it’s absurd. If prisoners have to follow the due process of law, then why was the high-powered committee made. How can the committee distinguish between prisoners booked for special Acts and others. It is like distinguishing between the rich and the poor prisoners. If this is how it is, the Supreme Court has done nothing to fight the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-panel-decides-to-release-50-of-prisoners-on-temporary-bail-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19/story-U2yob9EHSa5TJXai12tHEI.html

12-05-2020||India||Pressure mounts on MP govt, restrictions on Maha border lifted for UP and Bihar labourers||Rising temperature and death of at least 8 migrant workers in the past 20 days have driven Madhya Pradesh government to lift restrictions on the MP-Maharashtra border for labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, officials said.The influx of migrant labourers, about 25,000 per day on an average, has caused worries to the administration. These labourers are covering hundreds of kilometres travelling or walking through the state up to the UP border. Screening such a large number of workers, including the elderly, women and children, is practically not possible, officials said. Hence, this is an immediate casualty but the administration can’t stop them as they become aggressive leading to law and order problems, the officials added.Also read: Migrant worker walking back to Bihar run over by SUV on Ambala highway, killedBijasan and Khetia on MP-Maharashtra border are two entry points for people coming from the Maharashtra side. However, more than 90% of labourers enter the state via Bijasan to get to the Agra-Mumbai highway. Bijasan saw stone-pelting by agitated labourers when they were stopped by the local police on May 3. Many got injured, including at least three police personnel including a sub-inspector. Later, the police lodged an FIR against unidentified 400 migrant labourers for indulging in violence. There have been confrontations between the two sides several times in the past two weeks or so.Bijasan temple trust and the district administration have arranged food and water for the labourers at the temple premises. The village panchayats, which are situated on either side of Agra-Mumbai highway, have been instructed to set up a tent and also arrange food and water for people travelling or trekking through their areas, the officials said.An administrative official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “The restrictions were lifted as pressure was mounting with streams of labourers coming from Maharashtra side including labourers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana too. Whenever we try to stop them they become aggressive and there is a law and order problem. It’s unmanageable when thousands of workers in trucks, mini trucks, loading auto, auto-rickshaws, bicycles and even on foot converge at the border.”The officer said, “Another problem is when we try to stop the labourers they take different routes through the hilly areas and this result in dehydration and deaths in certain cases. Two labourers died on Saturday. In this scenario, proper screening of labourers for coronavirus is almost impossible. In the beginning, when we quarantined people they became aggressive and caused a lot of problems.” Sub-divisional magistrate at Sendhwa Ghanshyam Dhangar said, “The major problem that we are facing is the health of labourers affected by dehydration. Eight people died during the past 20 days. Sendhwa has hilly areas. There is a large number of labourers who trek or pedal bicycles for hundreds of kilometres braving about 40 degree Celsius temperature in Maharashtra itself. By the time they reach the border here they get dehydrated. It’s Ramzan time. There have been at least three deaths when labourers didn’t have water the whole day and continued to walk or pedal bicycles. This led to dehydration and they died.”The SDM said, “So far, we have arranged for labourers, who are walking, to be accommodated in trucks, buses and other vehicles carrying other labourers to Uttar Pradesh. But now we have decided to send such other states’ labourers in our buses to Dewas from where they would be taken to Guna and from there they would be taken to the UP border.”Superintendent of Police, Barwani district DR Teniwar said, “For four to five days we have allowed entry of people given their huge number. About 25,000 people are coming every day.”On Sunday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan issued instructions to district collectors to extend all possible facilities to the labourers like food, water and stay, among others.Chouhan instructed officials, “While trying to understand with full sensitivity the problem of a large number of people travelling on foot, they should be welcomed as guests in the districts and necessary facilities should be provided to them. These kinds of opportunities of service come occasionally in the history of human civilisation. These helpless labourers of other states should be welcomed with an open heart in the heartland of the country.”However, unlike the MP-Maharashtra border, the MP-Gujarat border in Jhabua has not been witnessing an influx of people from Gujarat after more than 25,000 workers on Dahod side, who wanted the border to be opened, were forced by the Gujarat administration to get back to their places on the assurance that they would be sent back to their destinations in trains.Collector, Jhabua district Prabal Sepaha said, “None are coming from the Gujarat side now. As far as people of Madhya Pradesh are concerned, about 1.5 lakh labourers hailing from different parts of Madhya Pradesh have come so far.”However, an administrative official who didn’t want to be named said, “Still there are labourers, though not in a large number, who enter the district through agriculture fields to find their way to Uttar Pradesh via Shivpuri or Datia.”Collector, Shivpuri district Anugraha P said, “About 5,000 people pass through the district on the highway to UP daily. The UP government opens its border at intervals to allow the labourers to enter the state.”Those who are coming from Maharashtra take different routes to UP. While a section of them head to UP via Shivpuri and Datia close to Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. There are groups of workers who prefer entering Uttar Pradesh via Sagar, Chhatarpur and Tikamgarh districts in Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh.Superintendent of Police, Chhatarpur district Kumar Saurabh said, “We have made all the arrangements for labourers like food and water. We send those labourers who are walking in buses up to the UP border.”(With input from Anupam Pateriya in Sagar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pressure-mounts-on-madhya-pradesh-govt-restrictions-on-maha-border-lifted-for-up-and-bihar-labourers/story-R4ZI2Eoq8O7WMhY8nlS7GO.html

He got himself tested on Sunday and was sent to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital in Delhi after it.“However, the doctors at RML prescribed him medicines and advised him to watch for any change of condition and recommended home quarantine,” the official said.Five Air India pilots had earlier tested positive for Covid-19.

12-05-2020||India||Chinese choppers spotted near Ladakh LAC prompt alert, IAF fighters rushed in: Report||After the scuffle between the Chinese People’s Liberation Army troops and Indian troops along the LAC in North Sikkim which led to injuries on both sides, China appears to be continuing on the path of belligerence towards India, this time along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.In what appears to be a multi-front deliberate ploy by China to keep India on its toes, the Indian Air Force was forced to rush its fighter jet patrols in Ladakh after Chinese military choppers were found to be flying close to the Line of Actual Control. This incident happened last week, around the same time the PLA troops and Indian army forces came to blows in the upper reaches of North Sikkim.“The Chinese military helicopters were flying very close to the Line of Actual Control. After their movement was picked up, the Indian Air Force fighter jets flew patrols in the area,” government sources told ANI here.Government sources who requested anonymity due to knowledge of frontline operations, informed that the Chinese choppers did not cross the LAC into Indian territory in that particular area, they said.Also Read: India, China face-off along Sikkim border, several soldiers injuredThe Indian Air Force frequently flies its Sukhoi 30MKI fighter aircraft fleet from Leh air base in Ladakh along with other planes.This latest development comes soon after the Indian security establishment noticed that Pakistani Air Force increased its patrols of F-16S and JF-17s along its Eastern Border with India, especially night sorties, after the Handwara terror attack that led to the death of 5 Indian security personnel. A fear of retaliation by Indian forces was cited as the reason by Indian security establishment sources for this ramping up of PAF air patrols.The Indian Air Force has two main bases in the Ladakh union territory including the Leh and the Thoise airbase where fighter jets are not deployed permanently but detachments from combat aircraft squadrons are operational throughout the year.There have been several occasions in the past when Chinese military helicopters have entered Indian airspace in the Ladakh sector and deliberately left behind tell-tale signs to stake claim on areas which are part of India. The LAC in this location, like in other parts of the India-China border in the country, is poorly demarcated, hence incursions sometimes are inadvertent as well.However, the scuffle with Indian troops in North Sikkim was a new front opened up by China which was a cause for concern. Ever since the outbreak of Covid-19, Chinese President Xi Jinping is under immense pressure to increase transparency in his country and reveal the real origin of the virus, which some have speculated emanated from a lab in China’s Wuhan. Trade wars with countries like USA and Australia have intensified and most multi-national companies have actively begun looking for manufacturing alternative,India being one such preferred destination.Security sources speculated that this could be the reason behind China’s new aggression. Similar muscle flexing was also seen recently when PLA Navy boats entered into disputed waters in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-choppers-spotted-near-ladakh-lac-prompt-alert-iaf-fighters-rushed-in-report/story-25Jr9bsUEPQYPieX39mSKJ.html

And they are leaving in droves from Mumbai, one of the biggest Covid-19 hostspots in the country.Helping them in their endeavours are autorickshaw drivers from Mumbai who are taking the migrant workers to as far as Indore in Madhya Pradesh. The Mumbai-Agra Road that touches Indore through a bypass road, is seeing a steady stream of autorickshaws from the country’s commercial capital.Officials and eye-witnesses put the number of these three-wheelers from Mumbai crossing the Indore Bypass Road at 50 every hour.Mumbai has the highest number of Covid-19 cases for any city in the country and a strict lockdown since late March has taken thousands of autorickshaws and black-and-yellow taxis off the roads there, leaving thousands of drivers and their kin jobless and without adequate cash in hand.“I have been driving an autorickshaw in Mumbai for the past 12 years. But everything is closed there now. I spent two months digging into my savings but that, too, has run out. I have no choice but to return to my village,” 54-year-old Baleshwar Yadav, who is returning to his native village in Jharkhand, told news agency PTI. He had eight people, including two women and three children, crammed into his three-wheeler.Many of them are not sure when they will return to Mumbai. “There was no food in Mumbai due to lack of work. We will think of returning to the city later,” said Ajay Yadav (36), hailing from Jaunpur district in Uttar Pradesh.Deputy Superintendent of Police (Traffic) Umakant Chaudhary said autorickshaws were being allowed to pass only after those inside are subjected to medical screening when they enter the border of Madhya Pradesh.“We have been seeing a sizeable number of autorickshaws from Mumbai on the Indore Bypass Road over the last one week. We have also received information that some drivers are charging people to transport them to their native places in other states,” the officer said.The migrants are also riding back home on their bicycles. And some of them live as far as Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh or Kalahandi in Odisha.“Traveling by a truck packed with people will cost me over Rs 3,500, bus journey will cost twice as much. And I have only Rs 700 in my pocket,” said 27-year-old Ramjeevan Nishad, who left Nallasopara to reach Vaisand after a journey of 80 kilometres.He is part of a group of dozen whose destination is Gorakhpur, which is 1,600 km away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/autorickshaws-bicycles-how-migrants-are-covering-1-600-km-mumbai-gorakhpur-journey/story-a5M9rD7sQlp2GsWLn2q1NI.html

It said in new guidelines released on Monday 200 people will be tested at health facilities in each of India’s 733 districts every week to check whether they have or have had Covid-19.The guidelines have been sent to all districts, which will now need to select 10 health facilities – of these six need to be run by the state – where certain sets of people will be put to swab as well as blood tests.The swab tests identify a concurrent infection while the blood tests can detect if a person has previously had the infection and is now fighting or has fought it off.“There is a need to establish systematic surveillance for Sars-CoV-2 infection in all districts of the country. This surveillance will be in addition to the routine testing as per current testing guidelines,” the document titled ‘District level facility based surveillance for Covid-19’ said.The ministry did not specify when the protocol will be put into place.More than four million people have contracted the coronavirus disease and 286,330 people have died across the world, according to the Covid-19 tracker of Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-covid-19-tally-breaches-70-000-mark-3-604-cases-in-last-24-hours/story-yyNOxjnAfDP5b6yN58y78L.html

12-05-2020||India||I still feel I’m in the truck, says driver who spent 47 days in his vehicle due to lockdown||A truck driver from Uttarakhand spent more than 40 days in his vehicle due to the nationwide lockdown before reaching his home district Champawat.He reached Champawat after 47 days on Saturday where the administration put him under home quarantine for 14 days.Sunil Kumar is a resident of Munch area and has been working for a transport company based in Delhi for the last six years.According to Sunil, he was stuck in the lockdown and spent 40 days and nights in his truck near the Rajasthan border.“I left for Hyderabad from Delhi on March 22. When I reached Shahpura area near Delhi-Rajasthan border on March 23, I was stranded there due to imposition of lockdown,” said Kumar.“Rajasthan Police didn’t allow me to proceed and Delhi Police didn’t allow me to go back. So I had nowhere to go. So I decided to wait in the truck itself. We keep a stove and ration for a few days in our truck. I cooked food in the truck and later bought food items from a grocery shop nearby,” he said.Kumar said waiting for such a long time was very difficult. “The difference of day and night didn’t seem to matter anymore. Sometimes I would spend my nights by counting stars. I was hoping that lockdown would end on April 24 and then I will be able to go home or Hyderabad. But it was extended further and so did my difficulties,” said Sunil.Kumar said he faced many problems while being stuck in the truck. He said he could not charge his mobile phone after some time and so couldn’t talk to his family members.“Somehow I managed to spend 40 days and 40 nights in my truck. It was a very difficult time. Weird thoughts would cross my mind. I missed my family, especially my pregnant wife. There were times when I thought if I would someday reach my home or not,” he said.Kumar said that finally when the lockdown was relaxed and commercial vehicles like trucks were allowed to ply on May 3, he left for Delhi and reached there on May 5.“In Delhi, I left my truck in my transport office. I registered for return on the website of my state government. My health screening was conducted and I boarded a bus for Uttarakhand. With the help of the authorities from my state, I finally reached Champawat, my home district on the morning of May 9,” he said.“Here, the local authorities quarantined me in a shelter house and took my sample for the coronavirus test. When my report came negative on Sunday, they sent me for home quarantine for 14 days,” he said.“I am feeling very happy that I am finally home. Now I will go to Delhi only after my wife delivers the baby.

In an order issued on Monday, the ministry said services of medical and paramedical staff are urgently required in meeting the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. The MHA asked all state and Union territory governments to ensure that their field officials allow smooth movement of all medical professionals, nurses, paramedical, sanitation personnel and ambulances, and ensure the opening of all private clinics nursing homes and labs with all the medical professional and staff.“...Furthermore the existing staff, apart from this duty, also have to render normal responsibilities, such as conducting immunisation programmes, Handling the onset of vector and other seasonal diseases, and meeting other non-Covid emergencies etc,” the letter said.There have been many complaints from healthcare workers about local authorities and police not allowing free movement during the ongoing lockdown.The letter signed by home secretary Ajay Bhalla says at many places, private clinics and nursing homes are also reported to have not been allowed to open.“The functioning of these medical facilities, which supplement the regular medical infrastructure, and relieve the burden on hospitals, is also crucial. I would urge all states and UTS to ensure that such clinics and nursing homes continue to function without any hindrances,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-tells-states-to-allow-free-movement-of-healthcare-workers/story-WnIRUh0EImTncvuu9WPr9L.html

Kumar cited the examples of Chennai and Delhi and said that vegetable sellers, who have remained unsampled in the state, were found to be the super spreaders in those places.In view of the risen in the number of Covid-19 cases among the migrants, who arrived in the state during the lockdown, the principal secretary directed DMs to sample migrants, high-risk people and vegetable sellers from Tuesday.The DMs have, however, been told to restrict the sampling to 50 so that their testing could be processed in 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vegetable-sellers-under-focus-for-covid-19-sampling-in-bihar/story-CaVgoXJokUb2uhOihdzuQM.html

12-05-2020||India||With Mamata hitting out at Centre during meeting with Modi, TMC-BJP verbal duel intensifies||The war of words between Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) intensified on Monday after the West Bengal chief minister’s outburst against the Centre during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with chief ministers.Both parties sharpened attacks on each other, with the TMC targeting PM Modi for an ill-planned lockdown and late response to the Covid-19 situation and the BJP hitting out at the state government for not doing enough during the coronavirus pandemic and “a collapse of the administration.”“The PM held no meeting with the chief ministers before announcing the lockdown. The centre thought they could handle the situation in 15 days and would then alone take the credit of it all,” Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief, was heard saying in a video clip released by the party. “Meetings with chief ministers are being held before announcing the second and third phase lockdown because the situation is not in control. Why didn’t they think of and plan for the migrant workers before announcing the lockdown?” Abhishek Banerjee asked.“There are apprehensions about the fallout of letting long-distance trains run. They Centre should provide all with more clarity,” TMC secretary-general and state education minister Partha Chatterjee said.He, too, alleged that BJP was busy playing politics when the focus should have been on putting up a unit fight against Covid-19.Mamata Banerjee had hit out at Centre in the afternoon during the video-conference with Modi, alleging it was trying to gain political mileage at the expense of the state government.“We as a state doing our best to combat the virus. The Centre should not play politics in this crucial time. We are surrounded by international borders and other bigger states and have challenges to deal with… All the states should be given equal importance and we should work together as Team India,” she said adding that the federal structure should be respected.In the evening, BJP leaders targeted the state government of minority appeasement, mismanagement over bringing migrant workers back, implementing a lax lockdown and failure in managing the public distribution system.“The Centre is not playing politics. The Centre had to intervene because the state was failing its people. The state played hide and seek with data and the real Covid-19 scenario, let the lockdown be easily violated, corrupted the public distribution system and also wanted to leave the migrant workers at lurch,” BJP’s state unit president Dilip Ghosh said.“In every case, the state acted after the Centre intervened. The government has failed in most critical aspects – health and home affairs – and both portfolios are held by the chief minister,” Ghosh added.“It’s not a time for politics. It’s a national crisis and the time is for uniting under the leadership of the prime minister and fight Covid-19,” BJP national executive member Mukul Roy said.All senior leaders of the West Bengal unit of the BJP, including central observers Kailash Vijayvargiya, Shiv Prakash and Arvind Menon, Union ministers Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri and members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, also took digs at the Mamata Banerjee government for utmost failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-mamata-hitting-out-at-centre-during-meeting-with-modi-tmc-bjp-verbal-duel-intensifies/story-gD6MgxhU5gOVLUPasHidiO.html

He said that the nearly 1,900 Tablighis and 500 people who had attended the Urs at a dargah in Rajasthan’s Ajmer were behind the second wave of the virus as they had entered the cities “like thieves”.Questioning why so-called intellectuals and community leaders were not chiding the actions of Tablighis and Ajmeris, Ravikumar said that those assaulting ASHA workers and other Covid-19 warriors should be given the strictest punishment.Responding to a question on both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa’s statements that the spread of virus should not be identified with any particular community, the BJP MLC responded saying that the stand of the party and government need not be the same.Fourteen new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in Karnataka on Monday, even as data revealed that 76 per cent of the total 862 Covid-19 infections in the state are asymptomatic.“As of 5:00 PM on May 11, cumulatively 862 Covid-19 positive cases have been confirmed in the state, it includes 31 deaths and 426 discharges,” the health department said in its bulletin.It said, out of 404 active cases, 395 patients are in isolation at designated hospitals and are stable, while nine are in ICU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-lawmaker-blames-tablighis-for-the-spread-of-covid-19-in-karnataka/story-iLlAWwIvYsv45oK0O5BsLN.html

The internet speed shall, however, remain restricted to 2G only across the Union Territory. It shall be effective from May 12,” the J-K administration said in an order.The services were snapped after top Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo and another terrorist was killed by security forces.Internet services were suspended in J-K in August last year after the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.

FAC asks power ministry||The environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) has deferred its decision on two contentious projects --- Etalin Hydropower Project of 3,097 MW in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, and the exploration of uranium in Telangana’s Amrabad Tiger Reserve.As per minutes of FAC’s meeting on April 23 uploaded on the Parivesh website late on Monday, FAC has sought comments from the power ministry on the Etalin Hydropower Project in view of the following:a) The project is delayed by six years and the country’s energy plan may have changedb) A large number of hydro-electric projects are pending due to environmental and forest clearance concernsc) Tariff structure of the project was already high when proposed in 2014.FAC has asked the power ministry to comment whether the project in its current form is viable. It has also directed Arunachal Pradesh to submit a cost-benefit analysis of the project.Earlier this month, several scientists and wildlife biologists wrote to FAC, warning about the massive loss of biodiversity if Etalin Hydropower Project was allowed to come up. Twenty-six scientists from 16 scientific institutions also flagged that a Wildlife Institute of India report on the biodiversity of Dibang Valley (based on which the Etalin Hydropower Project would be assessed) has several “scientific biases” and doesn’t reflect a true picture of the biodiversity of Dibang Valley, where the Etalin Hydropower Project of 3097 MW is planned.But FAC said the representations it got are all similar in content and add no new value or findings.The Etalin Hydropower Project will involve clearing of at least 270,000 trees in sub-tropical evergreen and rain forests and in a vital tiger area.The project is proposed to be developed by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited (JPL). The total cost of the project is about Rs 25,296.95 crore, according to FAC factsheet. When HT contacted JPL on May 5 about the biodiversity footprint of the project, a JPL senior executive said the company didn’t want to comment. On the uranium exploration in Amrabad Tiger Reserve, FAC said it wants a clear view from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-etalin-hydropower-project-financially-viable-fac-asks-power-ministry/story-U3Rj1nO8Kc94mymHAqAS4L.html
12-05-2020||India||‘Don’t bulldoze federal structure,’ Mamata Banerjee tells PM Modi||At Monday’s video conference of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee complained that “some union ministers were playing politics”, alleged “discrimination against people of Bengal” and that the state was being targeted by the Centre. She also asked the Centre not to charge migrants train fare to return home, sought 6% of national GDP for health and an immediate moratorium on repayment of loans and interest by the state and demanded that the states be allowed to borrow from the Reserve Bank at the repo rate. However, the focus of her speech, as revealed to journalists by her party Trinamool Congress (TMC), was politics in times of a pandemic. She said that the Centre was always welcome to send letters but objected to the way the communications had been leaked to the media.“I respect Mr. Amit Shah. Last time also he spoke about West Bengal and I could not counter him because I was not given a chance. But, why did Mr. Amit Shah need to write a letter and send that to the press? After it was out in the news, people were asking me. What am I supposed to do? Why don’t you speak to us directly? I request this must not happen to other states,” Banerjee said.“I don’t feel good saying this but why this discrimination against people of Bengal? Why letters are being sent to the media with rampant accusations?” she asked.“When something happens in Gujarat or an ordinance is declared to snatch away the rights of the labourers in Uttar Pradesh, why don’t you question them? Why are you targeting Bengal and its people by sending notices?” she added.Her outburst came following a string of criticism by the Centre on a wide range of issues about the handling of Covid-19 situation in Bengal. Over the past few weeks, the state faced criticism from the ministry of health, the union home ministry, the ministry of railways and the inter-ministerial central teams that visited the state. “I appeal to you to trust the state. This is not the time for ideological battle,” Banerjee told PM Modi during the videoconferencing. “My only humble request is don’t bulldoze the federal structure.”She also alleged that the Centre had “no fixed planning about the post-lockdown phase” and that meetings were being held after the Centre had already taken decisions.“We are together in this crisis; there should be no finger-pointing at states who are reporting higher numbers because it’s neither their fault nor their people’s fault.”Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued to attack Banerjee’s government. On Monday, all senior leaders of Bengal BJP, including Kailash Vijayvargiya, union ministers Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri, used social media to attack the Bengal government for alleged minority appeasement even in times of a pandemic, mismanagement over brining migrant workers back, implementing a lax lockdown and failure in managing the public distribution system.“Centre is not playing politics. Centre had to intervene because the state was failing its people. The state played hide and seek with data and the real Covid-19 scenario, let the lockdown be easily violated, corrupted the public distribution system and also wanted to leave the migrant workers at lurch. In every case, the state acted after the Centre intervened. The home and health departments proved to be utmost failure and both portfolios are held by the chief minister,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-bulldoze-federal-structure-mamata-banerjee-tells-pm-modi/story-V2h9ovxgmOUOyogCQpbDdP.html

12-05-2020||India||Kerala to tighten norms as returning immigrants threaten to foil state’s Covid-19 track record||Kerala which is maintaining a successful disease-management protocol has decided to strengthen its tracing and quarantine norms as immigrants from the Middle-East and people stranded in other parts of the country started flocking to the state in large numbers.Among the Gulf returnees, seven people had tested positive so far and more flights are expected in the coming days. On Monday, the state reported seven new Covid-19 cases, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office said. Out of 7, four are people who returned from Mumbai, one from Chennai and another returned from Kuwait (earlier six others who returned from the middle-eastern countries had tested positive). Out of 519 Covid-19 positive cases, 489 have recovered and 27 active cases are there, his office said.With train services expected to resume in a couple of days the state is expecting more cases. It has tweaked its policies and has given strict instructions to district administrations to enforce track, trace and treat protocol ruthlessly. People with minor symptoms or those who come from red zones will have to undergo strict protocols to contain a possible third bout of infection, said health officials.Kerala is the first state to have reported a coronavirus case in the country in January, when a Wuhan-returned medical student had tested positive.The second stage of infection occurred in the first week of March when some super spreaders returned from foreign countries and transmitted the disease to many others.The state pressed the emergency button as the exodus of expatriates from middle-eastern countries and people from other states began. People coming from red zones will have to undergo mandatory 14-day home quarantine and if they show slight symptoms they will be moved to hospitals and PCR tests will have to be done, said health ministry officials. In each area a nodal officer will be appointed for a section of people under quarantine and it is his/her duty to monitor them with the help of other health officials regularly. Local police officers will have to help him.Though the state was vociferous on stranded immigrants there is a complaint that it did not do much to students and others stranded in other parts of the country-- after it became a big issue it was forced to write to the Railways and north Indian states to help run special trains for them. The opposition and rights activists alleged that it was a “deliberate ploy to keep the state records intact”.“Around 350 special trains were run in the country and not a single one came to the state. Sad that in building up a public relations exercise the CM conveniently has forgotten his own people stranded in many parts of the country,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. He said hundreds of people were stranded along state borders after the government insisted on passes from the originating destination. But the ruling CPI(M) said the opposition was playing “cheap politics” during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-tighten-norms-as-returning-immigrants-threaten-to-foil-state-s-covid-19-track-record/story-01esW0yG4IxYQYvFZRmsEL.html
12-05-2020||India||States cannot exploit labourers: Rahul Gandhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday opposed amendments to labour laws put in place by some state governments, including in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)- ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, saying the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cannot be made an excuse to exploit workers and suppress their voices.“Many states are amending labour laws. We are together fighting against corona, but this cannot be an excuse to crush human rights, allow unsafe workplaces, exploit workers and suppress their voice. There cannot be any compromise on these basic principles,” Gandhi wrote in a Twitter post.Eight political parties had earlier written to President Ram Nath Kovind protesting against the changes to labour laws, including extending the daily working hours from eight to 12 in six states. After the face-off between the government and the opposition over the return of migrant workers to their homes, the new labour laws have emerged as another contentious issue.BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, two states with substantial workforces, have frozen major labour laws, except basic ones, in the hope that businesses will recoup from the blow of the Covid-19 pandemic and create more jobs on a net basis.The changes give industries more flexibility in hiring and firing employees, determining their wages, and reducing their liabilities in terms of providing employee benefits. Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said it was a shame that BJP-ruled states were amending labour laws under the cover of a pandemic to lure foreign investors. He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deny permission to states amending labour laws in an attempt to “strip workers of their basic rights”.“This is yet another shocking but unsurprising blow to workers and labourers by BJP governments. If the Prime Minister has a little concern for workers and labourers, then he should himself tell these states to not go ahead with amending labour laws and not allow them in doing so. We would expect the prime minister to intervene today itself,” Gohil told reporters through video conferencing.He said it was “shocking and heart-breaking” that when the entire nation is dealing with an unprecedented pandemic, which has disproportionately ravaged the lives of the poor, the BJP governments had used the outbreak as opportunity to deprive them of their rights.“This is shameful and once again highlights the true nature and priorities of this ‘Suit-Boot ki Sarkar’,” the Congress leader said.Gohil said as the labour laws were in the Concurrent List so they cannot be suspended without the explicit approval of the central government.“We, therefore, ask the Prime Minister to deny any permission that strip workers of their basic rights and have the potential of diminishing their livelihood. We also ask that trade unions be consulted before such an adverse step is taken,” he said.Gohil alleged that labourers and migrants were already getting inhuman treatment in the wake of the post-Covid lockdown.“We have all seen the visuals of lakhs of our brothers and sisters attempting to make the arduous journey home without any state support, any food or medicines, left to fend for themselves by an uncaring and apathetic government,” he said.To be sure, 90% of India’s workforce, which is employed in the informal sector, won’t be affected by these changes, which apply to those who are in the organised workforce and registered companies.Former union minister Jairam Ramesh also said it would be dangerous and disastrous to loosen labour, land and environment laws in the name of economic revival and stimulus.“In the name of economic revival and stimulus, it will be dangerous and disastrous to loosen labour, land and environmental laws and regulations as the Modi govt is planning. The first steps have already been taken. This is a quack remedy like demonetisation,” he tweeted.BJP spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said labour law reforms is a long standing demand of unions and industries both. “As it is in concurrent list, Centre had earlier consolidated 40 existing laws into 4 codes to streamline compliance and help formalisation of labour force. Now some state governments are working for further streamlining the functioning of the industry and help restart the economic cycle. These amendments are for the benefit of the economy as a whole including workers,” he said.Agarwal said, “The focus of the governments has shifted towards economic revival and they are doing what is needed. Putting a spanner in the effort is completely uncalled for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-cannot-exploit-labourers-rahul/story-QOvUHmMMXQou0561ZERU9N.html
12-05-2020||India||Rush for tickets, guidelines issued for passenger trains||Passengers boarding special trains will have to arrive at stations at least 90 minutes before their journeys begin and are advised to carry their own food, the government said in fresh guidelines on Monday, a day before the gradual resumption of the services connecting New Delhi and 15 other cities after a gap of nearly two months.Indian Railways also released a timetable for these trains, which will run only with air-conditioned (AC) coaches and have full seating capacity, and specified the stoppages they will make.Bookings began at 6pm after a two-hour delay due to technical issues. The railway ministry regretted the “inconvenience”, and said data on the special trains was “being fed” into the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website.By 9.15pm, about 30,000 PNRs (passenger name records) were generated and reservations were issued to over 54,000 passengers, a railway ministry official said. It was not immediately clear how many tickets were on offer.In the fresh guidelines, the railways encouraged passengers to download the Aarogya Setu app for effective contact tracing and follow social distancing both at stations and in trains.“The passengers shall reach the station at least 90 minutes in advance to facilitate thermal screening at the station. Only passengers who are found asymptomatic (not showing symptoms of Covid-19) will be permitted to travel,” the guidelines said.Despite lockdown curbs, passengers with valid tickets will not need any additional pass to travel to railway stations. “For movement of passenger(s) as well as the driver of the vehicle transporting the passenger(s) to and fro the Railway Station shall be allowed on the basis of the confirmed e-ticket,” the guidelines said.No stalls or booths on platforms will open. Vending activity will not be permitted even as the guidelines advised passengers to “travel light”.Other major guidelines pertained to ticket bookings and cancellations.Passengers will have to book general category tickets online — on the IRCTC website and on its app. A few reservation counters will be opened for HOR (high official requisition) holders, freedom fighters, and sitting and former lawmakers, among others.The fare structure will be similar to that in the premium Rajdhani trains, and the special trains will have first, second and third AC classes. Tickets can be booked a maximum of seven days in advance, and only confirmed tickets can be bought online. RAC (Reservation against cancellation), waiting list tickets and tickets issued on board will not be allowed.Online cancellation will be permitted up to 24 hours before scheduled departure, and the cancellation charge shall be 50% of the fare. The guidelines also said the “provision for prepaid meal booking, e-catering shall be disabled”, but dry, ready-to-eat food and bottled water will be available on board at a price.“Information to this effect shall be made available to passengers during time of booking ticket. Passengers are encouraged to carry their own food and drinking water,” the guidelines said. Passengers will be given hand sanitizer at stations but will not receive blankets and linen provided by the railways on board. The government has decided to resume passenger train services, prohibited since March 22, connecting New Delhi with Dibrugarh (Assam), Agartala (Tripura), Howrah (West Bengal), Patna (Bihar), Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Secunderabad (Telangana), Bengaluru (Karnataka), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala), Madgaon (Goa), Mumbai Central (Maharashtra), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Jammu Tawi (Jammu and Kashmir).While trains travelling from New Delhi to Secunderabad and back will have the least number of stoppages (three), those going to Dibrugarh and coming back will have the most (12). Trains to Mumbai Central and back will stop at four places on their way; those going to Chennai Central will have six stoppages.The rail network of India would run nearly 14,000 passenger trains and ferry 23 million passengers a day — before the lockdown was imposed on March 25 to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The first train to run after the gap of 51 days — the first such break in the 167-year history of the railways — will begin its journey from New Delhi for Bilaspur at 4pm on Tuesday.On arrival, passengers will have to follow the health protocols put in place by the destination state/Union Territory.The guidelines said zonal railways have been instructed to ensure that there are separate entry and exit gates at stations to the extent possible so as to avoid face-to-face movement of passengers.“Zonal railways will be guided by standard social distancing guidelines on stations and trains and observe the safety, security and hygiene protocols. Passengers are advised to carry their own linen for the travel. The temperature inside AC coaches shall be suitably regulated for this purpose,” the guidelines said. The Thiruvananthapuram division of the Southern Railways said it is ready to resume passenger services. “We are all set for it...Our first priority is to check a possible spread (of the coronavirus) and we will do everything possible for this. After every trip, we will disinfect the entire train before the next run,” said VC Sudeesh, senior divisional commercial manager.Others said they are making all possible steps to ensure smooth travel for passengers. “We are making adequate arrangements so that both outgoing and inbound passengers do not face any difficulties, and the entire process is hassle-free. Adequate security personnel and railway staff will be deployed at the platforms to help the passengers,” said I Khan, the divisional railway manager of Howrah.(with inputs from HTC in Kerala and Kolkata)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rush-for-tickets-guidelines-issued-for-passenger-trains/story-g86A9r9I7xROtKyJzoOYaM.html
12-05-2020||India||347 new cases take Gujarat tally to 8,542||On Monday, Gujarat reported 347 positive cases of Covid-19, taking the toll of affected people to 8542.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), said that these cases were reported from Ahmedabad (268), Vadodra (29), Surat (19 )and the rest from other districts.“Twenty deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. A total of 2780 have been discharged. Conditions of 5218 people are stable and 31 are on ventilator. The graph of discharged people is improving and deaths are also reducing day by day. 1616471 tests have been done so far,” Ravi said.The Gujarat government on Monday also launched India’s first hot air seam sealing machine, which makes the personal protective equipment (PPE ) kit used for the protection of such doctors-paramedical staff completely secure with specialised tape.Chief minister Vijay Rupani lauded a Rajkot based company for preparing this machine. “The initiative of protecting the PPE kits with hot air seam sealing tape, which provides 100% protection against the transmission of the virus to the doctors and health workers, who are currently engaged in the treatment of Covid-19, is really appreciable,” the CM said in an official statement issued by the state government.He added that the PPE kit is prepared by a sewing needle which is about 2mm thick and thread that is 0.5mm thick. As a result, if the infected patient’s blood or fluid enters the kit through tiny apertures left on the kit, the doctor-paramedical staff treating the infected patients may also be infected. By using this machine, the holes left in the sewing process in the PPE kit are sealed using specialised tape to make the PPE kit water and air proof to resist the virus.“There is not enough availability of such hot air seam sealing machine in the country so it has to be imported from abroad. The cost of such a machine imported from China or Korea is Rs 7 to Rs 8 lakh and delivery time is 12-13 weeks. In just a short span of 20 days, a team of 100 workers have given Rajkot the pride of manufacturing the first hot air seam sealing machine in India with 80% in-house parts,” Rupani said.Dr Parthiv Mehta, pulmonologist-intensivist said that this machine would be very useful for the corona warriors. “Through this machines kits are sealed using specialised tape making it air proof and reducing chances of leakage,” he said.The Gujarat government also launched the third phase of Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyan (SSJA) in order to provide employment opportunities to the workers and labourers amid the national lockdown.Providing details of the work under SSJA, Ashwani Kumar, secretary to the chief minister, said that 3463 gram panchayats have started 18,824 works  under MNREGA, thereby providing employment to 3, 04,756 labourers and workers. “This includes 37, 519 workers from Bhavnagar, 33,800 from Narmada, 20,821 from Chhota Udepur, 20,168 from Dahod, 20,041 from Panchmahal in addition to workers from the 3463 gram panchayats. The administration is ensuring welfare of the workers in addition to following safety protocols,” he said.Kumar said the Gujarat Government has successfully sent more than 5.5 lakh migrant labourers to their respective states through 209 labour trains. The district administration of Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara all contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/347-new-cases-take-guj-tally-to-8-542/story-M2SDxbPzIfzbka4A9ZzXhI.html
12-05-2020||India||PM Modi, CMs not in favour of lifting lockdown entirely||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that states will have greater say in determining the extent of restrictions and relaxations after May 17, within a broad national framework while underlining that India faced two challenges— reducing the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and resuming public activity gradually. He also emphasised that social distancing remains the “biggest weapon” against the virus till a vaccine is found, and suggested that the lockdown may not be lifted entirely.In his fifth interaction with chief ministers on the pandemic, according to participants at the meeting, PM Modi said India now had a good sense of the spread of the disease; urged states to carefully examine specific geographical areas to come up with a road map for the next phase of lockdown; highlighted the importance of green zones in restarting economic activity; underlined that the full resumption of rail travel would not be possible; pointed out that India will have to use technology in imparting education; and, more broadly, spoke about how the pandemic will change the world, just as the world wars did; and the new principle of life would be “jan se lekar jag tak” (from an individual to the whole of humanity).Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn the backdrop of migrant workers returning home, Modi also emphasised that this will create challenges at two ends — states from where the migrants have left will have labour shortages, and their home states will have to accommodate them economically while preventing the spread of the disease in rural areas. Over six hours, all chief ministers got an opportunity to speak — on the extension of the lockdown (opinion was divided among the CMs but the majority view was continuing it in containment zones while relaxing it elsewhere); the issue of migrant workers (the dominant concern was the possibility of returning workers spreading the disease); the authority of the states in decision-making (most states sought more autonomy in declaring red, orange and green zones), the resumption of train services (several CMs saw this as an unwise move); and the financial support states now need in the battle against the pandemic. The most stringent criticism of the Centre came from West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHome minister Amit Shah also spoke at the meeting, emphasising the importance of the Aarogya Setu app in tracking the disease. In his welcome remarks, according to an official statement, Modi said there was now a clear sense of the geographical spread of the pandemic in India, including the worst affected areas. “Moreover, over the past few weeks, officials have understood operating procedures in a time such as this, right up to the district level.” This understanding, he said, will help the country in having a focused strategy.“We have a twofold challenge — to reduce the transmission rate of the disease, and to increase public activity gradually, while adhering to all the guidelines, and we will have to work towards achieving both these objectives,” he said.Modi, according to one of the meeting participants cited above, said that the Centre will decide on future strategy based on consultations with the states, and the states will have to lead the fight. “He said that they will have to decide what new systems have to be in place — but while keeping in mind that the lockdown was the biggest weapon we have till a vaccine is found.”  Also Read: Covid-19 crisis: Govt’s stimulus package on anvilHe asked the CMs to sit with their teams and decide which areas they wanted to keep under a lockdown by May 15; draw a map based on it and provide the logic behind it; and after May 17, the Centre would act accordingly. “Needs are changing in all phases, and so gradual changes are going to happen. We will incorporate the changes that you suggest,” the PM told the CMs, according to the participant quoted above. The PM indicated that it would not be possible to end the lockdown entirely since there was a need to be alert. “The lockdown is the only way to deal with the virus. But states can modify according to their needs. From May 18, states will decide but there will be a set of common things nationwide.”A key issue that Modi addressed was of migrant workers. In his welcome remarks earlier in the day, he mentioned how the government had urged people to stay where they were — but people wanted to return home and that was “human nature”. “We have to make sure it doesn’t spread and go to villages, that’s our big challenge,” he said. In his final remarks, the PM returned to the theme and pointed out that the exit of workers will create a dual challenge. The first was for states that had seen workers leave. “These places are facing a huge labour shortage and so they have to devise a strategy as to how to restart their industry.” The second was for their home states. “The states which they are returning to have their own challenge. They didn’t have jobs and that’s why these people had left. They now have an economic challenge and also the threat of disease. How to deal with workers, how to motivate them to return to work, these are all concerns which we have to fix.”Modi also emphasised the next set of tasks — restarting economic activity; ensuring that there were no new diseases which spread during monsoon and the need for states to keep their non-Covid hospitals ready; modelling the education system using technology and conducting exams in a manner in which students did not lag behind; and thinking of ways to develop Indian tourist spots at a time when tourism the world over had stopped, to be able to take advantage of post-Covid tourism. At a time when passenger rail services have been resumed — albeit to a limited degree — and in response to CMs such as Bihar’s Nitish Kumar who expressed concerns that this will lead to the spread of the disease, the PM underlined that not all rail services will be resumed. “We can’t start all passenger trains at the same time. But we have started some limited trains like Rajdhani, which has few stations or is linked to the economic chain. Starting all is not a good idea.” Also Read: Govt plans random testing for community surveillanceAmong the CMs, the strongest criticism of the Centre came from Mamata Banerjee, who accused the government of playing politics. According to a second participant who attended the meeting, Banerjee said, “We as a state are doing our best to combat the virus. The Centre should not play politics in this crucial time; all states should be given equal importance.’’ She waved papers, and claimed that every half-an-hour, a letter came from the Centre giving directions, and every second day, a central team arrived. “Don’t we have any work other than running behind those teams? We are not a small state but one of the bigger states.”But the general theme of the meeting was the pandemic and the lockdown, with styles outlining their own experiences and challenges and views on what needed to be done next. Most states wanted the lockdown in the most affected zones, while greater relaxations elsewhere. Delhi, on lines of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s demand on May 3, said that the lockdown should continue in containment zones — but lifted elsewhere. Rajasthan too wanted the lockdown only in containment zones, with the decision to be left to the states. MP sought strict compliance of the lockdown in infected areas and relaxations in other areas. Karnataka wanted the lockdown to be strictly implemented in containment zones, no international or domestic air travel but resumption of public transport in non-containment zones. Both Punjab and Haryana asked that states be allowed to decide on red, orange and green zones, and containment areas. Maharashtra wanted a caution over lifting the lockdown, on the grounds that the cases were projected to rise by end of May — it also asked for additional deployment of security forces. Bihar sought an extension of the lockdown till May 31 in the meeting — and followed it up with a decision to the effect later at night. Kerala asked for easing of norms in green and orange zones. Also Read: Ensure medical workers travel unhindered: CentreBut besides the lockdown, states also expressed their views on other issues. Bihar and UP expressed concerns about the returning migrant workers and the challenges they posed on both the health and the economic front, while Maharashtra and Haryana urged migrant workers to stay back. Odisha, Chattisgarh, Telengana, and Bihar expressed apprehensions about the resumption of limited passenger rail services. So did Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, who warned about the possibility of community spread if trains were made operational without consulting states and its registration data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-cms-not-in-favour-of-lifting-lockdown-entirely/story-fBYTwOzxyqjzV0MZO957MP.html
12-05-2020||India||Govt defends changes in discharge policy||The Union health ministry defended on Monday its decision to drastically change the discharge policy for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) last week by saying that unless patients had a severe disease or were vulnerable, they do not need to obtain a negative test before they can be freed.“The discharge policy has been changed based on the current evidence-based trend world over. In many countries the discharge approach has changed from test-based strategy to symptom or time based strategy,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry at the daily government briefing on the crisis.“In ICMR’s lab surveillance data also that was recently reviewed it was found that RT-PCR positive patients turn negative usually after 10 days. There are other recent studies that say viral load also peaks in the pre-symptomatic period, which is two days before onset of symptoms and in next seven days starts going down. The new discharge policy was drafted keeping these trends in mind. It is meant only for patients who tested positive through RT-PCR test,” he added.The earlier criteria for discharging RT-PCR positive were that chest radiograph (image) was clear, and two consecutive negative test results on RT-PCR.At the briefing, the information and technology ministry said the government is using mobile phone tower data of migrants to trace their movement.Tower data before and during the lockdown has been analysed to trace movement of migrants, and Bihar has successfully used the mechanism to trace people from various metros to their homes in Bihar. The government said similar requests have come in from Odisha, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-defends-changes-in-discharge-policy/story-Z6k4RTgCghYdxWYTsyaUML.html
12-05-2020||India||States relax some curbs as lockdown nears deadline||Rajasthan became the first state to allow free movement of people within the state between 7 am and 7 pm, except in containment zones, as states began relaxing norms a week before the third phase of the federal lockdown draws towards its scheduled end on May 17. “No pass will be required for interdistrict and within district movement of people between 7 am and 7 pm except in areas under curfew,” announced chief minister Ashok Gehlot after a meeting with legislators and members of Parliament.Gehlot authorised the district and subordinate officers to issue passes to people to travel by bus or train to other states and containment zones. Earlier, the state home department had this power. The new travel guideline also made a 14 day quarantine mandatory for any person entering the state. The guidelines also allowed district officers to give permission to run industries.While the Telangana government has extended the lockdown till May 29, it has given additional relaxations for private companies and industries located in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area, a red zone. They resumed operations on Monday.Cyberabad Commissioner of Police, VC Sajjannar, told industry owners have been allowed to use 33% of the manpower in a phased manner. “And this 33% of strength is across all shifts, including critical operations, during night hours, contract staff etc,” he said.In Gujarat, the government decided to make the delivery of essential goods to home cashless from May 15, the first state to do so. “As a part of preparation strategy post lockdown, all retails and home deliveries agencies have been asked to get 100% screening of the staff. Those who get their staff screened would be able to run their operations without any hassle,” said an official order.The order also said that just to be abundantly cautious about the spread of the pandemic through currency notes, it has been made mandatory to accept digital mode of payment through unified payment interface and other platforms from May 15. So far, Gujarat has nearly 7,000 Covid-19 positive cases.In Uttarakhand, the government has allowed shops to function between 7 am and 4 pm, an extra three hours from this week. Government spokesperson and minister, Madan Kaushik, said, “We have increased the time limit of the opening of shops from 7 am to 4 pm in the state and more industries have been allowed to start operations.” However, Kerala, which has seen a new spurt of cases with expats returning, has decided against any relaxation for the time being. With train services also resuming, it expects more cases. Last Sunday it observed a complete shutdown, a symbolic move to strengthen its ongoing fight against the virus. In Rajasthan, a majority of MPs and MLAs welcomed the chief minister’s decision to bring stranded workers to their homes. The lawmakers suggested that additional trains and buses be arranged for them. They asked to simplify the pass process, arrange institutional quarantine for the people coming from other places to the village school or panchayat building and adding the names of new labourers to the MGNREGA list.On the demand of MPs and MLAs to remove the farmers’ welfare fee on purchases in agricultural markets, Gehlot said that the fee has not been imposed on the farmers but on the traders. The meeting was attended by speaker, Dr CP Joshi, former CM, Vasundhara Raje, leader of the opposition, Gulabchand Kataria, deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Rathore, and former Union minister, PP Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-relax-some-curbs-as-lockdown-nears-deadline/story-oQOwcSkqKRyAXhh8FxvxwK.html
12-05-2020||India||Govt issues new protocol for Aarogya Setu data collection||The government issued on Monday a set of protocols for how data collected from people through the Aarogya Setu contact tracing mobile application will be used and shared, attempting to address privacy concerns raised by activists and experts about the way the tool functions, the information it stores and the lack of clarity around who has access to it.The ‘Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020’, notified through a government order on Monday, restricts the use of data – such as the information people provide during self-assessment of their health and a record of who they came in contact with – “strictly” to purposes necessary and proportionate for the government’s “health responses”.The data can be retained for 180 days, the document says, significantly longer than the 45 days (for uninfected people) and 60 days (for infected persons) that it retains at present, according to officials in Niti Aayog who gave this information previously.A user can, however, request for their demographic data – defined as name, mobile number, age, gender, profession and travel history – to be deleted. “Demographic data of an individual that has been collected by NIC shall be retained for as long as this protocol remains in force or if the individual requests that it be deleted, for a maximum of 30 days from such request, whichever is earlier,” the document said.Officials said the protocol was necessitated by the increased criticism. “User data on the app is safe, and of the 98 million downloads, the data of only 12,000 people have been stored on the servers,” said Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov, adding that the protocol will allay concerns of privacy violations. Entrusting the National Informatics Centre for the collection, processing and managing of the data collected by the Aarogya Setu, the Centre also specified that only the data of those who are infected, are at high risk of being infected or who have come in contact with infected people are most likely to be collected. The data can be shared between any government department or ministry, which can also pass it on to third parties as long as the sharing of such information is specifically for the purpose of government’s health responses. “NIC shall, to the extent reasonable, document the sharing of any data and maintain a list of the agencies with whom such data has been shared,” the rules state, adding that any entity processing such data shall do so “in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory manner”. The protocol -- which will stay in force for six months -- also allows for data to be shared with different agencies and wings of the Central government as well as state governments in “de-identified” form to assist in the formulation or implementation of a critical health response. The app, which was launched to trace the contacts of individuals who have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has now been expanded to issue e-passes, provide telemedicine and is mandatory for travel to work. The app has been criticised by digital rights activist for its tracing of location histories and, last week, a French computer programmer said that vulnerabilities in the tool’s design could allow attackers to access data of millions of Indians. Violations of the data security protocols by any entity will be punishable under section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which invites jail term for up to two years. The protocols also allow research institutes to study the data collected by the app after it has undergone hard anonymisation – a process to scrub it of personally identifiable information. Divij Joshi, a lawyer and tech policy expert, said that while the protocol specifies the security guidelines better than the app’s privacy policy, it might not have enough legal teeth since it is not a legislative action. The protocol attempts to give a legal basis to Aarogya Setu, as required by the Supreme Court but it is not a clear legislative basis. It introduces some accountability by limiting data collection and sharing to that which is ‘strictly necessary’ and by allowing individuals to complain to Disaster Management Authorities under the law as well. However, the protocol does not address issues of efficacy of contact tracing, and the issues of discrimination and exclusion by making it mandatory,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-new-protocol-for-aarogya-setu-data-collection/story-EgPaNkP06FDOy1VGOPtKBP.html
12-05-2020||India||ICMR nod to 28 institutes for plasma therapy trials||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved 28 out of 113 institutions that showed interest in conducting convalescent plasma therapy trials for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, according to an official from the top medical body.Transfusing critically ill Covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma -- a component of blood rich in antibodies from patients who recovered from the disease -- so that they can fight of f the disease is a treatment showing promise world over.“The process for the plasma therapy trials is on; institutions are being approved and patients are being recruited. It will, however, be some time before anything conclusive can be said on the results of this therapy,” said Dr Rajni Kant Srivastava, spokesperson for ICMR.In Delhi, seven institutes, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Batra Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital and Max Hospital Saket have been approved to participate in the trials. Max Hospital in Saket had transfused plasma last month into a Covid-19 patient with good results. The patient was on ventilator, and the hospital sought approval on compassionate grounds as the family of the patient insisted.The patient recovered and was recently discharged, “but it is important that we also understand that plasma therapy is no magic bullet. During the patient’s treatment at Max Hospital, Saket, other standard treatment protocols were followed and we can say that plasma therapy could have worked as a catalyst in speeding up his recovery. We cannot attribute 100% recovery to plasma therapy only, as there are multiple factors which carved his path to recovery,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director – Max Healthcare.The ICMR earlier this month came out with a detailed document on the study model using plasma therapy. The sample size finalised for the multi-centre clinical trials is 452.Currently, no effective treatments are available for the Covid-19 disease. Scientists and Researchers are working on many aspects of treatment options for the development of vaccination and medication to combat this life-threatening problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-nod-to-28-institutes-for-plasma-therapy-trials/story-BK24kRcy1dsIzfMcsmZNeM.html
12-05-2020||India||Govt plans random testing for community surveillance||Every week, 200 people will be tested at health facilities in each of India’s 733 districts to check whether they have or have had the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union health ministry said in new guidelines released on Monday, charting out a comprehensive community surveillance strategy that experts have long said was crucial in managing the outbreak.The guidelines have been sent by the Union health ministry to all districts, which will now need to select 10 health facilities – of these six need to be run by the state – where certain sets of people will be put to swab as well as blood tests. The swab tests identify a concurrent infection while the blood tests can detect if a person has previously had the infection and is now fighting or has fought it off.“There is a need to establish systematic surveillance for Sars-CoV-2 infection in all districts of country. This surveillance will be in addition to the routine testing as per current testing guidelines,” says the document titled District level facility based surveillance for Covid-19. “The purpose of surveillance in an outbreak situation is to establish a trend on how far the disease is spreading; what is the pattern like; which areas are more affected and where the containment measures are succeeding. The preparations have already begun for this survey that will be conducted at the district level,” said a senior government official, who didn’t wish to be identified.The ministry did not specify when the protocol will be put into place.According to the document, the 200 weekly samples will be divided into high risk and low risk groups. The high risk individuals have been identified as health workers, from whom 100 samples will be collected. The remaining 100, considered in low risk, will be evenly split between out-patient department (OPD) visitors and pregnant women. The OPD patients will include people who do not show signs of an influenza-like illness (ILI), a category of people from whom samples are routinely taken for testing for Covid-19. The samples will be collected as throat and nasal swabs for an RT-PCR test, which detects the presence of the virus, and as blood for ELISA tests that detect if a person has a type of antibodies called IgG.“In subsequent rounds, IgG ELISA based testing of serum samples will replace RT-PCR based testing for surveillance purpose,” the guidelines added. The swab samples will be tested in pools – a strategy that reduces the number of tests that will actually need to be carried. According to guidelines, the 200 samples will be split into batches of 25. The strategy dictates that if a batch tests positive, only then will the individual samples need to be tested.Experts welcomed the move, saying it will be more effective to check the extent of disease spread than current measures. “This is a systematic surveillance for action, and there is high relevance of choosing pregnant women because usually pregnant women are at the least risk of getting infected because of normally not engaging in a behaviour that can make them vulnerable towards contracting an infection. So, if a pregnant woman is found to be positive it would reflect the extent of disease spread,” said Giridhara R Babu, professor and head Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.“And testing healthcare workers is necessary as these are front line workers at the highest risk, so you need to check they don’t become the vectors,” he added.“Pooling samples for testing is the best way to save precious resources but the only thing is, it needs to be done at a place where disease prevalence is low; the ICMR guidelines recommend about 2%. If it is done in a high prevalence district then you will have to test samples individually again and again for different batches, which would defeat the purpose,” said Dr Ekta Gupta, senior virologist, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which is one of the approved labs for Covid-19 testing. The move comes a day after the India’s top medical research lab – the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune – announced that it had created an ELISA test to detect antibodies.Antibody testing has been controversial in the world over since initial test kits, imported mostly from Chinese companies, turned out to be unreliable.The tests will be done in addition to the random testing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI), for which at least 250 samples are being lifted from each district as reported by HT on May 7.“The sampling will have to be done in all districts, which is going to be crucial in determining the prevalence of Covid-19 in our community. It is important,” said health minister Harsh Vardhan, while conducting review of the Covid-19 situation in one of the states on Thursday, referring to the tests on SARI and ILI patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-random-testing-for-community-surveillance/story-ge1vOF5kDRo6EOaWz3d2OI.html
12-05-2020||India||Migrant trains to take more passengers, allowed 3 stops||Indian Railways approved on Monday an increase in the number of passengers allowed on board Shramik Special trains it is running for migrant workers returning home after being stranded by the Covid-19 lockdown, and allowed the trains to make three stops en route to their destinations.Shramik Specials, which have so far been running without any stops on the way, are now allowed to carry up to 1,700 people. The special trains have 24 coaches, each with 72 seats. Until now, only 54 people have been allowed in each coach, with the middle berth left empty to maintain social distancing, meaning each train carried about 1,200 passengers. According to the new guidelines issued by Indian Railways, a copy of which was reviewed by HT, a train’s capacity should now be equal to the number of sleeper berths it has.The Union home ministry, meanwhile, asked all states and Union territories to cooperate with the railways in running more Shramik Special trains, which started on May 1 after state governments requested the Centre to facilitate the return of migrant workers stranded in various parts of the country because of the lockdown imposed on March 25 for the Covid-19 pandemic. “I urge upon you all to allow receiving of all Shramik Special trains without any hindrance and facilitate faster movement of stranded migrant workers to their native places,” a letter written by home secretary Ajay Bhalla to state and Union Territory (UT) administrations said. He also asked states and UTs to ensure that migrant workers do not resort to walking on the roads and rail tracks and use the special trains for travel home.The developments came a day after railway minister Piyush Goyal said Indian Railways had geared up to run 300 trains a day to ferry migrant labourers to their hometowns. He also appealed to the states to ramp up efforts to ensure these workers reach their destinations across the country in the next three-four days.“The minister has appealed to all states, especially states that have allowed very few trains (so far)...Same was discussed in the home secretary’s VC (video conference) with states yesterday (Sunday), and he has written a letter to them. The home minister (Amit Shah), in particular, has appealed to West Bengal, which has very low numbers (of trains that it has approved),” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Centre also said the railways will now run 100 ‘Shramik Special’ trains daily, and added that 513 such trains have been operated since May 1, carrying over 600,00 migrants to their destinations.Until Monday afternoon, 363 trains reached their destinations in Andhra Pradesh (1 train), Bihar (100 trains), Himachal Pradesh (1 train), Jharkhand (22 trains), Madhya Pradesh (30 trains), Maharashtra (3 trains), Odisha (25 trains), Rajasthan (4 trains), Telangana (2 trains), Uttar Pradesh (172 trains), West Bengal (2 trains) and Tamil Nadu (1 train). The remaining 105 were in transit, the ministry said.“This morning, I reviewed the train operations of ‘Shramik Special’ trains. Only 4 trains ran on the first day i.e 1st May which grew to 101 trains yesterday. In total, 468 trains have departed,” Goyal tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-trains-to-take-more-passengers-allowed-3-stops/story-kOWy3Iaw3DXpwV2J0nSihK.html
12-05-2020||India||Alert sounded after a swarm of locusts enters Rajasthan’s Ajmer||A swarm of locusts that travelled to the Indian border from Pakistan reached Rajasthan’s Ajmer district on Monday, and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) warned that more invasions by the insects . were likely from new areas.The Indian government’s Locust Warning Organization (LWO) claimed that the locust invasion would be controlled soon. LWO deputy director KL Gurjar said a swarm of locusts had been reported on Sunday night near Beawar, a city in Ajmer, that had since reached the district.Meanwhile, the FAO, an arm of t he United Nations (FAO), released a status update, suggesting the conditions for invasions by locus, a migratory pest, had become more worrisome in May and June. According to the update, migration from the spring breeding areas in Baluchistan has commenced, and several immature adult groups and swarms of locusts have appeared since May 2 in Rajasthan.Increased monitoring and reporting are required in desert areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border, warned the FAO, which released a global forecast according to which, in addition to the current invasion, locust swarms from new areas can cross the Indian border from June 22.According to the FAO, locusts possess the ability to change their behaviour and habits and can migrate over large distances. They can form dense and highly mobile swarms that can then fly as long as 150 kilometres a day, given favourable winds. These swarms can devour large amounts of vegetation and crops. An adult desert locust can consume its own weight in fresh food per day. Just one small swarm can eat the same amount of crops in a day as 35 000 people. If the numbers of locusts is not contained, the impact on crops and vegetation will drive up hunger in regions already struggling with high levels of food insecurity.Armies of locusts swarming across continents pose a “severe risk” to India’s agriculture this year, the UN has warned, prompting the authorities to step up vigil, deploy drones to detect their movement and hold talks with Pakistan on ways to minimise the damage, Hindustan Times reported on March 1. Locust attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. Authorities at the national plant protection office said the country was prepared and deploying a wide range of measures. But large-scale invasions could still prove challenging given that India lacks equipment like large sprayer aircraft, experts said. A moderate infestation from across the border chomped through crops in an estimated 300,000 hectares in Rajasthan and Gujarat in January. An upsurge in locust attacks since last year is being attributed to favourable breeding weather caused by a large number of cyclones in East Africa. India, China and Pakistan face the most risk in Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alert-sounded-after-a-swarm-of-locusts-enters-rajasthan-s-ajmer/story-fhI5fADtXkxoeKRSohvO9J.html
12-05-2020||India||Enzyme makes men vulnerable to coronavirus disease||Being male is a significant risk factor for severe illness and death from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) regardless of age, according to a new study that identified higher concentrations of a key enzyme in men’s blood as the reason for the increased risk of death they face compared to women.Men have higher levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a protein in the blood that Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19, uses to enter human cells, according to the study published in the European Heart Journal on Monday. Sars-CoV2 causes infection by using its crown-like spike protein, which gives the virus its name (corona is Latin for crown) to bind to ACE2 on the surface of human cells, from where it invades the air sacs in the lungs, leading to respiratory distress.ACE2 is found not only in lungs, but also the heart, kidneys and tissues lining blood vessels, and there are particularly high levels in the testes. Its regulation in the testes may partially explain higher ACE2 concentrations in men, and why men are more vulnerable to Covid-19, according to the study.“ACE2 is a receptor on the surface of cells. It binds to the coronavirus and allows it to enter and infect healthy cells after it is has been modified by another protein on the surface of the cell, called TMPRSS2. High levels of ACE2 are present in the lungs and, therefore, it is thought to play a crucial role in the progression of lung disorders related to Covid-19,” Dr Adriaan Voors, professor of cardiology at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, said in a statement.For the study, the researchers measured ACE2 concentrations in blood samples taken from 3,720 heart failure patients from 11 European countries and found that ACE2 was much higher in men than in women.Data from across the world shows that though men and women are equally likely to get infected, severe disease and death is significantly higher in men. Men are 2.4 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than women, found a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health on April 29. This study also listed older age and underlying diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and respiratory conditions, among others, high number of comorbidities with disease severity and deaths.Age was comparable between men and women in all data sets.In China, where Covid-19 originated, men accounted for close to two-thirds (64%) of deaths as compared to women, who accounted for 36% of all deaths.A similar gender gap in mortality rates has emerged from Italy, Spain, South Korea, France and Germany, with men accounting for 71% of the Covid-19 deaths in Italy. There were also disproportionately high deaths among men in other coronavirus outbreaks caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), with data from Hong Kong showing deaths among men were 50% higher even though more women got infected.Older age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease are associated with greater risk of death from Covid-19 , according to an analysisofsix retrospective studies with 22,350 Covid-19 infected patients and 741 cases of death published in the preprint server for health sciences, medRxiv, on April 11. “The early explosion of underlying comorbidities such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes and lung problems in Indians raises their risk of severe disease and death at younger ages as compared to other countries. That’s why continuing prescription medication for existing conditions is as important as washing hands and wearing masks,” said Dr G Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care, and a member of the Delhi government’s Covid-19 response committee. The European Heart Journal study also found that heart failure patients taking drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), did not have higher concentrations of ACE2 in their blood, which is contrary to some research that suggested that RAAS inhibitors might increase ACE2 in the blood to raise Covid-19 risk. “People with heart disease who have been prescribed ACE-inhibitors and ARBS should not discontinue the drugs,” said Dr Khilnani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enzyme-makes-men-vulnerable-to-disease/story-mTSvRnonr8KcunYZ69Qw1O.html
12-05-2020||India||Ensure medical workers travel unhindered: Centre||Health care services across key Delhi hospitals engaged in battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are getting impacted, administrators said on Monday, with staffers complaining of not being allowed cross-border movement from other parts of the National Capital Region amid a national lockdown implemented to contain the outbreak.The complaints by health care professionals of being stopped by the police at border check-posts come even as cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba wrote to states on Monday, directing them to ensure that medical workers can travel for work unhindered.Tanvi Grover, a postgraduate anesthesiology student who works at the Safdarjung Hospital’s intensive care unit, said travelling from and to her house in Gurugram has been a nightmare. She said has had to plead with policemen at the Delhi-Gurugram border to let her return home from the hospital.“The first day that I got stuck, I was at the border for over 1.5 hours, trying to convince the officials that I did not have any accommodation or even clothes to stay back in Delhi. The next time, I asked for a 24-hour shift that ended in the morning so that I could cross the border at about 5am when the checking is not so strict,” she said.Grover said she exchange shifts with others over the last two weeks in attempts to avoid hassles in travelling. For her next shift on Tuesday, she was not sure whether she would be allowed to cross the border into Delhi. Grover has her hospital ID card, an authorisation letter from the hospital’s medical superintendent, and now an online pass.About 35% of doctors, nurses and other health care workers at the Safdarjung Hospital live across the border in Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad and this has hampered the hospital’s functioning, said Dr Manish Kumar, president of the Safdarjung Hospital Resident Doctors’ Association. The hospital currently has 130 Covid-19 patients.“We are falling short of staff as many health care workers are unable to come to Delhi for their duties, which means those living in Delhi are pulling off more shifts and longer hours. This is not a sustainable measure and if some relief is not provided, others will get exhausted,” he said.All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) medical superintendent Dr DK Sharma said the services were being hindered at the premier hospital. “A couple of hundred staff members travel from across the borders for their duty... [they] have been unable to report for work. However, we are a big hospital with thousands of doctors, nurses and healthcare staff. So, we are able to manage for the time being.”A resident doctor who works at AIIMS said that last week, she had to plead with the police to be allowed to cross the border into Gurugram. “The person manning the border told me that the first [Covid-19] positive case reported involved a health care staffer. So till the time he is on duty at this check post, he won’t allow my car to pass,” the doctor, who was travelling to Palam Vihar in Gurugram last week, said on condition of anonymity. She returned to the hospital and was later able to cross over at a later time.An administrator of a tertiary care hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Yes, the lockdown of the Haryana and UP borders has impacted the services in the hospital; I can’t say how much, but we are running the services with the help of the staff that we have.”A senior Delhi government official said officials were trying to resolve the issue. “There have been talks and the government is planning on providing a list of those performing essential services in Delhi to allow them cross the border. The government is also looking at providing temporary accommodation till this lockdown is over.”Doctors associations have previously said the problems in travelling across state borders have led to undue pressure on those living in Delhi. “Around 15 to 20% of health care staff comes from across the border [particularly of hospitals] near the border areas such as GTB Hospital. With the closure of borders, the doctors living in Delhi have had to work more than their share,” said Dr Parv Mittal, vice president, Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association.Officials working on Covid-19 contact tracing and surveillance have also been facing problems with several on-ground health care workers being from places outside the Delhi borders. “We have had to ask administrations of the neighbouring states to allow one-time exit for the health care workers and here we are making some arrangements for their stay. However, the problem is that they have to stay away from their families for extended periods,” a Delhi official said on condition of anonymity.The interstate border closures because of Covid-19 have also hit the testing facilities. “There is a human resource shortage because staff cannot travel as the Gurgaon and other borders are sealed. There are issues with logistics as equipment is taking time to reach us by road. Our staff is getting harassed by neighbours, landlords because they work in the diagnostic sector,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder, Dr Dang’s Labs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-medical-workers-travel-unhindered-centre/story-AxFuoy1jZBTWr1JaRiDckJ.html
12-05-2020||India||Only containment areas should be red zones: Delhi CM Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider the recategorisation of Delhi’s designated Covid-19 hot spots – keeping containment areas in the city as “red zones” and declaring the rest of the city a “green zone” to restart economic activity.At the moment, all 11 revenue districts in the Capital are “red zones”, and can therefore ease the minimum lockdown restrictions as per the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry on May 1, two days before the nationwide lockdown was extended till at least May 17. These districts have 81 containment zones between them, where the restrictions are tighter, movement is restricted, and essential goods are home delivered by the administration.Kejriwal urged the Union government that only these containment zones should fall in the red category.“The Delhi government has adopted two policies now. Reviving the economy, as a priority, and focussing on containing the number of Covid-19 related deaths. The chief minister has urged the PM to consider turning Delhi into a green zone, except the containment areas, so that more relaxations can be implemented,” said an official in the chief minister’s office familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.Kejriwal raised the issue during a point the fifth meeting since the national lockdown was first imposed on March 25 between Modi and the CMs of all Indian states via video conference. On May 3, when the Delhi government issued an order to implement the restrictions and relaxations for the extended lockdown period under the Centre’s guidelines, Kejriwal made the same appeal in a video press briefing.In addition, the chief minister also asked the Union government for the release of central funds.“The finance commission has not released funds to Delhi. So, the chief minister also requested the PM to release funds to Delhi from the finance commission,” the official quoted above said. Delhi has been consistently demanding the Centre to raise its share in central taxes. As per latest audit report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, the government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) has maintained a revenue surplus over five years from 2013-14 to 2017-18.However, the grants in aid received by Delhi from the Centre decreased Rs 2,825 crore (2016-17) to Rs 2,184 crore (2017-18). This included grants from Centre in lieu of share in central taxes, which remained stagnant at Rs 325 crore since 2001-02 although the central tax collections have grown substantially since 2001-02, the report pointed out.The Centre has maintained that the amount has remained the same since 2001 because Delhi is a Union Territory and it is not covered under the Central Finance Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-containment-areas-should-be-red-zones-kejriwal/story-uqSsU2Zza79OyzwW0GTihK.html

The flight reached Hyderabad at about 9 pm.The two persons who failed the test will not be put in quarantine and provided treatment. Indian authorities had made it clear that only people who passed screening and tests and are asymptomatic will be allowed on repatriation flights being operated as part of Mission Vande Bharat.Ajaykiran Donthala, an Indian who was stranded at the airport for almost 50 days, was repatriated on the same flight. Ambassador Pavan Kapoor met Donthala and other passengers before the flight took off.India is operating 64 flights from 12 countries during the first week of the repatriation programme to bring back almost 15,000 citizens, mainly from West Asian countries.Indian officials are carrying out stringent screening and testing of all citizens being repatriated by non-scheduled flights and naval ships from different countries as part of Mission Vande Bharat. Citizens who register for the programme are told only asymptomatic people will be allowed to take flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-indians-fail-antibody-test-barred-from-boarding-repatriation-flight-from-uae/story-a9mbk1mFS3dnD1Z8X2FtXJ.html
12-05-2020||India||Paharganj entry, platforms 1-5 for new passenger trains||Only passengers with confirmed train reservations will be allowed to enter New Delhi Railway Station from Tuesday, when 15 passenger trains will resume operations after a nearly two-month suspension caused by the coronavirus disease, Northern Railway said on Monday.Passengers of the 15 trains would be allowed in only from Paharganj because Ajmeri Gate entry points are already being used for facilitating stranded migrants board Shramik Special trains transporting them to their home states.“The passengers trains will be originating from platform number one, two, three, four and five, depending upon the demand ..,” said Northern Railways divisional railway manager (DRM) SC Jain. “The passengers having confirmed reservation e-tickets will only be allowed to enter the station premises. They will be using Paharganj entry points. This is being done to avoid confusion and mixing of passengers..,” he added.All trains that will depart from the New Delhi Railway Station on Tuesday and all platforms from where they will set off are being thoroughly washed, disinfected and sanitised, the official said.“We are installing sanitiser dispensers at the entry points of the station building. Staffers with thermal scanners will also be deployed there. The passengers will have to use sanitiser and undergo thermal screening before being allowed to enter the premises. We will deploy sufficient staff to ensure social distancing is being maintained,” said Jain, adding that sanitiser dispensers will be installed in each coach of the trains.E-booking of train tickets, scheduled to start at 4 pm on Monday, was delayed because of technical glitches.Multilayered barricades were put in place at the railway station and except security personnel and sanitation staff, no one was allowed inside the compound. A few passengers who reached the barricades hoping to gain entry and spend the night on the platforms, were turned away by security personnel, who asked them to return to places where they had been staying or . to spend the night in any of the nearby shelter homes. One person said he had come to board a train to his hometown Bilaspur in Chattisgarh on Tuesday. A person he spoke to on the state helpline told him train services will resume on Tuesday and he should reach the station.“The policemen did not allow me to cross the barricades and asked for my E-ticket. I did not have the ticket since booking has not started. The policemen asked me to stay in the nearest shelter home for the night, book my ticket and come on Tuesday,” said Santanu Holkar, who had come to Delhi on February 28 for a job interview and got stuck because of the lockdown.“I was selected for the job. The company asked me to extend my stay till all the formalities were completed. However, the procedure stopped because of the lockdown and I had to stay in a PG {paying guest} accommodation in Vaishali, Ghaziabad,” added Holkar.Deputy commissioner of police (railways and metro) Harendra Kumar Singh said that the police were yet to receive any communication from railways officials on implementation of the new order and security arrangements. “As of now, we know that nobody will be allowed to enter the compound without a confirmed E-tickets of trains. All necessary arrangements will be made as and when we receive instructions from the railway officials,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paharganj-entry-platforms-1-5-for-new-passenger-trains/story-WYLeEVJr2TqDbM6Bwgs0kK.html
12-05-2020||India||Users can now request deletion of their data on Aarogya Setu app: Centre||Any user whose demographic data is stored with the government through the Aarogya Setu app can now request for its deletion, the Centre said on Monday as it issued a set of protocols to regulate the definition, collection, processing and storage of data by the contact-tracing app. Data about the user’s name, mobile number, age, gender, profession and travel history come under this ambit. The ‘Aarogya Setu Emergency Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020’, which will be applicable for the next six months, also increases the period of retention of such data from the earlier 60 days as specified in the app’s privacy policy to 180 days.The move comes as the government has faced criticism of the violation of privacy by digital rights activists as the app has evolved from a contract-tracing app when it was launched in April to take on a larger role of providing e-passes, telemedicine, as well as e-pharma facilities; critics have raised concerns over the government making it mandatory for a host of activities, especially in the movement of individuals. ALSO READ | Aarogya Setu app rule for private offices, not for domestic helps: OfficialLast week, a French hacker pointed at vulnerabilities on the app by showing that details of millions of Indians using it could be accessed within a 100-km radius. The app only provides data for a radius of 10 kilometres only for phones in India. IT ministry officials said that the protocol was necessitated by the increased criticism. The rationale for the protocol, the government said, was to ensure the effective implementation of the government’s health response to Covid-19. “There is a need to ensure efficient data and information sharing among the different Departments and Ministries of the Government of India as well as those in the State/Union Territory Governments,” the protocol said. Entrusting the National Informatics Centre for the collection, processing and managing of the data collected by the Aarogya Setu, the Centre also specified that only the data of those who are infected, are at high risk of being infected or who have come in contact with infected people are most likely to be collected. This includes demographic, contact, self assessment and location data. ALSO READ | MIT researchers examine Aarogya Setu app, here’s what they have to sayWhile contact and location data will by default remain on the device, the government may upload it to its server to formulate or implement appropriate health responses, it said. It added that the data of those infected will not be shared with any third party in usual circumstances, the government may do so if it is “strictly necessary” to formulate or implement health responses. The rules are applicable for six months, and while the app does not yet have a sunset clause, the government said that a review of the protocol will be taken up after six months. Contact, location and self-assessment data of individuals will be permanently deleted in 180 days in most cases, but demographic data will remain for as long as the protocol remains in force. If an individual requests that it be deleted, it will do so within 30 days of the request. The protocol also allows for data to be shared with different agencies and wings of the Central government as well as state governments in “de-identified” form to assist in the formulation or implementation of a critical health response. These entities, responsible for processing the data in a fair manner, will not store it for more than 180 days. However, the protocol said that the NIC will have to maintain a list of such agencies with details of when such sharing was started, people who have access, as well as the categories of the data.Abhishek Singh, CEO MyGov, said that the protocol will allay concerns of privacy violation. “User data on the app is safe, and of the 98 million downloads, the data of only 12,000 people have been stored on the servers,” he said. Violations of the data security protocols by any entity will be punishable under Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which invites jail term for up to two years. The protocols also allow research institutes to study the data collected by the app which has undergone hard anonymisation. Divij Joshi, a lawyer and tech policy expert, said that while the protocol specifies the security guidelines better than the app’s privacy policy, it might not have enough legal teeth as it is not a legislative action.“The protocol attempts to give a legal basis to Aarogya Setu, as required by the Supreme Court but it is not a clear legislative basis. It introduces some accountability by limiting data collection and sharing to that which is ‘strictly necessary’ and by allowing individuals to complain to Disaster Management Authorities under the law as well. However, the protocol does not address issues of efficacy of contact tracing, and the issues of discrimination and exclusion by making it mandatory,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/users-can-now-request-deletion-of-their-data-on-aarogya-setu-app-centre/story-S8SWdUYoRvUL0ubkxBf00L.html
