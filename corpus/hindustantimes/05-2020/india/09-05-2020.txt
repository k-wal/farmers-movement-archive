There is no need for the people to get panicky,” he said.In the morning, tense situation prevailed at the LG Polymers plant at R R Venkatapuram village, where hundreds of people belonging to the surrounding villages staged a dharna demanding immediate closure of the plant.Several men and women tried to barge into the plant premises even as state Director General of Police Gautam Sawang was inspecting the storage tank from where leakage of Styrene gas took place. They raised slogans like “we want justice,” and “close down the company.”The irate villagers stopped ambulances carrying bodies of three victims from King George Hospital mortuary to their respective villages for cremation and kept them on the road in front the company gate to stage a dharna.Also Read: TDP slams YSRC on Vizag gas leak, accuses govt of being lenient with LG PolymersThe protestors tried to gherao the DGP as he was coming out of the plant. A woman protester fell on his feet demanding justice, but she was pushed away by the women constables. The DGP was escorted out of the premises with heavy police security.“It has been two days since the cases were booked against the management of LG Polymers. But no action was taken against any of the company officials till date. We shall not allow the company to run under any circumstances,” an angry villager said.With the situation going out of hand, the police had to resort to lathi-charge to disperse them. They bundled scores of protesters into vans and took them away to the Gopalapatnam police station. But within no time, many others assembled at the spot and gate crashed into the company premises.Visakhapatnam police commissioner R K Meena quickly intervened and with the help of additional forces, managed to force the protestors out of the company premises. The police also managed to shift the bodies from the spot to Venkatapuram village for the cremation.State minister for tourism M Srinivasa Rao and other YSR Congress party leaders tried to convince the angry villagers saying that the government would make efforts to get LG Polymers shifted out of the place.“The government has appointed a high-powered committee which would go deep into the mishap and take stern action against the company. Please bear with us,” Srinivasa Rao appealed to the villagers with folded hands.The DGP said the situation was absolutely under control. He said more technical teams from chemical and petroleum ministry in Delhi would be arriving later in the day to study the situation and suggest the way forward.Sawang, who had a meeting with technical experts, scientists and the special team from National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), appealed to the people not to rush back to their villages but remain in relief camps for another 48 hours, which was mandatory period to restore normalcy as per the safety protocol.He said the high-powered committee would take up the investigation soon and based on its report, action would be initiated against the company. “There is no need for us to protect anybody. Depending on the progress of the case, we shall invoke more sections of the Indian Penal Code against the company,” he said.In a detailed statement, the LG Polymers said initial investigations, prima facie, suggested that the cause of the incident on Thursday was the leaking of vapour from the Styrene Monomer (SM) storage tank near the GPPS (General Purpose Poly Styrene) factory.Also Read: LG Polymers says vapour leak caused accident at Vizag plantThe company said that while focusing on stabilizing the plant, the firm was doing its best to support people affected by the incident.A special task force has been set up to resolve issues and help victims and their families with medical supplies, household goods, and psychological counseling, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-gas-leak-victims-seek-closure-of-lg-plant-minister-promises-justice/story-cxNLSyphRcfb8r9u6C6HkJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Kolkata registers 276 new Covid-19 cases, 29 deaths in 7 days||The spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continued to record a sharp hike in Kolkata, with the state on Saturday reporting that 64 people had tested positive and nine people had died in the last 24 hours. With this, the city has reported 276 new Covid-19 cases and 29 deaths in the past seven days.Thirteen of Bengal’s 23 districts have reported new cases in the last week and Kolkata has emerged as the state’s greatest challenge. It is mainly because of the sharp increase in the numbers in Kolkata that Bengal’s overall graph is also rising. The state recorded 527 new cases and 38 deaths in the past seven days.The situation is most critical in boroughs 1 to 9 sprawling across north and central Kolkata and parts of south Kolkata, and borough no 15 in western Kolkata, covering mostly the Garden Reach area. Of the total 326 containment zones in the city, 255 are between wards no 1 and 90 of the total 144-ward Kolkata Municipal Corporation.“The situation is worse in ward no 66, where there are 11 containment zones. Besides, ward no 60 has nine containment zones and ward no 18 has seven,” said a KMC official.Ward no 66 covers Tangra and Topsia area in central and south Kolkata. Ward 18 covers parts of Shobhabazar neighbourhood in north Kolkata, while ward 60 covers the Park Circus neighbourhood in central Kolkata.Overall, 911 people tested positive in Kolkata and 116 of them died, with 64 deaths attributed to Covid-19 and 52 to co-morbidity.“Cases in Kolkata are certainly increasing but there are also positive examples of densely populated areas reporting no new cases since been put under complete lockdown. Besides, the KMC has also started a door-to-door survey for Covid-19 symptoms and collection of swab samples from every household within containment zones,” said TMC Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen, who is also a doctor, a KMC corporator, and is playing a leading role in the Mamata Banerjee government’s battle against Covid-19.“We are entirely sealing containment zones with barricades. The police are helping people with doorstep delivery of essentials. Grocery shops, medicine shops and rickshaw-pullers have been roped in for this purpose,” said a senior officer of Kolkata police who did not want to be named.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, has blamed a lax lockdown in Kolkata for this steep rise. “The chief minister allowed sweetmeat shops to function. She took a casual approach and her police took the cue from her. People freely crowded markets. We are afraid that the lockdown in Kolkata is going to continue longer than other major cities in the country,” said BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-registers-276-new-covid-19-cases-29-deaths-in-7-days/story-8FDnVRWnwbU0EsJ7kQnV0I.html
09-05-2020||India||Govt rejects Nepal protest on Lipulekh||New DelhiNew Delhi on Saturday rejected Kathmanu’s protest against the construction of a road to Lipulekh on the border with China, saying the region is “completely within the territory of India” and both sides can resolve boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue.Earlier in the day, Nepal expressed regret at the inauguration of the route from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to Lipulekh, with a statement from the foreign ministry contending the road “passes through Nepali territory”.Defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 80-km road on Friday to curtail the time taken for the pilgrimage to Kailash-Mansarovar. The road ends at Lipulekh Pass, and will help pilgrims avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.“The recently inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in the state of Uttarakhand lies completely within the territory of India. The road follows the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.India had improved the road for the ease and convenience of pilgrims, local residents and traders, he said.India and Nepal have an established mechanism for boundary issues, and the delineation of the border with Nepal is ongoing, Srivastava said. India is also committed to resolving outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue, he added.The two countries are in the process of scheduling talks between their foreign secretaries, which will be held after they have dealt with the Covid-19 crisis, Srivastava said.Nepal’s foreign ministry emphasised the country’s claim on Lipulekh. It said in a statement: “The government of Nepal has consistently maintained that as per the Sugauli Treaty (1816), all the territories east of Kali (Mahakali) River, including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipu Lekh, belong to Nepal.”The development comes at a time when Nepal has also been irked by the depiction of Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand in new Indian maps showing the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Nepal had sought talks to address the Kalapani issue but New Delhi rejected Kathmandu’s protest, saying the new maps accurately depict Indian territory.The statement from Nepal’s foreign ministry said Kathmanu had reiterated its claim to all territories east of the Mahakali river several times, most recently through a diplomatic note sent to New Delhi on November 20 last year.The “unilateral act” of opening the new road “runs against the understanding reached between the two countries, including at the level of Prime Ministers, that a solution to boundary issues would be sought through negotiation”, the statement said.Nepal also said it is committed to a diplomatic solution to boundary issues on the “basis of the historical treaty, documents, facts and maps”. The Nepal government called on India to refrain from “any activity inside the territory of Nepal”, and pointed out Kathmandu had expressed its disagreement in 2015, through separate diplomatic notes sent to New Delhi and Beijing, when India and China agreed to include Lipulekh Pass as a bilateral trade route.Nepal’s foreign ministry also brought up the issue of a report prepared by the “Eminent Persons Group” of the two sides to recommend measures to elevate existing relations, and said the document should be made public.“The Group has concluded its task and prepared a consensus report. The government of Nepal is ready to receive the report and believes that it will be in the interest of the two countries to implement its recommendations which will also help address the outstanding issues left by the history...,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rejects-nepal-protest-on-lipulekh/story-vnQxIGYRpkOpOoD9vGjsVL.html

Rahul says it has received huge contributions even from public sector units like the Railways and should, therefore, be open for audits and a public disclosure for the sake of transparency. “The #PmCares fund has received huge contributions from PSUs & major public utilities like the Railways. It’s important that PM ensures the fund is audited & that the record of money received and spent is available to the public,” Rahul said on Saturday.Railways minister Piyush Goyal was quoted in reports pledging Rs 151 crore to the PM CARES fund in the last week of March this year. The fund has also received several hundred crores of rupees in donation from other contributors—both in the public and the private sector. All BJP MPs have also donated Rs 1 crore each from their annual development fund along with a month’s salary.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesPM-CARES or Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund was announced in the month of March and the PM said it is meant to further strengthen India’s disaster management capacities and encourage research on technologies to protect citizens from disasters such as the one brought upon by the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister has been made the Chairman of this trust and its members include the Defence Minister, Home Minister and Finance Minister.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The Congress party raised questions over setting up of the fund in the past as well and has demanded to know why it could not be merged with the PM National Relief Fund.Earlier this month, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had demanded an audit of the fund alleging an official circular in Uttar Pradesh was asking everyone to donate Rs 100 towards it. “ A suggestion: When the common people are distressed, there is a shortage of ration, water and money and the government machinery is extracting Rs 100 from everyone for donations to PM CARES, then it would be appropriate from every perspective to have the fund audited,” Priyanka tweeted on May 2, while referring to an alleged order from the district administration in Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh to collect Rs 100 from individuals as donations to the PM CARES fund||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-7-days-after-priyanka-rahul-repeats-demand-to-audit-pm-cares-fund/story-OFTtcAEUzsPLFoj4MmONJL.html
09-05-2020||India||‘Acted after Amit Shah’s letter’: Railways counter Bengal’s claim on migrants’ return||The Ministry of Railways on Saturday night rebutted Bengal’s ruling party Trinamool Congress’ claim that the state had made arrangements for eight trains to bring back migrants from four other states that are scheduled to reach Bengal over the next three days.Trinamool Congress and the state government made these claims after union home minister Amit Shah wrote to Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing the state of not supporting the Centre in allowing Bengal’s migrant workers stranded in other states to reach Bengal.“Amit Shah’s letter is full of outright lies. Two trains have already reached and eight more are expected to reach Bengal in the coming three days. Overall, 80,000 people have already been brought back using various means of transport,” TMC Rajya Sabha leader and national spokesperson Derek O’Brien said on Saturday.TMC also alleged that the union home minister was deliberately spreading lies to play politics during an epidemic.O’Brien presented a document showing two trains each from Punjab and Tamil Nadu and three from Karnataka in the draft schedule of special trains, as of May 8, which will reach seven districts of Bengal between May 10 and 12, carrying 12,714 passengers altogether. Another train is scheduled to arrive in Malda district on May 10, carrying 1,721 passengers from Telangana.The Railways, however, contested TMC’s claims in a series of three tweets on Saturday night.“Indian Railways has so far run more than 300 trains mainly for states like UP, Bihar, Odisha, and MP etc. But for WB till today morning we had received approval for only 2 Shramik special trains, 1 from Ajmer Sharif and the other from Ernakulam,” the Railways said, adding, “After the request of Hon’ble HM, this afternoon WB has approved 2 trains from Punjab, 2 from TN, 3 from Karnataka and 1 from Telangana, which are being arranged.”“However, WB has not approved any train from Maharashtra, while there is a requirement of 16 trains to WB and presently 6 requests are pending for which approval is still awaited from WB,” the ministry added.The Congress, meanwhile, has added a twist to the ongoing political blame-game by supporting the Centre’s version. “The chief minister has given permission to eight more trains after Shah wrote to the state,” alleged Congress’ leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is an MP from Berhampore in West Bengal.Facing the ire of the BJP, the Congress and the Left parties, Mamata Banerjee’s TMC on Saturday said that the state had a “staggered plan” to bring back migrant workers stranded in other states. The state would also allow residents stranded abroad to return.A senior government official said that the state would not accept a large number of people from outside at one go. “It would not be right to accept more than 4,000-5,000 people on a single day. We are making plans for every single one of them depending on his or her residential address and health status. We can’t do something that could lead to a steep rise in the state’s Covid-19 graph,” a top official of the state government said, requesting anonymity.Over the last week, 13 of Bengal’s 23 districts reported new Covid-19 cases.At the state secretariat, home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said that pilgrims stranded in Haridwar, Dwarka and other religious places would also be brought back in batches. “Many people from the neighbouring states of Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand came to the state borders by walking there. We made all arrangements to safely send them home,” Bandyopadhyay said.O’Brien said that the state had a seven-stage plan to bring back migrants. “We are doing it in a staggered manner. Everyone stranded in other states would be brought back but in batches. The prime minister announced the lockdown without an iota of planning. We don’t want to bring the migrant workers back without having an elaborate plan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acted-after-amit-shah-s-letter-railways-counter-bengal-s-claim-on-migrants-return/story-SWQAJonpTm9U020kpwdLnJ.html

09-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Revised govt policy specifies when to discharge a positive patient||The union ministry of health on Saturday issued revised discharge policy for patients admitted to the government’s three-tier Covid medical management system, clearly listing out conditions for discharging mild, moderate and severe cases. For the first category of mild and very mild cases or pre-symptomatic cases at a Covid Care facility, the revised guideline sets the requirement of spending three days without fever and passage of 10 days since the onset of symptoms for discharge. Such cases do not need to be tested for a negative finding for Covid-19 virus before they are discharged, the revised policy states. However, such mild and very mild cases must be kept under regular temperature and pulse oximetry monitoring at the Covid Care facility during their stay and should follow home isolation for 7 days as per the relevant guidelines issued by the health ministry after their discharge.The revised guidelines add that a mild or very mild patient needs to be moved to a dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) if the oxygen saturation dips below 95% at any point of time prior to the discharge from the CCC.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIf the patients in the above category (mild/very mild/ pre-symptomatic) again develop symptoms of fever, cough or breathing difficulty after the discharge from CCC, then they will need to contact the CCC or the state helpline or 1075 for revaluation. Such cases will again be followed up through a tele-conference on 14th day, says the guideline.The second category of patients that fall under moderate classification are described as those whose symptoms resolve within three days and oxygen saturation levels are maintained above 95% for the next four days.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The revised guideline says that such cases will undergo monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation at the Covid Health Centres (CHC) that have the facility for oxygen beds.If the fever resolve within 3 days and the patient maintains saturation above 95% for the next 4 days without oxygen support, then the moderate patient can be discharged but not before 10 days have passed since the onset of symptomsAdditionally, the following three conditions must also be met for the discharge of patients in the above category. 1. Absence of fever without antipyretics2. Resolution of breathlessness3. No oxygen requirementEven in moderate cases, there will be no need for testing prior to discharge, and the patient will be advised to be in home isolation for 7 days as per the guidelines issued by the health ministry in this regard.For patients who are on oxygenation and whose fever does not resolve within 3 days and demand of oxygen therapy continues, the revised guidelines say that such patients will be discharged only after the resolution of all clinical symptoms of coronavirus and the ability to maintain oxygen saturation for 3 consecutive days.And finally for patients classified as ‘severe’, including immunocompromised patients--HIV patients, transplant recipients, malignancy--- the discharge criteria will be based on clinical recovery, confirmatory RT-PCR test after resolution of symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-revised-govt-policy-specifies-when-to-discharge-a-positive-patient/story-LNSuPPIZdXWh3xSVxSXHEL.html

Since its launch on April 2 this year, over 96 million people have registered with the Aarogya Setu health care application, which has become the fastest mobile app to reach 50 million users globally and will be one of the fastest entrant to the 100 million club. The Aarogya Setu has helped the government with its twin objective -- “whom to test” and “where to test more” in its battle against Covid-19. Speaking to ANI, Niti Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant said: “For instance, in Maharashtra, the engine identified over 60 hotspots across 18 districts. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageAcross the nation, the engine predicted about 130 hotspots at the sub-post office level between April 13 to April 20. Later, these forecasted hotspots were declared as ‘real hotspots’ by the Union Health Ministry some 3 to 17 days after being alerted by Aarogya Setu. This way, the engine helped the government with “whom to test” and “where to test more” against the coronavirus.”“The Aarogya Setu App alerted the government about more than 650 hotspots across the country and over 300 emerging hotspots which could have been missed otherwise. It gives accurate forecast of hotspots and it is also preventing the origin of newer hotspots. The engine has generated incredible insights and impact with precise projections of locality, direction and velocity of the spread of infection,” he said.The Niti Ayog chief informed that so far around 69 million people have taken the self-assessment test, an adoption rate of more than 71 per cent, out of which, over 3.4 million people have self-declared themselves as unwell since they were showing one or more than three symptoms. With this, a dedicated team of over 70 healthcare workers have reached to people who displayed two or more than two symptoms of Covid-19.”This is how a dedicated team of more than 70 healthcare workers have reached out to about 650,000 people who showed two or more symptoms. More than 16,000 people have been administered follow-up tele-consultation by doctors,” he said. At least 12,500 users, who downloaded the Aarogya Setu, have detected positive for COVID-19 so far. The Bluetooth based interaction data has led to around 60,000 people being assessed and alerted at various degrees of risk which include self-isolation, quarantine and testing.About 8,500 people have tested from the set of people assessed as high-risk and of which more than 23 per cent have tested COVID-19 positive so far giving an extraordinary testing accuracy.The efficacy of testing recommended by Aarogya Setu is much higher than any testing protocol anywhere in the world and it manifolds higher than the current overall efficacy of testing in India, Kant said. The Aarogya Setu app is available in 12 different languages and soon it is set to expand to all 22 scheduled Indian languages, the Niti Aayog CEO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-app-alerted-govt-to-300-emerging-hotspots-which-could-have-been-missed-out-amitabh-kant/story-5KRc3Bxgr3DhAqUL3iDy8H.html

This is done through an elaborate network of importers, customs house agents, transporters and the operation is financed through illegal international hawala channels,” it said. Investigation also established that the seized consignment was a part of a total of five consignments of drugs, out of which four had been successfully smuggled into India, it added.Ranjit Singh is also prime accused in the recent Hizbul Mujahideen terror funding module which was busted with the arrest of Hilal Ahmad Wagay, a resident of Nowgam, Awantipora, Jammu and Kashmir with Rs 29 lakh cash in Amritsar by Punjab Police on April 25.“This money was being transported to the Kashmir valley to be handed over to Riyaz Naikoo (now killed), chief operational commander of Hizbul Mujahideen. This case has been taken over by NIA,” the agency said.Ranjit Singh along with his five brothers has been involved in smuggling and trade of drugs for the past many years, it added.“Pakistan based terrorist organisations are using narcotic trade to generate funds for terror activities in India. The proceeds of narcotic trade are transferred to Kashmir valley through couriers and hawala channel for terrorist purposes,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-nabs-alleged-narco-terrorist-with-hizbul-link-from-sirsa/story-c8XZ7ilkXA3KmUzstyPWnJ.html

In other districts too cases are being reported as migrants from Surat are returning back to their homes.Ganjam district collector Vijay Aamrita Kulange said Section-144 has been imposed around all Covid-19 medical camps/institutional quarantine centres where migrants have been housed by the government.Kulange said no one will be allowed to enter within 100 m radius of the quarantine centres and directed the Superintendent of Police, Sub-Divisional Magistrates, Executive Magistrates and inspectors of police stations to keep a close watch on the centres.The decision comes after a video of people violating the norms in quarantine centres went viral.In one quarantine centre of Sergarh block housing, 80 migrant workers from Surat, their kin were seen delivering food and betel to the inmates at the gate violating social distance norms.Earlier this week, 128 Surat-returned migrant labourers had fled from two Covid-19 quarantine centres in Beguniapada block in Ganjam district before they were caught.The state government has also increased the quarantine period for returnees from 14 days to 28 days as many of the positive cases were found after the 14-day quarantine period.“Returnees from other states will have to undergo an institutional quarantine of 21 days followed by home quarantine for next seven days,” said Odisha’s chief spokesperson on Covid-19, Subroto Bagchi.The order came even as two persons died in two separate quarantine centres of Ganjam and Sonepur districts.On Friday afternoon, a 40-year-old man who had returned from Surat and showed Covid-19 symptoms died before his swab sample could be tested; while in Sonepur, a migrant labourer from Bengal died in the quarantine centre Saturday morning. However, he did not show any Covid-19 symptoms.Officials said Friday’s stay order by the Supreme Court on the Orissa High Court order of stopping travel of migrant workers without Covid-19 test in the originating state would lead to a massive surge in positive cases. On Thursday, the Orissa High Court had directed the state government to not let migrant workers board trains to Odisha without testing them for Covid-19.Over 46,000 people have returned to Odisha from different states and another five lakh migrants are expected to turn up. On Saturday, 5 special trains carrying migrants left for Odisha from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The trains will reach Odisha on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quarantines-centres-in-odisha-s-ganjam-under-section-144-over-covid-19-worry/story-nNnw7qvUw5WQtjhK0rZxtL.html

We were able to identify by people through their pictures caught on other cameras and are interrogating them as to why they were inside the forests. But due to the lockdown the investigation is not progressing at a good speed,” said Rahul, who uses only his first name.Officials said three persons have been taken in so far for questioning and two more are still missing.But the Corbett administration has increased vigil and is ensuring that any untoward activity can be avoided. The director said that it is very difficult to monitor the boundaries of the park due to the lockdown because there could always be people waiting to enter the forests.“Due to the lockdown it is difficult to take pre-emptive actions in nearby villages and find out if there is any new movement or people who have settled in and due to these challenges we are keeping a vigil day and night through almost 500 camera traps and around 12-15 watch towers in key areas apart from regular patrolling during the day,” said Rahul.These camera traps, still cameras and video cameras had been set up in March this year to keep an eye on any kind of movement and for surveillance inside the park.“We are also doing ambush patrolling at sensitive points across the boundary of Corbett where a team of armed forest staff of around four-five members camp at night and ascertain that there is no human activity inside the park like lighting a fire or anything similar. We also use night vision binoculars to keep an eye from the watch towers,” added Rahul.Elaborating on e-surveillance, Rahul said that from Ramnagar to Kalagarh, there are ten towers where thermal cameras have been installed for better surveillance.“These cameras are connected to our tiger cell in Ramnagar through radios where we can check continuous live footage of any movement in that region. Around 40 km of boundary is covered by these cameras, so we are constantly ensuring that untoward activities are kept under check,” said Rahul.The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau in the last week of April had issued an alert asking tiger reserves and forest departments to increase vigil and strengthening of intelligence network after a few members of the notorious Bawaria gang went missing from their original spots in Haryana and Punjab, said officials.Amid the coronavirus outbreak across the country, the Uttarakhand forest department in March had ordered that Corbett Tiger Reserve, along with all protected areas and zoos in the state remain closed till further notice.Believed to have around 260 tigers at present, Corbett Tiger Reserve which is spread across 1,288.31 square kilometers is one of the most –frequented tourist destinations in the state. The gates of Corbett open on November 15 every year for six months till mid June. Corbett witnesses a footfall of around 3 lakh tourists every year across its six eco-tourism zones, with Dhikala and Bijrani being the most popular ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambush-patrolling-e-surveillance-how-corbett-is-being-guarded-during-lockdown/story-iaoj8ET3GOhVLylFVxfFNO.html
09-05-2020||India||‘Celebrations can wait’: Clerics to CM Mamata on lifting lockdown after Eid||The Bengal Imams’ Association, a body of Islamic clerics in the state, has urged chief minister Mamata Banerjee not to lift the lockdown before Eid Ul Fitr scheduled on May 25, under any circumstances.“The Union government has announced lockdown till May 17. In our state, it has already been extended till May 21. The holy Eid Ul Fitr is on May 25. The government may consider relaxing the lockdown due to Eid. But, we request the Bengal government to extend the lockdown for a few more days. Let people live first, celebrations can take place later,” Md. Yahiya, chairman of the Bengal Imams’ Association wrote in a letter to the chief minister on Saturday.Yahiya proposed that the lockdown be extended till May 30.“We request you to raise this demand before the Centre as well. The Muslim leadership will stand by the government,” Yahiya wrote.No one from the government or the ruling party, Trinamool Congress, agreed to speak on record. “The chief minister herself will take a call considering all aspects,” said a senior minister of the state government who did not want to be identified.Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on April 26 urged people to pray during the month of Ramzaan to get rid of coronavirus before Eid.The clerics’ call came at a time when the Covid-19 graph in Bengal is steadily rising, reporting 527 cases over the past five days.Earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal opposition in the state, had accused the Mamata Banerjee government of turning a blind eye to the violation of lockdown measures in areas dominated by minorities in Kolkata and Howrah, the epicenters of the coronavirus infection in the state. “Mamata Banerjee continued with her politics of appeasement during this fight against the virus. She did not reveal details about Delhi’s Nizamuddin Markaz-returnees and everyone could see how the administration is turning a blind eye to lockdown violations in areas dominated by members of a special community,” BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh said earlier this week.Muslims comprise 27.01% of the state’s population, according to the Census of 2011, and are a majority in three of Bengal’s 23 districts – Murshidabad, Malda and Uttar Dinajpur. Incidentally, Uttar Dinajpur has not recorded any case yet, while Malda has reported 3 and Murshidabad has reported 1 Covid-19 case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/celebrations-can-wait-clerics-to-cm-mamata-on-lifting-lockdown-after-eid/story-SWi9HEYpxd4YlWxe0V7WoN.html
09-05-2020||India||National Herald case: ED attaches part of nine-storey Mumbai building, Congress slams move||The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday “partially” attached a nine-storey building in Bandra (Mumbai) worth Rs 16.38 crore, in connection with its money laundering probe involving Associated Journals Limited (AJL), a company controlled by the Gandhi family and the publishers of the National Herald newspaper.ED said it has attached a part of the building, which has been established as “proceeds of crime” and notices regarding the attachment under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) have been issued to AJL and veteran Congress leader Moti Lal Vora, who happens to be the chairman and managing director of the company.The nine-floor building, located at plot number 2, Survey number 341, near Kala Nagar in Bandra (East), has two basements and a total built up area of 15,000 square meters and its total value is around Rs 120 crore.Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been named as an accused in the case and both Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED have chargesheeted him in 2018 and 2019 respectively, along with Vora.Also Read: ED files charges against senior Congress leaders in National Herald caseThe ED has alleged that Hooda and Vora used proceeds of crime in the form of a plot – number C-17, Sector 6, Panchkula, allotted illegally to AJL and pledged it to avail loan from the Syndicate Bank branch on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in Delhi to construct this building in Bandra.“Thus, the said asset at Mumbai that germinated out of the proceeds of crime has been attached to the extent of Rs 16.38 crore. Further investigation is going on,” the agency said in a statement. The Panchkula plot has already been attached by the agency.The money laundering probe was based on allegations that the property was allotted to AJL in the year 1982 but was withdrawn by the Estate Officer, Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) a decade later on October 30, 1992, since AJL did not comply with the conditions of allotment.“However, Hooda blatantly misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the said plot afresh in the guise of re-allotment to the AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of necessary conditions and policy of HUDA by an order of August 28, 2005, for Rs 59,39,200,” ED has claimed. The actual value of the property (Panchkula) is about Rs 64.93 crore, it said.The anti money laundering probe agency has further stated that Hooda, as the then CM, caused wrongful loss to HUDA and wrongful gain to AJL by ignoring legal opinion and recommendations of HUDA officers and financial commissioner and principal secretary, Town and Country Planning.The agency also said it found that Hooda, thrice granted undue extensions to AJL for construction on the said plot, and after acquisition projected it as untainted property and further acquired loans from the bank by way of mortgaging the same from time to time.Reacting to the development, senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, “This is a part of the continuing governmental tirade against National Herald. Since the primary allegations against National Herald are baseless, such attachment orders are equally baseless and untenable. They will be suitably challenged by proper legal recourse. There is also a continuing process of spreading misinformation by authorities in this regard. The government would be far better advised to use its energies to battle Covid instead of such wasteful exercises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-herald-case-ed-attaches-part-of-nine-storey-mumbai-building-congress-slams-move/story-loFUxymMPRDBsC0lM60nzM.html

The previous TDP government had also given consent for operations without obtaining proper environmental clearance.On Saturday, the TDP president dashed off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rope in national and international health experts for assessment of the health of the people affected by the gas leakage from the LG Polymers firm.Expressing doubts over the content of the gas leaked from the plant, Naidu pointed out that though the company claimed that the gas that had leaked was Styrene, there were also reports of other toxic gases being in it.The TDP chief had earlier demanded that the LG Polymers be closed forthwith pending investigation. He also lashed out at chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy for not taking action against the company till date.“Filled with fear, people of Vizag are sleeping on the roads. Local residents are protesting on the streets for justice. Bereaved families are weeping alongside the bodies of their loved ones. Not a single arrest made nor a single asset seized. Where is @ysjagan? #VizagDemandsJustice,” he tweeted.Senior TDP lawmaker K Atchen Naidu, who called on the affected people in King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam, demanded that the Jagan government put pressure on LG Polymers to pay a compensation of Rs 10 crore to each of the families of the deceased.“We thought Jagan would deal with the company firmly, but he was soft on them after meeting the company representatives in the Visakhapatnam airport,” the TDP leader alleged.Meanwhile, the YSRC has revealed that it was the Chandrababu Naidu government which had, in January 2017, given the consent for operation for LG Polymers till December 31, 2021. The company also got the approval for expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 415 tonnes per day to 655 tonnes per day in 213 acres of land allotted by the government at a capital cost of Rs 168 crore.The ruling party also revealed a government order issued in August 2015, which sought to de-notify 128.24 acres of land from the purview of Simhachalam Temple administration and allot it to LG Polymers. This piece of temple land was allotted to the company’s original promoter Hindustan Polymers Ltd in 1964, but it got into a dispute later.The YSRC reminded that in June 2018, when Naidu was in power, the AP Pollution Control Board had given hazardous waste disposal authorization which is valid till April 30, 2023.It also pointed out that the company had gone in for expansion without obtaining environmental clearance during the TDP regime in 2018 itself. Following the objections from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, it had submitted an affidavit admitting its violation in May 2019, the ruling party said.Minister for municipal administration Botsa Satyanarayana reminded that it was Naidu, who had announced during the Partnership Summit in 2018 that LG Polymers was going in for expansion.“He was the person who had colluded with the company. We have already declared that stern action would be taken against the company, if the high-powered committee made such a recommendation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-slams-ysrc-on-vizag-gas-leak-accuses-govt-of-being-lenient-with-lg-polymers/story-gL1f5gtEO6pwxyeoGDKdHL.html

This is a mandatory drill for all hospital staff treating Covid-19 patients. “It was around 9 pm that my wife called up to say that our son was sick. He was vomiting and apparently down with some gastric infection. I could do little, but the family with the help of a neighbour, who drives a taxi, took the child to the nearest hospital in Chinhat. The hospital refused to admit my child after which the family was informed about another hospital in Alambagh. That hospital too refused to admit my son,” says Manish.“My wife then rushed him to King George’s Medical University (KGMU). By this time, I had called up my seniors in the hospital, who had dialled KGMU where the doctors immediately attended to him but a lot of time had been lost by then,” he recalls.He said his son tested negative for coronavirus. He suspects that it was the fear of infection because of which the private hospitals refused to attend to his child.“How can one deny treatment to a child in an emergency?” he asks.“Main ladke ko galey bhi nahi laga paya (I couldn’t even embrace my dear son as I was quarantined). With special permission, I did go to KGMU in an ambulance after wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. Yet, I didn’t go near my family or for that near anyone. I could only watch my son from a distance as he left us,” he says.In the morning, the child was buried in the family’s village on the outskirts of Lucknow.“I am still unable to get over the fact that he might have been alive if the private hospitals had attended to him,” he said.Manish’s quarantine has ended but he hasn’t resumed his duties while his wife is still inconsolable.“My wife continues to sob uncontrollably. I put duty over my family responsibilities first. I had lost my father sometime back and now this. Don’t know how life will shape up now,” he said.

We’ll continue our strict surveillance. We can’t allow people to enter Kerala without valid passes. It’s mandatory for people coming from other states to carry passes from their place of origin to their chosen destination in a bid to contain the viral outbreak,” he added.The CM also announced that the state government would arrange special trains from New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, etc; to bring back all those who are stranded.“We’re in talks with the Union Ministry of Railways. Among the stranded, students, pregnant women, and senior citizens will get first priority to come back home,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-indians-flown-back-from-gulf-to-kerala-test-covid-positive/story-3PShMQHKaIYTT4bH39NHkM.html

Later, the bodies were sent to the neighbouring Shahdol and Umaria districts. There were two injured labourers, who were sent to their native Mandla district in an ambulance van,” said SS Jain, superintendent of police, railways, Jabalpur.Bharat Yadav, district collector, Jabalpur, said, “All the stranded migrant labourers, who were brought back from Aurangabad, belong to villages in Jabalpur, Shahdol and Rewa divisions. All of them underwent a medical examination at Jabalpur railway station before they’re sent to their respective native places by buses. Adequate arrangements were made for their food and water on the way.” The rail accident victims worked at a steel plant in Maharashtra’s Jalna district. They had left Jalna at 7 pm on Thursday and walked on the road to Badnapore. Later, they started walking along railway tracks. They sat on the railway track to take rest, but fell asleep on the track due to exhaustion after walking for 36 kilometres. A train ran them over on Friday early morning, said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-bodies-of-labourers-crushed-by-train-brought-back-to-native-place/story-zLjWk9r7WdQDia7Gbr3o9K.html

Various petitions were also filed in the Supreme Court seeking assistance for lawyers who have been struggling due to lack of work during Covid-19.The Supreme Court Bar Association in April set up a Covid-19 Helping Scheme for providing financial assistance to lawyers during the lockdown.“The study does not surprise me. Early years at the bar have traditionally been years of strained circumstances. With the many high-priced law-schools churning out smart freshers, these small earnings look even smaller especially for those who come from no family background of law,” said senior advocate Sanjay Hegde.The participants in the survey also expressed their lack of confidence in the court when it came to giving lawyers a fair hearing in cases.66 per cent of surveyed lawyers across 8 high courts in the country said that their chance of getting a fair hearing from the court depends upon the composition of the bench.Over 83 per cent of lawyers surveyed at the high courts of Calcutta (97 per cent), Delhi (83 per cent) and Patna (93 per cent) felt that their chance of getting a fair hearing depends on the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-per-cent-high-court-lawyers-say-junior-advocates-earn-less-than-rs-10-000-survey/story-DV8iGsnOtuNI84KrFCXIlJ.html

Since January this year, 80 Mujahideens (terrorists) have given their ‘Shahadat’ (eliminated by the security forces) and all of them were highly educated and trained.”He continued, “Mujahideens (terrorists) also broke the back of enemy (security forces) in Handwara Rajwar recently but the enemy (India) has the upper edge.”Hindustan Times cannot vouch for the veracity of the video.A day after security forces eliminated Naikoo in a joint operation, Salahuddin had said the sacrifice would help them achieve the mission that they had set out to achieve.Naikoo along with his associate Adil Ahmed were killed in Wednesday’s operation carried out by Jammu and Kashmir police and troopers from the 21 Rashtriya Rifles.A top army officer said that despite losing eight men in two encounters recently in Handwara, security forces have maintained a constant pressure on the militants across Kashmir.“We are already into hot pursuit mode,” he added.Security forces suspect that there are nearly 250 militants including 100 Pakistanis who are active in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/riyaz-naikoo-s-killing-a-shock-says-hizbul-mujahideen-boss-syed-salahuddin/story-6vXUvlJYLkchtdyMl87Y7J.html

09-05-2020||India||Aarogya Setu app rule for private offices, not for domestic helps: Official||The Union home ministry’s lockdown guidelines that mandate employers to ensure that their employees have the Aarogya Setu mobile app does not apply to domestic helps, a senior Union home ministry official said on Saturday.The official said this provision was clearly designed for public and private offices.Officials said the government wants to encourage everyone with a smartphone to download the Aarogya Setu app. “But the harsh reality is that not everyone has a smartphone,” a second official said.India has 1.2 billion mobile phones; only 350 million are smartphones.The home ministry official’s clarification to the question came following multiple complaints on social media and elsewhere about housing societies barring domestic helps from resuming work unless they install the mobile application.Many can’t afford one. One of them said that there was a smartphone at home but that was being used by her son to attend online classes at home.Office-bearers at the housing societies have cited the provision in the home ministry’s National Directive for Covid-19 Management to insist on the mobile app.According to the national directive for work places, “Use of Arogya Setu app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public. It shall be the responsibility of the Head of the respective organisations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees”.Officials said domestic helps did not fall under this category. If they did, then all households who employ one would be required to comply with all other provisions listed for work places including use of thermal scanning devices, repeated sanitation of the premises through the day and earmarking quarantine areas to isolate employees showing symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-app-rule-for-private-offices-not-for-domestic-helps-official/story-DF6DPhpFqTnyUcX3ln84cM.html
09-05-2020||India||J-K administration may keep internet suspended for a few more days||The Jammu and Kashmir administration is contemplating a move to suspend mobile internet connectivity for a few more days, though prepaid mobile phones were restored late on Friday night.Authorities had snapped mobile internet across Kashmir as an operation to nab Hizbul Mujahideen operational commander Riyaz Naikoo was underway at Gulzapora Beighpora on Wednesday, and only broadband connectivity through fixed line telephones was available in the region. The police have apprehensions that Naikoo’s killing could trigger massive clashes like those witnessed after the killing of Burhan Wani in 2016, and believe it would be better for mobile internet services to remain suspended for some more time. Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they didn’t want to take any chances this time. “After the killing of Naikoo, there were clashes at some places. To prevent the spread of the clashes in different parts of South Kashmir, the internet was snapped. It could be restored with a few days,” said a senior police officer. People familiar with developments said the government had decided to restore mobile phone services on Friday night. However, a high-level meeting decided that mobile internet connectivity would remain suspended till the 17th day of the holy month of Ramzan (May 11). The day coincides with Badr, the first and decisive battle in the history of Islam when the first few hundred adherents of the religion took on their powerful opponents in Arabia and won, according to historical accounts. There are also inputs from intelligence agencies that militants might try to target security force installations on the day of Badr.The intelligence agencies had earlier issued warnings about attacks on this particular day. Last year too, there were similar reports about possible attacks on the 17th of Ramzan.Already, 3G and 4G services have been barred in Kashmir despite numerous appeals from mainstream political leaders and only 2G services were restored, resulting in very slow internet connectivity. Officials in Jammu and Kashmir contend that restoration of 4G services could give rise to anti-national activities and militancy. Kashmir’s divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole described the suspension of mobile internet connectivity as a temporary measure and said services would be restored very soon.Director general of police Dilbag Singh told Hindustan Times that after the killing of Naikoo, the Hizb had become headless and this was a setback for the group. “Now it has to be seen how long Pakistan will keep this group headless,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-administration-may-keep-internet-suspended-for-a-few-more-days/story-6MJo3mb8ftDSCiTg87YCxL.html
09-05-2020||India||Containment zones boost Chennai’s efforts to efforts to flatten Covid-19 curve||Tin sheets cordon off both ends of the West Madha Church street in North Chennai’s Royapuram, where a social work graduate student lives with her parents. Her lane is one of 357 containment zones in the city and 711 in Tamil Nadu’s 36 districts. “Last week there was a positive case discovered 2-3 houses down the street above the neighbourhood supermarket,” the 21-year-old told HT. “After that these tin sheets came up overnight. It is when the virus was next door that fear and anxiety gripped the area,” she said. The first containment zone in North Chennai came up as early as April 2 after which the corporation has been learning on the job, officials said. “Initially our containment zones were defined in a very expansive manner,” said a senior official. Drones with speakers flew overhead to check if people were congregating on roof tops and to make announcements. “Then we realised that this is counterproductive. If we close down a large area, then it will be impossible to monitor. It made more sense to define a more compact containment zone and enforce containment of a smaller group of families,” the official said.Now, on average, each containment zone monitors 150 families. One case is enough to contain an area. The transformation from a neighbourhood into a containment zone is swift. First, the person who tested positive is taken to hospital, then all his family and direct contacts are traced, tested and quarantined and third, in consultation with the police, the area is cordoned off. “We have registers outside containment zones which records how many people come in and go out every day. Movement is severely restricted for emergency cases only. We are working to ensure groceries and vegetables are supplied every day outside the barricades,” said the official.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Furthermore, zonal classification of districts are based on hotspot analysis set down by the Centre. Red zones or hotspot districts are demarcated on the basis of active cases; green zones are districts with either zero confirmed cases till date or no confirmed case in the last 21 days; while the orange zones are districts that are neither red nor green. As of May 5, Tamil Nadu has 12 districts are in the red zone, while 25 are in the orange zone. Krishnagiri, which was a green zone, was redesignated an orange zone after one positive case was reported on Wednesday. Though the first case in the city was reported on March 7, TN created a containment zone plan after a religious conference of the Tablighi Jamaat held in New Delhi in mid-March was declared a hotspot. By April 1, the state had rolled out a detailed plan to track the attendees, their family members, and their primary contacts to test them for Covid-19. Health workers conducted door-to-door surveillance of the attendees’ families across several districts and authorities were instructed to cordon off a radius of 7-8 km around the attendees’ homes. In all, 1480 attendees and their contacts were traced and tested. Since the beginning of the week, Chennai’s wholesale fruit and vegetable market, Koyembedu, has been shut as it was found to be a Covid-19 hotspot; officials fear that the number of people who will need to be tracked may well be more than those associated with the religious conference. Of the 508 positive cases on May 5, a large number were linked to the wholesale market.The case of ChennaiThe state which has been in continuous lockdown since the last week of March, saw its caseload grow by 2089 in April; Chennai alone accounted for 880 of those. Of the 15 containment zones in Chennai, six including zone 5 where the 21-year-old graduate student lives, is under the scanner of the Corporation. At a press conference last week, Corporation commissioner G Prakash said that northern Chennai, which accounts for a majority of the city’s cases, will see further containment efforts.Over the weekend, the Tamil Nadu government announced a graded relaxation for commercial and industrial units across the state; this does not apply to any containment area. Offices were also allowed to resume work with 20 persons or 25% of the work force, whichever is lower. The government has begun to offer e-passes to allow people to move within districts, between districts and even travel outside the state specifically for marriages, funerals or medical emergencies. The government has also started a website in which migrants are expected to register their details, in order to return to their home states. Over 1.18 lakh people are reported to have registered already. Yet, on the first workday of this week, crowds thronged various parts of Chennai. This was worrying, because physical distancing and other safeguards remain vital to preventing the spread of the virus. Officials said that they have found it tough to enforce the lockdown even inside containment zones. A senior corporation official who did not wish to be named told HT: “To be honest, we can’t say we have done a perfect job, but we are doing our best. In a way these containment zones are like imprisoning people in their homes. We try our best to explain to people that we don’t have an alternative.” Last week, protests broke out in parts of Royapuram, where residents gathered in large groups and argued with police personnel at a barricade to allow them to go out to purchase groceries.Ali Basha, a 49-year-old who runs a tuition centre in Thiruvottiyur in North Chennai has been providing relief materials to families in his area since mid-April. “There was also a rumour doing the rounds in the early days of the lockdown that salty air from the sea breeze helps fight the virus. Since North Chennai is mainly on the coast, most people bought into this Whatsapp forward and didn’t really care much about the social distancing,” he said.In other parts of North Chennai, residents that HT spoke to, said they found inner roads to get around police barricades in containment zones. “Only 40% of those who step out really need to. The rest are people who are just curious how the city looks under a lockdown. They show up with their mobile phones so they can video call friends or relatives and give them a glimpse on how the roads or marketplaces look,” Basha said. Crowding around vegetable markets has also been a severe issue in the state prompting Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to note early last week, “In corporations like Chennai, Coimbatore and Trichy, the problem lies in vegetable markets. No matter how much you tell people, they refuse to follow lockdown restrictions. They are playful.”Turning greenThis is not to say that other districts have not been able to reduce the spread of the pandemic-causing virus, Sars-Cov-2, during the lockdown. Erode in western Tamil Nadu, for instance, has slowly fought its way out of a red zone. The district currently has no active Covid-19 cases. Last month the district was in the news when two Thai nationals who were part of the New Delhi religious conference tested positive on March 21. “Every single case we had in Erode was asymptomatic,” Erode deputy director of Health Services Dr S Soundammal told HT.The district has not seen a single positive case since April 15 entirely due to rigorous contact tracing in the initial days with testing and strict quarantining that followed. “Our last active case was recorded on April 14 after which we have not got a single case. This is despite 100-200 samples tested every day still,” said Soundammal. “Our happiest day was April 28 when the last of the four cases we had were discharged. That day we realised that we had not had a case for the previous fortnight.”The district administration is now focused on containing crossovers from across the district borders, even though the state has begun to allow inter-district travel. “We have got lists of people who have crossed over into our district, some who had passes to travel, some who didn’t. Some people who have walked across the Cauvery river, or through forests. We have strictly closed borders and maintained records and enforced a 14-day quarantine for anyone coming from outside,” said Soundammal. “For it to be a complete success story it will take time. We are in the middle of the journey,” she said.Flattening the curve or reducing the spread of the infection now means that a district has to find its way back to being a green zone. One way to do that is to curtail people from red zones mixing with people from other zones. However, former city health officer of Chennai and senior epidemiologist Dr P Kuganantham noted that epidemiologists are not worried about the increasing number of positive cases. “The first step to arrest the spread of the epidemic is identifying more number of cases,” he said.The more a state tests, the more the numbers would increase. Official data from May 1 shows that Chennai has tested 5225 samples per million population while the state has tested 1685 samples per million population till now.“People are alarmed about increasing number of cases but they don’t understand one important point, positivity and illness are two different things. Testing positive amongst the younger and middle age groups is not going to harm them unless they suffer from any co-morbid conditions. It is only bad if elderly people with co-morbidities are going to be infected,” he said. “This lockdown has has postponed or delayed outbursts of the epidemic, and given more chance for elderly people to be isolated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/containment-zones-boost-chennai-s-efforts-to-efforts-to-flatten-covid-19-curve/story-O3emY2Yl73I95aoXQq6rVL.html
09-05-2020||India||Congress ups ante against ruling BJP in Gujarat as Covid cases surge||The Congress in Gujarat has upped the ante against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, blaming the “Namaste Trump” event organised in Ahmedabad on February 24 for a surge in Coronavirus infections in the state.The opposition party demanded an independent probe by a special investigation team (SIT) into the matter, and said it will soon approach the Gujarat high court against the state government’s “criminal negligence”, since the event held during US President Donald Trump’s visit allegedly led to community transmission of the virus.Trump participated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the February 24 road show in Ahmedabad that was witnessed by thousands of people.After the road show, the two leaders addressed a gathering of more than 100,000 people at Motera cricket stadium, run by the Gujarat Cricket Association. Till Friday, Gujarat reported 7,403 Covid-19 cases, of which 5,260 were from Ahmedabad district alone. Of the 449 people who died due to the disease in the state, 343 were from the city.At least 204 patients have died in Ahmedabad’s Civil Hospital, while 92 died at Sardar Vallabhbhai Hospital.“We will soon file a petition in the Gujarat high court demanding a judicial inquiry into the event through an SIT having field experts as its members,” said Gujarat Congress chief Amit Chavda.“We will demand action against the government, GCA and the Trump Abhivadan Samiti (a committee formed to organise the event) through this petition,” he added.Chavda alleged the Coronavirus entered Gujarat and spread among people due to the Namaste Trump event as thousands of foreigners came to Ahmedabad ahead of the US president’s visit.“People were asked to stand shoulder to shoulder on the road to greet the leaders. Lakhs of people were brought to the stadium in buses. This triggered the spread of the virus. This event was not a mistake, but criminal negligence,” he said.The World Health Organization (WHO) had said in January that the coronavirus spreads from one person to another, and asked all countries to refrain from organising large gatherings, the Congress has maintained.“Despite such warning, Namaste Trump was planned for political gains and permission was granted by the Gujarat government. Because of the Namaste Trump event, not only Gujarat but the whole country is paying the price,” the party alleged.“Is it a coincidence that Ahmedabad, which hosted the event, has become one of the worst affected cities?” asked the Congress, while claiming the Gujarat model of development was a lie that has completely devastated not only the state but the entire nation.However, the Gujarat unit of the BJP dismissed the allegations as baseless, and said the event was organised well before the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic.“The first Coronavirus case in Gujarat was reported on March 20, almost a month after the event. Chavda is making baseless allegations for vote bank politics,” said Gujarat BJP spokesman Prashant Vala.The state government’s offer to give land within seven days and all clearances to set up industries in 15 days to firms wanting to shift out of China also faced criticism from the Congress, which accused chief minister Vijay Rupani of being insensitive towards migrant workers and the country’s small and medium businesses.“Disgusted by @vijayrupanibjp ji’s announcement of inviting foreign investors. #Gujarat govts pathetic treatment towards our #migrant workers during #coronavirus will remain a blot forever. Our #MSMEs are on death bed. Give them a stimulus package before inviting foreign Industries,” said senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil.His colleague Arjun Modhwadia also attacked the chief minister.“I am happy to learn CM @vijayrupanibjp ji opens up Guj doors for Foreign investment & industries - to boost state’s economy & market. But what about local MSME dying? They need Stimulus package, relaxation in taxes. Why this step motherly behaviour Rupani ji?” he asked.The state government has also announced that new industries will not be bound by labour laws for 1,200 days (3.2 years) from the start of manufacturing, to attract foreign direct investment and local investment after the pandemic.“At present, a large number of industries and MNCs from Japan, the USA, Korea and other European nations are willing to shift their production from China to other countries. We have decided to coordinate with various Central ministries, including the external affairs ministry, and approach missions of different countries to attract such industries to Gujarat,” Rupani said in a video message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-ups-ante-against-ruling-bjp-in-gujarat-as-covid-cases-surge/story-rJSHbsiBSzHNxRklIauAUN.html

Although mobile call services were restored on Saturday,internet connectivity remained suspended.Employees of software development companies, who have been struggling with slow internet speeds since January, are among the worst hit.“Most of my team members have been working from home due to the ongoing lockdown restrictions. But the suspension of mobile internet services has disrupted their work. How can they work from home?” asked Majid Ahmad, a Srinagar-based administrator of a software development firm.The J&K administration restored 2G mobile internet connectivity in January after a Supreme Court order, as normal life in the Kashmir Valley was paralysed after the Centre revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 and split it into two Union territories -- J&K and Ladakh.The administration has ignored growing demands for 4G mobile internet connectivity and only allowed 2G as a stop-gap arrangement.“I was out of Kashmir last time when the mobile internet connectivity was suspended. Now, I’m stuck here for the past two months because of the lockdown. I’m feeling helpless,” said Gowhar Ahmad, who works for an international development agency. “The suspension of internet defeats the WFH concept ...{which is } being promoted across the world amid the Covid-19 outbreak,” he added.Mohammad Asim, an engineering student who returned home from Uttar Pradesh after his college closed due to Covid-19 outbreak, cannot attend online classes because of the suspension of mobile internet connectivity.“Earlier, slow connectivity was a challenge. Now, there is no connectivity at all. How can I attend my online classes with zero connectivity?” he asked.A resident of Srinagar’s Old City, who didn’t wish to be named, said the UT administration should have suspended mobile internet connectivity only in areas such as Pulwama where protests erupted.“Why have the authorities put the entire population in Kashmir Valley at such an inconvenience amid the lockdown restrictions?” he asked.Pandurang K Pole, divisional commissioner, Kashmir, said the authorities had been compelled to suspend mobile internet connectivity because a spurt of violence in the valley. “Mobile internet connectivity has been suspended as a precautionary measure for a temporary period. We’ll restore it soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-amid-pandemic-snapped-internet-services-in-kashmir-irk-professionals-students/story-gvnxwrDTov0bSQ58vNbWTO.html

At least 1589 positive cases are now linked to the Koyembedu market cluster.However the cabinet met on May 2 and discussed ways in which activities can resume in the state under the guildelines offered by the union ministry of home affairs.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageStarting Monday, shops selling essentials goods like vegetables and groceries will open from 6 am to 7 pm within Chennai corporation limits, while they will be permitted to stay open from 10 am to 7pm in the rest of the state. Similarly, standalone and neighbourhood shops will remain open from 10.30am to 6pm in Chennai, and 10 am to 7pm in the rest of the state. Tea shops can operate in all parts of the state, except within containment zones, however, customers would not be allowed to remain within the shops. Petrol pumps in Chennai region will be open from 6 am to 6 pm; but they will operate 24X7 on central and state highways. Private offices in Chennai region can operate with 33% workforce from 10.30 am to 6 pm. The government order did not specify if public transportation would be allowed in the state, but added that all restrictions and exemptions specified earlier would continue.The state has categorized 12 districts, including Chennai, as red zones while the remaining 26 are orange zones.The state had announced the opening of liquor shops run by Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC), a government firm which sells alcohol in the state, in all districts except Chennai on Thursday. Heavy rush was witnessed at most places with people standing in serpentine queues even as the move to allow sale of liquor came in for flak from opposition parties and others, who raised apprehensions that it would lead to further spread of the novel coronavirus.However, a division bench of the high court took note of long queues and assembly of large crowds outside liquor shops, and ordered the closure of alcohol vending outlets in Tamil Nadu till the lifting of lockdown. The court observed that about 3,850 shops across the state were opened, and a record sale of Rs 175 crore was made.“It is also reported that the number of police personnel being infected with Covid-19 disease is also on the rise and deploying them for controlling the crowded tipplers before the TASMAC shops would also put their life at risk, besides preventing them from discharging their duties in places, where their services are really required”, the High Court had observed.TASMAC on Saturday moved the Supreme Court challenging the order for closure of state-run liquor outlets on the ground that there was total violation of guidelines meant to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.witnessed at most places with people standing in serpentine queues even as the move to allow sale of liquor came in for flak from opposition parties and others, who raised apprehensions that it would lead to further spread of the novel coronavirus.However, a division bench of the high court took note of long queues and assembly of large crowds outside liquor shops, and ordered the closure of alcohol vending outlets in Tamil Nadu till the lifting of lockdown.

09-05-2020||India||5 students booked in MP for social media post on Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar||Five students including three minors were booked in Madhya Pradesh after a complaint by a Bharatiya Janata Party worker against them for a comment on social media about Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar, police said. The complainant said that the comments “insulted a reputed person and could create law and order issues.”Though the FIR was registered against the students on Sunday last but the incident came to the fore on Friday when a group of students and some social activists launched a campaign against the police station in Morena in the Gwalior-Chambal region to quash the FIR. No arrests have been made so far in the case. The students’ post reportedly questioned the way that the Union minister wore a face mask during a meeting held through video conferencing. “They posted a screen image of Tomar on Facebook and wrote, “This is the way a mask is worn. One should learn from the minister. Pls make him understand this is mask not knickers’, said an officer of the police station.Yash Sharma, a BJP worker and the complainant, said, “In this pandemic situation, these comments hurt the sentiments of people. A comparison of mask with knickers is insulting for such a reputed personality, his followers and other people.”Morena, superintendent of police, Asit Yadav said, “We received a complaint at Porsa police station in Morena on May 3. The FIR was registered against five persons under section 505 (2) (circulating a statement which create or promote enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes), section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant) and under section 51 of disaster management act, which is in force due to Covid-19.”However, one of the students named in the FIR defended the post, saying they “just wanted to send out a message” about the correct way of wearing a face mask.“During the video conferencing held on April 24, Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar had not covered his nose properly with the mask. We just wanted to send out a message to people that this was not the correct way of wearing a face mask,” Ajay Pratap Singh said.Another student Aditya Singh Tomar who runs a local social group in Morena said that the post should not offend anyone as those involved didn’t make the comments intentionally to hurt anyone.“The post should not offend anyone. It is a humorous post by three school students and two college students (Ajay Pratap Singh and Aman Singh) who are also a part of our group. They did nothing wrong or objectionable and didn’t make comments intentionally to hurt anyone. The police action violates the right to freedom of speech. We will continue our campaign till the FIR is quashed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-students-booked-in-mp-for-social-media-post-on-union-minister-narendra-singh-tomar/story-onRjRZRZxNUoEXvn3tTUPK.html

Narendra Modi ji to intervene in this matter by talking to the CMs of the respective states who are not allowing these people to come back home,” Pawar said in a tweet.He did not name any state but Bengal and Union home minister Amit Shah have had a war of words over transportation of migrant workers. Shah had said the Centre was not receiving “expected support” from her government in helping migrant workers reach home. The ruling Trinamool Congress in Bengal hit back at Shah and accused him of misleading people “with lies”.The transportation of migrant workers has become a touchy issue. In Maharashtra’s Aurangabad, 16 migrant workers were run over by a goods train on Friday morning as they slept on the tracks after a long journey on foot in a desperate attempt to find transport to go back to their hometowns hundreds of kilometres away in Madhya Pradesh.In another tweet, Pawar said Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Railways minister Piyush Goyal have assured him that arrangements are in place for sending migrant workers back to their homes.“The CM of Maharashtra has assured me of arrangements for the transportation of these workers wanting to go back to their home states. State Transport buses will be used for their travel. The Union Railway Minister has also assured of arrangements of travel by trains for the same,” Pawar said in another tweet.The NCP chief said he had spoken to Goyal about the migrant workers.“Had a telephonic conversation with Shri @OfficeofUT - Chief Minister of Maharashtra and Shri @PiyushGoyal - the Union Railway Minister regarding the issue of migrant workers,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-asks-pm-modi-to-speak-to-cms-not-allowing-migrants-to-return/story-5I27jA3DzITAYLwR6PKK8J.html

The attachment order was issued against the AJL and Moti Lal Vora, chairman-cum-managing director. The ED also launched a money laundering probe on allegations that plot number C-17, Sector 6 at Panchkula in Haryana was allotted to AJL in 1982 but was taken back by the Estate Officer, Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) a decade later, October 30, 1992 since AJL did not comply with the conditions of allotment.Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda faced criminal proceedings for allegedly reallocating the institutional plot in Panchkula. “Hooda, the then CM, Haryana/chairman HUDA, blatantly by misusing his official position dishonestly allotted the said plot afresh in the guise of re-allotment to the AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of necessary conditions/ policy of HUDA vide order dated 28.08.2005,” the ED’s statement said. It also said the decision caused wrongful loss to HUDA and wrongful gain to AJL.According to ED, the investigation under PMLA revealed that Vora and Hooda were involved in the process of illegal possession of “crime proceeds.” The PMLA defines proceeds of crime as “any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence or the value of any such property”. “It is further revealed that, the accused used this proceeds of crime–plot at Panchkula – for availing loans from Syndicate Bank, New Delhi by way of pledging it for approval of construction of building at plot near Kala Nagar in Bandra (east) held in the name of AJL valuing at Rs 120 crore. It is a 9 storey building having two basements and total built up area is 15,000 square meters. Thus, the said asset at Mumbai, germinated out of proceeds of crime, has been attached to the extent of Rs. 16.38 crore,” read the statement.The Bandra plot issue came under the spotlight after BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a case accusing Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi of trying to take over the National Herald’s properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-herald-case-ed-attaches-part-of-bandra-building-worth-rs-16-crore/story-aNW0NfqNhfZB30kUuOD3YM.html

Taking their concerns in mind, he decided to break his silence and address the issue.“…Therefore today I decided to clarify that I am completely healthy and not suffering from any disease,” he wrote in the statement.Taking a jibe at the social media posts that have made uncharitable remarks about his health, Shah, pointing to the Hindu way of thought, said such rumours go on to strengthen one’s health.“I hope people will stop speculating about my health and let me focus on my work and also pay attention to their own work. I am grateful to all the party workers and my well-wishers who have been calling to find out about my health,” he said.BJP president JP Nadda also condemned the rumours and crude mentions about Shah’s health. “Making crude remarks about the home minister’s health is highly condemnable. Spreading such misleading things about one’s health shows the mentality of those people. I strongly condemn this and pray to God to give wisdom to such people,” said Nadda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-on-negative-buzz-around-his-health-such-rumours-strengthen-you/story-RoYX9dyt5G9p78cNOEZL4K.html

It’s the only human disease to be eradicated so far. A lesson we must take is: when the Earth globe europe-africa unites behind science and public health measures we can defeat diseases and protect lives and livelihoods.” #OnThisDay 40 years ago, #smallpox was made history.It's the only human disease to be eradicated so far.A lesson we must take is: when the 🌍 unites behind science and public health measures we can defeat diseases and protect lives and livelihoods. pic.twitter.com/9GgNwtI0wgSmallpox was eradicated on the back of a 10-year-old effort spearheaded by the WHO involving thousands of health workers around the world to administer half a billion vaccinations. “When WHO’’s smallpox eradication campaign was launched in 1967, one of the ways countries raised awareness about smallpox was through postage stamps – when social media like Twitter and Facebook was not even on the horizon,” World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.The stamp recognises the global solidarity in fighting smallpox and honours millions of people working together, from world leaders and international organisations to rural doctors and community health workers, to eradicate smallpox.The WHO chief said that many of the basic public health tools that were used successfully to eradicate smallpox are the same tools that have been used to respond to Ebola and Covid--19: disease surveillance, case finding, contact tracing, and mass communication campaigns to inform affected populations.The WHO is now working with many partners to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 to control the transmission of the virus, Ghebreyesus said.The UN said that the successful smallpox eradication programme yielded vital knowledge and tools for the field of disease surveillance, the benefits of vaccination and the importance of health promotion in fighting other diseases.In May 1980, the 33rd World Health Assembly issued its official declaration that “the world and all its peoples have won freedom from smallpox.”“There are many lessons to learn from the eradication of smallpox that can help fight the Covid-19 pandemic today and prepare for future pandemics,” the UN said.“The eradication of smallpox offers us hope and shows us what global solidarity can achieve,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-agencies-commemorate-40th-anniversary-of-smallpox-eradication-with-a-stamp/story-QKDMKJXP5rNc0ulpexhgLJ.html

He said many people have even tweeted praying for his death.“The country is currently fighting a global epidemic like corona and as I keep busy being the home minister of the country, I did not pay attention to all of this. When this came to my notice late at night, I thought that all these people should enjoy their imaginary thoughts. So I did not give any clarification.“But millions of my party workers and my well wishers have expressed a lot of concern since the last two days. I cannot ignore their concern. So I want to clarify today that I am perfectly healthy and I do not have any disease,” said Shah.The home minister expressed his gratitude to well-wishers and all party workers for showing their concern about his health.“I have no ill-will or malice towards people who have spread these rumours. Thank you to you too,” Shah added.Drawing from Hindu beliefs, Shah said it is believed that such rumours strengthen one’s health. “Therefore, I hope that all such people will leave these meaningless things and let me do my work and will also do their own work,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-debunks-rumours-surrounding-his-health-i-am-healthy-and-not-suffering-from-any-disease/story-dchI3mhTm8cb7HBuk5hX8K.html
09-05-2020||India||‘Have 7-stage plan to bring back migrants’: Trinamool on Amit Shah’s letter||West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Saturday rubbished Union home minister Amit Shah’s allegations that the state isn’t helping the Centre in bringing back migrant workers and accused him of spreading lies and playing politics amid an epidemic.“Amit Shah’s letter is full of outright lies. Two trains have already reached and eight more are expected to reach West Bengal in the coming three days. Overall, 80,000 people have been brought back using various means of transport,” said TMC national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien.“Amit Shah just woke up from his 40-day sleep but when one writes a letter still in his sleep, the person gets the facts all wrong,” he said, adding the Union home minister was playing politics on the issue.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief Abhishek Banerjee tweeted that Shah should apologise if he fails to substantiate the charges in his letter with facts.Shah told Banerjee in a letter that West Bengal was meting out “injustice” to Bengali migrant workers stranded across the country by not allowing “shramik” (worker) trains run by the railways to reach the state.In his communication, Shah also pointed out the Centre has facilitated more than 200,000 migrant workers to reach home and that workers from West Bengal are eager to return.O’Brien presented a document showing two trains each from Punjab and Tamil Nadu and three from Karnataka are in the draft schedule of special trains as of May 8, and they will reach seven districts of West Bengal with 12,714 passengers between May 10 and 12. Another train is scheduled to arrive in Malda district on May 10 with 1,721 passengers from Telangana.“We have a seven-stage plan to bring back migrants. We are doing it in a staggered manner. We did not announce a lockdown without an iota of planning. We don’t want to bring back the migrant workers without a proper plan as we are considering all possible implications to find the best way to do it,” O’Brien said. The opposition Congress, however, contended the West Bengal government gave the green light to the eight trains only after receiving Shah’s letter.“The chief minister has given permission to eight more trains after Shah wrote to the state,” said Congress’ leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is the MP from Berhampore in West Bengal. Chowdhury earlier said he had spoken with Shah and railway minister Piyush Goyal to ensure the safe return of migrant workers but his efforts hit a roadblock due to West Bengal’s lack of interest. O’Brien rubbished Chowdhury’s charge and said, “Our government gave permission to these trains before Shah’s letter, as is evident from the date in the document I presented.”Shah’s letter to the West Bengal chief minister stated, “Migrants from West Bengal are also eager to reach home. Central govt is facilitating but we are not getting expected support from W.B. State Government, which is not allowing the trains to reach W.B. This is injustice with W.B. migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-seven-stage-plan-to-bring-back-migrants-tmc-says-after-amit-shah-s-letter/story-6GU3nspCakOuCxLZ7frjvM.html

The angry villagers stopped them and kept the bodies on the road in front of the company gate to stage a dharna.Watch | Vizag gas leak: Locals protest outside LG Polymers demanding closure of plant The police had a tough time controlling the protesters even as the force was mobilised in large numbers in view of Director General of Police Gautam Sawang’s visit to the plant.A woman protester fell on the feet of the DGP demanding justice for the people by taking immediate action against the company. However, she was taken away by the women constables posted at the spot. The DGP was escorted out of the premises with heavy police security.“It has been two days since the cases were booked against the management of LG Polymers. But no action was taken against any of the company officials till date. We shall not allow the company to run under any circumstances,” an angry villager told the reporters.With the situation getting tense, the police had to resort to lathi-charge to disperse them. They bundled scores of protesters into vans and took them away to the Gopalapatnam police station. But within no time, many others assembled at the spot and gate-crashed into the company premises.Visakhapatnam police commissioner RK Meena quickly intervened and, with the help of additional forces, managed to force the protesters out of the company premises. The police managed to shift the bodies from the spot to Venkatapuram village for cremation.State minister for tourism M Srinivasa Rao and other YSR Congress party leaders tried to convince the angry villagers, saying that the government would make efforts to see that the LG Polymers is moved out.“The government has appointed a high-powered committee to probe the accident and take stern action against the company. Please bear with us,” Srinivasa Rao appealed to the villagers with folded hands.The DGP told reporters that the Styrene gas leakage was under complete control and it would be neutralised by evening.“We are not here to protect anybody. The investigation has begun and we shall take action based on the investigation. There is no need for the villagers to get agitated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesters-stop-ambulance-keep-bodies-on-road-demanding-vizag-plant-be-shut/story-LJqvfYnb0DjaJ8nfYxZhrN.html
09-05-2020||India||‘Baseless narrative’: India rejects Pakistan’s claim on reduced water flow in Chenab||Pakistan has said that water discharge in Chenab river has come down significantly, a claim that has been termed by India as “baseless narrative”.In a letter to Indian Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Saxena sent on Wednesday, his Pakistani counterpart Syed Mohammed Meher Ali Shah stated that the discharge at Marala Headworks on Chenab, which flows into Pakistan from the Indian side, has unexpectedly reduced to 18,700 cusecs from 31,853 cusecs.He also asked Saxena to look into the situation and apprise him. The Indian Commissioner for Indus Waters termed the claim as “another baseless narrative” by Pakistan and said the matter has been examined. “The discharges at Akhnoor and Sidhra which are the last gauge and discharge sites on Chenab and Tawi rivers respectively in India have been found consistent and show no significant variation during the stated period,” Saxena told PTI on Friday. He added the same response has been conveyed to Pakistan advising it to get the matter examined instead.The Permanent Indus Commission, formed under the Indus Waters Treaty was signed between India and Pakistan in 1960. Indus commissioners of both the countries act as representatives of the respective governments for the treaty matters.The treaty provides for both the commissioners to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan.It specifies that the waters of three the eastern rivers namely Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, have been allocated exclusively to India. Of the total 168 million acre-feet, India’s share of water from the three allotted rivers is 33 million acre-feet, which constitutes nearly 20 per cent. India uses 93-94 per cent of water. The western rivers, namely Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, are allocated to Pakistan with India given some rights like agriculture, navigation, domestic use and also the unrestricted rights to develop hydroelectric power projects within the specified parameters of design and operations.In March, the annual meeting between Indus Commissioners was postponed after New Delhi proposed deferment of consultations due to the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown.The Indus Commissioners are supposed to hold meeting by March 31 every year, according to the Indus Waters Treaty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baseless-narrative-india-rejects-pakistan-s-claim-on-reduced-water-flow-in-chenab/story-aUjJeHVUCtreSsIVEAnTmI.html

It is difficult for us to do as rent for the shop and salaries are very costly,” Babu added.The order from the state’s excise department on Friday evening said that the permission is applicable to standalone CL-4 (clubs), CL-7 (hotels and lodges) and CL-9 (bar) licence holders, only till their stocks last. The takeaway of food has also been permitted.The conditions laid down by the government include the sale of sealed bottles only while maintaining social distancing during the sale and wearing of masks.Transporting liquor stocks to CL-2 (MRP) outlets is allowed, the order said adding that permission is not applicable to outlets in containment zones.The order also clarifies that procurement of fresh liquor stocks from the Karnataka State Beverage Corporation Ltd (KSBCL) depots by clubs, bars and restaurants during the period is not allowed.The permission for the sale between 9am and 7pm was given following petitions by associations of bars and hotels raising concerns that their stock would have to be destroyed if drinks such as beer which has a shelf life of six months are not sold.In a separate order, the department allowed Metro Cash and Carry to sell liquor till May 17, with similar conditions of timing, social distancing, wearing of masks among others.They too can’t operate in containment zones announced by the government.A similar order has been issued allowing standalone wine boutiques to sell wines, with similar conditions, but no last date has been set.The government had earlier allowed CL-2 (retail shops) and CL-11C (state-run retail shops such as MSIL) to sell liquor between 9am and 7pm only in areas that are outside Covid-19 containment zones from May 4.The sale of alcohol had stopped from the night of March 24 as the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease took effect. After more than 40 days of lockdown, the Karnataka government had finally agreed to resume sales from May 4 but had said that only about 4,500 standalone liquor stores could sell whereas bars, restaurants and stores located in shopping complexes and malls continue to be shut to ensure adequate social distancing.Immediately after re-opening on Monday, it had sold alcohol worth Rs 45 crore.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had announced a Rs 1,610 crore Covid-19 relief package on Wednesday and said that it would be primarily funded by a hike of 11% in excise tax. This was on top of the 6% hike which was announced in the budget presented in March indicating a cumulative 17% hike in retail prices.The state had earned Rs 19,701 crore of revenue from the sale of liquor in 2019-20—till February as the budget was presented on March 5. The revenue target from the sale of alcohol this year is Rs 22,700 crore.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-karnataka-allows-bars-clubs-restaurants-to-sell-liquor-as-takeaway/story-uCDc8p2BxSv6N6j994wW3K.html

We are taking good care of them,” Abhishek Banerjee, who is also the chief minister’s nephew, said.Amit Shah had pointed out in his letter that the Centre was not receiving the “expected support” from the state government in helping stranded migrant workers from West Bengal. “West Bengal government is not allowing trains with migrants reaching the state. This is injustice with WB migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them,” Amit Shah had said in his letter to Mamata Banerjee.The issue of migrant workers is the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the West Bengal government amid a row over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Centre and the state have exchanged allegations over the criteria for reporting deaths from the infection, and while While Bengal says the Centre is trying to politicise a public health crisis, the Union government maintains that state officials are ignoring repeated warnings to step up the fight against the disease.Federal officials have said that the region has not conducted adequate tests and that there has been mismanagement over identifying hotspots and containing them.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla also slammed the state government for a very low rate of testing and high rate of mortality, 13.2%, by far the highest for any state. The Centre has also accused the state government of not allowing cross-border movement of goods trucks to Bangladesh.There are 1,678 Covid-19 cases and 160 deaths in West Bengal until Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-is-lying-tmc-shoots-back-after-amit-shah-s-letter-to-mamata-banerjee-on-migrants/story-fBhv1nJDVzvVQ90CVgWUfN.html

The IMR has been reduced from 52 (2005) to 22 (2018), according to the latest data released by the Registrar General of India in the SRS bulletin on Friday. “The current national average of infant mortality rate stands at 32 much higher than that of J-K,” the spokesman said. “The entire Health and Medical Education Department with active support from the National Health Mission (NHM) has put in strenuous efforts to provide essential newborn care at government health institutions across the Union Territory,” Atal Dulloo, the financial commissioner in Health and Medical Education Department, said. Special newborn care units (SNCUs) have been established in 27 districts and other equivalent hospitals, three NICUs, newborn stabilisation units (NBSUs) and newborn care corners (NBCCs) have been set up in 264 delivery points with financial and technical support from the National Health Mission, he said. “The progress in scaling up the interventions to save the lives of the newborn has substantially accelerated during recent times leading to reduction in child mortality indicators,” Dulloo said. Some of the measures in this regard include strengthening of NICUs and SNCUs, implementation of Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram, hiring of manpower, etc. To further decrease the infant mortality rate in the Union Territory to single digit by 2022, an action plan has been developed which is being implemented at various levels, the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-witnesses-decline-in-infant-mortality-rate/story-NgbaNFuvNfSO9mdSNdWyVI.html

This is injustice with WB migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them,”Shah wrote.States with large migrant populations like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have received the maximum number of workers returning home on Shramik trains.West Bengal, senior officials said, has received only two special of the special trains so far and hasn’t cleared any more trains. Until Friday, more than 250,000 migrants had been sent home on 251 Shramik trains.The issue of migrant workers is the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the West Bengal government amid a row over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The two sides have clashed over a visit by interministerial central teams (IMCTs) for an assessment of the situation in seven West Bengal districts. While the teams claimed that they didn’t get any support from the state government in assessing measures put in place to control Covid-19, the state government accused the Centre of politicising a public health crisis.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla also on Thursday slammed the West Bengal government for a very low rate of testing and high rate of mortality – 13.2%, - by far the highest for any state. The Centre has also accused the Trinamool Congress government of not allowing cross-border movement of goods trucks to Bangladesh, potentially jeoparadising trade commitments made to the neighbour..Bengal has reported 1,678 Covid-19 positive cases and 160 deaths until Saturday morning. The ministry of home affairs has told all the states that inter-state movement of only distressed migrant workers, students, pilgrims and tourists, who had moved from their home towns or workplaces before the coronavirus lockdown took effect on March 25, and could not return on account of restrictions, is allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-mamata-banerjee-not-getting-expected-support-from-bengal/story-8NhI9av1FyZffgK6ZSjCrJ.html

Nair didn’t stop and started running towards Marine Drive following which cops ran after him.Also read: Mumbai Police’s take on ‘card against humanity’ game is on point “As he stopped, our men tried to overpower him but he started to randomly wave the chopper towards them and tried to kill an officer by attacking on his neck. Luckily, the officer dodged him and sustained an injury on his shoulder. He attacked other two cops who sustained injuries on their hands,” Mrityunjay Hiremath, senior police inspector of Marine Drive police station told HT.Night round police inspector Jitendra Kadam, sub-inspector Sachin Shelke and constable Sagar Shelke were taken to JJ hospital and after primary medication, they were taken to Marine Drive police station and given a separate room for recovery and rest.

09-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Bombay HC tells Maharashtra to protect Arthur Road jail inmates||The Bombay high court has asked the Maharashtra government to ensure that Covid-19 does not spread any further in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail where 77 inmates and 26 staff members have tested positive for the virus.Justice Bharati Dangre’s direction came on Friday while hearing a bail application on Friday filed by an inmate, Ali Akbar Shroff, citing medical reasons.The prisoner had sought temporary bail claiming that he had become more vulnerable due to the spread of Covid-19 in Arthur Road jail.The judge said that the authorities need not be reminded of the rights of inmates to safe and healthy environment and even while in incarceration they equally enjoy the right to life as those in the outside world.Shroff’s counsel, senior advocate Abad Ponda pointed out that the 43-year-old is a chronic patient of diabetes, hyper-tension and high blood pressure. Ponda added that Shroff also has sinus problem and required constant medical treatment and supervision.This medical condition, according to the senior advocate, may prove fatal as persons suffering from hypertension and diabetes are considered more susceptible to coronavirus and therefore urged the court to release Shroff on temporary bail.“The situation no doubt is precarious,” said Justice Dangre commenting on Ponda’s statement that several inmates of Arthur Road jail have tested positive for coronavirus. “If it is true that more than 100 patients have been tested positive in Arthur Road jail, it is for the authorities to arrange for their affairs and to ensure that the inmates presently housed in the jail are not infected by the virus.”She, however, rejected the interim bail plea saying a number of aged inmates are presently languishing in jail although they are more prone to the virus, as compared to the present applicant. “Since no imminent health impediment is reflected in case of the present applicant, application is rejected,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-bombay-hc-tells-maharashtra-to-protect-arthur-road-jail-inmates/story-xCdvXCvglOLqQNXMzPWFvI.html

After the accident, the railways called for new protocols to alert train drivers about people walking on tracks. Meanwhile, the move by BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh to freeze major labour laws in order to bolster businesses and revive the economy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak has drawn sharp criticism. Train crushes 16 migrants on way homeThe victims were in a group of 20 people who left Jalna for their villages the previous evening after deciding to no longer wait for their employer – a company running a steel factory – to pay their wages.These migrant workers did not have jobs, and sometimes food, for over a month as factories remained shut due to the nationwide lockdown in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

This could indicate the possibility of community transmission of the virus in the country. According to officials, the common factor in all these cases was that the source of the virus was not traceable and essential good suppliers infected many persons in their respective cities leading to a spike in the Covid-19 cases locally.As most of the spreaders were asymptomatic, their identification was a challenge for the authorities. In most of the cases, they were identified only after a large number of cases were reported from the places they had visited, officials said.Also read: List of states with over 5,000 Covid-19 cases in IndiaThese super spreaders are somewhat different from the ones identified earlier. In March and April, most of the Covid-19 super spreaders were persons with known travel history to places highly infected with Covid-19. Except of the 11 vegetable vendors in Jhajjar, the authorities have not been able to track the travel history of these service providers to a known Covid-19 hotspot.Kerala’s Wayanad, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Lok Sabha constituency, had remained Covid-19 free for 32 days before a truck driver from Chennai’s Koyambedu vegetable market got the virus. The market, now described as a mega super spreader, has contributed to a sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases in Chennai in the last week.“The market is linked to about 1500 cases. We don’t know from where the virus came in the market,” said corporation commissioner G Prakash. This truck driver is said to have spread the virus to 20 other people including his 82-year-old mother, a 49-year-old wife and his co-driver’s 21-year-old son.Also read: Vande Bharat Mission - 8 flights from 7 countries to land in India todayIn Rajasthan, the Jaipur municipal corporation identified 10 fruit and vegetable vendors as super spreaders after they had infected at least 150 persons in the city. Jaipur has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state.Nineteen super spreaders including vegetable vendors, milk vendors and grocery shop workers, became the carrier for the virus in 30 new localities in Ahmedabad, which accounts for about 70% of the total cases in Gujarat.Similar instance is available from some other cities. In Odisha’s Bhubaneshwar, a biryani delivery boy is responsible for turning a residential society into a containment zone. In Lucknow’s Qaiserbagh, eight persons got the virus from a vegetable vendor, including three members of his family. In Delhi’s Tuglakabad area, a grocery shop owner became a cause for declaring the area as a containment zone. 51 persons who visited his shop were tested positive.Haryana’s Jhajjar, which had no case till April 24, got 73 Covid-19 cases from 11 vegetable sellers who visited Delhi’s Azadpur fruit and vegetable market, said to be a source for the spread of the virus in Jehangirpuri and Rohini in Delhi. Authorities have not been able to identify the Covid-19 carrier to Azadpur market. Jhajjar civil surgeon Dr Randeep Punia said they came to know these vegetable vendors only when cases started coming up from the places the sellers frequented in the town. “Identifying such persons is the biggest challenge,” said Ajitabh Sharma, Principal Secretary, department of energy and nodal officer for Covid-19 management in Jaipur. “They look normal and have no symptoms. And even if they mild symptoms, they tend to hide them fearing loss of work.”The emergence of essential service providers as Covid-19 carriers have pushed the authorities to look at a new way to check the spread without hampering supply of goods to localities.In Jaipur, Sharma said all vendors in the city are being tested and their visits have been restricted only to a few localities.“We have colour-coded their carts depending on their municipal ward to restrict their movement. Not more than 10 vendors are being allowed in a locality,” he said.Punia added that in Jhajjar, they have decided to test all those who come in contact with people frequently such as milk booth operators and shop owners. Giving daily health update on Aarogya Setu app has been made mandatory for them. Ahmedabad’s Vijay Nehra said the government has opted for home delivery of essentials as these service suppliers come in contact with a large number of people daily and it is very difficult to monitor them.Dr Rajesh Malhotra, head of Covid-19 centre at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, said the recent emergence of super spreaders show that travel history of a person is no more relevant as most of them don’t have any travel history.“We need to have a strategy to identify such persons quickly and isolate them before they spread the virus to a large number of people,” he said.Other experts, however, said that the emergence of service suppliers as Covid-19 spreaders is an ample indication of community transmission of the virus even though the government has denied it.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said that India has not entered the stage three of Covid-19 transmission, which is large scale community transmission of the disease.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-covid-19-super-spreaders-your-service-supplier-with-no-contact-history-could-be-one/story-A4IPdvTqwXAlsuEad7bsTO.html

This is injustice with WB migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them,” Amit Shah said in his letter to Mamata Banerjee.The issue of migrant workers is the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the West Bengal government amid a row over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Centre and the state have exchanged allegations over the criteria for reporting deaths from the infection, and while While Bengal says the Centre is trying to politicise a public health crisis, the Union government maintains that state officials are ignoring repeated warnings to step up the fight against the disease.Federal officials have said that the region was failing to conduct adequate tests and grappling with confusion and mismanagement over identifying hot spots and containing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-govt-not-allowing-trains-to-help-migrants-return-home-minister-amit-shah-writes-to-mamata-banerjee/story-0hjNS4wMFIQJ8LNO2SzIDO.html

The demand came on a day when a senior resident doctor in Goa Medical College was suspended pending further inquiry for being absent without leave when Deshprabhu was rushed to hospital requiring critical care. “As per the information gathered, two key on-duty doctors were missing when they were needed to attend Deshprabhu,” Girish Chodankar, the Congress’ Goa unit chief, said while alleging that the doctors were being protected by higher-ups.“The Congress demands an impartial inquiry by a retired high court judge on [the] mysterious death of our leader,” Chodankar said. Later, the dean of Goa Medical College and Hospital issued an order suspending the senior resident doctor. A show-cause notice has also been sent to Dr Jeevan Vernekar, the head of the radiology department.According to the show-cause notice sent to Dr Vernekar, there was a delay in conducting Deshprabhu’s CT scan at the time of his admission in GMC.It also said that when the chief medical officer accompanied Deshprabhu to the radiology department “neither a junior doctor nor senior resident doctor was present there to do the CT scan and the patient had to wait for 35 minutes.”The Goa Association of Resident Doctors has, however, protested the suspension of the doctor. In a statement to the media, the association said the decision to place the doctor on suspension was “demoralizing and demotivating to the serving residents of the institution who are already overburdened and overstressed working as frontline warriors in the ongoing pandemic.”“Residents support this institution in fighting this pandemic, but the suspension order meted against one of our senior residents is demoralizing,” the association said. Jitendra Deshprabhu, the former two-time legislator in Goa, died due to pneumonia on April 21. His test report for Covid-19 was reported negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-demands-probe-into-party-leader-s-death-doctor-suspended/story-E306eU3yLWSRz88ENIY08H.html

The other category of patients, including very mild, mild, pre-symptomatic and moderate cases, need not be tested before they are discharged.The revised guidelines are in complete contrast with the government’s earlier guidelines that said a case confirmed by laboratory had to be tested on day 14 once and then again in a span of 24 hours, and the patient will be fit for discharge only if both the results are negative.“After discharge from the facility, if they again develop symptoms... contact the COVID Care Centre or State helpline or 1075,” the new rules said.Globally, more than 3.9 million people have contracted the coronavirus disease and 274,898 have died, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-3320-new-covid-19-cases-95-deaths-in-24-hours/story-OIWepw8Z3lafz9hzkeaRIM.html

Since then, crowds have swelled outside liquor outlets across the state and unofficial sale figures have crossed Rs 300 crore. Bars and outlets inside shopping malls are, however, closed. The state has also allowed home delivery of liquor from the retail outlets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drunk-e-rickshaw-driver-kills-infant-daughter-in-bengal-lynched-by-villagers/story-sbAYoCBO2F3E38tfhyYFNI.html

It started on May 7 and will run till May 13 and involves the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Bangladesh, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, the UK and the United States. In the first week of Vande Bharat, 64 flights are expected to bring 15,000 Indian citizens home from 12 countries. India will expand its mega Vande Bharat mission from next week to evacuate stranded citizens from abroad by including countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Germany, Spain and Thailand, official sources said on Friday.All international passengers will be charged for the journey and fares from Gulf countries to Kerala range from Rs 15,000 to Rs 16,000. Rescue flights from London will cost Rs 50,000 and those from the US Rs 1,00,000.At least 300,000 people have registered to come back in West Asia alone but the authorities are focusing only on “compelling cases”.Priority will be given to “asymptomatic” migrant labourers/workers abroad who have been laid off, short term visa holders faced with expiry (of visas), persons with medical emergency, pregnant women, the elderly, students, and those required to return to India due to the death of a family member.All those who travel back will have to undergo strict screening processes and download the Aarogya Setu app. The evacuated citizens will then be sent to institutional quarantine facilities set up by various state governments.Pregnant women, people needing immediate treatment, those returning to attend ceremonies connected to the death of a close relative, aged people needing continuous assistance and children under 10 years will be permitted to go to their houses, where they will be under strict home quarantine (self-isolation) for 14 days, officials said.Nearly 7000 Indian nationals stranded in the Maldives were also evacuated on Friday from the scenic island nation on an Indian Navy warship.

It is an everyday battle for us to keep the infection at bay,” Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said on Friday.The Covid-19 national tally inches toward the 60,000 mark with over 16,000 patients who have recovered from the deadly contagion and have been discharged from hospitals. More than 1,800 people have lost their lives in the battle against coronavirus.Here’s taking a quick look at top developments:1. Five hospitals, two from Ahmedabad and one each from Chennai, Jodhpur and Bhopal, have so far been approved to conduct randomised controlled clinical trials under WHO’s Solidarity Trial to find an effective treatment for Covid-19.2. Anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has failed another test to check its efficacy in treating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a new study has revealed, with patients admitted to hospitals showing no change in their conditions after being administered the medicine.3. Under its repatriation programme for nationals stranded abroad in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, flights carrying Indian nationals will be arriving today from Dhaka, Kuwait, Muscat, Sharjah, Kaula Lampur, London and Doha under the Vande Bharat Mission, news agency ANI reported. Two flights carrying a total of 335 people from the Gulf countries landed in Kerala’s two airports on Friday night.Under #VandeBharatMission, four flights carrying Indian nationals will be arriving — Kuwait to Cochin (arrival at 2115 hrs), Kaula Lampur to Trichy (arrival at 2140 hrs), London to Mumbai (arrival at 0130 hrs of 10th May) & Doha to Cochin (arrival at 0140 hrs of 10th May).

Kerala on Friday completed 100 days since the first coronavirus case was reported on January 30. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Covid-19 curve in the state had flattened marked by high recovery and low mortality rate.

09-05-2020||India||Bengal Police’s order to play CM’s Covid-19 song on Tagore birth anniversary stirs controversy||Bengal Police’s order to play a coronavirus awareness song penned and set to tune by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Rabindranath Tagore’s 159th birth anniversary has stirred a controversy. Opposition parties have called it an attempt to “impose the chief minister” on Bengal’s biggest annual cultural event. On Friday, nearly all police stations in the state took out small tableaus carrying a cut-out of Asia’s first Nobel laureate, Tagore, and played his songs over loudspeakers. The Nobel laureate in literature had also composed an opus of work consisting of more than 2,000 songs, collectively called Rabindra Sangeet which is considered as one of the most important music genres of Bengal.They also played the coronavirus awareness song, “Corona-ke Chhutey Diyo Na” which was penned by CM Banerjee at the end of March and rendered by singer-turned-minister Indranil Sen.The order from the Additional Director General of West Bengal police (law and order) is dated May 6 and was sent to the special superintendent of police of all districts and commissionerates.The order reads, “A programme titled Kabi Pranam is to be observed in districts and commissionerates on 08/05/2020 to mark the birthday of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. A collection of selected Tagore songs is enclosed herewith, along with the awareness song, written by Hon’ble CM, WB, on coronavirus. This should be played at important residential areas and housing complexes of cities and towns between 9 am and 11.30 am.”The order added that police personnel who are “gifted with an interest in music and singing are to be encouraged and mobilised to participate, wearing safety apparel and maintaining social distancing.” “We used the celebration of Tagore’s birth anniversary to spread awareness on the coronavirus. Apart from playing Tagore’s songs, microphones were used also to remind people of the do’s and don’ts. The song on coronavirus awareness was played as part of the awareness programme,” said superintendent of police of a district, who did not want to be named, on Friday. From the price of her paintings to poetry written by her and given away by the school education department to meritorious students as ‘rewards’, CM Banerjee’s artistic expressions have often created controversies. The song about coronavirus is no exception. Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders took digs at the Mamata Banerjee administration for issuing the order.“Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is the greatest icon, whose teachings and wisdom guide the world. But what do Mamata Banerjee’ awareness songs have to do with celebrating Gurudev’s life and legacy? It is not just an affront to Gurdev, but also makes light of the fight against Corona!” BJP national executive member Mukul Roy said.“Instead of commemorating Gurudev, WB govt is imposing the CM on people! This is outright insulting!” alleged Bengal BJP’s women’s wing chief and Hooghly Lok Sabha MP, Locket Chatterjee.In Kolkata, CM Banerjee paid her tribute to the 19th-century polymath at a small event on the streets outside Rabindra Sadan, Kolkata’s key cultural complex, where she joined Indranil Sen and lent her voice to a Tagore song, standing in front of a cut-out of the bard. The government, which organised mega cultural celebrations across the state on this day, has created a 2-hour-long programme that will be aired by various TV channels on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-police-s-order-to-play-mamata-s-covid-19-song-on-tagore-birth-anniversary-stirs-controversy/story-iJ6Q1xk649GNtH7Fno4r6I.html

When we were cordoning off Pardhoni, the Maoists started firing. In retaliation, we also started firing. Our sub-inspector SK Sharma lost his life in Maoist firing,” Jitendra Shukla, Rajnandgaon’s superintendent of police (SP), said while speaking to HT.Sharma, a resident of Surguja district was also the in-charge of the Madanvada police station. Shukla said they have gunned down Ashok, the divisional committee member, and Krishna, who was the area committee member of CPI (Maoist).“Two other woman cadres, Sarita and Pramila, were junior cadres and working as party members,” he added.“We have also recovered an AK-47 assault rifle, one SLR and two 315 bore rifle from the spot and searching of the whole area is going on,” the SP added.Police said that the team of Maoist was camping in Pardhoni jungles since Friday evening.Rajnandgaon comes under the newly-formed zone of Maoists. Maoists have built a new red corridor on the tri-junction of three states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone. Many documents recovered suggest Maoists are continuously moving in that area to strengthen the new zone and recruitment for the area was also done.Senior officers of Chhattisgarh believe there are about 180 armed Maoists now in the Vistaar Dalam of the MMC zone, who are trying to establish their grip in the MMC zone. The new zone is said to be a refuge for hardcore Maoists of Bastar and other regions. Most of the cadres in this region were recruited from South Bastar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policeman-killed-4-maoists-gunned-down-in-chhattisgarh-s-rajnandgaon/story-IjzdXpdj3mb1a1aiCzvTzN.html
09-05-2020||India||Plea in SC for shelter, food, transportation to migrants in view of Aurangabad accident||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court on Friday seeking a direction to the Centre to ask all District Magistrates in the country to identify stranded migrant workers and provide shelter, food to them before ensuring their free transportation to native places in view of the early morning’s tragic incident at Aurangabad in Maharashtra in which 16 such workers were mowed down by a goods train. The migrant workers were returning to Madhya Pradesh and had slept on railway tracks. The interim application, filed in a disposed PIL, has also referred to the earlier statements made by the Centre before the apex court saying that it was told that “there was no person walking on the roads in an attempt to reach his/her home towns/villages” and moreover the states and UTs will provide adequate facilities for migrant labourers. Referring to the tragic incident, lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava, in the plea, said, “issue appropriate direction to Union of India to show cause as to despite the Orders…passed by this court in.., why no concrete action has been taken to avert the heart wrenching train accident, which took place at Gadhejalgaon village in Aurangabad District on May 08 at about 5.30 AM (Morning) in which at least sixteen (16) migrant workers, who were walking on foot, have been Killed.” It sought a direction to the Centre to ask all district collectors to “immediately identify such moving/stranded migrant workers in their respective Districts, immediately shift them to the nearest shelter homes/camps, provide them sufficient food, water, medicines and counselling etc. and upon proper medical examination, ensure to provide free transportation to them to their respective native villages, with utmost dignity”. The plea said the deceased labourers belonged to Shahdol and Umaria Districts of Madhya Pradesh and were walking from Jalna in Maharashtra to Aurangabad Railway Station to board trains to reach hometowns. After walking for several kilometers, they decided to take rest on the railway tracks between Satana and Karmad and were mowed down by a goods train, it said. Earlier, the top court had disposed the PIL seeking migrant workers’ welfare during the pandemic and consequential lockdown saying that the Centre and states are taking appropriate steps to provide relief to migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-for-shelter-food-transportation-to-migrants-in-view-of-aurangabad-accident/story-C68d66cmYSdixqdyyzqxqN.html
09-05-2020||India||After Aurangabad train accident, Maharashtra CM urges workers to not risk lives||Leaders across party lines expressed grief over the death of 16 migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh in a train accident in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district early on Friday.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to the migrant workers in the state to not put their lives at risk, assuring them that the government was arranging trains to ferry them to their home states.In a statement, Thackeray expressed grief over the tragedy and said that the cost of medical treatment of the injured would be borne by his government.“We are in constant touch with the Railway ministry. A train will start from Mumbai, too, soon. I appeal to workers not to put their lives at risk. The shelter camps being operated at the district level will be functional till a single migrant labourer is left in the state. Administration is looking after their stay, food and health services. The labourers will be informed about the trains at their shelters,” he said.His remarks came shortly after 16 workers were crushed to death by a freight train when they were sleeping on railway tracks.The Maharashtra government has also announced the ex gratia of ~5 lakh each to the families of the deceased from the chief minister’s relief fund.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar reiterated the CM’s assurance. He said that a dialogue with other state departments is on and arrangements will be made soon.Sharad Pawar, president of the Nationalist Congress Party, said that factory owners and contractors should take the responsibility of the workers. “They should at least inform the government, if they are not in position to do so. The state government should constitute flying squads for these workers to ensure their safety,” he said in a statement.Calling it “heart wrenching”, Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari said, “The news of the unfortunate death of the innocent workers, who were sleeping on railway tracks and were run over by a goods train, is heart wrenching.”Opposition leader, and former chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis took to Twitter to express his condolences. “Extremely saddened & shocked to know about the #Aurangabad rail accident where migrant labourers lost their lives,” he tweeted.However, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ram Kadam said that the migrant labourers were forced to walk due to the failure of the government to make arrangements for them.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has also announced a financial assistance of ~5 lakh each to the families of the deceased. “I am also in touch with Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to get updates about the treatment and other arrangement being made for them,” he said.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-aurangabad-train-accident-maharashtra-cm-urges-workers-to-not-risk-lives/story-mqdkLRdq8Ktz9v5CXWlmIK.html
09-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This is the fiftieth instalment of a daily dispatch I started writing on March 19 – it should have been the 52nd but I took two breaks, each for a day. There were 169 cases in India when I started writing the dispatch, and three deaths (all data for March 18). The corresponding numbers, globally, were 218,863 and 8,983.Back then, the coronavirus disease was largely a Chinese and Italian affair. There were 80,928 cases in China and 3,245 deaths; and 35,713 cases in Italy and 2,978 deaths. Almost 70% of deaths, and 53% of all cases were accounted for by these two countries. There were only 9,317 cases in the US, and 171 deaths. In the UK, there were 2,626 cases, and 115 deaths.In the 52 days since, the global number of cases has increased to 3.91 million, a compound growth rate of 5.7% a day, and the global number of deaths to 270,740, a growth rate of 6.8% a day. The US now accounts for the most cases, 1.29 million, and deaths, 76,938. Spain, the UK, and France have all seen a significant number of deaths (25,000-30,000). And India now has 56,409 cases and 1,890 deaths. After 46 days of a lockdown (March 25 to May 8; the government has said the current phase will go on till May 17, although several restrictions have been eased), it is clear that the disease is yet to peak in India, although the trajectory it has followed in the country remains unique. All the numbers are from worldometers.info.The big constant between then and now is the lack of a cure for Covid-19, but we are definitely closer to one than we were 52 days ago. A vaccine may be available later this year or early next year – whether it will be accessible to all is a different question altogether; never in human history has a vaccine been developed in as short a time for a disease about which we still don’t know enough. Gilead’s remdisivir has emerged as the breakout drug for Covid-19, but it is still not evident that it is the cure (it probably isn’t).In the past 52 days, we have come to learn more about the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. It is highly infective, has a wide range of symptoms, likes clusters, and is not as fatal as some other viral infections (while the death numbers are still horrible). Most cases remain mild or entirely asymptomatic, and the disease is dangerous for people over the age of 60 years, and those with pre-existing health conditions. Many of us have even taught ourselves enough basic math to track growth rates and understand the probabilities of false positives and false negatives.We have also figured out what works – lockdowns, quarantines, sterilisation, even masks. The jury was still out on masks when I started this column, with entirely well-meaning people sharing that well-produced comic strip (it went viral) that insisted they weren’t, unless one was a health worker. We know what is safe and what isn’t.We have realised that the current cure, locking down, has a price (a big one; the Indian economy will probably shrink this year) and are desperately trying to work out a way to open up without too much risk (although it does seem a bit much to apply the old risk-return trade-off to lives). We are slowly starting to get used to the prospect of co-existing with the virus. After all, humanity has encountered pathogens through the ages – and lived to tell the tale.And we are beginning to understand that nothing will be the same again (at least till a vaccine is discovered, perhaps even after).It is arguable, but I do not think there’s been a more transformational period in the history of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-6EtAbdK2VhcOV1iRqjpTpK.html

So, keeping in mind the public health, ban was imposed on 11 premium brands for a year.”Gupta said the ban would also help contain the spread of Covid-19 in Jharkhand, as people spit after consuming Pan Masala. “The ban will be implemented strictly in Jhakhand,” he said.Socio-economic and educational development society (SEEDS), a technical partner in state government’s tobacco control programme, executive director Deepak Mishra said Jharkhand became third state in the country after Maharashtra and Bihar that banned Pan Masala.As per the notification, 41 samples of pan-masalas of different brands, were collected from different districts of Jharkhand for lab tests during 2019-2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-bans-11-pan-masala-brands-on-health-concerns/story-QXv1MiD7rVHSoABJOOy60J.html

We need to ease transport, working from home must be promoted and we need to decentralise agencies so if God forbid such situation arises again then life doesn’t stop. I hope government, urban planners and environmentalists become more human-centric and environment friendly.”The ‘Savdhaan India’ host is deeply concerned about sharp rise in domestic violence cases. “It has been ‘dhakha-chupa satya’ (hidden truth). In this period, these violent souls have become all frustrated and hyper active. I don’t understand how such incidents can be stopped but I strongly feel all police stations should have a dedicated wing for children and women related crime. Besides, cyber-crimes and hate crimes have also gone up. Globally we are uniting to fight a virus but unfortunately the ugly face of society has exposed. Instead of uniting we have miserably divided our society.”Sushant was supposed to shoot for two web-series both of which have been indefinitely postponed.The Cine and TV Artists Association (CINTAA) honorary secretary says, “We have to learn to live with it as this virus is not going leave soon. Lockdown was just a first step to control the spread. I hope by September-October we devised methods and designed guidelines on how to shoot with the spread around. People are working on it and foreign unions are working on guidelines as we have to start work again — with or without vaccine.”After Holi, he went to Hyderabad for day do to shoot for a film. He recalls, “I had to take a flight, be in crowded unit where touch can’t be avoided and eat outside food. It was really scary!”He is spending lockdown time with family, “Thankfully, we all were in Mumbai, my daughter left her hostel as soon the lockdown was announced. So presently my entire family is home and ‘Mil-baat kar sab kaam kar rahe hain.’ Earlier, too I used to help my wife with household chores so it’s nothing new but the good part is the kids are there supporting us. It’s a good time to bond and also test our limits of ‘shehensheelta’ (patience). This way we have learnt to appreciate homemakers who live their lives for home and family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/hope-we-become-better-human-beings-now/story-LvTmpUerczc9siesdydyQO.html

North Bengal shares borders with the Indian states of Sikkim and Assam as well as Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. The last two countries and Sikkim share borders with China.Rajendra Kumar Baid, general secretary, Cooch Behar District Chamber of Commerce and Industries has already written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, requesting her to utilize the opportunity.“Many companies are moving out of China as they have don’t feel safe anymore. India is being seen as the next destination by some companies from Europe, USA and Japan,” said Baid.“We can invite a few companies to Cooch Behar district where around 2000 acres of government land is lying unutilized alongside the Torsha River,” said Baid. “This is what I wrote to the chief minister,” he added.“North Bengal is connected to the rest of India by rail, road and air routes. The Asian Highways Network connects north Bengal to Myanmar and other countries,” said Baid.Sanjit Saha, chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), North Bengal chapter, said, “India is now being seen as a beacon of hope by potential investors and North Bengal fits the bill. Availability of cheap land and labour makes the region an attractive destination. The CII will write to the state and the Centre. This is the time to highlight the advantages of this region before potential investors.”Niranjan Mittal, director of Siliguri-based PCM Group of Companies that has investments in many countries, said, “Though it is early to say that all companies will move their investments from China to India, the crisis at least presents an opportunity worth exploring.”“We need to ensure ease in doing business through a single window system. With the Centre trying to change its policies for eastern states, north Bengal can gain,” said Mittal.Surajit Paul, secretary, North Bengali Industries Association said, “With more than 7000 micro, small and medium industries, north Bengal has the geographical advantage of reaching out to markets in many neighbouring countries.”North Bengal development department minister Rabindranath Ghosh said, “We will provide land to the companies that invest in north Bengal. The region has a land bank and offers pleasant climatic condition. Also, there are some natural advantages for food and fruit processing and agri-based industries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-bengal-s-business-groups-offer-scope-for-industries-moving-out-of-china/story-Q4QBZORGAdvZt4iv9VyjQP.html
09-05-2020||India||Flights carrying 335 evacuees from Riyadh, Bahrain land in Kerala||Two flights carrying a total of 335 people from the Gulf countries landed in Kerala’s two airports on Friday night, as India’s Vande Bharat Mission to bring home its nationals stranded due to Covid-19 lockdown in various countries entered second day. While an Air India repatriation flight from Riyadh carrying 153 passengers, including 84 pregnant women, 22 children and four infants landed at the Kozhikode airport 8 pm on Friday night, another Air India Express flight from Bahrain with 177 passengers, including 5 infants, reached Kochi airport at 11.32 pm. Two flights had landed at Kochi and Kozhikode on Thursday from Abu Dhabi and Dubai, respectively.According to Kozhikode airport sources, the flight from Riyadh carried five people having some health issues and they would be shifted to Manjeri and Kozhikode medical college hospitals. Ten passengers from neighbouring states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu also travelled in the flight from Riyadh, the sources said. The passengers were subjected to thermal test at the aerobridge itself before allowing them to undergo customs and immigration checks, Kozhikode airport sources said. Official sources said all the passengers would be subjected to Covid-19 rapid test at the airport before transferring them to their respective destinations by special taxis and KSRTC buses. As per the norms, all the pregnant women and children would be transported to their homes and others would be shifted to coronavirus care centres in their home districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flights-carrying-335-evacuees-from-riyadh-bahrain-land-in-kerala/story-u8iD1EeieYhctUH4ULTroI.html
09-05-2020||India||Supreme Court advises states to initiate online sale, home delivery of alcohol||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stop the sale of liquor across the country but took the view that states should consider its online sale or home delivery in keeping with social distancing norms.The observation by the court came on a PIL filed by a public-spirited citizen Guruswamy Nataraj who sought a stay order on the May 1 notification issued by the Centre permitting liquor vends and shops to open across the country from May 4.The petition highlighted the public health threat attached with this decision. Social distancing was given a complete go-by at some of these vends that saw unmanageable crowds. At some places in Delhi, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, police had to resort to a lathicharge.Arguing the petition, advocate J Sai Deepak told the bench that direct contact sale of liquor must stop. In case of absolute necessity alone, the Centre must consider modifying its decision to permit online sale of liquor, he added.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and BR Gavai saw merit in the suggestion of providing liquor online but felt this decision rested with the states and not the Centre. Chhattisgarh has started online sales and Punjab has arranged for home delivery of alcoholic beverages. The option of online sale has been provided by Delhi government and in Karnataka the same was undertaken on an experimental basis, Sai Deepak told the bench.But he felt that a uniform directive must come from the Centre as an entire country under lockdown cannot afford to give social distancing a go-by. This would also negate the effect of the complete lockdown aimed at flattening the curve of the coronavirus disease, he argued.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, present during the hearing conducted through video conferencing, said the decision of the Centre does not restrict states from resorting to online sale.The matter was dismissed but the bench noted in its order, “It shall be open for the concerned state government to consider non-direct sale including online sale/home delivery of liquor to facilitate social distancing”.Liquor sales have shored up state coffers that were running dry. States have resorted to levying additional tax as high as 70% on sale of liquor but this has hardly dented demand. The petitioner told the court that there are only 70,000 licensed liquor vends in the country, which can hardly meet the demand. But the court felt that any decision on sale of liquor lay exclusively within the policy domain of the governments and for this reason it refused to tie the Centre’s hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-advises-states-to-initiate-online-sale-home-delivery-of-alcohol/story-7BcULVf16gmx2Fm9ouQdcJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Industry body CII says Rs 15 lakh crore package required for economic revival||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Friday said the impact of a prolonged lockdown on the economy is severe and demanded a stimulus package of Rs 15 lakh crore, substantially revising its earlier estimates of Rs 4.5 lakh crore.CII president Vikram Kirloskar said the negative impact on the economy is expected to be even more significant than what the industry had previously anticipated, and that it needs to be offset by a large fiscal stimulus.“CII recommends the government to announce an immediate stimulus package of at Rs 15 lakh crore, which translates into 7.5% of GDP (gross domestic product),” he said. By the time the third phase of the lockdown ends, the economy would have lost almost two months of output, he added. India is under a lockdown situation to contain spread of Covid-19 since March 25. The lockdown is scheduled to end on May 17. Other industry associations have also asked for a large stimulus package to bring the economy back on track. While the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has asked for a ~10 lakh crore package, the PHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry has demanded Rs 16 lakh crore. Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) president Niranjan Hiranandani stressed on an urgent need for a stimulus package. “NITI Aayog has proposed a Rs 10 lakh crore stimulus package and we suggested a package for Rs 14 lakh crore,” he said.While industry bodies endorsed the government’s initial response under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), they are unanimous about a large stimulus package to save both lives and livelihood. The government on March 26 announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package under PMGKY, about 0.8% of GDP. The welfare package was aimed at providing immediate relief to the poor by providing them three-month ration and cooking gas for free and direct cash transfer to underprivileged women, elderly people and disabled people. Since then, there have been reports of a soon-to-be-announced fiscal package for industry, but none has been. An immediate substantive stimulus is required from the government for both the poor and the industry, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), CII said.“Clearly, time is running out for a fiscal stimulus package to rescue the economy. Delayed fiscal relief for enterprises reeling under the lockdown will make it harder for them to recover,” CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee said.It proposed direct cash transfers of Rs 2 lakh crore to the poor having bank accounts linked through the JAM trinity (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile) in addition to the Rs 1.7 lakh PMGKY package.It should be ensured that the migrant labourers are kept within the purview of the proposed cash transfers, Banerjee said.CII also sought Rs 2 lakh crore immediate support in the form of additional working capital to enterprises to pay salaries and prevent job losses. The additional working capital provided by banks for the April-June wage bill should be backed by a government guarantee at 4-5% interest, it added.To support about 63 million MSMEs, CII suggested a credit protection scheme where 60-70% of the loan should be guaranteed by the government. In other words, if the borrower defaults, the government should repay the bank up to the amount it has guaranteed, so the risk to the lender is limited.The industry body proposed creation of a fund with a corpus of Rs 1.4-1.6 lakh crore that will subscribe to non-convertible debentures or bonds of corporates rated A and above.“The fund can be seeded by the government contributing a corpus of Rs 10,000-20,000 crore, with further investments from banks and financial institutions. This will provide adequate liquidity to industry, particularly stressed sectors such as aviation, tourism and hospitality,” it said.It stressed on enhanced public expenditure infrastructure to boost demand in the economy with an allocation of Rs 4 lakh crore.“The work should be initiated with the involvement of state governments, so that implementation bottlenecks can be overcome. Specifically, the spending can begin with the completion of projects that have already begun, such as roads which are stalled after 80% of the job is complete,” it said.CII also suggested an allocation of Rs 2 lakh crore to bail out state-run electricity distribution companies that have been accumulating losses and burdening the state exchequer.It demanded an allocation of Rs 2 lakh crore for bank recapitalisation is required to keep the financial sector robust so that they can meet the credit needs of the industry. “This will help public sector banks manage any surge in their NPAs (non-performing assets).”In addition, CII suggested Rs 4 lakh crore support from the subscription of government paper by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), given the fact that inflationary pressures remain muted in view of depressed demand conditions.“A lower amount of Rs 2 lakh crore can be borrowed by the government from the secondary market, so that bond yields remain moderate. Further, substantial reduction in expenditure of around Rs 4 lakh crore is possible by reducing some of the discretionary expenditure such as centrally sponsored schemes. These are some of the avenues that would finance the package,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industry-says-15l-cr-package-required-for-economic-revival/story-FsnITZwvFtj6JgD3snq0cP.html
09-05-2020||India||Train crushes 16 migrants on way home||Sixteen people were killed when they were run over by a freight train near Maharashtra’s Aurangabad early on Friday morning as they slept on train tracks after a long journey on foot in a desperate attempt to find transport to go back to their home towns hundreds of kilometres away in Madhya Pradesh.The victims were in a group of 20 people who left Jalna for their villages the previous evening after deciding to no longer wait for their employer – a company running a steel factory – to pay their wages.These migrant workers did not have jobs, and sometimes food, for over a month as factories remained shut due to the nationwide lockdown in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“We tried to get passes for the special trains but did not get help from any of the authorities. Finally we started walking at around 7pm on Thursday and slept on the train tracks. We were so tired that we could not even discuss about the risk of sleeping on the tracks,” Virendra Singh, one of the survivors, told local media at Aurangabad’s Ghati Hospital. “The contractor had assured payment on May 7 but later said he was not in a condition to do so,” he said.The group had walked some 36kms, at first on the roads before they moved to the tracks to avoid being stopped by police.Singh was one of the four survivors who slept on a clearing next to the tracks, while the others slept on the rails when a freight train with empty wagons for petroleum products ran them over around 5.20am. “Two of the others and I tried to warn the victims but were unable to awaken them on time,” he said.District officials said they are now focussing on sending the bodies of the victims home by the special trains that they had been hoping to board. “The case is being investigated by the police, but our priority is sending the bodies back. They are being sent by a special Shramik train departing for Jabalpur on Friday evening,” said Sanjeev Jadhavar, resident deputy collector, Aurangabad.Tens of thousands of people have been walking home from big cities and industrial hot spots after being laid off because of the lockdown in force since late March. There have been reports that some others like the victims have been killed in road accidents. While the victims of Friday’s fatal incident did not have the requisite documents to obtain a pass, the other reason why migrant workers have been making the punishing journeys on foot or bicycles is a reluctance by their home states to accept them. Officials in Telangana have decided this week to scrap dozens of requests for special trains after destination states for such travellers did not give the necessary approvals to allow the journey. The Union government has allowed special trains -- called Shramik trains -- to be requested if the origin as well as the destination states agree on the travel, which many regions fear could also fuel the spread of Covid-19. A senior Railways safety official in Delhi said the victims in Friday’s accident had fallen asleep on the tracks believing there would be no train on the route. The engineer of the locomotive spotted the people and used the train’s horns, but was not able to stop on time. Mokshada Patil, superintendent of police, Aurangabad rural, said investigation was being carried out on the basis of the information given by the survivors. “All of them were working at SRJ Steels in Jalna, about 35 km from the accident spot, and had started on Thursday evening. They were heading towards Aurangabad to check for any travelling facility back to their home state. They had planned to walk up to Manmad (about 130 km from Aurangabad), a rail junction, to catch a train,” he said. Jalna, one of the eight districts in Central Maharashtra, is known for steel industries and labourers from MP, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrate to the town for daily-wage jobs that fetch between ~400-~600 a day. The steel factories employ them through contractors without any security of health services and life-accidental insurance, said an official from the Jalna district collector. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed anguish over the deaths. “Have spoken to Railway minister Piyush Goyal and he is closely monitoring the situation. All possible assistance required is being provided,” he said in a tweet. “Shocked by the deaths of migrant workers hit by train. We should be ashamed of how we treat our nation-builders,” said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.Maharashthra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to migrant workers to not risk their lives by heading home on foot and that there will be more trains arranged. Thackeray also announced an ex-gratia of ~5 lakh each to the families of the victims from the chief minister relief fund. “I have just heard the sad news about labourers coming under the train, rescue work is underway,” railway minister Piyush Goyal said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-crushes-migrants-on-way-home/story-4yxu0I4GOSQGxqmlxXCfAM.html
09-05-2020||India||Supreme Court stays Orissa HC order on migrant entry||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed an interim order of the Orissa high court which ordered that all migrant workers returning to the state test negative for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) before being allowed to board special trains, and added that the exercise be governed by guidelines put in place by the central government.The guidelines put in place by the Centre for the movement of migrants provide ample protection, the Supreme Court bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan observed, after the Union government approached the apex court saying that the HC order effectively put in place precautions over and above the protocols set by the Union government.“We stay the interim order dated 07.05.2020. We further clarify that the stranded migrants shall be dealt with as per the order/guidelines of the Government of India dated 29.04.2020,” the Supreme Court ordered.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the bench, also comprising justices SK Kaul and BR Gavai, that all stranded migrants boarding the special trains were being screened and only those found asymptomatic were allowed to proceed. Assisted by advocate Kanu Agrawal, he further said that the migrants were being allowed only on the condition that they will be quarantined for the requisite time period in their home states.On April 29, the central government issued a circular permitting stranded migrant workers, students and pilgrims to travel to their homes states. The government shared a list of necessary precautions to be taken during the exercise. On May 1, the government issued an order permitting the travel of such migrants by special trains.The Centre contended that the order passed by the high court effectively mandated additional safeguards over those prescribed by the Union government and that the move can’t be allowed without hearing the central government. The bench accepted this argument.“We are of the view that the order of the Government of India dated 29.04.2020 provides ample protection. It appears that before the High Court the order of the Government of India dated 29.04.2020 and the guidelines were neither brought into the notice nor were under challenge (before the high court),” the top court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-orissa-hc-order-on-migrant-entry/story-WMKwzb29nAIFrgUJEgT5cP.html
09-05-2020||India||NCW mulls advisory on policies to aid women farmers||The National Commission for Women (NCW) conducted a virtual day-long consultation on Friday to come up with an advisory for states that would enable them to prescribe policy changes in aid of women farmers hit by the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The NCW expects to issue the advisory before the kharif season begins next month, and is treating the matter as urgent since several migrants are making their way home during the lockdown. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma told Hindustan Times that as women migrants made their way home to work in farms, policy rethinks are crucial. Present at the deliberation were officials from the union ministry of women and child development, department of agriculture, National Rural Livelihood Mission, National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, PM Kisan, National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, as well as representatives of non-governmental organisations like the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Oxfam, and Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch (MAAKAM). A key point that emerged during the discussion was that while a significant number of Indian farmers are women, their access to credit facilities, subsidies and tools are limited. “Most of the land is registered in the name of male farmers, and so, the women are not eligible to apply for credit facilities and state subsidies. Even farming tools are designed for men only,” Sharma said. As a result, one suggestion that came out in the discussion was to give women farmers access to credit without interest or collateral, since many did not hold land titles and others are tenant farmers. As migrant labourers make their way home — at least 1.8 lakh have registered with states to take trains back home, but the numbers are likely several times more —the labour market is expected to become more competitive. Stakeholders at the virtual consultation suggested that home state must ensure that women get equal job opportunities. The finance ministry’s Economic Survey 2017-18 pointed to the feminisation of agriculture sector, as more women took up farm jobs, but exact numbers are unclear. While an Oxfam report pegs the number of women cultivators and agriculture labourers at 70%, a 2011 report of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations stated that women account for 30% of the farm labour force in India. Seema Kulkarni of MAKAAM, who participated in the discussion said that in the current situation unfolding due to the Covid-9 pandemic, widows of farmers who committed suicide are vulnerable. “As the kharif season is on the way, widows are particularly vulnerable as they have not sold their harvest and so, do not have seed availability and have high credit liabilities. Loan waivers are not sanctioned, and most of them get loans through self-help groups and micro-finance which are high on interest. Loans need to be institutionalised, and quick estimates of women in need must be prepared,” she said. In January, MAKAAM had written to the Centre to provide MGNREGA job cards for women affected by farm loan suicides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncw-mulls-advisory-on-policies-to-aid-women/story-kw9eCY2voCtJ72rkVjYJ0I.html
09-05-2020||India||WHO reforms only after pandemic is over: India||New Delhi: India believes proposals for reforming the World Health Organization (WHO), which have been raised in light of its perceived shortcomings in tackling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis, should be taken up after the world overcomes the pandemic, people familiar with the developments said on Friday.The world community’s focus, for now, should remain on efforts to fight Covid-19, develop a vaccine and medicines and keeping intact crucial supply chains, the people cited above, familiar with thinking at the highest levels of government, said on condition of anonymity.During a virtual summit of leaders of G20 states on March 26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had raised the issue of strengthening and reforming inter-governmental organisations such as the WHO, which he said continued to be based on the last century’s model and hadn’t adapted to deal with new challenges.But even after US President Donald Trump announced last month that he would cut funding for the WHO, the Indian government said the focus of global efforts should remain on overcoming the pandemic.“Our position is that, at this time, we should give attention to the Covid-19 crisis. Issues such as the WHO’s mandate and an investigation of its working can be taken up later, when we have dealt with the immediate issue,” said one of the people cited above.During the Prime Minister’s recent conversations with heads of state and government and in external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s discussions with his counterparts, the focus has been on combating Covid-19 and finding solutions to the worldwide crisis, the people said.“All our conversations with heads of state or government or with foreign ministers have been about how to cooperate to deal with the crisis and work together to develop vaccines and therapeutic solutions,” the first person said.“The conversations have also been about reliable supply chains that can be of use to states,” the person added.The people, however, made it clear that India wants to see the WHO’s mandate strengthened. India also wants to work with others on ways to increase the WHO’s capacity to handle pandemics and crises, they added.“These are issues we can come to when we have more breathing space to deal with them,” the person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-reforms-only-after-pandemic-is-over-india/story-YU4tybLy3yOBFJvSfEPnYJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Centre says Bengal not testing enough, mismanaging Covid-19 cases||As a row between West Bengal and the Centre over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) escalates, officials of the Union government said on Friday that the region was failing to conduct adequate tests and grappling with confusion and mismanagement over identifying hot spots and containing them.The Centre and the state government, led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, have exchanged allegations over the criteria for reporting deaths from the infection, and while While Bengal says the Centre is trying to politicise a public health crisis, the Union government maintains that state officials are ignoring repeated warnings to step up fight against the disease.A Union government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the state was not even conducting 250 tests daily, as mandated by the Centre for Covid-19 hotspots, while neighbouring Odisha was testing between 500 to 1,000 people every day.“The state has 540 identified containment zones and 10 districts are falling in the red zone. Instead of sharpening focus on these zones, the West Bengal administration is quibbling over the number of containment areas alleging that the Centre is overestimating such areas,” another senior Union official said, asking not to be named.The Centre holds daily review meetings with different states on their Covid-19 preparedness. On Thursday, during the meeting with West Bengal, only one state official was absent, according to a person present at the meeting. As district magistrates of the red zones did not attend the meeting, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan inquired if they would be joining at all, the person added on condition of anonymity. The lone West Bengal representative, Saumitra Mohan, MD of the National Health Mission, said he wasn’t immediately able to contact the DMs.Even as the Centre has started running special trains to send back stranded migrant workers to their states, the West Bengal government has not yet put in place any standard operating procedures (SOP) for the exercise, another official said. The issue was raised again on Thursday and Mohan was asked to convey the urgency for SOP to senior officials in the state.The Centre also pointed out that a proper door-to-door scrutiny in the containment zones was not happening in the state. There were also reports of lax rules in sealing containment zones in many areas, especially in the congested areas of north Kolkata.“We have told them that it is of vital importance to conduct tests for Surveillance for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI)/Influenza Like Illness (ILI), which should be intensified in unaffected districts and districts that have not reported cases for the last 14 days,” said a senior official.Leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state have argued that the Centre failed to send adequate numbers of Covid-19 testing kits, which resulted in low level of testing. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) maintains that there is no problem of testing kits’ supply to the state.An interministerial central team (IMCT), which visited West Bengal to assess the Covid-19 situation recently, said there were discrepancies in reporting of cases in the state. In its final status report submitted to the West Bengal government, IMCT also raised questions on the state government’s claim that it surveyed five million people.A senior Union official said that due to the lack of cooperation from the state, the central team was forced to use Google Maps to find their way to hospitals or other spots for surveillance. Despite repeated requests for a statement, Mohan did not offer any comment.Trinamool’s general secretary Partha Chatterjee, however, has accused the Centre of politicising issues and warned the Centre against mixing politics with administration at a critical juncture in the public health crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-bengal-not-testing-enough-mismanaging-cases/story-Em6pDNsRr3S8WYvPGCrnCJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine fails another test as a Covid-19 treatment, says study||Anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has failed another test to check its efficacy in treating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a new study has revealed, with patients admitted to hospitals showing no change in their conditions after being administered the medicine.The observational study published in the highly cited New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) showed that doctors reported that the use of hydroxycholoquine neither lessened the need for patients requiring breathing assistance nor the risk of death.The study said there were no potential benefits or harm from the drug, which was given to 1,376 consecutive patients in the emergency room with Covid-19 symptoms in the New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. The NEJM study found that the risk of intubation or death was not significantly higher or lower among consecutive patients who were given hydroxychloroquine compared to those who were not given the drug. “There was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death,” the study concluded.The findings come two weeks after the US Food and Drug Administration warned the public against using hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine without prescription or supervision because of reports of “serious heart rhythm problems” in patients treated with the malaria drugs.“There is still no convincing evidence for treatment. To rule out unmeasured confounding and bias, randomised-control trial evidence in larger numbers is needed, such as from multi-country solidarity trial being conducted by World Health Organization,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. India is among the countries testing the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as part of the solidarity trial. Observational studies aren’t considered as conclusive as randomised-controlled trials because clinicians often use several drugs and therapies to treat patients. More rigorous clinical trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of the drug, said the NEJM study, which was funded by the US National Institutes of Health.Hydroxychloroquine is the only drug approved for treating hospitalised Covid-19 patients in India, where it is given in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin. It is also being given to health care workers and people at risk of exposure as a prophylaxis for Covid-19, which leads to potentially fatal complications in some patients. The cheap and widely available drug that has been used to treat malaria for at least a century emerged as the most sought-after medicine after two preliminary trials in Covid-19 patients in China in March showed it boosted recovery and lowered the severity of Covid-19. An early study from France also showed benefit of hydroxychloroquine in 26 patients treated at French hospitals, but flaws in study design made it difficult to interpret. The studies were published in medRxiv, a pre-print website that publishes studies before peer-review to expedite access to new research.An analysis published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in March, however, said the “data to support the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are limited and inconclusive.”Apart from malaria, hydroxychloroquine is prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Several countries including India, China, France, South Korea, Italy, India and the United States are using anti-malarials to treat people severely ill with Covid-19.US President Donald Trump has touted the drug as a “game changer” in the fight against Covid-19.Anti-malarials work by decreasing the acidity in endosomes, which are compartments within cells that some viruses hijack to enter the cell and cause infection. The doorway used by Sars-Cov-2 is the spike protein on its surface that it uses to attach to a receptor on the surface of human cells, but studies in cell culture have suggested chloroquines have some activity against the virus.The doses needed to treat Covid-19 are usually very high, which raises risk of toxicities, which led a small study in Brazil being suspended after researchers found high doses led to irregular heartbeats (heart arrhythmia).Last week, Gilead Sciences’ antiviral drug remdesivir became the first drug to get emergency use authorisation in the US for treatment of Covid-19. The move came after the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases released results from its study showing Covid-19 patients who took remdesivir usually recovered after 11 days, four days faster than those who didn’t take the drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-malaria-drug-fails-another-test-as-a-covid-19-treatment-says-study/story-IadOtW6iRHIf7LMCA6AvSN.html
09-05-2020||India||Delhi HC relief to professor over maternity leave||A judgment by the Delhi High Court on Labour Day, May 1, shone the light on unfair conditions imposed upon female contractual workers after it quashed the termination order of an ad-hoc college professor who had taken maternity leave and whose tenure was not extended by her place of employment.Manisha Priyadarshani, an ad-hoc professor of English at Aurobindo Evening College since 2014, took leave between January and March 2019 for the birth of her child. Following this, her tenure, which ended on March 18, was not extended at the start of the new semester in May, although other ad-hoc professors, who were junior to her, were given extensions.As Delhi University does not entitle ad-hoc employees to avail of maternity leave and benefits, the college claimed that it was well within its rights to terminate Priyadarshani’s appointment and “her non-reporting for duty from 21.01.2019 to 18.03.2019, was improper”.Priyadarshani also moved a petition in the Delhi high court last March, challenging the 2005 Delhi University rule that denies maternity leave to ad-hoc employees, and sought benefits under the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. This petition is still pending in court, said Kush Chaturvedi, the advocate representing her on the matter.The May 1 judgment comes in the wake of widespread agitation by ad-hoc professors for benefits as well as induction into permanent rolls of the university.According to Rudrashish Chakraborty, a former member of the Academic Council of Delhi University, the number of ad-hocs has grown to disproportionate numbers in the last few years. Since 2012, Delhi University Teachers Association (Duta) has demanded that all ad-hocs should be made permanent. It has also taken up the issue of maternity leave of ad-hoc teachers, Chakraborty, a former elected member of the Duta executive, said.“Delhi University has 50% teachers in the ad-hoc capacity — that’s 4500 teachers — and a huge number of them are women, teaching for a long time. They are given appointments for four months, which is then extended after a notional break; they don’t receive annual increments or the same kind of benefits as permanent teachers. Priyadarshani’s case is symptomatic of a larger malaise in the university system: that of apathy of the authorities towards the ad-hoc teachers and also withdrawal of any financial commitment to higher education,” he said.In its judgment, the high court found that the justification offered by the college that she was not at work when her tenure ended, as she was on leave that was not granted to someone in her capacity, was not “a legitimate ground to deny extension of tenure” to her.The court further stated that this was akin to penalising a woman for becoming a mother while still employed, and equating motherhood to loss of employment. The court held that Article 21 of the Constitution guaranteed her right to employment and protected her reproductive rights as a woman.“Such a justification offered by the respondents for declining to grant an extension to the appellant/petitioner as she had highlighted her need for leave due to her pregnancy and confinement would be tantamount to penalising a woman for electing to become a mother while still employed and thus pushing her into a choice-less situation as motherhood would be equated with loss of employment,” the order of a two-judge bench comprising Justices Hima Kohli and Asha Menon, read.Namita Rajput, officer on special study of Aurobindo College (evening), confirmed that Delhi University did not have provisions for granting maternity relief to ad-hoc teachers. On a question regarding their future course of action, Rajput said that the college was yet to decide on the matter. Though the order was passed on May 1, the college is yet to contact her regarding joining back, Priyadarshani told Hindustan Times.

09-05-2020||India||SC sets Aug 31 deadline for Babri order||The Supreme Court on Friday extended by three months the deadline to deliver the verdict in the criminal trial against LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti over the demolition of the Babri Masjid, as it asked special judge SK Yadav to pronounce the judgment by August 31.The top court asked the special judge to make use of video-conferencing facilities to ensure that the recording of evidence was completed and there was no inordinate delay in concluding the trial.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are on trial for the 1992 demolition of the mosque in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya. They have been charged for various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including promoting enmity between religious groups, making statements affecting national integration or which are likely to cause public mischief.“We may indicate that video conferencing facilities are available and should be used by Shri Yadav in order to complete all evidence… We extend the period to complete evidence and deliver judgment till 31st August, 2020,” the bench headed by justice Rohinton Nariman said after the special judge wrote to the court on May 6, stating that recording of evidence was yet to be completed.This will be the third time the court is setting a deadline for completion of trial in the 27-year-old case. In April 2017, the Supreme Court ordered that additional charge of criminal conspiracy under section 120B of IPC be framed against the accused leaders. BJP leader Kalyan Singh, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Masjid was demolished and who is one of the accused in the case, was given immunity by the top court under Article 361 of the Constitution as he is currently the governor of Rajasthan. The apex court had also ordered the special court to complete the trial within two years.Subsequently, the court took up the matter in July 2019 and extended the deadline for completion of the trial and delivery of the verdict by nine months. The deadline expired on April 19 and the special judge wrote to the apex court on May 6, seeking an extension.The SC heard the matter on Friday. “We are cognizant of the fact that Shri Yadav is making all efforts in order that the trial reach a just conclusion. However, given the original time frame and the extended time frame, the effort must now be to complete the proceedings and deliver judgment latest by 31st August, 2020,” the Supreme Court said.The top court, in its landmark verdict on November 9 last year, decided the title suit on the disputed site at Ayodhya in favour of the Hindu parties, while also acknowledging that the demolition of the Babri Masjid was a “calculated act.”“During the pendency of the suits, the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship. The Muslims have been wrongly deprived of a mosque which had been constructed well over 450 years ago,” the November 9 judgment said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sets-aug-31-deadline-for-babri-order/story-mo2pVSg4Kz3Q06Jg0Os4vI.html
09-05-2020||India||Three truck drivers in Odisha die in mysterious circumstances||Three truck drivers from Jharkhand who had come to Odisha’s Dhenkanal district to pick up ethanol spirit from a sugar mill just before the lockdown was announced in March, died under mysterious circumstances on Friday morning.Dhenkanal police said one of the three brothers, Hariram Bharati, Rudaal Bharati and Dilip Bharati was found dead on Friday morning near the trucks, while the other two died on the way to hospitals. “The three had a meal of fish and green banana which they had cooked under the trucks. After eating, one of them complained of uneasiness and nausea. He died while being taken to the Dhenkanal district headquarters hospital. Another driver, too, died on the way to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. The third was found dead near the truck where he had his meal,” said Gyanaranjan Samal, inspector of Dhenkanal town police station.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe inspector ruled out excessive consumption of hooch or other liquor and said he suspected food poisoning to be the cause of death, since all three had complained of uneasy stomachs after eating.“There was no smell of alcohol on their mouths.

09-05-2020||India||LG Polymers told to pay Rs 50 crore interim relief||The National Green Tribunal on Friday asked LG Polymers Private Limited to pay Rs 50 crroe interim compensation, which has to be deposited with the district magistrate of Vishakhapatnam at the earliest. The amount was arrived at on the basis of prima facie evidence of the extent of damage to life, public health and environment according to NGT’s order which was published immediately after an emergency hearing by video conferencing.The NGT bench headed by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel took suo moto cognizance of the Styrene gas leak, which happened on Thursday and killed 12 people.NGT also constituted a fact finding committee comprising Justice B. Seshasayana Reddy, Former Judge, Andhra Pradesh High Court; Prof Ch V Rama Chandra Murthy, former vice chancellor, Andhra University, Vizag; Professor Pulipati King, Head of Chemical Engineering Department, Andhra University, Vizag; Member Secretary, CPCB (Online, if travel is restricted due to Covid-19); and Director, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (Online, if travel is restricted due to Covid-19) and Head, NEERI, Vizag.The committee was asked to get information on the sequence of events leading to the gas leak, causes of failure and persons and authorities responsible therefore, extent of damage to life, human and non-human; impact on public health and the environment – including on water, soil, air; steps to be taken for compensation of victims and restitution of the damaged property and environment; and the cost involved and remedial measures to prevent recurrence. CPCB was asked to bear the costs of logistics and functioning of the committee.NGT also issued notices to Andhra Pradesh State Pollution Control Board, District Magistrate, Vishakhapatnam, Central Pollution Control Board , Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and LG Polymers India Pvt., Limited. Responses will have to be filed before the next date of the hearing on May 18.“Styrene gas is a hazardous chemical as defined under Rule 2(e) read with Entry 583 of Schedule I to the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemical Rules, 1989. The Rules require on-site and off-site Emergency Plans to ensure prevention of damage. There appears to be failure to comply with the said Rules and other statutory provisions. Leakage of hazardous gas at such a scale adversely affecting public health and environment, clearly attracts the principle of ‘Strict Liability’ against the enterprise engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous industry. Such an entity is liable to restore the damage caused under the Environment Law, apart from other statutory liability,” the bench said in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lg-polymers-told-to-pay-50cr-interim-relief/story-aETvfDM0f9DeOZaxWqZ29I.html
09-05-2020||India||Kailash Mansarovar yatra will now be easier||New Delhi: The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is set to become easier and smoother for pilgrims with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) completing a key road in Uttarakhand that will cut the travel time for the pilgrimage as people will no longer have to undertake a gruelling trek for it, the defence ministry said on Friday.Hundreds of pilgrims travel to the 6,638-metre Mount Kailash near Mansarovar Lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region annually in summer with the belief that circumambulating the holy mountain brings good fortune.The BRO has built the 80-km road from Dharchula to Lipulekh (the gateway to Kailash-Mansarovar) at an altitude ranging from 6000 feet to 17,060 feet to create the shortest route for the Yatra, the ministry said in a statement.“Now, people can drive up to Lipulekh in vehicles. They will no longer have to trek for five to six days,” said a government official. The new road is an extension of the Pithoragarh-Tawaghat-Ghatiabagarh road.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the new road link will allow pilgrims to complete the Yatra in just one week compared to two to three weeks it took earlier. He inaugurated the road through video conferencing.“While combating Covid-19 pandemic, the BRO in Uttarakhand has connected Kailash Mansarovar route to Lipulekh pass at a ht of 17,060 ft; thus providing connectivity to border villages and security forces,” the minister said on Twitter.“The arduous trek through treacherous high-altitude terrain can now be avoided. At present, the travel to Kailash-Mansarovar takes around two to three weeks through Sikkim or Nepal routes. The Lipulekh route had a trek of 90 km and the elderly yartris faced a lot of difficulties,” the statement said.The routes through Sikkim and Nepal require the pilgrims to cover 20% of their journey on Indian roads and 80% on Chinese roads. “With the opening of the new road, this ratio has been reversed. Now pilgrims will traverse 84% land journey on Indian roads and only 16% in China,” the defence ministry said.Singh said with the crucial road link had fulfilled the decades-old dreams and aspirations of local people and pilgrims.BRO chief Lt Gen Harpal Singh said the construction of the road was a challenging task due to constant snowfall, high altitude, and extremely low temperatures -- factors that restricted the annual working season to five months.One of the biggest challenges for the BRO was to arrange a large labour force to carry out the construction of key roads and tunnels in far-flung areas as Covid-19 sweeps through the country, as reported by Hindustan Times on April 28.The BRO’s peak working season extends from May to November. Migrant workers are a key part of the BRO’s workforce involved in building strategic roads, along the country’s northern border with China, scattered across Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kailash-mansarovar-yatra-will-now-be-easier/story-QHNQCNiWlUIZEI7BiWTelO.html
09-05-2020||India||Will not return as Congress chief anytime soon: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday indicated that he will not return as the party chief anytime sooner even as his active involvement in organisational matters and series of conversations with experts on the Covid-19 crisis has fuelled speculation about it.“...please read my [resignation] letter that I wrote one year ago on that issue,” he said in response to a question about his active involvement being perceived as a sign of his return as the Congress president. Gandhi resigned as the party chief last year following the party’s drubbing in the 2019 national polls. He tweeted a four-page farewell note listing the reasons why he resigned as the Congress chief on July 3 last year.In the letter, Gandhi took a dig at his party colleagues for the electoral drubbing and spoke about the lack of support to him, saying he had stood completely alone in the fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).“I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS, and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, I stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it,” he wrote.Gandhi has held interactions with Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee and former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan over the Covid-19 crisis.Asked about these conversations, he said, “I normally interact with a lot of people. These are interesting conversations. I thought let me give the people of India a glimpse of what the experts think about the present situation. This is the basic idea of such conversations. Whatever I get to learn and understand from these conversations, I wanted to pass it on to other people. Otherwise, there is no specific strategy behind it.”Gandhi was included in former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh-led 11-member Congress Consultative Committee on the Covid-19 pandemic on April 18.Asked about his suggestion to Congress chief ministers on taxing diesel, petrol, and alcohol, Gandhi said he will leave these decisions to them. “I do not like advising chief ministers through press conferences. The rule I would say they should follow is to be compassionate, understand that India is going through a very difficult time, that there are people, who are struggling more than others, and be gentle and compassionate and loving towards everybody.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-return-as-congress-chief-anytime-soon-rahul/story-YZqH2QuEPlaMgw9OHigxnK.html
09-05-2020||India||5-member panel to probe styrene leak||Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government on Friday constituted a five-member committee to probe into the Thursday’s gas leakage from LG Polymers’ plant in Visakhapatnam that claimed 12 lives, officials aware of the matter said.The committee will be headed by special chief secretary (environment, forests, science and technology) Neerab Kumar Prasad, they added. Special chief secretary (industries and commerce) Karikal Valaven, Visakhapatnam collector V Vinay Chand, commissioner of police R K Meena and Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board member secretary Vivek Yadav will be among its other members.The officials said the committee will inquire into causes of the leakage and verify whether the company had adhered to all safety protocols. It will study if there are long-term effects of the gas leakage on the surrounding villages and recommend proposed action to be taken against the company in case of any negligence, they added.The committee will also suggest measures to be taken by industrial units to prevent such mishaps and submit its report within a month.State industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy, who visited the plant and held meetings with the officials, said experts were making efforts to neutralise styrene gas at LG Polymers plant and it might take another 48 hours to do so.He said the leakage occurred during the maintenance and that production at the plant had not commenced during the Covid-19 lockdown.Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy separately held a review meeting and directed officials to identify hazardous factories in and around Visakhapatnam located in densely populated areas. He asked them to prepare a roadmap to make Visakhapatnam a safe and risk-free city by shifting hazardous industries away from habitations.Reddy instructed officials to immediately release ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore to each of the families of the deceased, Rs 10 lakh each to patients on ventilators, Rs 1 lakh each of other patients and Rs 25,000 to those who underwent treatment.Health minister Alla Nani said the government was involved in the relief and rehabilitation measures as per the Reddy’s instructions. He said 15,00 people in five villages around the plant were evacuated and rehabilitated on a war-footing after the news of the gas leakage was received. Nani said 554 victims were shifted to hospitals and 128 of them have completely recovered. He added the other 305 include 52 infants. Nani said 121 others were being treated at private hospitals and were out of danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-member-panel-to-probe-styrene-leak/story-wjvWqNp97DIZK1FCip2AcI.html
09-05-2020||India||Vizag polymer unit didn’t have environmental nod||The Union environment ministry received LG Polymers India Private Limited’s application for environmental clearance for its Visakhapatnam plant only last month and the factory was operating without it, two officials aware of the matter said on Friday, a day after a toxic gas leak from the unit left 11 people dead.“This polymer plant is a very old project (dating back to) when the EIA [environmental impact assessment] notification was not applicable. Subsequently, they did get relevant permissions from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board. They didn’t come to us but applied to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority [SEIAA] for an environmental clearance in 2018. There was confusion whether they will be assessed by the state or by the environment ministry. So only last month, their application for the EC [environmental clearance] was forwarded by the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority to us and it will be considered in due course,” said Geeta Menon, joint secretary, environment ministry.She added the company had expanded the unit, which required it to seek the clearance. “Based on that notification the company applied to SEIAA, Andhra Pradesh, but the project was not appraised. The file has come to us now. We will have to look into what violations have taken place and how long they have been operating without a valid EC,” added Menon. LG did not respond to queries from Hindustan Times sent on Thursday, and again on Friday. The ministry issued a notification in March 2017 allowing the environmental appraisal of projects, which had started work or expanded beyond their capacity. Projects were allowed to apply for such post-facto clearances for six months from the notification date.Environmental clearance involves the assessment of a project on the environment and people around it.Officials said the unit was established much before EIA norms of 2006 came into force,and it may not have applied for the clearance. “There was no law for environment clearance process then. It appears that they may not have taken the EC. But these issues are still being investigated,” said CK Mishra, secretary, environment ministry. The ministry’s website says the plant violated norms by undertaking manufacturing without the clearance. A notarised affidavit by LG Polymers India Private Limited on the ministry’s website admits the plant was functioning in violation of the EIA notification as it did not have an environment clearance for manufacturing polystyrene.According to the document dated May 8, 2019, the plant obtained “consent for establishment” in 2001 and “consent for operation” in 2002 from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB). Subsequently, “minor expansions” of the facility were undertaken with APPCB’s permission, the affidavit says. In all, those “minor expansions” entailed six enhancements in the plant’s capacity; for expandable polystyrene from 45 to 102 TPD and for polystyrene from 235 to 313 TPD between 2004 and 2017.The affidavit says when the company applied for the clearance for the capacity expansion to the environment ministry, it was found the unit was “operating without a valid environmental clearance” and in “violation” as per the applicable statute.Petrochemical based processing units are required to undergo the EIA as they fall under the red or a highly polluting category.“As on this date our industry does not have a valid environmental clearance substantiating the produced quantity…however we are continuing our operations with valid consent from the State Pollution Control Board,” the affidavit says. It refers to a 2017 Supreme Court judgement mandating 100% penalty for illegal operations in violation of various statutes including the Environment Protection Act. The affidavit says that the company is aware that the environmental appraisal of the project will be subject to a bank guarantee equivalent to the sum needed for the redemption management plan and natural and community resource augmentation plans.The unit was established in Vishakapatnam in 1965 by M/S Hindustan Polymers Limited, which was amalgamated with Mc Dowell and Company in 1982, according to the affidavit. Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, said a perusal of the documents reveals the project was still under environmental appraisal or a post-facto approval when the accident happened. “This is not merely a legal problem. It poses serious life, health and livelihood risks for people and can cause irreversible environmental damage.”Kohli said the project was in operation even as its application was pending under a “violations” category, which means its social and environmental impacts were never assessed. “This brings to light a systemic problem of the environment clearance process as thousands of projects have now come before the environment ministry disclosing that they were operating without approval. Such a system, which was earlier justified as a one-time amnesty, is now proposed as a routine exercise as part of the proposed EIA 2020 amendments. This defeats the idea of precautionary principles and prior environment clearance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-polymer-unit-didn-t-have-environmental-nod/story-CSMrE8I36C3k5TTR2fVsDM.html
09-05-2020||India||AIIMS Jhajjar to treat Covid-19 positive paramilitary jawans||With more 500 central paramilitary personnel contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the government has earmarked AIIMS Jhajjar for treatment all personnel testing positive for the infection, officials familiar with the development said.The decision was taken Friday during a meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah with the director generals of all paramilitary forces – the Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).The number of total positive cases in paramilitary forces touched 530 Friday with 30 new cases reported in BSF and 12 in ITBP. The BSF now has the highest number of Covid-19 cases at 221, followed by 161 in CRPF, 94 in ITBP, 35 in CISF and 17 in SSB. A CISF jawan, deployed at the Indian Museum in Kolkata, succumbed to the disease Friday, taking the number of casualties to five.One of the officials cited above said all paramilitary jawans, who were hitherto referred to ITBP hospital in Noida, and Safdarjung Hospital and Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in Delhi, will be sent to AIIMS Jhajjar where a dedicated team of doctors will look after their treatment.A majority of the jawans in BSF, ITBP and CRPF have contracted the infection in Delhi while performing law and order duties, while rest of the cases have been reported from Tripura, Mumbai and Kolkata.Expressing concern over the pace of Covid-19 spread in the paramilitary forces, also called CAPFs (central armed police forces), Shah instructed all director generals to ensure that contact tracing of affected jawans and testing facilities are augmented and everyone follows the safety guidelines prescribed by the Union health ministry.Shah told the chiefs of forces that “Modi government is not only concerned over the spread of Covid-19 but is making all efforts to ensure safety, security and well-being of all CAPFs”, according to statement released by the Press Information Bureau. He also enquired about the situation regarding security personnel affected by the virus in each of the CAPFs as well as persons who were found to be asymptomatic. Shah also asked the director generals to ensure timely payment of terminal dues, including ex-gratia, insurance, etc., in case of a casualty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-jhajjar-to-treat-paramilitary-jawans/story-8uemmJQEE7OyL6O1c2ys6M.html
09-05-2020||India||Kerala HC seeks govt’s response to plea against Aarogya Setu app||New Delhi: The Kerala high court on Friday sought the response of the Union government in a plea challenging its May 1 directive to make the mobile application Aarogya Setu mandatory for all persons working in government and private companies.The bench headed by justice Shaji P Chaly, however, did not stay the directive while asking the Centre to file its response by May 12. The petitioner John Daniel, who is the general secretary of the Thrissur District Congress Committee, on Thursday challenged the government’s mandate to use Aarogya Setu -- a key tool in the Union government’s bid to contain the spread of Covid-19 -- alleging that it violates the privacy and autonomy of an individual.He submitted that Aarogya setu app collects personal information of an individual without consent, contended that forcible extraction of personal information is unheard of in a democratic country, and called it an attribute of a dictatorial system.He also argued that Centre’s directive asked the state governments to proceed under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) against anyone who does not install the app. Section 188 of the IPC states that any person who disobeys an order given by a public servant can be punished with imprisonment up to six months.“If a particular citizens disapproves the use of the same, it could be said that the information was forcibly and coercively taken from him without his consent and by inflicting fear of penal consequences. Such coercive and forcible extraction of personal information from an individual is unheard of in a democratic and republic setup and it is attribute of a dictatorial system”, the petition said.The central government launched Aarogya Setu on April 2 to disseminate information regarding Covid-19, and to collect data from individuals. It is a tracking mobile application which uses the smartphone’s GPS and Bluetooth features to track the coronavirus infection. It determines whether or not an individual has been within six feet of a Covid-19 – infected person by scanning through a database of known cases across India.On April 29, the app was made mandatory for all central government employees. On May 1, it was extended to all employees in private and public institutions.The petitioner’s contention is that the app continuously collects data of an individual once it is installed on the mobile phone. By forcing people to download the app, there is no question of consent in providing personal information, the petitioner argued.Privacy and autonomy are facets of right to life under Article 21 as per the landmark 2017 Supreme Court judgment in KS Puttaswamy matter (nine-judge bench), the petitioner submitted.“He (an individual) is forced to give away data to a system which he may or may not approve of, thereby attacking his right of informational autonomy,” the petition said.A French computer researcher -- who goes by the nom de guerre Elliot Alderson -- on Tuesday posted on social media a technical analysis of the alleged flaws of Aayogya Setu on Wednesday, saying the application has vulnerabilities that could compromise the identity and movement of the millions of Indians who use it.The Union government, which dismissed the contention, maintains said the platform is “absolutely robust, safe and secure”. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad earlier this week said it was “a perfectly accountable platform to help in the fight against Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-seeks-govt-s-response-to-plea-against-aarogya-setu-app/story-G9tdb3M50VzZlj7c6RCc8O.html

India’s played constructive role in Afghanistan and its support for efforts for peace, reconciliation and development had figured in discussions in New Delhi on Thursday between Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for Afghanistan, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.“The US side’s expectation was that India would continue to play a positive role and India has to be a part of the process to effectively contribute to the process,” the person said.India clearly conveyed its concerns regarding a recent surge in terrorist violence in Afghanistan and the role played by Pakistan-based terror sanctuaries during the meetings with Khalilzad.Khalilzad’s short visit to India amid the Covid-19 crisis highlighted the “level of urgency” regarding the situation in Afghanistan and the discussions took in the gamut of developments in the war-torn country, including internal developments, the impact of the US-Taliban agreement and efforts aimed reconciliation between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, the people said.The Indian side highlighted the threat posed to Afghanistan by terrorism and the increase in attacks by the Taliban on security forces, as well as concerns about the impact of the violence on the Afghan constitutional set-up and on minorities such as Hindus and Sikhs, the people added.At the same time, India and Iran have cooperated to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, the people said. A total of 1,142 Indians, including pilgrims from Kashmir and Ladakh and students, were repatriated from Iran while more than 1,000 Iranians have been flown back from India. The Iranian side helped arranged treatment for some 300 Indians who tested positive for Covid-19, while India has provided medical assistance and medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chabahar-port-helps-india-extend-aid-to-afghanistan/story-iwpOeJ9d9lTXJQ5awHEuuJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Taxing work conditions, long hours fail to deter Pune nurse||Last month, when senior nurse Rajashri Kanade was due to return home after 20 straight days of duty, reports of healthcare workers being assaulted by neighbours and random people on the streets were all over the news. The 52-year-old, who was deputed at the Sassoon general hospital’s Covid-19 intensive care unit, was worried about the reception she might receive from her housing society. The Centre eventually amended the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 to make such acts of violence a non-bailable offence, but Kanade needn’t have worried. On her return home, residents of the housing society where she has lived for the past five years, welcomed her with a shower of flower petals and an ‘arti’. Children ran up to her and gave her hand-made greeting cards, thanking her for all the effort she has put in to fight against the coronavirus pandemic.“I was overwhelmed and couldn’t stop crying. I felt like we were one big family,” said Kanade. Of Pune’s 107 deaths, a majority have been at the Sassoon hospital, one of the three Covid-19 specific hospitals in the city. Kanade, who was working in the ICU before she returned home — she has now been deputed to the Organ Transplant unit — was required to wear the personal protective equipment (PPE), one of the most important preemptive measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Another measure hospitals are taking is to turn off the air conditioning, as according to studies, the virus is able to stay suspended on aerosols, though its virulity decreases over time.There are other limitations once the PPE, comprising a body suit, mask, headgear, gloves and shoes has been worn. Once removed, the kit cannot be re-used and must be disposed. Kanade did not eat, drink or use the washroom for at least seven hours once she wore the PPE. “The PPE kit is very heavy and it sticks to the body. It is very difficult to work when you are drenched in sweat. But after years in the job, I discipline my mind to concentrate on the work at hand. Only after I remove the kit, do I use the washroom and drink at least two litres of water,” said Kanade. She would also not eat for the duration that she was in the PPE.The patients were almost always anxious and full of fear, she said. Therefore, the first thing that the medical staff do is stay positive. They help patients relax before they begin treatment, she said. “Once we enter the ward would sing a prayer hymn, ‘Hum ko itni shakti dena’,” she said.Kanade said her family was very supportive of her work: her son Aniket dropped her and picked her up; her daughter-in-law Snehal packed her meals.“We health workers are handling a pandemic for the first time,” Kanade said. “People need to follow all the precautions laid out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taxing-work-conditions-long-hours-fail-to-deter-pune-nurse/story-CCoDxheYZU6TTNCiB8dOcM.html
09-05-2020||India||Focusing on menstrual care in time of Covid-19 pandemic||For the past 11 years, anganwadi worker Pushpa Devi of Dablain village in Haryana’s Jind district leaves her home at 10 am for a few days each month. Along with 10 other women, she distributes sanitary napkins to the women of the village, free of cost. All the women are members of a self help group formed in 2004 and make these napkins with cloth. Like Devi, many of the women who accompany her on her rounds are anganwadi workers who have been tasked by the state government to distribute ration from the local Integrated Child Development Services centre to beneficiaries. This has proved to be a boon for them, as their sanitary napkin rounds continue unaffected.Women’s menstrual care in India is an area of concern: most rural women are unable to use hygiene products either due to lack of awareness of products like sanitary napkins and safe practises during menstruation, or due to their inability to purchase these products. According to the 2015-2016 family health survey, 51.8% women in rural areas used unhygienic methods of protection or none at all during their menstrual cycles. The government terms sanitary napkins, including homemade ones, and tampons, hygienic methods of protection.Poonam Muttreja of the Population Fund, a non governmental organisation working in the area of gender sensitive policies on population and health said that cloth, if not used hygienically, can lead to lots of infections. “Urinary tract infections can happen if cloth is not used properly. Soap and sun, which are needed to keep the cloth hygienic, are sometimes not availed by women, as reproductive health is a private issue and women tend to hide the clothes,” Muttreja said. Lack of clean water compounds women’s health issues. The group was trained to make sanitary napkins in 2009 after a bureaucrat in the local administration initiated the effort. “We bring the material from Delhi, and unlike commercial napkins, our pads are biodegradable,” Devi said over the phone from her village. “We have even trained women in other villages to make them and even how to use them. We tell them that reusing cloth is unhygienic and can lead to infections.” The group now has a facility in the village where women can make these napkins; there, the women have uninterrupted power supply, required to operate some of the sewing machines needed to stitch the pads. During the lockdown, the women have distributed over 500 packets in their village of 5000 residents, Devi said. The group also sells napkins — each packet has six, and costs Rs 12 — to women from other villages who want to sell them in their communities. Though the work that they do is vital, anganwadi workers continue to remain at high risk as they are required to do their work without much protection. There are no protective gear at all provided to these women, and anganwadi workers either buy or make the masks that they wear. The need for protective gear have been echoed by several anganwadi associations. Concerns mounted in Jind in the last few days, as four women tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week.Suman, secretary of Jind’s Anganwadi Association, said that the women were on duty at Nidani village, and their samples were collected. “They tested positive, and were moved to Rohtak. Though we were told later that they are not positive, without protective gear, the women [anganwadi workers] are scared to move around in the village,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focusing-on-menstrual-care-in-time-of-pandemic/story-4xWhX7aHYSvylpz7NRmpMO.html

Though it remains unclear how the policeman’s 27-year-old wife and son got infected, Vijayanta Arya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (north-west), said that the constable had been with his family in Sonepat for 10 days until April 4, when he returned to duty in the national capital. When the constable died of the coronavirus infection on Tuesday, the Sonepat administration had got his wife, son and other family members tested for Covid-19 after his cremation. “On Friday, the test results of his wife and son returned positive. They are being looked after,” the official from Sonepat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-days-later-wife-and-son-of-delhi-cop-who-died-of-covid-19-also-test-positive/story-y5I1DU3Su2v4GyYvYnS3QO.html
09-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Only severe cases to be tested before discharge, says Centre||The Union health ministry on Friday revised its discharge guidelines for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, requiring only patients who had developed a severe illness or have compromised immunity to test negative through a swab test before they are allowed to leave the hospital or a care centre.The other category of patients, including very mild, mild, pre-symptomatic and moderate cases need not be tested before discharge.The revised discharge guidelines are in contrast with the government’s previous rules that said a laboratory confirmed case had to be tested on day 14 once and then again in a span of 24 hours -- if both the results are negative then the patient is fit to be discharged from the health care facility.When contacted about the revised guidelines, joint secretary, health ministry, Lav Agarwal, said: “The ministry has issued detailed guidelines as per the clinical status of the patient that should be followed.”The revised discharge policy is aligned with guidelines on the 3-tier Covid-19 health facilities and the categorization of patients based on clinical severity — mild, moderate and severe.“For mild, very mild and pre-symptomatic cases admitted to a Covid Care Facility will undergo regular temperature and pulse monitoring. Patient can be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset and if they have no fever for 3 days. There will be no need for testing prior to discharge. At the time of discharge, patient will be advised to follow the home isolation for 7 more days,” say the revised guidelines.“After discharge from the facility, if they again develop symptoms of fever, cough or breathing difficulty, he will contact the COVID Care Centre or State helpline or 1075. Their health will again be followed up through tele-conference on 14th day.”Cases clinically classified as moderate cases will undergo monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation. If fever resolves within three days and patient maintains saturation above 95% for the next 4 days (without oxygen support), such patient will be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset in case there is no fever without anti-fever drugs, no breathlessness and no need for oxygen. There will again be no need for testing prior to discharge, and home isolation for 7 days is suggested with close monitoring of health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-severe-cases-to-be-tested-before-discharge-centre/story-CEDSmxZz77tEdgfv5VYHYK.html
09-05-2020||India||Govt expands reach of Vande Bharat mission to bring back Indians stranded abroad||India will expand its massive repatriation programme for citizens stranded abroad due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis to Russia, Central Asian states and European countries such as Germany and Spain next week, people familiar with developments said on Friday.The Vande Bharat Mission, as the repatriation programme has been dubbed, has focused on neighbouring countries such as the Maldives and Bangladesh and West Asian states such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which have millions of expatriates, in the first phase during May 7-14.“For the second week of the mission from May 15, we will expand the scope of repatriation to other places not covered so far, particularly Russia, Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and European states such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and Spain,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.There will also be flights to Ukraine and Thailand, and the focus will be on countries with large numbers of Indian students, who accounted for more than a third of the nearly 68,000 requests for repatriation received by the external affairs ministry in New Delhi from people stranded abroad.During the first week of the Vande Bharat exercise from May 7, a total of 64 flights from 12 countries are expected to land at 14 airports across India with some 15,000 people. The first two flights from the UAE arrived in Kerala on Thursday.During the second week of the repatriation programme, there will be greater use of feeder flights both outside the country and within India, the people said. For instance, feeder flights could bring Indians stranded in Latin American countries to a point in the US for a return flight to India.“The main issue is the commercial viability of the operations to ensure what Air India does is self-sustaining. The flights are being operated at cost and this is not a profit-making venture,” the person cited above said, explaining why the government opted to charge for ferrying stranded nationals back to India.Noting that the government hadn’t charged for previous evacuation flights, the person added: “In the past, evacuations were from conflict zones and in emergency situations. Now, we are talking about a repatriation of people who want to return to India.“They have the means to return. They are studying and working abroad, they will finance their own return to India at minimum cost.”The people said the cost of tickets from West Asian states, for instance, were reasonable when compared to the rates of airlines from other countries that are currently operating. The government is also trying to increase the viability of Air India’s operations by allowing people on outbound flights provided they have long-term visas or residency permits and the destination countries are willing to receive them, the people said.The external affairs ministry’s online platform, on which requests received by Indian missions from citizens wanting to return are regularly uploaded, has so far recorded a total of 67,833 requests. About 34% requests or about 22,500 were from students, 30% or nearly 16,000 from migrant workers, 9,250 from short-term visa holders whose visas had expired, more than 5,500 from people with medical emergencies or seeking treatment for terminal illnesses, more than 4,000 from stranded tourists, more than 3,000 from pregnant women and the elderly and more than 1,100 from people who wanted to return due to a death in the family.These repatriation requests were from Kerala, which topped the list with more than 25,200, Tamil Nadu, with some 6,600, Maharashtra, with about 4,300, Uttar Pradesh, with more than 3,715, Rajasthan, with more than 3,300, Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi, all with more than 2,000 requests each.On Thursday, an Air India flight from Abu Dhabi to Kochi brought back 181 people, while another Air India flight from Dubai to Kozhikode returned with 182 passengers. On Friday, an Air India flight from Singapore to Delhi returned with 234 passengers, while another flight from Dhaka to Srinagar brought back 168 passengers.There will be a total of 27 flights from West Asia during the first week of Vande Bharat, including 11 from the UAE, five each from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and two each from Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.During the same period, there will be seven flights from Bangladesh to bring back nationals to Srinagar, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. There will be another 14 flights from South-east Asia, including five each from Singapore and the Philippines and four from Malaysia.There will also be seven flights in the first week from four airports in the US – New York, Washington, Chicago and San Francisco, and seven more flights from London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-expands-reach-of-vande-bharat-mission/story-ehpP6er0dLaJGMToL9hi1M.html
09-05-2020||India||Gujarat infections rise by 46.47% in a week, Covid-19 tally climbs to 7,403||Almost a third of Gujarat’s 7403 Covid-19 cases (May 9) and a little less than half the deaths, were reported in the past week, as India’s western state continued to be roiled by the coronavirus disease. Till May 2, the number of cases in the state was 5054 . This rose to 7,403 on May 8, which means the number of cases increased by 46.47%.The number of deaths also increased by 71.37% in this period. Till May 2, there were 236 deaths; this increased to 449 on May 7.Friday saw 390 positive cases and 24 deaths . Three districts account for 88.8% of the total cases: Ahmedabad (5,260), Surat (824) and Vadodra (465). Of the 449 deaths, 343 have been reported from Ahmedabad ,38 from Surat and 31 from Vadodra. Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), Gujarat said that the state has conducted more than 1 lakh tests to identify Covid-19 patients.“Till date, 1872 people have been discharged which means the recovery rate has improved by over 374% in the past one week,” Ravi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-infections-rise-by-46-47-in-a-week-covid-tally-climbs-to-7-403/story-oN8hAeEWtssuzehPtYzpFK.html
09-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Must learn to live with the virus to beat it, says govt||The government said on Friday that Indians needed to make behavioural changes and learn to live with the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen, which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), even as it said that close to one in three patients were now free of the viral infection.In its daily briefings, the central government has previously asserted that Covid-19 necessitates a “new normal” of social distancing and heightened public health vigil, which are essential to stop the advance of the highly infectious disease. On Friday, the country reported 3,241 new cases, taking the total to 59,543 infections, according to official data provided by states.Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said on Friday that a recent spike in cases brought down the doubling rate, the average duration in which cases rise twofold, but added that the peak of the disease can be avoided if the prescribed dos and don’ts are followed.“We will have to learn to live with the virus, for which it is important to make critical behavioural changes and incorporate all the preventive guidelines that the health ministry has been issuing on following hand hygiene, cough etiquette and social distancing measures, as part of our daily routine. It is an everyday battle for us to keep the infection at bay,” the official said.He said that with 16,539 people cured of Covid-19, according to the Centre’s data, close to one in three patients were now free of the respiratory disease. “The recovery rate shows that almost one in third infected person has recovered in India. It is a positive sign as it is increasing by the day,” Agarwal said. HT’s dashboard on Covid-19 cases, which is based on data released by states, shows that the doubling rate over the past week has reduced from close to 12 days to just above 10 days, an alarming trend.Experts say a graded exit from the national lockdown, which is scheduled to conclude on May 17, could lead to a surge in cases and the peak of the disease could hit between now and August, signalling the importance of aggressive testing and adequate social distancing to keep the disease from spiralling out of control.With average daily cases over the past week remaining close to 3,000, the government is soon expected to revise its list of “red zones”, hot spots that need special attention to contain the spread of the disease.“We are aware that at some places, the number of cases has seen an abnormal growth that has also affected the country’s overall doubling rate. States such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan have been reporting higher number of cases, and the Centre is in constant touch with them to assist them by providing technical guidance in implementing stricter containment measures,” Agarwal said.The number of infected cases needing critical care continued to remain low in India, with 1.1% on ventilator support, 3.2% on oxygen support and 4.7% patients undergoing treatment in intensive care units (ICUs), he added.There are 216 districts that have not reported any case so far; about 42 districts have had no fresh case in the last 28 days; and 29 districts have not reported any fresh case in three weeks.The government said that while the health care facilities were prepared to manage the current caseload, other ministries were making additional arrangements to tackle a surge in infections. “Indian Railways has converted 5,231 of its rail coaches into Covid care centres, to be stationed in 215 identified railway stations for very mild and mild cases. To avoid cross-infection, there will be separate coaches for suspected and confirmed cases. A maximum of two confirmed people can be allowed to share a cabin. As many as 85 stations will have adequate number of medical personnel available to manage the cases. There are about 2,500 doctors and 35,000 paramedical staff from the railways set-aside for Covid-19 management,” said Agarwal.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also secured approvals from the Covid-19 National Ethics Committee for conducting clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy. The research body has identified 21 sites across India to conduct the trials.“The sites include five hospitals in Maharashtra, four hospitals in Gujarat, two each in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, and one each in Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana, and the union territory of Chandigarh,” the official said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday interacted with the state health ministers of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana to review preparedness as part of a daily exercise. He stressed on the need to increase the sampling and testing of severe acute respiratory illnesses and influenza-like illnesses in all districts to determine the exact spread of the disease. He also discussed arrangements made by these states for the quarantine of migrant workers returning to the regions from other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-learn-to-live-with-the-virus-to-beat-it-says-govt/story-IarrAwLNoPijbSJhhu2CIM.html
09-05-2020||India||Some states put freeze on labour laws to get business going||Undertaking a radical set of politically controversial economic reform measures, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP), two states with substantial workforces, have frozen major labour laws, except basic ones, in the hope that businesses will recoup from the blow of the Covid-19 pandemic and create more jobs on a net basis.The changes give industries more flexibility in hiring and firing employees, determining their wages, and reduce their liabilities in terms of providing employee benefits. Some economists welcomed the move for clearing structural bottlenecks, possibly leading to greater investment, creating employment opportunities for migrant workers returning home, and positioning India to be able to take advantage of disruptions in global supply chains. The move, however, also sparked intense criticism from the Opposition, particularly left parties, trade unions including those affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and civil society activists for undermining worker rights, removing decades-old protective measures and slowly dismantle the welfare architecture. To be sure, 90% of India’s workforce, which is employed in the informal sector, won’t be affected by these changes. These apply to those who are in the organised workforce and registered firms. While the Centre has attempted a degree of changes in labour laws, there have been no moves with as wide ranging an impact as those brought about in UP and MP. UP suspended key labour laws for three years on May 6 through an ordinance, even as MP announced on May 7 it was taking a similar course to put all labour laws on hold, barring some provisions of the Factories Act, 1948, for the next 1,000 days. The move comes after the BJP held consultations with stakeholders back in April. The UP government passed the Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance, 2020, that exempts businesses, manufacturing mostly, for three years from a gamut of labour laws barring four: the Building and Other Construction Workers Act; Workmen Compensation Act; Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act; and section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act, which mandates employers to pay timely wages, and the Maternity Benefits Act. This means that a broad range of laws will not apply. These include the Factories Act, which mandates work-hours provisions. In UP, this stood at eight hour daily shifts and 48 hours a week. Employers need not abide by it anymore. The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 too now remains suspended in UP and Madhya Pradesh. In UP, the Act in the state covers 12 sectors that account for four-fifths of manufacturing output. The law requires 30- to 90-day notice period before retrenching “workmen”, which is a class of mainly floor workers. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations, and mines with 100 or more workmen, lay-offs also required government approval. These approvals will no longer be required. The moves by the two heartland states could be a model for other BJP-ruled states, as thousands of migrant workers head back to home states, many on foot, creating a burdening surplus labour force. Gujarat and Uttarakhand are likely to follow suit, an official said.“In order to revive economy, a total of 3000 hectares of land in the industrial estates of the (state) Gujarat will be made available from the state’s land bank and also different desk-nodal officers will be assisting incoming industries from other countries. New industries will be exempted from labour laws other than the Minimum Wages Act, Industrial Safety and Health Act, Labour Compensation Act for 1,200 days from the start of production in the state,” a Gujarat government official said.Uttarakhand labour minister Harak Singh Rawat said his state too was contemplating “similar moves” to give exemptions to industry to help them deal with losses. The moves come in the backdrop of consultations undertaken by the BJP last month. Between April 3 and 10, the BJP held discussions with four groups of stakeholders on the economy and reforms. “There are many bottlenecks we need to remove. Cost of acquiring land, and the legal and procedural delays are issues. Similarly, we need reforms in the labour sector,” Gopal Agarwal, the party’s spokesperson on economic issues said. The move has divided economists as well as the political spectrum. On one side are those who believe that archaic labour laws had greatly crippled India’s economic story. make it virtually impossible to fire employees, letting inefficient firms survive at the cost efficient ones. Stringent labour laws that apply to firms employing over 100 employees act as an incentive for smaller firms to stay small so they can escape the rules. According to the World Bank, with less restrictive laws, India could approximately add on an annual basis “2.8 million more good quality formal sector jobs”. According to a recent State Bank of India Research, the country’s labour productivity was also significantly lower than its global peers. “Even in the next decade, i.e., by 2021 it is estimated that India’s output per worker will rise to just $6,414 compared to China’s $16,698,” it said.The changes give markets a much freer hand to regulate labour demand and supply, and enhance productivity and size. They, according to one official requesting anonymity, aim to increase competitiveness of firms and improve exports, while increasing labour demand. “All along we have argued for labour reforms. We know existing laws have certainly not helped the economy. We also easily assume that existing laws are good for workers and protect them. There is no way there can be business as usual. We will have to see what are the outcomes after a year or so,” said NR Bhanumurthy of the New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. Bhanumurthy said the caution he would like to apply is not to hop from “one extreme to another”. The criticism comes from those who believe that it is precisely this other extreme that has been adopted. The core concern is that the changes dilute protections, such as floor wages and work shifts. This effectively brings the “north American hire-and-fire model to the Indian hinterland economy”, said economist KR Shyam Sundar of the Xavier Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur. The government has approached the problem from the wrong end, Shyam Sundar said. “Labour law changes giving flexibility of labour to employers will be meaningless unless supply-side measures are designed, such as wage subsidies, cheaper capital and more access to markets because of piled-up inventory due to the lockdown.” These changes will expose workers to livelihood vulnerabilities, he said.Seven left parties, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary, Sitaram Yechury, have written. a letter President Ram Nath Kovind for the latter’s urgent intervention on this issue to stop “such naked savagery against the working class and the working people”. Workers are angry and trade unions have criticised the moves. “This is the worst time to make amendments to labour laws,” said CK Saji Narayana, president of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, which is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP’s ideological parent. General secretary of the left-leaning CITU Tapan Sen said the government had “pounced upon the working class”. The country however has been easing many labour rules over time. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took steps to restrict power of federal labour inspectors by introducing random inspections assignments to them and setting time limits for reports. Some businesses were allowed to self-audit too. Rajasthan, under a BJP government, also pushed reforms in labour laws. The government’s ambitious plan to take the 40 different central labour laws and 100 state laws and merge them into four codes is still not complete. Of these four codes, the code on wages has been cleared by Parliament. Three codes—on occupational safety and health, industrial relations and social security -- are yet to be cleared. According to experts, India will have to balance the need for businesses to grow along with maintaining labour safety nets. Bibhas Saha of the Durham University Business School argued that labour law reforms, a necessity, have been a long time coming. He however said job security needs to be replaced with the concept of income security. This implies the state’s provisioning of benefits such as unemployment allowances.

09-05-2020||India||Industry bodies urge move to boost jobs||Industry bodies have asked for a suspension of labour laws, except those dealing with minimum wages, bonus and statutory dues for two to three years; the treatment of the ongoing lockdown period as an industrial furlough (termed a lay-off according to law); and for the payment of wages in this period to be expensed under Corporate Social Responsibility activities, as ways in which the state can help Indian industry during the ongoing crisis brought about by Covid-19 and the lockdown enforced to combat its spread. The organisations also asked for allowing 50% of the workforce to join a factory to restart production . These demands were raised during a webinar between the bodies and the Union labour ministry on Friday. The latest demands come after some states relaxed labour laws to woo fresh investments even as opposition parties and trade unions erupted in protests. Uttar Pradesh moved an ordinance to bypass a host of labour laws while some others allowed longer work hours in factories. Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar read out a list of measures taken to resolve workers’ woes during the Covid-induced lockdown and said that his ministry is “sympathetic to the requirements of the industry and would try to provide all possible help”, an official present at the meeting dais on condition of anonymity.  Labour secretary Hiralal Samariya assured employers that the ministry remains “committed to provide all help” ro address problems faced by the industry bodies while protecting the interests of the workers. CII, FICCI, Assocham, Council of Indian Employers and eight other employer associations attended the meeting, days after the labour ministry interacted with trade unions. Meeting recurring expenses such as payment of wages have emerged as a key concern in some sectors. While some factories have restarted work in a limited way, others still haven’t for a variety of reasons including being located in a so-called containment zone. Which is why the industry bodies want the lockdown to be equated to what the Industrial Disputes Act, enacted in 1947, terms a lay-off: the inability of a factory to operate normally on account of a raw material or power shortage or a natural calamity. The law stipulates compensation for lay-off at “50% of the total of the basic wages and dearness allowance that would have been payable to him had he not been so laid-off”.The law also says that if the lay-off period extends beyond 45 days, no additional compensation will be paid. With the government slowly opening up more industries, the employers wanted that at least 50% of the workforce must be allowed to work to increase of goods and services to optimum level. The Centre had announced that under the PMGKY, it will pay 24% of the companies’ contribution to provident fund of eligible workers who earner less than Rs 15,000 a month and are employed in a factory that has up to 100 workers. The industry bodies want the threshold on this eased so that more workers can be covered under the scheme. Apart from seeking suspension of labour except those dealing with minimum wages, bonus and statutory dues, the bodies also want an increase in the working hours to 12 hours per day.With millions of migrant workers already returned home or keen to go back, they also asked for a programme for “return of these migrant labour to work by providing counselling to alleviate their fears on Covid-19, providing financial help for their transportation, providing free groceries for about six months,” according to a second official familiar with the happenings at the meeting. They also suggested that instead of red, orange and green zones the government should notify just containment and non-containment zones to “facilitate easy movement of workers and goods”.Achirangshu Acharya, economist with Vishwa Bharati University said, “Suspension of basic rights of the workers can lead to exploitation of workers and the government needs to be careful about such demands. As India had a high unemployment rate even before the pandemic crippled the economy, the focus should on providing jobs to maximum people, not extending working hours for a set of workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industry-bodies-urge-move-to-boost-jobs/story-g6VxnurBeIVXA0neKGskhK.html
09-05-2020||India||Our labour reforms help create more jobs in UP: Sidharth Nath Singh||A minister in the Uttar Pradesh cabinet with the charge of several departments, including  MSMEs, investment promotion, textile, and khadi and village industries, Sidharth Nath Singh spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran about migrants returning to the state, changes in labour laws, the MSME sector, and investments. Edited excepts:UP has the highest number of MSMEs, and they are the worse hit from the lockdown. What is the state doing for the sector?The MSMEs mostly want help on the credit side; a lot of steps have been taken by the state to ease things. We have waived off fixed electricity charges and are billing them only for what is being consumed. Major labour reforms have been undertaken, which allow exemptions from several labour laws for a thousand days for both the existing as well as newer companies that want to set up base in UP. We are working closely with state-level banking committees to see ensure they can get what the RBI said -- 10% extra loan on the basis of their working capital.You mentioned labour reforms, but there is a lot of criticism about making changes in the laws at this time. Won’t these make workers more vulnerable to jobs losses?I can’t understand the criticism, because it helps create more jobs in UP. Our migrant labourers are coming back from other states, so we need to create more jobs. The jobs can only come in if the industries come in. All the clauses related to minimum wages, the number of hours, safety and security measures, are intact; clauses related to child labour and bonded labour will be applicable as they were before. What was redundant, unnecessary and not required, what added to red-tapism and corruption and allowed labour inspector raj, has been taken away. And, we will ensure safety and security for the labourers.There are hundreds of thousands of workers returning to UP. Is that a cause of concern, because you have to offer them jobs and take care of their medical and other needs?Whenever we looked at creating an industrial ecosystem, we found we never had trained or semi-skilled labour. For so many years, workers were known to work outside UP. Now with so many of them returning, we have an opportunity to go for a skilling programme. Now we have skilled and semi-skilled labourers who can be deployed in many sectors provided we give them a job opportunity. It is an opportunity, not a matter of worry.You’ve been holding meetings with investors. Which are the sectors that are likely to attract them?The CM formed a task force to look into attracting investments coming in, particularly from China. Apart from me, the task force has senior bureaucrats, and we have taken the professional services of Ernst & Young. We looked at two levels of competition, first at the domestic level between states; and the second from South-East Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.We looked at various aspects -- incentives, cost of wages, production -- and improved our existing policies. The sectors that we focused on are pharmaceuticals, food processing, medical devices, electronics and automobiles. The reforms will soon be approved by the state cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-labour-reforms-help-create-more-jobs-in-up-sidharth-nath-singh/story-AsG1V6bawfrR9iWm8FYohN.html
09-05-2020||India||Centre must give stimulus, decentralise power, says Rahul Gandhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold regular conversations with chief ministers “not as the boss but as a colleague” to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, and called for an economic package for all sections of society -- from the poorest to large industries -- because they are all interconnected parts of the economic engine that need to be kick-started to spur demand.In his second press conference during the national lockdown (he first addressed the media on April 16), Gandhi listed eight key points that, he said, the government needed to look at immediately -- income support to the poorest households; jobs through the rural employment guarantee scheme; food security to people outside the public distribution system; income and purchase guarantees to the farmers; wage protection for MSMEs; credit and subsidies for big businesses; getting shopkeepers back to work; and helping migrant workers return home.“You have to take care of big and small businesses alike because everything is connected. If you want to start the engine, you cannot think of starting just one part of the engine. You need to create demand, put money in the system, put money in poor people’s hands, help MSMEs and make sure you are protecting some of the larger players, because these are all interconnected,” Gandhi said during an hour-long video news conference.The larger idea, he said, was to end fear psychosis surrounding Covid-19, and letting people draw confidence from how the disease is not deadly for 98-99% of the people. “People are very scared. The Prime Minister needs to dispel this fear and tell people this is a dangerous disease for just 1-2% of the population who are old and those who have diabetic and heart conditions,” Gandhi said.In a more granular description of this plan, he called for a transfer of Rs.7,500, or even Rs.5,000, to each of India’s 130 million poorest households. “It is going to cost Rs 65,000 crore, and will transform the way people are thinking about the current pandemic,” he said.About employment guarantee, Gandhi said that the 100 days of the wage employment under MGNREGA should be doubled to 200 days. For food security, he asked the government to ensure delivery of 10kg rice or wheat, 1kg pulses and 1kg sugar to every individual every month for six months; and for farmers, he asked the government to transfer Rs10,000 as Urgent Income Support to all PM-Kisan accounts, purchase all foodgrain at MSP, and remove GST on fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural equipment.For entrepreneurs and industry, he suggested that government give a Rs 1 lakh crore wage protection and Rs 1 lakh crore credit guarantee schemes, along with a six-month interest subsidy on loans. He called for similar credit guarantees to big businesses to ensure the value chain is unaffected and layoffs are avoided.Gandhi has been holding conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its impact on the Indian economy. So far, he has spoken with Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee and former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan. Asked if these conversations and his active involvement meant he is coming back as the party chief, Gandhi said, “You please read my letter one year ago (when I stepped down). I wanted to give the people a glimpse of what the experts think about the present situation.”Calling for decentralisation for a comprehensive fight against the disease, he said the battle needs to be taken to the district level. “If we fight this in the PMO only, we will lose. The Prime Minister must devolve power. If we centralise, there will be a calamity,” Gandhi said. “The Prime Minister has to trust chief ministers who, in turn, have to trust district magistrates. The Centre should leave the call of categorising zones to them and not take decisions in Delhi... Forget about Congress-ruled states or BJP-ruled states. They are all Indian chief ministers and should be working together with the Prime Minister. If I was to advise the Prime Minister, even though it is not my place, definitely he should make calls to every chief minister in 1-2 days in a partnership-type call,” he added.Gandhi also reiterated his party’s stand on the national lockdown, asking for an exit strategy, and asserting that the lockdown does not have an “on-off switch”. “You can’t switch it off and it’s gone... It requires number of things to happen. It requires a psychological change. The government needs to understand that.”The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said Gandhi was speaking without the right facts. “The Prime Minister has been consulting chief ministers and subject experts in dealing with the situation... The ever youthful Congress leader, who is about to complete a half century, now at least should have some wisdom and practicality,” party spokesperson Sudanshu Trivedi said. “It is very typical and characteristic of Gandhi to speak before media without studying facts. It’s not time to create controversy directly or indirectly. Instead it is time for cooperation and Gandhi should try to fight the biggest calamity in human history under the able guidance of our Prime Minister,” he added.Political analyst Chandan Gowda of the Bengaluru-based Azim Premji University agreed with Gandhi that the Covid-19 containment effort should be collaborative, decentralised and all-encompassing. “Over-centralised decision-making violates the spirit of a federal polity too,” Gowda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-must-give-stimulus-decentralise-power-rahul/story-O72zHPpRHiRCxaobllaHCN.html
09-05-2020||India||Train operators told to spot and report to avoid deaths||A group of factory workers on a 36-hour journey by foot in Maharashtra to catch transport back to their hometown in Madhya Pradesh, fell asleep exhausted after walking along the tracks since they thought there would be no trains running, the safety regulator of the railways said on Friday, calling for new protocols for engineers and field staff to report any instance of people walking on tracks so that other trains can be warned.The victims were workers at a steel factory in Maharashtra’s Jalna. After covering 36km on Thursday, they slept on the railway tracks where they were run over in the early hours of Friday -- 16 of the 20 people in the group died on the spot, where images showed a trail of scattered luggage and food.“Apparently, the affected persons had gathered along the track under the impression that train services have been suspended due to Covid-19 lockdown. Furthermore, false sense of security may have come to their minds about there being no trains running whereas freight, parcel specials have been running from before and now migrant specials have also started plying,” chief railway safety commissioner Shailesh Kumar Pathak said in a letter to railway board chairman Vinod Yadav. HT has seen the letter. The incident brings into focus the desperation of hundreds of thousands of people who migrated to work from some of India’s most impoverished villages and towns to industrial hot spots and urban centres, but now find themselves unemployed as the country remains shut down in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to railway ministry officials, the locomotive pilot controlling the freight train tried to warn the victims when he spotted them using the train’s horn and tried to stop, but the people could not react in time and the train was not able to come to a stop.The average speed of freight trains has risen from the approximately 24 km/hr usually to more than double now as passenger train services remain suspended due to the nationwide lockdown, decongesting the railway network. A high-level inquiry headed by the Commissioner Railway Safety (South Central Circle) has been ordered to investigate the incident and arrive at the cause, the ministry said. Railways minister Piyush Goyal said in a tweet on Friday that the ministry is closely monitoring the situation and is briefing him on the steps taken in this regard. The safety commissioner said as a measure of abundant precaution, it is essential that all railway personnel connected with train operations, maintenance, and patrolling activities should immediately communicate if they spot persons walking along the track. This is so that “necessary action like caution order to all passing trains…may be taken,” the official added. The safety commissioner has instructed that a ‘caution order’ be handed out to engineers to ensure special precautions. “A ‘Caution Order’ detailing the kilometres between which such precautions are necessary, the reasons for taking such precautions, and the speed at which a train shall travel, shall be handed to the Loco Pilot at the stopping station immediately short of the place where such precautions are necessary, or at such other stations and in such manner, as prescribed under special instructions,” the letter said. According to a senior official, the railways does not consider accidents that happen due to external factors as ‘railway accidents’ and hence is not bound to provide ex gratia relief to the victim’s families. “It is provided only in accidents where the railway is involved such as derailment of trains etc,. In this case, states and the Centre are likely to provide the relief,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-operators-told-to-spot-and-report-to-avoid-deaths/story-EMjWSEEtZJC0bRH0h9x7fN.html
09-05-2020||India||Across the country, migrants still forced to walk thousands of miles||Migrant workers continue to walk and cycle back to their homes even as the railways last week began running special trains and some state governments deployed buses for the people stranded because of the Covid-19 lockdown.Some do not have documents needed to register for the trains; others simply do not want to wait any longer; and in still other cases, the trains themselves haven’t been approved by states that have to receive the migrant workers. Mohammad Imran, a worker, said he began walking back on Wednesday along with his pregnant wife, children and parents from Rajasthan’s Ajmer to Uttar Pradesh’s Farrukhabad, around 600 km away, as neither bus nor train was available. “If get a ride, it will be good or else we will walk. It is better to move than die hungry,” he said as he walked along the Ajmer-Jaipur highway on Friday with his family.Many people continued walking or cycling back to their homes from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Some of them said they started walking after being unable to register for travel on the special trains as they did not have identity documents. “I was unable to register as I do not have my Aadhaar number,” said Suraj Bhan Singh, a worker from Jharkhand in Gujarat’s Surat. Another worker, Raj Singh, in Ludhiana said he has not been able to register as the Uttar Pradesh government’s helpline number is always busy. “I have not been able to connect for a week.” Neerav Kumar carried puncture repair tools as he cycled with several other workers from Rajasthan’s Jodhpur to Uttar Pradesh. He said he had arrived in Jodhpur looking for work a day before the lockdown was imposed in March. Kumar said he was forced to try and return home as he faced possibility of starvation. “I bought this cycle for Rs 1,500 to go back. We registered on the Rajasthan government website but did not receive any response.” About 3,000 migrants assembled near the Mangalore railway station on Friday and demanded that they be sent back to their states. Similar protests were also reported from Kerala and Gujarat.Many workers have been detained from trying to cross inter-state borders ; some have tried to cross over through forests that span two states; others have tried to use boats to cross rivers. Police have launched an operation to track hundreds of workers who entered Rajasthan from Gujarat through forests.Officials have cited different reasons for the problem and said some states are slow in granting permission for the special trains. And they add that many workers do not have necessary identity documents to registrer for travel on these trains and were running out of patience as factories have not fully resumed operations.Three special trains left Karnataka for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on Friday carrying migrants. Officials in Karnataka blamed states such as West Bengal for their reluctance in accepting the workers. “There are 18,800 people from West Bengal who want to go back, but we are yet to hear from that state,” said an official on condition of anonymity.Officials in West Bengal said they are getting workers back from the districts that were either in the orange or green zone.Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said nobody has stopped trains coming from Karnataka or any other state. “The state government has also given consent to run eight more trains from Karnataka and many more from other states.” Bihar’s public relation department secretary, Anupam Kumar, said district magistrates have been authorised to issue e-passes to people returning on their own. The state’s principal secretary, disaster management, Prataya Amrit said the Centre has devised a protocol under which states have to issue no objection certificates to receive trains. Another Bihar government official said the states have to make arrangements for medical check-ups of the returnees and their travel back to their home districts. “Therefore, allowing so many trains at the same time would be a logistical nightmare.”Jharkhand minister Rameshwar Oraon said trains were coming daily. “We have to also make arrangements to take these workers to respective districts and provide them quarantine and medical facilities.” Madhya Pradesh’s additional chief secretary, ICP Keshri, said over 1.05 lakh workers have returned to the state and 50 more trains are expected in the next one week.As many as 2.53 lakh people have registered with the Karnataka government seeking to return mainly to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam. So far, 70 special trains have ferried 82,544 migrants out of 2.5 million workers stranded in different states, according to official data. Fifteen more trains were expected to reach their destinations on Saturday. Experts said the migrants were desperate to return because they have run out of money. “A migrant worker in Surat would have had an average annual income of Rs 1,07,163 in 2019-20. It implies that a migrant worker is going to lose an absolute amount of Rs 8,930 income in a month,” said Gagan Bihari Sahu, an associate professor at the Surat’s Centre for Social Studies, who has conducted a study on the losses migrant workers faced.Dilip Ratha, chief economist for migration and remittances at the World Bank, said migrants work in insecure jobs and are the first to be hit by a crisis. “Not only they will lose jobs, they will also lose ability to send back money home,” a World Bank statement had quoted him as saying.

09-05-2020||India||Aurangabad train accident: Wages halted, victims began to walk||With a handful of clothes in their luggage and packets of rotis and chutney in a couple of lunchboxes, a group of 21 men began walking from Jalna, where they worked in a steel factory, in an attempt to find a train that would take them back to their hometowns in Madhya Pradesh. After walking for around four hours, they left the main road at Badnapur and started following the train tracks in order to avoid police pickets. After covering around 36km in 8-9 hours, according to police officials who spoke to some of the men, they were too exhausted to continue and decided to sleep on the tracks. Around 5:15am, 16 of the men were run over by a freight train.“A group of 20 stranded labourers started walking from Jalna. They decided to take rest and most of them lied on rail tracks,” superintendent of police Mokshada Patil said.Images and videos taken by people at the site showed a trail of ripped luggage bags and rotis, with the incident prompting outrage by political leaders and the National Human Rights Commission issuing a notice to the Maharashtra government.“They were not even sure of the route they had to take and decided to try their luck first at Aurangabad, then two rail junctions Manmad and Bhusawal. Had they been properly informed about the train planned from Aurangabad on Friday, they probably could have not met with the accident,” said a police officer from Karmad, asking not to be named. The spot where the men were run over falls under the Karmad police jurisdiction.According to one of the survivors, the men decided to make the journey after the contractor who arranged for their employment at a steel manufacturing unit reneged on his assurance to get them their wages on May 7. The men had not been paid in over a month due to the nationwide lockdown, one of the survivors told local media.“Our family members were distressed and wanted us to return at the earliest. We tried to get passes for the special trains but did not get any help from any of the authorities. Finally, we started around 7pm on Thursday and retired on the tracks. We were so tired that could not even discuss the risk of sleeping on the tracks,” said Virendra Singh, one of three people who slept on a clearing next to the track and survived. Singh and the others saw the goods train coming and immediately raised an alarm but it went unheard, said Patil.Later on Friday, the South Central railway in a statement said the driver had seen the sleeping men and had even tried to wake them up by honking but failed to save their lives.Across Maharashtra, as in several other states such as Rajasthan, Telangana and Karnataka, people who had migrated to these states for work are now making punishing journeys back to their hometowns and villages after being sacked due to the shutdown of the economy.In cities across Maharashtra, long queues of migrant workers have been reported in recent days outside police stations and hospitals for fitness certificates from doctors and to submit these with an identity card to police. However, some migrants alleged they were charged Rs 500 for the fitness certificate.On Thursday, the state government issued a clarification that there is no need to attach a medical certificate to the registration form required to facilitate the journey.“About 1 lakh people have reached their respective villages safely. In the next few days, it is planned that all the stranded workers in the state will reach their homes properly and there is a continuous coordination with the railways,” the CM’s office said.As per the state government of Maharashtra, the state government is running 4,729 relief camps where 428,734 migrant labourers have been given refuge with food and necessities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wages-halted-victims-began-to-walk/story-epx5KoPhk9qrYl21GE5zVI.html

In order to help such people, the official said Sitharaman had allowed them to discount the extended stay to determine their residence status.The finance ministry said since it was not clear when the NRIs would be able to fly out, the Central Board of Direct Taxes had issued orders that this extended stay in India would not be counted to determine their residential status for the financial year 2020-21. The exact dates which shall be excluded shall be issued after international flights resume.The exception applies to individuals who came to India before 22 March and had been unable to leave the country on or before 31 March 2020. It will also benefit NRIs who had been quarantined in India after 1 March on account of Covid-19. This discounted calculation of dates shall be extended to NRIs whether they had left the country in an evacuation flight or were still in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stranded-indians-won-t-lose-nris-status-don-t-need-to-file-returns-in-india/story-rPHchWL1wfItiQpALAapMN.html
09-05-2020||India||NSA Ajit Doval packs in 3 blunt messages to Pak in daily PoK weather forecast||The Centre’s decision to ask television channels to include weather reports and forecasts for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Northern Areas signals a significant shift in India’s strategy on Imran Khan’s Pakistan, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times on Friday.The move was conceived by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval “some time back”, a top government official said.The formal proposal, crafted a little over three months back, went out from Deputy National Security Adviser (Strategic Affairs) Rajinder Khanna’s office on 3 February to the secretaries of foreign and home ministries apart from chiefs of India’s two lead intelligence agencies: Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing.Their formal approvals came last week.At one of the early discussions that were held to finetune the proposal, the official recalled how Doval had spoken of the multiple messages that this one move would send.The central point, the official said, is that “this is my area and I am asserting my sovereignty by taking all the steps”.This week, the government told public broadcaster Doordarshan to include weather forecasts of Mirpur and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit in the Northern Areas that are described by Pakistan as “Gilgit Baltistan”. Some private news channels have already told the government that they will also make changes to their weather bulletins.Doordarshan was also told to use weather maps that include the entire territory of Jammu and Kashmir that would serve as a daily, and public reiteration of India’s stand.A second senior government official said the move marked a shift in India’s approach that had been perceived to be hesitant to go all out to hammer the message to Pakistan, its allies and the world that Islamabad was in illegal occupation of over 86,000 square km of Jammu and Kashmir.This changes.For one, the assertion of sovereignty becomes particularly important because of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that passes through the Northern Areas or, the expansive Gilgit-Baltistan region that is almost twice the size of Kerala.When China floated the Belt and Road Initiative a few years ago, it had expected India to be part of the project though it passes through the Northern Areas under Pakistani control. When India protested, Beijing told New Delhi to still join in because this would not affect the status of Kashmir as a dispute between the two countries.“The daily weather map reinforces India’s message on the entire territory of J&K, every day,” the official said.The daily weather forecast, and the map of India on the television screens, also underlines India’s strong views on the occupied territory but also the fact that Pakistan was making material changes to the region and exploiting the population of this region.In many ways, the official said, the map of India on the television screens also spotlights the plight of the people living in these areas whose rights are violated by Islamabad on a daily basis.There is another constituency that India hopes to message: the political establishment in the United Kingdom to ask them to not take sides.A large proportion of the Pakistani expatriate population in the United Kingdom is from Mirpur who have close links with Labour Party leaders such as Jeremy Corbyn who had gone to the extent of passing a resolution to seek international intervention after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-ajit-doval-packs-in-3-blunt-messages-to-pak-in-daily-pok-weather-forecast/story-iYpODhNMD5FfFDU2GiuYNN.html

We make sure the government guidelines are properly followed,” Muriel Baldago, an elected official dressed in a Stormtrooper costume, told Reuters.His get-up is greeted with smiles and offers villagers a little distraction from outbreak, he added.On May 4, also known as “Star Wars” Day and celebrated worldwide by fans of the franchise, government workers in costume also rode small wooden boats to distribute relief packs containing rice and canned goods in a nearby coastal neighbourhood.The Philippines, whose capital and main cities are under strict quarantine protocols until mid-May, has recorded 9,485 confirmed coronavirus cases, 623 deaths and 1,315 recoveries as of Monday, government figures showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/look-who-is-enforcing-lockdown-in-philippine-village/story-MKac5PrK0ad3ChdKDveRML.html
