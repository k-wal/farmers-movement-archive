We’ve written to Lalnunmawia Chuaungo, chief secretary, Mizoram, for an immediate inquiry,” NCW tweeted on Wednesday.The NCW move follows publication of a news report about the incident in Vanglaini, a Mizo daily, on May 5. According to the report, the senior medical officer of Tlabung Civil Hospital in Lunglei district had issued such a notification in March this year.“Voter ID is mandatory for every woman delivering a child at Tlabung Hospital and those who do not possess valid Voter ID cards are not allowed to deliver a child here,” said the notice--Vanglaini mentioned in its report.The matter was brought to the notice of NCW by Paritosh Chakma, president of the Mizoram Chakma Alliance Against Discrimination (MCAAD) who in his complaint termed the hospital move as “bone-chilling, out-rightly unethical, illegal and flagrant violation of right to health”.Chakma alleged that the notification issued by the hospital is part of the continuing discrimination against the minority Chakmas of Mizoram, who face a lot of discrimination in the state despite being Indian citizens.He added that denial of healthcare to a pregnant woman who doesn’t have a Voter ID could even happen in cases when the expectant mother is suffering from Covid-19. This would violate guidelines issued by the Centre on treating Covid-19 patients and could lead to spread of coronavirus from pregnant women.“Thousands of Chakmas were deleted from electoral rolls in 1995 and were never enrolled. Further, there is an unofficial ceiling on number of Chakmas during electoral revisions, which leads to many getting excluded. Obviously, there are hundreds of Chakmas who were not issued Voter ID cards and don’t have one,” Chakma said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncw-asks-mizoram-to-probe-hospital-s-refusal-to-deliver-baby-without-woman-s-voter-id/story-Wdz0SCHE0OrOjSFhGk2SII.html
07-05-2020||India||India raises concern before US special envoy||New Delhi: India on Thursday conveyed its strong concerns about a spike in terrorist violence in Afghanistan to US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, and called for rooting out terror sanctuaries in Pakistan to ensure peace in the war-torn country, people familiar with developments said.The concerns were conveyed to the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation during his meetings with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“The existence of terror sanctuaries in Pakistan and their role in terrorist violence in Afghanistan figured in the meetings,” said one of the people cited above, without giving details.The development came against the backdrop of worries in New Delhi that India’s viewpoint on the Afghan peace process is being given the short shrift by the US, which is apparently focused solely on implementing its deal with the Taliban to facilitate the withdrawal of American forces.India has also been concerned about the increased activities of Pakistan-based terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed in Afghanistan and the targeting of minorities, including the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed nearly 30 people, including an Indian citizen. Indian intelligence agencies believe the Islamic State, which claimed the attack, targeted the Sikhs after being unable to go ahead with plans to strike the Indian embassy.“India is deeply concerned at the upsurge in violence and supports call for immediate ceasefire and [the] need to assist the people of Afghanistan in dealing with [the] coronavirus pandemic,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Khalilzad’s meetings.The Indian side “emphasised that putting an end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries is necessary for enduring and sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan”, the statement added, without naming Pakistan.Both Jaishankar and Doval, the statement said, “reiterated India’s continued support for strengthening peace, security, unity, democratic and inclusive polity and protection of rights of all sections of the Afghan society, including Afghan Hindus and Sikhs”.Khalilzad, the first high-level foreign dignitary to travel to New Delhi since Covid-19-related travel restrictions came into effect, visited India as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to Qatar and Pakistan.He provided an update on the US peace and reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan. The US side “recognised India’s constructive contribution in economic development, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan” and “laid importance to India’s crucial and continuing role in sustainable peace, security and stability in Afghanistan”, the external affairs ministry’s statement said.The Indian side also said it will continue extending humanitarian food and medical supplies to Afghanistan to deal with the pandemic. India recently shipped another 10,000 tonnes of 75,000 tonnes of wheat gifted to Afghanistan from Kandla port to Chabahar port in Iran. The wheat will then be transported by road to Afghanistan. Another 5,000 tonnes of wheat was shipped via Chabahar last month.Khalilzad was accompanied for his meetings by List Curtis, senior director in the National Security Council, and US ambassador Kenneth Juster. In Doha, Khalilzad met Taliban representatives to press for the full implementation of the US-Taliban agreement. In Islamabad, he will meet Pakistani officials to discuss the Afghan peace process.“At each stop, he will urge support for an immediate reduction in violence, accelerated timeline for the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, and cooperation among all sides in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic in Afghanistan,” said a statement issued by the US state department on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-raises-concern-before-us-special-envoy/story-bbnBO00szbsklZx9XVrKTM.html

Earlier, this time period was 30 days. As a result of this, the process of issuing registration/licenses for factories, shops, contractors, bidi manufacturers, motor transport workers etc will be completed in one day,” he added.In another measure, Chouhan announced that the license under the Contract Labour Act will now be issued for the entire period of the contract instead of just one calendar year, as was the case.“The process of issuing registration/license will be online. With a view to encouraging startups, a provision has been made for one-time registration and the provision for renewal has been done away with,” the CM said.According to the CM, another provision has been made to maintain a single register instead of 61 registers under the labour laws and to file a single return instead of 13 returns. Self-certification will suffice for filing the return, he added.Factories have also been exempted from inspections for a period of three months under the Factory Act. The owners will be allowed to have a third-party inspection by the inspectors of their own choice. Establishments employing less than 50 workers have been excluded from inspection in various labour laws. Now, inspection will be possible only with the permission of the labour commissioner and on the basis of complaints, he said.Chouhan also said that the duration of shifts in factories during the ongoing coronavirus crisis has been increased from 8 hours to 12 hours.Congress has opposed the amendments terming it exploitative.Party MLA Hiralal Alawa said, “The amendments will give enough powers to factory owners to exploit the labourers at will as they will have no fear of any inspection or inquiry. The amendments mean the labourers will be treated as bonded labourers and they will not be able to seek justice from the labour courts or it will take years for them to get justice given the complexities involved.”In another coronavirus related development, the MP government said the shops in the non-Covid areas can now remain open from 6 am till midnight. Earlier they were allowed to operate from 8 am to 10 pm daily.

Alleging that there is no information on how many workers were present for work in the factory, the BMS — an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — has demanded that the NGT should ask the company management and the government to disclose the number.The BMS has also demanded that the company should pay RS 25 lakh as compensation for the dead and RS 5 lakh for those injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-precautionary-measure-no-emergency-alarm-bms-submits-report-on-vizag-gas-leak-to-ngt/story-gcAU2OsyKIrXI2tydE6TFJ.html

The petitioner had also appealed to the HC to direct the state government to provide food and accommodation to the stranded people in their respective states of work instead of bringing them back to Odisha.Soon after the HC order, Surat district collector Dhaval Patel said Odisha government has cancelled the three Shramik special trains scheduled for departure from Surat on Friday. So far 13 Shramik special trains from Surat carrying Odia migrant workers have reached Odisha, while another six left Surat today.The HC order came on the day Odisha registered the largest single-day surge with 34 new Covid cases, most of them among migrant workers from Surat. Of the 1,000 samples of Surat returnees, four per cent have tested positive. Odisha health minister Naba Das, who had a meeting through video-conferencing with union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, said Odisha on Thursday requested for testing of migrants in the States from where they are returning.“We have requested additional testing kits and relaxation in ICMR guidelines. Instead of pre-screening, pre-tests should be conducted as it will help Odisha government in effective tackling of the Covid-19 situation,” Das said.As per the SOP issued by the Centre, migrants are being pre-screened before they are boarding special trains to their home states. Meanwhile, public health expert and the president of Public Health Foundation of India Dr Srinath Reddy today suggested the Odisha government should focus on community protection instead of the development of herd immunity.Delivering a talk on “Learning from Covid-19 – What we have learnt and how we can win” through video conference at the Gurugram Collectorate in Haryana, Dr Reddy said social distancing seemed to be the only solution in the absence of a vaccine or a treatment.“Public cooperation and a community’s active participation is the only shield that can protect us from the deadly infection,” said Dr Reddy, advising the Odisha government to look after the elderly persons as they are more vulnerable to the disease.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Not only the virus affects the respiratory system, but it also affects the other parts of the human body.

In all probability, he might fly to Visakhapatnam on Friday,” one of his personal staff members said.TDP spokesman and politburo member Varla Ramaiah sought to know how the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had given no-objection certificate to LG Polymers to restart the operations of its plant at Visakhapatnam, though it did not fall into the category of essential goods.“It is a plastic manufacturing company. Apparently, the company got the NOC with the influence of a ruling party leader who claims all rights over Visakhapatnam,” Ramaiah alleged.TDP MP from Vijayawada Kesineni Srinivas demanded that cases should be booked against negligent officers of the industries department and industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy also. “I demand the resignation of the irresponsible Industries Minister,” he tweeted.The YSR Congress leaders did not react to the demands and allegations of the TDP leaders.

The MHA asked the state to ensure complete segregation of the Ratha-Khala from the adjoining Grand Road and other properties by erecting a cloth-partition wall.However, the MHA said the decision regarding the holding of Rath Yatra has to be taken by the State Government after assessing the coronavirus situation.Earlier, the state government had sought permission from the Centre for the construction of chariots during the lockdown period.A few days ago, Puri king Gajapati Dibyasinghdev had backed the making of chariots as a construction activity, which is allowed in all Covid-19 zones. Gajapati Dibyasinghdev heads the managing committee of the 12th century temple.The Rath Yatra, scheduled on June 23, is the most important festival in Odisha, attended by over million devotees who throng Puri town for the 10-day long festival. The temple doors have been shut since March 20 due to the pandemic. Only day-to-day rituals are being done by the temple priests.The state government is still in a fix over holding the festival as Covid cases in the state are surging with 34 new cases reported on Thursday taking the state tally to 219. The option to hold the Rath Yatra only in the presence of policemen and temple priests is also being considered. However, the government is not sure about deploying 5000 policemen for pulling the ropes and cordoning off the area, when the cops will be required elsewhere for maintaining the lockdown. The government is also apprehensive of a surge in Covid cases if devotees are allowed to congregate in Puri.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19If the car festival is not held this year, it would be the first time in the last 284 years.

Before the closure too, Karnataka on an average did about Rs 55-60 crore sales per day and despite the hike in prices we expect we will be able to meet our annual target.”In 2019-20 the state had mopped up Rs 19,701 crore of revenue from the sale of liquor (till February as the budget was presented on March 5). The revenue target from sale of alcohol this year is Rs 22,700 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alcohol-sale-in-karnataka-falls-after-government-hikes-prices/story-MVn3lnWzAPaYMvmrg2q9VN.html

Administration has also banned all shops except those selling milk and medicines. Nodal officers have been appointed for each zone to ensure home delivery of essential goods. Since March 19, when the first case was reported from the state, an analysis of Gujarat’s official Covid data reveals that the rate of spread has increased in the state after it touch the 4,000-mark. The data also shows that the mortality rate has steadily increased from 3.7% (when the state had just 1000 cases) to 4.3% (at 4000 cases) to 5.9% (at over 6,000 cases).One of the officials in the new team that has taken the charge for Ahmedabad said that the lockdown was not enforced properly and initially, there was laxity in identifying persons infected with the virus.“In the first week to ten days, only those who visited hospital with Covid symptoms were tested. No random testing was done,” he said.Another official of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation said the government reacted only when the cases were reported from localities outside the walled city. It was found that many residents from the walled city areas were allowed to move around in Ahmedabad resulting in the spread of the virus.

Gujarat chief minister, Vijay Rupani in an interview to HT had attributed the high number of cases to large number of international and domestic travellers. He also said that Tablighi Jamaat members were not traced in time upon their return from Delhi Markaz resulting in the spread of the disease.The HT Guide to Coronavirus Covid-19Experts, however, say that the cases increased because of initial laxity and failure to enforce lockdown seriously.While the shutdown of Ahmedabad is likely to show results after some days, the administration announced shutting down of all shops selling vegetables and fruits in Surat as well from May 9 to May 14, said PTI.Surat municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said that such a step was necessary to contain the spread of the disease as large crowds were gathering at vegetable shops without respecting physical distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-status-check-in-hotspots-ahmedabad-and-surat-show-spike-a-day-after-hard-lockdown/story-c3CWrKlGB8vQKS4UZzPfbL.html

The PPE has been certified to be mass produced and used in clinical Covid-19 situations, he said.“Shortage of PPE during the ongoing Covid-19pandemic is of serious concern as it imperils the well-being and availability of the healthcare workforce, apart from adversely impacting their security and morale…The Indian Navy has risen to this challenge of making available this critical resource in the fight against Covid-19,” navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.A team formed by the Innovation Cell, Institute of Naval Medicine, Mumbai and the Naval Dockyard Mumbai collaborated to design the PPE.The cost of the PPE is significantly lower than those commercially available and can be produced by basic gown manufacturing units, he said.“The PPE passed with 6/6 synthetic blood penetration resistance test pressure. (Government mandates minimum 3/6 and above level as per ISO 16603 standard),” the official said.Three weeks ago, the DRDO shifted a key testing facility for carrying out quality checks on PPE from Gwalior to New Delhi to cut down delays and ensure faster delivery of the safety gear to healthcare workers.At a time when the country is facing a shortage of PPE kits, the testing facility was shifted from Gwalior-based Defence Research Development Establishment (DRDE) to the Delhi-based INMAS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ppe-kits-developed-by-indian-navy-cleared-by-drdo-testing-agency/story-ewgzXHpSYIAXi5fSVvRrMI.html
07-05-2020||India||India conveys concerns about terror sanctuaries in Pakistan to US special envoy Khalilzad||India on Thursday conveyed its strong concerns about a spike in terrorist violence in Afghanistan to US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, and called for rooting out terror sanctuaries in Pakistan to ensure peace in the war-torn country, people familiar with developments said.The concerns were conveyed to the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation during his meetings with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“The existence of terror sanctuaries in Pakistan and their role in terrorist violence in Afghanistan figured in the meetings,” said one of the people cited above, without giving details.The development came against the backdrop of worries in New Delhi that India’s viewpoint on the Afghan peace process is being given the short shrift by the US, which is apparently focused solely on implementing its deal with the Taliban to facilitate the withdrawal of American forces.India has also been concerned about the increased activities of Pakistan-based terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed in Afghanistan and the targeting of minorities, including the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed nearly 30 people, including an Indian citizen. Indian intelligence agencies believe the Islamic State, which claimed the attack, targeted the Sikhs after being unable to go ahead with plans to strike the Indian embassy.“India is deeply concerned at the upsurge in violence and supports call for immediate ceasefire and [the] need to assist the people of Afghanistan in dealing with [the] coronavirus pandemic,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Khalilzad’s meetings.The Indian side “emphasised that putting an end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries is necessary for enduring and sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan”, the statement added, without naming Pakistan.Both Jaishankar and Doval, the statement said, “reiterated India’s continued support for strengthening peace, security, unity, democratic and inclusive polity and protection of rights of all sections of the Afghan society, including Afghan Hindus and Sikhs”.Khalilzad, the first high-level foreign dignitary to travel to New Delhi since Covid-19-related travel restrictions came into effect, visited India as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to Qatar and Pakistan.He provided an update on the US peace and reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan. The US side “recognised India’s constructive contribution in economic development, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan” and “laid importance to India’s crucial and continuing role in sustainable peace, security and stability in Afghanistan”, the external affairs ministry’s statement said.The Indian side also said it will continue extending humanitarian food and medical supplies to Afghanistan to deal with the pandemic. India recently shipped another 10,000 tonnes of 75,000 tonnes of wheat gifted to Afghanistan from Kandla port to Chabahar port in Iran. The wheat will then be transported by road to Afghanistan. Another 5,000 tonnes of wheat was shipped via Chabahar last month.Khalilzad was accompanied for his meetings by List Curtis, senior director in the National Security Council, and US ambassador Kenneth Juster. In Doha,Khalilzad met Taliban representatives to press for the full implementation of the US-Taliban agreement. In Islamabad, he will meet Pakistani officials to discuss the Afghan peace process.“At each stop, he will urge support for an immediate reduction in violence, accelerated timeline for the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, and cooperation among all sides in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic in Afghanistan,” said a statement issued by the US state department on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-conveys-concerns-about-terror-sanctuaries-in-pakistan-to-us-special-envoy-khalilzad/story-rJMCY9P7B25bGj5oeNSZAK.html

Out of 502 positive cases, 474 have been discharged leaving 25 patients in the hospitals. Though the state had recorded four deaths it is yet to include the death of a man from Mahe in the state list. Mahe is part of Puducherry.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.The CM said 16,693 people are under observation out of which 16,338 are in their homes and 310 in hospitals. He said the state has started sentinel surveillance to monitor health conditions of a large number of people at one go. Out of 3,035 samples collected for this, 2,337 have tested negative and other results are awaited, he said.The good news came at a time when the state is expected to witness an exodus of expatriates.Called ‘Vande Bharat’ operation, the latest evacuation is being dubbed as the largest since the Kuwait evacuation in 1990 when Iraq invaded that country. But some of the expatriates expressed reservations over the term ‘evacuation’ and insisted that they have paid for their tickets and these are special flights. But many especially pregnant women said they were really thankful to the state and central governments.“I was really worried but now dark clouds have moved. I am delighted to go back to my parents for my first delivery. Really grateful to the both the governments,” said one of them, M S Sanila before boarding the flight to Kozhikokde.The first flight from Abu Dhabi to Kochi is carrying 179 passengers. The second flight from Dubai to Kozhikode has 168 passengers where the maximum number of passengers are from Malappuram. The state government has decided all those found asymptomatic at the airport will have to spend the next seven days at quarantine facilities arranged by the government. After the seven-day period, they will be tested for Covid-19. If they found negative they will be allowed to return to their home where they will have to spend the next seven days in quarantine.But this arrangement goes against the guidelines of the Ministry of Home Affairs which mandates 14 days of institutional quarantine. Since health is a state subject, Kerala has taken a stand that it can decide on such matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-keeps-covid-19-slate-clean-as-first-batch-of-expatriates-head-home/story-m8KaZrpKCsSO6NCCF5R5aP.html
07-05-2020||India||Areas under PoK now in IMD’s forecast||The IMD’s Regional Meteorological Centre has started including cities under Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir in its forecasts, a departure from its earlier format, officials said on Thursday. The IMD has started including Gilgit Baltistan and Muzaffarabad, which are parts of PoK, under the Jammu and Kashmir meteorological sub-division since May 5, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the Regional Meteorological Department that gives forecast for the northwest meteorological division of the IMD. IMD Director General M Mohapatra said they have been mentioning areas under PoK under its daily weather bulletin ever since the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in the two union territories August last year. However, officials said it’s now being mentioned explicitly under the Jammu and Kashmir subdivision. These cities of PoK have now found a place in the overall forecast of the northwest division. The northwest division consists of nine sub-divisions – Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi-Chandigarh-Haryana, Punjab, east Uttar Pradesh, west Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan and west Rajasthan. The development assumes significance as New Delhi has been of a position that the Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir belongs to India. The inclusion of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit-Baltistan in the forecast comes amid Pakistan’s Supreme Court allowing elections in Gilgit-Baltistan this week. India had strongly reacted to the development. Sources added that internally, it was pointed out that since IMD has been mentioning these cities under the PoK in its daily national weather bulletin and also the local bulletins, they should also find a place in the forecasts of the RMC. Mohapatra said that the IMD, being the World Meteorological Department nominated Regional Meteorological Centre, provides severe weather warnings to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan detailing forecasts for the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/areas-under-pok-now-in-imd-s-forecast/story-C6uM7HLTlq33N1o5pn79uK.html

These are first casualties in the border guarding force due to the infection; both deaths took place this week in Delhi. According to a statement issued by BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj, one of the troopers was a critically ill patient. He died after he contracted the infection while visiting a super speciality hospital for his treatment. The second trooper died at Safdarjung hospital on May 4. He was unwell and admitted to the hospital on May 3. The Covid-19 test was done after his death, and the result came on Wednesday. Earlier, a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan died in Delhi, in the first death in central paramilitary forces due to Covid-19. BSF also reported 41 new infections in the force on Thursday, taking its tally to 193 cases across India. “Prahari pariwar (bordermen family) is grief-stricken with deaths of two BSF personnel during this pandemic,” the BSF statement said.“Braving the challenges of securing frontiers, working with civil administration and while shouldering other essential responsibilities, 41 new COVID-19 positive cases have been reported since yesterday (Wednesday).

07-05-2020||India||With old liquor rates still in play, Uttar Pradesh consumers stock up on favourite brands||The scaled-up liquor prices in Uttar Pradesh didn’t come into effect on Thursday allowing consumers time to stock up at old rates.The state government on Wednesday announced an increase in prices of all categories of liquor, including country liquor, to mop up additional revenue of Rs 2,350 crore.“We have been asked not to increase prices today (Thursday). As soon as we get the clearance, we will increase it, though re-labelling the price on old stock would be difficult,” a liquor seller said.At many places, people were seen buying liquor by the bagful at old rates, as sellers conveniently ignored the ‘limit for sale’ clause that bars buying beyond a certain quantity.Since May 4, when liquor shops reopened to long queues across the state after a six-week closure, revenue of over Rs 300 crore has flowed in, excise officials admit.At least two BJP lawmakers publicly disapproved of the decision to allow liquor sale. One of them said he was worried that social distancing norms were flouted in the rush to grab a bottle.“I fail to understand the need for allowing liquor sale as well as lifting the ban on cigarettes and paan masala,” said BJP’s Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj.The party’s Kanpur MP Satyadev Pachauri, too, had written to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, expressing concern over the sale of liquor and the flouting of social distancing norms.BJP’s outspoken MLA from Bairia (Ballia) Surendra Singh also wondered why the government had allowed liquor sales. The opposition parties, including the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, have already demanded that the liquor shops be closed again.However, shopkeepers said after the first day, the rush had largely settled down.“Our liquor licence expired on March 31. But due to the lockdown, we have been given seven days to clear our stock after which all the leftover stock would be destroyed. So, before the price hike is effected, we want to make the most of it. The people benefit too and we don’t see anything wrong in it as government is getting much needed revenue,” a liquor seller said.The state government had set an excise revenue target of Rs 31,600 crore for 2019-20, against which it earned Rs 27,323 crore till March before the lockdown saw all bars, clubs, standalone liquor vends and model shops shut down for six weeks.“The excise policy has to be reworked now, given the massive loss of revenue due to closure of liquor shops,” an official said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19WHAT IS ‘LIMIT OF SALE?’The ‘limit of sale’ clause restricts a person from buying beyond a certain limit.For country liquor, both spiced and plain, the limit of sale by retail is 1.5 litres for each variety.In foreign liquor category, six litres of liquor bottled in India or the Indian Made Foreign Liquor can be purchased.

In a letter to Pradhan on May 4, the CM said the NMDC had to pay Rs 1,623 crore to the Chhattisgarh government following the Supreme Court order in 2014 order as penalty for violations. The SC order was not challenged by NMDC, which so far, paid Rs 600 crore to the state government.“When the entire country was facing an acute shortage of iron ore due to en masse lapsing of missing leases elsewhere in the country, NMDC did not face any problem in Chhattisgarh. Even today, those mining leases have not been operationalized in favour of NMDC in many states. But, in Chhattisgarh, we have been very cooperative and all the mining leases of NMDC have been extended within time and mines are operational without any hindrance,” the letter said.The CM also questioned why the NMDC pledged CSR funds to the PM Cares fund.“NMDC has not been keeping up with its commitments given to the state government for more than one occasion…NMDC has diverted the rightful CSR funds of people of Chhattisgarh to the newly created PM Cares fund and has not paid the penalty amount in full to the state government,” the letter read.The CM in his lRaipuretter said that it is important for a PSU like NMDC to act more responsibly during such a crisis.“I expect that government of India should not be a mute spectator and instruct NMDC to act in a duty bound manner and make the payments to the state government at the earliest,” the letter said, while asking NMDC to “win over the hearts of people of Chhattisgarh” by standing up with them.“We have been active in containing the spread of Covid-19. In this crisis situation, the state government needs financial resources and people of Chhattisgarh are looking for their legitimate resources to come during these hours of crisis,” the CM said while asking Pradhan to facilitate the release of the pending Rs 1,000 crore.Reacting to the letter, NMDC spokesperson Jay Prakash said: “NMDC has excellent relations with Chhattisgarh government and we are sure all issues will be amicably resolved, safeguarding the interests of Chhattisgarh state and NMDC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhatisgarh-cm-reminds-centre-of-rs-1000-cr-penalty-on-nmdc-after-it-donates-rs-150-cr-to-pm-cares/story-OUUIseU7Ok9xzBaOJjod1O.html

A major leak from a chemical plant of LG Polymers near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh in the wee hours of Thursday impacted villages within a five-km radius, leaving eight people dead and scores of citizens complaining of breathlessness, nausea and other problems.Para-tertiary butyl catechol or PTBC is currently being used in Visakhapatnam to neutralise the effect of the gas leak, said Ashwani Kumar, secretary in the Gujarat chief minister’s office.“This chemical, used for reducing the effects of gas in the air after a leak, is manufactured only in Vapi. The Andhra Pradesh government requested Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to facilitate airlifting of the chemical from Vapi to be sent there as soon as possible,” Kumar said.As instructed by Rupani, senior officials have asked Valsad district collector to make necessary arrangements to procure 500 kg of the chemical. The stock will soon be airlifted from Daman where it will be taken by road from Vapi, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-gas-leak-guj-govt-to-send-chemical-used-as-neutraliser/story-MZfAue72bO0vMPk0rAVaaP.html

Hundreds of chickens in poultry farms in the surrounding villages were also found dead with their bodies turning a darker shade of grey under the effect of gas.Such was the impact of the gas that leaves on trees along the road near the chemical plant wilted turning reddish brown and pale yellow.The incident has claimed 11 lives and more than 300 have been hospitalised. It evoked memories of the gas leaked from a pesticide plant in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal in 1984. That incident, counted among one of the world’s worst industrial disasters, had killed 3,500 people.“Today’s incident might not be of such a magnitude as that of the Bhopal tragedy. But it is certainly a major disaster in Visakhapatnam after the 1997 explosion of a cylinder at Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited in which 22 people were killed,” said Rajesh Mallu, a senior journalist from the port city.People were running for their own lives in such a hurry that they did not even bother to check about their old beloved kin. A five-year-old girl, Sucharita, was found crying on the road side near Chintala Agraharam village, where the local farmers rescued and consoled her.Apparently, Sucharita’s parents, who were feeling suffocating due to the impact of gas, failed to carry her along with them as they were running for a safer location. A local journalist finally managed to locate her father Raju at another village about two km away and hand over the child to him.“We were running in a semi-conscious state to find a safer place and we didn’t even realise that our daughter is not with us. I am glad my daughter is fine and back with us”, Raju said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unconscious-people-animals-turning-grey-scenes-outside-vizag-plant/story-rjjv4xOA5VpRauyecSQlZO.html

The migrants said due to the lockdown they neither had money nor food and were suffering from a lot of problems. The police have sent them back after giving them food.Thousands of labourers come from different parts of UP and Bihar to earn a livelihood from mining-related activities in Guala river area in Nainital and US Nagar district every year. Labourers have been stranded this year due to the lockdown. They have been sitting completely idle and suffering from acute financial crisis. In such a distressing condition, they wanted to return to their native places and began using forest routes.Fed up with continuous unemployment and financial crisis amid lockdown, a large number of labourers from UP and Bihar set out on foot to their native places through forest routes, but were stopped by villagers and police. They used the forest routes instead of main roads to dodge the police and avoid police action.“We were brought by a contractor here for mining but work has been stopped due to the lockdown. We have been sitting idle and facing financial problems for the last 47 days. So we felt it was better to return to our villages,” said Mangal Rajbhar, a resident of Azamgarh in UP. He was part of the group of labourers which was stopped by villagers in Shaktifarm area.“Since we ran out of money and to avoid strict police action, we chose forest routes. We were determined to cover hundreds of kilometres distance on foot. There is no hope of mining work reopening here and if we stay here for more weeks we will start starving. If we reach our villages, at least we will live comfortably there despite unemployment,” Ramesh Prasad, another labourer said.Since there is no mode of transport available and fear of action by the police for attempting to cross the sealed border between UP and Uttarakhand, these labourers chose the forest routes and set out on foot for their destinations instead of main roads.“The registration process is on by the administration for such stranded labourers to drop them to their native places, but due to lack of awareness they set out on foot,” said an official.“We told them that it is better to go back because even the UP administration will not spare them following the violation of lockdown. They will face unnecessary police action there. When we persuaded them, they agreed to go back by bus to Nainital district. They had reached here in two groups and arrived in Shaktifarm and Nanakmatta through the forest,” Vivek Prakash, sub-divisional magistrate, Sitarganj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/240-migrants-take-forest-routes-in-kumaon-to-reach-up-bihar-caught/story-SN6d3MfmZWsqcO2okfbnAL.html

Dr Y K Gupta, who is chairing the committee for Evaluation of Research Proposals at ICMR, said the evidence and data available at the moment is not strong enough to start the clinical studies by different routes/forms of Ganga water for treatment of coronavirus. The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), an arm of the Jal Shakti Ministry that deal with the rejuvenation programme for the river, had received a number of proposals, including from people and NGOs working on Ganga, to undertake clinical studies for treatment of coronavirus patients with the water, officials said. The proposals were accordingly sent to the ICMR. Gupta, who is also a former dean of the AIIMS, said, “At present the proposals needs much scientific data, proof of concept and a strong background hypothesis. This has been conveyed to them (NMCG).”  NMCG officials said the proposals were discussed with the scientists of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), which had earlier conducted a study ‘Assessment of Water Quality and Sediment to understand the special properties of River Ganga’. According to the NEERI study, Ganga water has higher number of bacteriophages as against pathogenic bacteria. During consultations that were held between the NMCG and NEERI, the scientists had also said there is still no proof that Ganga water or sediment has anti-viral properties. “We forwarded the proposals to the ICMR as received,” said a senior official of the NMCG. One of the proposals received by NMCG claimed that the waters of Ganga have “ninja virus” which scientists call bacteriophages. Another proposal claimed that pure Ganga water boosts immunity which helps fight the virus. The third proposal, a much detailed one, sought more research on Ganga water’s anti-viral properties and its ability to boost immunity in fighting diseases.  NMCG officials said they have not received any official communication on the status of their proposals from the ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-more-data-icmr-on-proposed-study-of-ganga-water-for-treating-covid-19/story-iOq9ToWrucCh3buXaoTXKN.html

Forget bearing the expenses which we will afford on our own, CM Mamata Banerjee has not even conveyed any concern regarding our plight,” Mitthu Mukherjee a Bengal resident said.Local tehsildar Ashish Ghildiyal said as the West Bengal government had not granted permission to stranded residents, these people are not being allowed to move further.Chandrima Chakravarti, another stranded pilgrim said she had arrived in Haridwar in March for pilgrimage. “But due to the lockdown, I got stranded with my family members and its quite disheartening that our own state government is not granting us permission or taking measures to take us back as is being done by Uttarakhand or even Uttar Pradesh government,” she said.Radhe Krishan ashram spiritual guru Satpal Brahmachari said that till the lockdown sanctions are waived fully and pilgrims, workers from other states are unable to go to their homes, their ashram will distribute free food to all such people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilgrims-in-haridwar-protest-against-bengal-cm-mamata-wait-for-nod-to-return/story-yDnYa0C9frHnIUBGiXE5xK.html

On Wednesday, too, the tablets were distributed among around 1,200 workers who arrived in a train from Kerala. The second train arrived at Berhampore in Murshidabad district. The district’s chief medical officer of health, Dr Prasanta Biswas, said all labourers were screened for symptoms of the coronavirus disease and given the tablets.The West Bengal Doctors Forum on Wednesday wrote to the state health secretary, attaching links to news items in which government staff were quoted saying they had given these tablets to hundreds of migrant workers. The letter from the Forum said, “As per the advisory available from the Government of West Bengal vide Order No. H&FW/139/20 dated April 10, 2020, in accordance with the Indian Council of Medical Research Advisory Memo No. VIR/4/2020/ECD-I dated 22nd March, 2020, the prophylactic use of HCQ for SARS - Cov- 2 is clearly indicated for two specific selected groups of people: Asymptomatic Healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 and asymptomatic household contact of laboratory confirmed cases.” Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“We were confused when he saw on television that these tablets were being indiscriminately given to migrant workers returning from other states. We have asked the health secretary whether there has been any change in guidelines and wanted it to be put up on the department’s website,” said Dr Koushik Chaki, secretary of the Forum.“In view of the side-effects including contraindications, the same needs to be prescribed by registered medical practitioners and under regular supervision, pharmacovigilence and reporting of adverse effects, if any, among the two above mentioned categories only,” said the letter.In addition, the tablets are used for patients who are admitted for treatment. This is done following ICMR protocols, said Dr Chaki.In March, the ICMR had warned people against the indiscriminate use of hydroxychloroquine or HCQ after reports that there has been a rush to buy the medicine, which India has approved as a prophylaxis (a treatment to prevent a disease) in the fight against the deadly coronavirus infection (Covid-19).On April 23, an ICMR official said it will continue with the restricted use of HCQ to treat patients critically ill with Covid-19.On April 25, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on warned doctors against prescribing hydroxychloroquine touted by President Donald Trump for treating coronavirus except in hospitals and research studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-ask-why-migrant-workers-returning-to-bengal-are-given-hcq-tablets/story-ewUDEALF4o6VvgfOXfsf7J.html
07-05-2020||India||Vizag gas leak: Plant produced stuff used to make disposable plastic cutlery||LG Polymers India, the company behind the deadly styrene gas leak in Visakhapatnam that left at least nine dead and hundreds hospitalised, is a subsidiary of leading South Korean chemical firm LG Chem that had entered India in 1997 through the acquisition of a local company. The Vizag plant manufactures polystyrene (PS) that finds wide utility in the food-service industry as rigid trays and containers, disposable utensils, and foamed cups, plates and bowls. The company, according to its website, was established in 1961 as ‘Hindustan Polymers’ by the Shriram Group for manufacturing PS and its co-polymers at Visakhapatnam. It got merged with MC Dowell & Co Ltd of UB Group in 1978. Considering India as an important market for its aggressive global growth plans, LG Chem in July 1997 acquired Hindustan Polymers and renamed it as LG Polymers India Pvt Ltd (LGPI) in July 1997. The factory recorded 222.8 billion won (USD 181.8 million) in revenue and 6.3 billion won in net profit last year. In terms of sales, the parent company LG Chem was the 10th largest chemical company in the world in 2017. LGPI’s Visakhapatnam factory was being prepared to reopen on Thursday after the lockdown when the accident took place. Company workers were preparing to restart the operation when the gas started to leak in the early hours. As much as 1,800 tonnes of styrene is said to have been in the storage tank when the leakage happened. Due to stagnation and changes in temperature, styrene could have resulted in auto polymerisation that could have caused vapourisation. Styrene gas is a flammable liquid that is used to make polystyrene plastics, fiberglass, rubber, and latex. The accident at the Visakhapatnam factory raised questions on the improper maintenance of chemicals in the industry and reminded of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, the world’s worst industrial disasters. “LG Chemical has a very strong presence in Styrenics business in South Korea and has plans to establish an equally strong presence in the Indian market by the current product range of PS and EPS,” the company says on its website. “Presently, LGPI is one of the leading manufacturers of polystyrene and expandable polystyrene in India. LGPI in true LG tradition is committed to excellence in product quality, service, and enriching customers through added value.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-gas-leak-plant-produced-stuff-used-to-make-disposable-plastic-cutlery/story-CsHMl6qza2eepdYuJI5geJ.html

Two patients had died earlier.61 of the remaining 78 patients have already been discharged and the rest are in quarantine, to be discharged soon.The state has fared well overall in terms of recoveries with half of the total coronavirus positive patients now cured. The state has also reduced the backlog of pending tests from 5,000 three days ago to under 2,000, data released on Wednesday showed.Officials of the state health department said Rajasthan’s recovery rate was better than top 10 Covid-19 infected states in the country. According to data shared by states up to May 5, While India’s overall recovery rate was 27.66 per cent, the recovery rate in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh was more.State health minister Raghu Sharma said around 52 % of Covid 19 positive patients in the state have turned negative because of extensive surveillance, quarantining, maximum sampling and testing.“Till Thursday afternoon, 3,400 people were fund corona positive, of which 1,740 are cured after treatment and 1,284 have been discharged,” he said.On the other hand, a sudden spike in new cases has alarmed the government, leading to the sealing of borders with the neighbouring states on Thursday.Rajasthan in last 24-hours has registered over 200 Covid-19 positive cases, taking the tally of active cases in the state to 1,565, till Thursday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-in-good-and-bad-news-5-rajasthan-districts-are-disease-free-but-sudden-spike-causes-alarm/story-ly01Ha6lwpbJJarv9ti1OJ.html

According to the US, Salahuddin had committed or poses a “significant risk of committing acts of terrorim”.But that classification hasn’t made a difference to the Hizbul Mujahideen boss who has the support of Pakistan’s deep state and has been participating in public events for years. The Pakistan government had then declared that it will not act against Salahuddin since the United Nations Security Council hadn’t classified him as a terrorist.Islamabad hasn’t acted against those designated by the UNSC either. There are about 130 individuals who have been sanctioned by the UNSC. On them, Pakistan says it can’t find most of the individuals sanctioned by the UNSC due to inadequate or inaccurate information about them in UNSC dossiers.Riyaz Naikoo’s luck ran out at 7th hideoutSyed Salahuddin’s statement described Riyaz Naikoo’s status in the Hizbul Mujahideen hierarchy as its chief commander. His elimination is a huge setback to the terror group and will lead to its weakening in south Kashmir, where the Hizbul has traditionally been active, a senior police officer said.This part of Kashmir is also where Riyaz Naikoo had an extensive network.He had many hideouts in this area, Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said on Thursday. Kumar said they had already busted six of his hideouts. The one where he was found dead after the firefight with security forces was his seventh. Because there was a possibility that this house could be linked to others in the vicinity via underground tunnels, the security forces even brought earth-digging equipment, including four JCB machines, to block any such effort to slip out.Kumar said it was natural that the terror group would be impacted by his elimination. “Riyaz Naikoo was the most experienced… When the next one is named, we will go after him…. We already know who it is going to be,” the Kashmir region’s top police officer said.Syed Salahuddin’s statement on Thursday did not name anyone. He hadn’t formally designated Riyaz Naikoo either who was seen to be the de facto chief of the Hizbul in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/riyaz-naikoo-setback-upsets-syed-salahuddin-says-the-spark-will-spread-in-region/story-TfBIKLGprQk6uTmYhwOldM.html
07-05-2020||India||Patient can WhatsApp, SMS or email consent for Covid-19 clinical trials: ICMR draft guidelines||Patients, who have been chosen for clinical trials, can now give their consent electronically through a text message, WhatsApp or other mobile-based applications because of mobility restrictions due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) draft guidelines for ethics committees that review biomedical and health research in the country. “A lot has changed because of the pandemic situation, especially restrictions imposed on in-person meetings and physical movements. Many patients won’t be accessible in person because of Covid-19. Besides, we need to maintain social distancing and nobody would like to exchange a lot of papers. We decided to make use of the technology in a bid to ensure that research work doesn’t suffer,” said Dr. Roli Mathur, head, ICMR’s bioethics unit, who drafted the guidelines. “The onus, more than ever, lies on a researcher to adequately inform the subjects of the pros and cons related to the project since the option of digital consent is readily available. The concept of ‘informed consent’ has assumed more significance, where a researcher needs to explain a patient to the best of ability,” she said. The ethics committee quorum, where a minimum number of members is required to be present during a meeting, for decisions to be valid can also meet virtually. “Earlier, it was imperative for ethics committee members to meet in person. But of late, we’re getting a number of queries from various ethics committee members, who are pleading their inability to meet in person. The guidelines weren’t clear about whether the quorum could be held online. But, our experts are of the opinion that it is feasible to conduct ethics committee meetings online,” Dr. Mathur said. Emerging trends suggest that online ethics meetings are likely to become a permanent feature even after the Covid-19 pandemic eases in the near future.“We have smoothly transitioned to digital media to conduct meetings, even though there was initial reluctance among a section of members because of perceived technical glitches. However, it has turned out to be a workable idea, as it saves travel time, easier to co-ordinate, etc. It may evolve into a permanent feature in the near future,” she added. The new guidelines suggest that if members of an ethics panel are not available for any reason, a researcher can approach another ethics committee to seek its consent. “On the one hand, there is a need to undertake research on a priority basis, and on the other to ensure that this doesn’t compromise scientific validity and ethical requirements. This is the appropriate time to respond to humanitarian emergencies by adopting novel methodologies, designing innovative methods, appropriate use of digital platforms and new technology, effective management of limitations of time, infrastructure, resources, and enable quick communication,” Dr. Balram Bhargava, director-general, ICMR, wrote in the foreword to the draft guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patient-can-whatsapp-sms-or-email-consent-for-covid-19-clinical-trials-icmr-draft-guidelines/story-kxpOESR82JZlaDq2sW2XnL.html

He also asked the Centre to rush experts with the knowledge of treating victims of Styrene Gas- a carcinogenic chemical. He added that a two-pronged treatment protocol was needed given the prevalent coronavirus infections which weaken a person’s lung and immunity system.“I request you to send medical experts from India and globally to treat the victims of Styrene Gas. Further, Covid-19 infects the lungs and reduces the immunity of a person. Hence, it is essential that the medical aid should be two pronged, keeping in mind Covid-19 and Styrene Gas,” wrote Naidu.Poisonous Styrene vapour leaked from a chemical plant in Vishakhapatnam in the early hours of Thursday, killing nine people and sickening over a thousand others, as it spread to nearby villages in a five-kilometre radius. The leak happened while the plant was preparing to reopen following ease of restrictions on industrial activity during the third-phase of national lockdown.Director General of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) SN Pradhan said 500 people from 200-250 families living in the 3 km radius of the plant have been evacuated to safer places. The leak occurred from a plant that was holding about 1,800 kilo litres of the poisonous chemical, said news agency PTI.Centre has already rushed a specialised CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) team from the National Disaster Relief Force along with medical specialists. Director General of (NDRF) S N Pradhan said the leakage from the factory is now minimal but the NDRF personnel will be at the spot till it is totally plugged, reported PTI.Also Read: Andhra poisonous gas leak: Rs1 crore relief for deaths, 10 lakh for critical patients, probe ordered into incident||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-gas-leak-chandrababu-naidu-demands-to-shut-down-lg-polymers-plant-seeks-centre-s-help/story-FwVAqIajuL5nmLXU4p2HbM.html

07-05-2020||India||Deliberately infecting healthy people with coronavirus may speed Covid vaccine studies, says WHO||Deliberately infecting healthy volunteers with the virus that causes Covid-19 may speed studies of vaccines against the deadly pathogen, the World Health Organization said.Such studies, which pose significant potential dangers to subjects, may be considered in dire situations and with certain disclosures and protections, a working group of the United Nations health agency said in a report posted Wednesday on its website.Researchers around the world are racing to develop vaccines to protect against the deadly coronavirus and allow countries to rebuild teetering economies. So-called challenge studies, where treatments or preventatives are tested directly against the infection in informed volunteers, might speed the path of vaccines to the public.Challenge studies “can be substantially faster to conduct than vaccine field trials,” according to the working group paper, “in part because far fewer participants need to be exposed to experimental vaccines in order to provide (preliminary) estimates of efficacy and safety.”Eight ConditionsThe report laid out eight conditions that would need to be fulfilled for challenge studies to be considered, including scientific justification, an assessment of potential benefits and the fully informed consent of subjects.Initial studies should be limited to young, healthy adults from 18 to 30 years old. Tests might prioritize those who are most likely to get infected while taking care not to inappropriately target the poor and otherwise socially vulnerable, the report said.Health-care workers and researchers would be particularly appropriate for coronavirus challenge studies, according to the report, as they already face a higher probability of infection and are well informed about its risks.Challenge studies hold the potential to reduce coronavirus mortality around the world but pose significant potential dangers for volunteers, scientists led by Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist, suggested in a recent paper.“Obviously, challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death,” they said in March in an article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.Vaccines are usually tested in a large group whose results are compared with those from a separate group of unvaccinated people. Waiting for both groups to become exposed to the illness in their regular daily lives can take months, while challenge studies would ensure that the subjects would promptly come into contact with the virus.Officials at Moderna Inc., where a vaccine for Covid-19 is in development, aren’t enthusiastic about the idea.“I’m not sure I am a huge fan of it really for both practical and ethical reasons,” said Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, during a presentation put on by the health news organization Stat on Wednesday. “As is often the case, the devil is in the details.”Zaks said he wasn’t sure that a challenge study, which could take months to design and implement, would speed development of the company’s product, which is already entering the second of three phases of study. The shot would have to prevent the development of disease, not just mild infections, or it would be hard to know if the dose picked was the right one, he said.Foundation 1daysooner has a website where people can sign up to participate in a human challenge trial for Covid-19, if one were to occur. Nearly 14,000 volunteers from 102 countries have signed up so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deliberately-infecting-healthy-people-with-coronavirus-may-speed-covid-vaccine-studies-says-who/story-RK74T8dCPwpbeILOafZQ9I.html

While one of the patients died today, another borderman had passed away on Monday at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital.“DG BSF and all ranks mourn the untimely demise of the corona warriors of BSF. BSF fraternity conveys condolences and stands firm with the bereaved families,” the force said in a statement on Thursday.These are the first cases of death in the BSF due to Covid-19 and the second among paramilitary forces after a 55-year-old sub-inspector of the CRPF had succumbed to the disease last month.The total number of infections or active cases in the 2.5 lakh personnel strong force now stand at 193 after 41 fresh cases were reported, the BSF said in the statement. Two jawans have recovered.“While all instructions and protocols issued by the health ministry are strictly followed, it is pertinent to mention that BSF establishments have established well equipped quarantine/isolation centres as per the prescribed norms to prevent the contagion. The composite hospitals of BSF are dedicated Covid-19 Health Centres (DCHC) and are diligently handling cases of BSF personnel,” the statement further said.Eighty-five BSF personnel tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. This was the highest spike in Covid-19 cases in a day in any of the paramilitary forces.The BSF has reported most of its cases from Delhi, Kolkata and Tripura. BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj said that the infections have been reported while performing operational and essential duties. Bhardwaj said that each establishment of the BSF is following the standard operating procedures that are in place to contain the coronavirus disease.The central paramilitary forces now have over 400 cases across the country.Around 10 lakh strong border guarding forces are deployed for counter-insurgency, border guarding and law and order duties across the country. The spike in Covid-19 infections in CAPFs in last one week has raised concerns among its brass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-bsf-personnel-die-of-covid-19-tally-in-force-nears-200/story-yqWy7J5LLLVeBDSCfM9oOL.html
07-05-2020||India||Odisha posts highest single-day surge in Covid-19 positive cases||Odisha posted its highest single-day surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases, as 21 people were found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and the overall tally in the state rose to 206 on Thursday.All 21 new Covid-19 positive cases were migrant labourers, including 17 and four from Ganjam and Mayurbhanj districts, respectively, who had recently returned home from the industrial town of Surat in Gujarat, the state health and family welfare department said in a tweet.A 20-year-old girl is among the 17 new Covid-19 positive cases reported from the coastal Ganjam district. While Mayurbhanj district’s green zone tag was wiped out when four migrant labourers tested Covid-19 positive. All the new Covid-19 positive cases are asymptomatic and have been kept at quarantine centres on their return to Odisha, the health department officials said.On Wednesday, another nine migrant workers, who recently returned from Surat, tested Covid-19 positive in Jagatsinghpur, Ganjam and Kendrapara districts.Of the 206 Covid-19 positive cases in the state, around half have either returned from Surat or Kolkata.Till Wednesday, 35,540 migrant workers had returned to Odisha. Another five lakh is expected to arrive over the next few weeks, and the state government has arranged an equal number of quarantine beds in around 12,000 makeshift medical camps. State health department officials said that the curve is unlikely to be flattened in the coming days, as Odisha is expecting an influx of stranded migrant labourers.Odisha reported its first Covid-19 positive cases in 37 days, and the figure doubled in only 11 days, raising concerns for the state government.On March 15, only one district Khurda, had reported a Covid-19 positive case, but it has since spread to 16 of the 30 districts in the state.Special Relief Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Jena has asked all district collectors and municipal commissioners to ensure spot registration of non-enrolled migrant returnees in temporary medical camps immediately after their arrival from other states.To make matters worse, hundreds of migrants, who returned from Surat, flouted state government’s guidelines and did not register their vehicles on the Covid-19 portal giving the journey details.The government is worried about the rampant violation of norms that are putting paid to its containment plans.For instance, in some quarantine centres in Ganjam district, over 100 migrant returnees fled as a mark of protest against lack of food and water and in another case they threw away ‘unpalatable’ food.The authorities have booked seven people at a quarantine centre in coastal Bhadrak district for filming a video in violation of social distancing norms. Allegations are also doing the rounds about some migrant returnees, who are quietly slinking away at the dead of night from the quarantine centres to spend time with their families.Though the state government has issued stern warnings against such indiscretions, officials said they did not want to be seen heavy-handed in their approach while dealing with the migrants. “Don’t look down at the migrant returnees, as they’ve returned from the states that have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots. Though some of them have tested Covid-19 positive, we need to treat them properly,” said Subroto Bagchi, state government’s spokesperson on Covid-19.“The returnees have the same rights as anybody else living in Odisha. In fact, they’ve more rights on the state’s resources, as they are in distress due to the loss of their livelihoods because of lockdown restrictions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-posts-highest-single-day-surge-in-covid-positive-cases/story-EpVEHhwOnCcVUOXXofElHK.html
07-05-2020||India||Andhra poisonous gas leak: Rs1 crore relief for deaths, 10 lakh for critical patients, probe ordered into incident||The Andhra Pradesh government on Thursday announced Rs 1 crore as compensation for each of the deceased in Visakhapatnam poisonous gas leak incident. He also announced Rs 10 lakh for those put on a ventilator as a result of the leak and Rs 1 lakh for those who have been hospitalised due to the incident.At least 9 people have died and more than a thousand have fallen sick due to the leak of poisonous gas Styrene from the LG Polymers unit at R R Venkatapuram on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam on Thursday morning. The state government also announced a compensation of Rs 25,000 for the gas-leak affected patients who are under treatment without hospitalization at the OPDs (Out Patient Department) and Rs 10,000 each for affected families from the five villages adjoining the LG plant.Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy said that those who have lost cattle due to the leak will get full compensation for the loss; besides Rs 20,000 to each family.The state government has also appointed a committee to probe the incident and the government indicated that the LG Polymers plant could be relocated if found necessary. The incident happened in the wee hours on Thursday when the plant was preparing to resume operations in line with the relaxations for the resumption of industrial activities, extended at the start of the third phase of the nationwide lockdown to fight coronavirus. State industries minister M Goutham Reddy said that the leakage of gas might have occurred from the tank storing Styrene in liquid form. The minister said the liquid turns into a gaseous state at a temperature of more than 20 degrees Celsius. He added that the cap of the storage tank is learnt to have come off, leading to the leak. Initial reports suggested that the engineers attempted to seal the mouth but the damage had been done by that time, he added.He claimed that the company- LG Polymers-- was asked to confirm with all safety protocols before reopening the plant following lockdown relaxations.The plant is located at R R Venkatapuram area near Gopalapatnam, which is close to Visakhapatnam international airport. People in nearby residential areas were fast asleep when the incident took place.When the poisonous gas reached the residential areas, many people rushed on to the streets complaining of a pungent smell difficult to bear. Several people collapsed on the streets while a large section of residents, including the children and the old people, fainted within their homes, said Visakhapatnam’s assistant commissioner of police, Swaroopa Rani.Also Read: Gas leak might have occurred from chemical plant’s storage tank: Andhra Pradesh minister||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-poisonous-gas-leak-rs1-crore-relief-for-deaths-10-lakh-for-critical-patients-probe-ordered-into-incident/story-3JdMGe6U7CiyJZzM6xMHbK.html

07-05-2020||India||Styrene is lethal and carcinogenic if inhaled in high quantities: Experts||Styrene gas which leaked from the LG Polymers unit at R R Venkatapuram on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam, is a lethal chemical that can have a carcinogenic (cancer causing) effect on human beings, if inhaled in high quantities, experts said.According to P Prasada Rao, an environmental engineer with the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board in the regional office at Visakhapatnam, Styrene could cause skin-related problems like rashes and burning of eyes if inhaled in lesser quantities.But if it would affect the brain if inhaled in high quantities and people fall into an unconscious state. It has a carcinogenic effect on such people in the long run. “We are right now assessing as to what extent this chemical has entered the air and its impact on the people,” Rao said.Styrene is a common chemical used in the plastic industry. “If the quantity of consumption is very high and the proximity is intense, then it can be lethal,” S N Pradhan, Director General of the National Disaster Response Force said.State industries minister P Gautam Reddy also admitted that Styrene has carcinogenic property. “I was told it is in a liquid form stored in the storage tank of the plant for the last 45 days and at 20 degrees Celsius and above, it would convert into gaseous form. Apparently, the gas leaked out of the tank due to opening of the lid. The technicians of the plant closed the lid within a short time but the damage was already done,” he said.An official in the industries department who preferred anonymity said preliminary studies revealed that the company authorities had apparently not maintained the stipulated temperature during the lockdown period and subsequently while taking up the maintenance work before reopening.It is learnt as many as 25 workers were involved in the maintenance work at the chemical tanks. On the night shift, they also kept the mandatory antidote in the form of water spray ready. Forensic experts are assessing if the workers did not use the antidote or if it did not work.There was 2,000 metric tons of the gas (liquid) in the tank that created the problem. Another tank has 3,000 metric tons of the gas stored.Noted environmentalist and former Union energy secretary E A S Sarma wondered how the state pollution control board had granted permission for expansion of the plant in 2019 without obtaining approvals from the Centre.He also questioned how the state government had granted a No Objection Certificate to resume the plant operations though it was not an “essential” industry. By no stretch of imagination, a plastic manufacturing unit like this can be called essential, he pointed out.LG Polymers, a group of company of South Korea-based LG Chem, originally began as Hindustan Polymers in 1961 at Visakhapatnam. Later, it merged with UB Group in 1978 and in 1997; it was taken over by LG Chem which changed the company’s name to LG Polymers India Pvt Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/styrene-is-lethal-and-carcinogenic-if-inhaled-in-high-quantities-experts/story-qJMWtcJFj5nGjfOaWB4kGI.html
07-05-2020||India||Club musicians turn vegetable sellers in lockdown-hit Bengal town||The raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak has overnight turned Siliguri-based professional musicians Rahul Sarkar and Prashant Mitra into vegetable vendors to make their both ends meet.The duo has been going around door-to-door with bicycles laden with vegetables and fruits, a career option, which wasn’t in their wildest nightmares when they had left their homes in North 24 Parganas district’s Jagaddal three years ago and came to Siliguri, located about 500 kilometres away, to try their luck as professional musicians.Sarkar (33) started playing the drums, while Mitra (48) hit the keyboards for bands at a couple of bars in Siliguri. They made Rs 700 each daily for their evening gigs, accompanied by a dash of glamour and some fame among the club circles in the Darjeeling district.However, the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were initially enforced for 21 days from March 25 and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of Covid-19, have changed their lives upside down. Sarkar and Mitra, who have been friends since their struggling days at Jagaddal, are busy carting vegetables and fruits on their bicycles all day to fend for their families and also send some money back home.“I never thought I would be selling vegetables and fruits, but right now this is all I can do to take care of my family,” said Sarkar.“The outbreak has taught me a lesson. I’ve learnt to accept the harsh reality. One should not hallucinate about life,” said Mitra, whose father lives with his sister in neighbouring Assam.Sarkar’s son, who has started going to playschool, wife and father live in Jagaddal, while Mitra lives with his wife in Siliguri. The stage, the duo says, has become a distant dream, as the bars have been closed for an indefinite period following the state government’s order. Sarkar and Mitra received some help in cash and kind from well-wishers and the North Bengal Stage Performers’ Association (NBSPA) that was formed on April 6 to help members in distress. The money helped Sarkar and Mitra start the vegetable business, but it was barely enough to buy two weighing scales. The friends, bound by a common fate, decided to work together as makeshift vegetable vendors to tide over the acute financial crunch.“Most of our colleagues are in dire straits. Our jobs will be of least priority even after the bar reopens,” said Mitra.Around one thousand musicians, dancers, singers and anchors were working in the 50-odd bars in Siliguri, the biggest town and business centre in north Bengal, before the lockdown was clamped.“These people enjoy no social security, as they’re treated like daily-wage earners,” said Deep Chattopadhyay, secretary, NBSPA.“We formed the association to help ourselves. Our means are limited. We need support from the state government,” said Chattopadhyay, a saxophone player and an English teacher at a local high school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/club-musicians-turn-vegetable-sellers-in-lockdown-hit-bengal-town/story-k7WigoZ7EnQGFqHLxHAEyK.html
07-05-2020||India||About one-third of road accident victims during lockdown are migrants: NGO||Nearly a third of road accidents to have taken place during the lockdown prompted by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India have claimed the lives of migrant workers walking back home, according to data collected by Save Life Foundation. India recorded about 600 road crashes in the first two phases of the lockdown, said the data compiled for the period from March 24 (the day India announced the lockdown) till May 3 (the day the second phase of the curbs ended). The highest number of road accidents took place in Punjab (42), followed by Kerala (26) and Delhi (18).Of the total 137 victims in this period, 42 were migrants, 78 were “driving during the lockdown”, and 13 were essential workers. Nine states, namely Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Assam, Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, recorded over 100 of these fatalities.“While there has been a dip in the absolute number of road crash fatalities during lockdown due to suspension of public transport and general mobility, the rate of deaths in road crashes has remained unchanged, highlighting how unsafe Indian roads are even when the majority of the country has been under restrictions,” said the NGO, which works to ensure road safety practices.“At least 580 crashes, resulting in 137 deaths have taken place over the last 41 days,” Piyush Tewari, who founded the Save Life Foundation, said. “This is the minimum number as cases with single fatalities may not have been documented properly.”According to Tewari, while the number of fatalities was lower, the crash severity rate of the accidents has remained constant. “Under normal circumstances, we would have seen approximately 16,000 deaths from around 65,000 crashes. The crash severity ratio, around 1:4, comes down to the same as the cases at present.”“The crash severity ratio staying constant just tells us how dangerous the roads are,” Tewari said.Vijay Chibber, a former secretary in the ministry of road transport and highways, said a host of factors plays out in a road accident. “The crash severity proportion stays about the same if there are defects in road engineering, or if visibility is not good in an area,” Chibber said. “Such a road will remain accident-prone whether 50,000 vehicles or 30,000 cars are driving on it.”“Engineering defects can induce accident as can bad drivers,” Chibber added. “While the volume of traffic may have fallen during lockdown, other factors may have remained constant.” These factors, said Chibber, are considered “black spots”. “Accidents during the lockdown can be an indication of a poor quality of vehicles, drivers and of roads.” “Our highways are not access controlled, migrants walking on the roads or on a cycle may not be visible, especially at dawn or dusk. Hordes of people walking home may have aggravated the situation causing the accidents,” said Chibber. Road accidents claimed nearly 150,000 lives, according to the ministry of road transport and highways data for 2018. India is a signatory to the United Nation’s Brasilia Declaration with the target of reducing road fatalities by 50% by 2020.On March 16, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said in the Rajya Sabha accidents across the country have reduced by nearly 10% ever since the Motor Vehicles Act was amended in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/about-one-third-of-road-accident-victims-during-lockdown-are-migrants-ngo/story-AjbwTJ8GjjkFWlg0MgnCqN.html

The leakage of styrene gas, which causes nausea and dizziness, took place early on Thursday when the plant was preparing to resume production later today in view of the eased Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.In the villages closest to the plant located on the outskirts of the city, visuals on social media early this morning showed people lying motionless on the streets, at least two had fallen into the drains.Elsewhere also, there were videos of parents carrying unconscious children in their arms on the streets and running to get medical help. Many others were seen dazed sitting on the pavements. Some more lay on the roads, a young woman among them was seen collapsing.The municipal corporation tweeted that people in an area within approximately 3-kilometre radius of the plant were vulnerable.The incident evoked memories of the gas leaked from a pesticide plant in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal in 1984. That incident, counted among one of the world’s worst industrial disasters, had killed 3,500 people.In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dialled Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and promised all the help that he would need. Jagan Mohan Reddy left Visakhapatnam soon after.PM Modi also called a meeting of the National Disaster Management Authority that he leads. “I pray for everyone’s safety and well-being in Visakhapatnam,” PM Modi said in a tweet before the meeting started.According to news agency ANI, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) chief SN Pradhan said about 1,000 to 1,500 people had been evacuated by the authorities and more than 800 taken to hospital.Most of the people taken to hospital were later discharged.Visakhapatnam District Medical and Health Officer Tirumala Rao told reporters, around 2 pm that 300 people were still admitted to various hospitals.Late afternoon, Pradhan told a news briefing in Delhi that 11 people had died in the incident.Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy has announced Rs 1 crore compensation for the next of kin of the dead besides Rs 10 lakh to people who have been put on ventilator and Rs 25,000 to those who were treated as outpatients. The chief minister also announced that a committee has been set up to probe the incident and the government was prepared to have the company shift to a different location if recommended by the panel.Gas leaked at 2.30-3 amThe gas leak is reported to have been spotted around between 2.30am and 3 am at LG Polymers India Pvt Ltd facility at RR Venkatapuram area near Gopalapatnam.Assistant commissioner of police Swaroopa Rani said many people who woke up to the pungent smell of the gas ran out. Many, mostly children and old people, fainted at home. Police teams that went to the villages initially had to retreat for fear of being poisoned.Andhra industries minister M Goutham Reddy said styrene gas appeared to have leaked from the storage tank of the plant. It seems the cap of the storage tank came off and by the time the engineers sealed the gap and neutralised the liquid, the damage was done.The company had been told to adhere to all safety protocols before reopening the plant after lockdown relaxations. “It is for the company to prove that there was no negligence on its part,” Reddy said.South Korea-headquartered LG Chem said operations at the plant had been suspended because of a nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak and was preparing to resume operations.“We are currently assessing the extent of the damage on residents in the town and are taking all necessary measures to protect residents and employees in collaboration with related organizations,” LG Chem, the owner of LG Polymers, said in a statement, according to news agency Reuters.It said the spokesman separately said a night shift maintenance worker had discovered the leak from a tank. The cause of the leak is being investigated, the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-die-300-hospitalised-in-vizag-after-styrene-gas-leaks-from-polymer-factory/story-QAYTx6Xr9zEN8CgLZvRMWP.html
07-05-2020||India||Road developers to incur Rs 3,700 crore revenue losses during March-June: Report||Highway developers and toll operators are likely to incur toll revenue losses of about Rs 3,700 crore during March-June this year, while NHAI will lose Rs 2,200 crore in toll fee, Crisil Research said on Thursday.However, it said that the road and highways sector would rebound faster despite sharp losses this quarter.“On its part, the roads and highways sector will see developers/ toll operators incurring toll revenue losses of Rs 3,450-3,700 crore during March-June, the estimate suggests. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will lose Rs 2,100-2,200 crore in toll over this period,” Crisil Infrastructure Advisory said during a tele-conference on “Impact of the Pandemic on the Transport Sector and Mitigants thereof”.It said the extended lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, which has stalled traffic on the ground as in the air, is expected to heap enormous losses on infrastructure industries but roads and highways would rebound faster despite sharp losses this quarter.The agency said NHAI had planned to raise Rs 80,000-85,000 crore through fiscal 2025 by monetising 6,000 km of operational public-funded toll roads.“This asset monetisation programme through toll-operate-transfer and infrastructure investment trusts will likely take a hit,” Crisil said. In addition to the loss in toll revenue, stakeholders will suffer losses on account of accrued interest, increase in costs of under-construction projects, time overruns, and rise in disputes between private sector and the government authorities.“Tolling operations resumed on April 20 and construction on select projects has also restarted. Going forward, the ramp-up in traffic, availability of labour and raw materials for construction, and expeditious dispute resolution will be the key monitorables. “In addition, road authorities such as the NHAI will have to step up initiatives beyond conventional avenues such as development of way-side amenities and formation of special purpose vehicles/ joint ventures for both, financing and revenues,” Akshay Purkayastha, Director, Transport & Logistics, Crisil Infrastructure Advisory, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/road-developers-to-incur-rs-3-700-crore-revenue-losses-during-march-june-report/story-eO9mZHI3iSGwqoh1qkCQWL.html

We will seek explanation from the airline (private operator) as to how it happened. BOI (Bureau of Immigration) has a very stringent protocol for dealing with such deviations, which must have been acted upon,” said a senior official of aviation regulator DGCA.It is not clear if the businessman and his cook were deported or sent to a quarantine facility within India.India has been under a lockdown since March 25 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. All scheduled commercial passenger flights have been suspended during the lockdown.However, cargo flights, medical evacuation flights and special flights permitted by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have been allowed to operate during this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-opens-bookings-for-foreigners-visa-holders-on-outbound-repatriation-flights/story-ElPSbnKlR4WuysO0y6lNKI.html
07-05-2020||India||Jaipur focuses on ‘super spreaders’ to contain Covid-19 infections||Rajasthan has now turned its focus on ‘super spreaders’ to contain Covid-19 infections in Jaipur, a top government official said Thursday.According to the government data, out of the 33 districts in Rajasthan, Jaipur has the maximum of 1,099 Covid-19 cases. Till date around 30,761 samples have been taken in Jaipur and 52 of Covid-19 patients in the district have died.After finding over 10 positive cases of super spreaders (fruit and vegetable vendors) in the city recently, the district administration has aggressively started taking random samples.“Our major focus is now on super spreaders such as vegetable vendors, dairy booths, grocery and medical shops – these are the direct points of interaction. Many incidents in past few days have come up where the vegetable vendor had spread the infection,” said Ajitabh Sharma, Principal Secretary, department of energy and nodal officer for Jaipur.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Contact tracing is difficult in such cases because vendors are mobile, he added.“Aggressive random sampling has been started to check super spreaders with vegetable vendors being the first to be checked since they are mobile. Subsequently, we will cover dairy booths, grocery and medical shops which are stationary,” Sharma said.He said there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of fruit and vegetable sellers after many people who were in other trades also started selling fruits and vegetables.The officer said that there is a higher risk of infection since a large number of people come in contact with the vendors who have no fixed routes and which makes contact tracing difficult if a positive case is found among them. Over 150 first contacts of super spreaders have been quarantined. The administration has now devised a way to monitor the vendors.“In view of this, the number of vendors has been limited for every ward and they have to wear caps issued by Municipal Corporation, wear masks and carry sanitizer,” he said.“The number of vendors has also been limited across the city to 10 in each ward. To distinguish them, caps of different colours have been given to vendors permitted in inner and outer walled city. Out of around 3,000 vendors 1,050 are now permitted to sell. Those selling inside the walled city will wear multi-coloured cap and those outside will wear white,” he said.A separate team of doctors are testing them and monitoring them. Chief Medical and Health Officer, Narrottam Sharma said till date around 1,200 samples of super spreaders such as vegetable vendor and grocery store people have been taken and a dozen of them have tested positive.Amid the increasing number of cases, the ‘positive’ news is that out of the total 1099 Covid-19 cases in Jaipur, 604 have recovered and 461 have been discharged. The number of active cases is now 443.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaipur-focuses-on-super-spreaders-to-contain-covid-19-infections/story-2QWj6ImuyacoBPvmNO5LaM.html

We are mentioning Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad in the bulletin as they are the parts of India,” news agency ANI quoted IMD Director General Mrutyunjoy Mohapatra as saying.“For a long time, IMD has been issuing severe weather forecast for Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal etc. We were mentioning this information in our national bulletin. For past two days, we have started mentioning this information in our regional bulletin,” ANI quoted Mohapatra as further saying.Mohapatra said they have been mentioning areas under PoK under its daily weather bulletin ever since the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in the two union territories in August last year, news agency PTI reported.These cities of PoK have now found a place in the overall forecast of the northwest division. The IMD’s northwest division consists of nine sub-divisions: Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi-Chandigarh-Haryana, Punjab, east Uttar Pradesh, west Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan and west Rajasthan.The development assumes significance as New Delhi has been of a position that the PoK belongs to India.The inclusion of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit-Baltistan in the forecast comes amid Pakistan’s Supreme Court allowing elections in Gilgit-Baltistan this week. India had strongly reacted to the development.A senior Pakistani diplomat was served a “demarche”, or formal diplomatic representation over telephone, to lodge India’s strong protest against the Pakistani Supreme Court’s order.Mohapatra said that the IMD, being the World Meteorological Department nominated Regional Meteorological Centre, provides severe weather warnings to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan detailing forecasts for the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/areas-in-pakistan-occupied-kashmir-now-in-weather-department-forecast/story-vpnunRAqwvnYFubyxTfJyJ.html

India, China in lead||The UN on Thursday projected a sharp rise in global birth rates, led by India, in the months since WHO declared coronavirus a pandemic, triggering lockdowns. “The pandemic could strain healthcare capacities for mothers and newborns,” it said.“An estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the Unicef said in a report. This represents a spike for the period assessed. “New mothers and newborns will be greeted by harsh realities.” India, with 20.1 million births, tops nations with the anticipated highest numbers of births in the nine months since the pandemic’s declaration, the UN body said. Following India will be countries, such as China (13.5 million births), Nigeria (6.4 million), Pakistan (5 million) and Indonesia (4 million). “COVID-19 containment measures can disrupt life-saving health services such as childbirth care, putting millions of pregnant mothers and their babies at great risk,” Unicef’s executive director Henrietta Fore said in the global report. Developing countries are especially at risk, she said.The UN body made projections for a 40-week period between March 11 and December 16 2020 in its estimate based upon the WHO’s March 11 assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.India has made considerable progress in social indicators, but still lags many countries in indices such as maternal health, access to contraception and immunisation. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), the prevalence rate of anaemia among Indian women has witnessed just a speck of minor improvement from 55% in 2005-06 to 53% in 2015-16. The UN body said most of the countries which will witness a baby boom (including India) had “high neonatal mortality rates” even before the pandemic and “may see these levels increase with COVID-19 conditions”.“That’s very true. Family welfare has got a big knock down. Access to birth-control measures during the lockdown has been scarce. There is a high possibility of unprotected sex among spouses. Adequate resources must be reserved for a birth boom,” said Dr. Sushil Sharma, a public health expert and chairman of the Arthritis Foundation of India. According to Purushottam M. Kulkarni of Jawaharlal Nehru University, data from the NHFS shows that between 2005-06 and 2015-16 (NFHS-4), there has been little improvement in access to contraception, indicating unmet contraception. Unmet need for contraception is measured as the share of women who are fertile and want to postpone their next birth or stop childbearing altogether but don’t have access to contraception. Even wealthier countries are affected by this crisis, the UN body said. “In the US, the sixth highest country in terms of expected number of births, over 3.3 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. In New York, authorities are looking into alternative birthing centers as many pregnant women are worried about giving birth in hospitals.”Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns died every year, or 1 every 11 seconds, mostly of preventable causes, data from WHO show. The UN body called for allocating dedicated resources to lifesaving services and supplies for maternal and child health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-sees-global-baby-boom-due-to-covid-19-lockdowns-india-china-in-lead/story-ViCK1y4Vff5fIGSVQLA9CM.html

07-05-2020||India||Bengal’s retail and hospitality sectors plan new models to sidestep Covid-19 crisis||With business virtually at standstill, retail and hospitality industries have planned new models to keep going in a controlled environment during and after the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus.The Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) has prepared a standard operating procedure (SOP) and approached the administrations in several states, including West Bengal, seeking resumption of operation with limited manpower and restricted entry of shoppers. The industry provides livelihood for 12 million people across India.“The retail industry contributes over 10% to India’s gross domestic product (GDP), the second largest after agriculture. It employs over 8% of the overall workforce making it the third largest in the country,” Amitabh Taneja, chairman and founding director, SCAI, said in a summary to the SOP that was sent to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on May 1 along with his letter.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.The SOP mandates, among many other things, 50 per cent occupancy of common areas and gross leasable areas, distance of five feet between customers at eating outlets, Installation of plexiglass at checkout points, 50 per cent use of parking capacity, restricted washroom usage, no promotional activity and sensor-based sanitization points at entry and inside stores and outlets. State government officials were not willing to comment but a senior bureaucrat said that SCAI representatives were told that the government would wait for the Centre to take a call on opening malls.“It will take India quite some time to turn into a green zone. Shopping centres and malls cannot be shut down till then because billions of lives depend on the manufacturing industry which has taken a hit. If the government can allow offices and airports to operate with limited staff, something can be tried at malls as well. Look at the streets. I am quite sure there would have been complete order at liquor stores in the malls had they been allowed to open,” Rahul Saraf, managing director of Kolkata-based Forum Group and director SCAI, told HT.“A mall provides a formal and regulated environment. One should not wait for normalcy to return,” he added. The amount of business in a mall works out to be around Rs 10,000 per square feet a year and the space used for business in some of the big malls in and around Kolkata adds up to around five million square feet, said Saraf.“Let there be caveats but thousands of frontline and back-end workers should be allowed to earn their livelihood,” he added. With the number of Covid cases on the rise, the hospitality industry in Bengal is going through an equally rough time and many are trying to work out new models.Rishi Jain, executive director, Jain Group, which owns Holiday Inn Kolkata Airport, has started renting out the top floor of the property to people looking for a quarantine facility that is more hospitable than a government building.“Entry and exit to the top floor are not used by other guests and the floor below it is kept empty to act as a buffer zone. Only disposable utensils and containers are used in the top floor,” said Jain.“In our hotel, retail selling has come to a zero with no one coming in to have lunch or dinner or ordering food from home. Luckily we have some guests of foreign origin and supply of raw materials is unaffected till now. We are operating with 30 per cent staff strength,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-retail-and-hospitality-sectors-plan-new-models-to-sidestep-covid-19-crisis/story-y8L83Ob8XvubK5Zwr6D5aM.html

Nine people were killed in the gas leak.“I personally helped more than 15 people get to an ambulance who had tried to run away from the village but dropped down a few metres away,” Local revenue official B V Rani told news agency Reuters.Areas within an approximately 3-kilometre radius of the plant were vulnerable, the municipal corporation said in a tweet. Around 1,500 people had been evacuated, mostly from a neighbouring village, authorities said.The scenes were reminiscent of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster which killed thousands of people. At least 30 tonnes of methyl isocyanate gas was released from the Union Carbide pesticide plant in the Madhya Pradesh capital in one of the worst industrial disasters of the 20th century.The incident occurred on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984, and affected more than 6,00,000 workers and nearby inhabitants.Scores of people had left their homes in a hurry as gas started to spread. It mostly affected the low-lying areas of the city and led to decay of vegetables, fruits and other eatables.Doctors said the most common immediate health issues were severe lung injury, often resulting in death, and corneal damage. Many lost their eyesight.One of the most common long-term impact has been fibrosis of the lung and respiratory crippling, said doctors. A Belstein Test conducted in 2015 found the water from 240-foot-deep borewells in Bhopal to be contaminated due to the gas leak referred to many as Hiroshima-like tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-gas-leak-an-eerie-reminder-of-bhopal-gas-tragedy/story-PTCBZv5Me1Y2crMHtVbeNN.html
07-05-2020||India||Ministry website crashes as Indians abroad rush to register to get home||The Indian civil aviation ministry’s website crashed on Wednesday as panicked citizens abroad rushed to register for a repatriation of almost 15,000 nationals from 12 countries on planes and naval ships.India banned all incoming international flights in late March as it imposed one of the world’s strictest virus lockdowns, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers and students stranded abroad.Under the first phase of the mass effort announced on Tuesday, two ships were heading towards the Maldives to evacuate some 1,000 Indian citizens while another was headed for the Gulf.The first of 64 flights over the first week was due to leave the United Arab Emirates -- home to more than three million Indians -- on Thursday.A flight from Qatar for the southern state of Kerala originally scheduled for Thursday was postponed to Saturday, local media reported. No reason was given.In total 26 flights will bring Indians home from the Gulf region, while others will operate from Southeast Asia, Britain and the United States.Indian media quoted civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri as saying that 200,000 Indians abroad had registered for repatriation and that the final number could be twice that.His ministry blamed the crashing of its website on “unprecedented traffic” and urged people to check the website of Air India, which is operating the flights, for details.Kerala is the biggest source of Indians in the Gulf.OV Mustafa, the director of Norka Roots, a government welfare body for non-resident Keralites, told AFP that those abroad were “desperate” and in a “panic”.The Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Twitter that all passengers would be screened for virus symptoms and given an antibody test at the departure airport.There were also concerns about social distancing on the flights, with the Times of India quoting Puri as saying that keeping middle seats vacant on the aircraft was not viable.The Indian embassy statement said that passengers would be given masks, gloves and sanitisers to wear and use on board.Upon arrival, passengers are set to be quarantined for a minimum of 14 days, presenting a large challenge to already stretched Indian authorities.Kerala’s chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the state was “fully prepared” and that “all arrangements are in place for testing and quarantining”.In the first five days, 2,250 people are expected to land at the state’s airports in Kochi, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram. Kochi port was also set to receive all three ships.Vijayan said that 442,000 people wanted to come back to Kerala, and that the central government had “only” approved the return of 80,000.‘Only for the rich’The government has come under fire because those being flown back have to pay, with prices reportedly ranging from 12,000 rupees ($160) for a ticket from Dubai to 100,000 rupees to fly back from the United States.A huge number of Indians who work abroad do menial work and have been left jobless by the pandemic shutdown.The oil-rich Gulf is reliant on the cheap labour of millions of foreigners -- mostly from South Asia -- many of whom live in squalid camps far from the region’s skyscrapers and malls.Prominent Indian opposition politician Shashi Tharoor said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that many could “ill afford” to bear the costs.A. Jemford, who works for the non-profit Agaram Foundation in Tamil Nadu state, tweeted that the repatriation effort was “only for the rich”.One Indian man in Sharjah in the UAE whose wife is six months pregnant told AFP that he registered with the consulate last week but has heard nothing since.“I don’t have medical insurance to cover the delivery costs here so I wanted to get her back home to Kerala to her parents. And she has complications in her pregnancy,” said the man, who did not wish to be named.“It’s been a week and we haven’t heard anything,” he said, adding he could only “sit and pray to my God.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministry-website-crashes-as-citizens-abroad-rush-to-register-to-get-home/story-KK4ebnLxaODCiYwiYijfQO.html

The minister said styrene in liquid form was stored in the tank and it would take gaseous form at a temperature of more than 20 degrees Celsius. “The cap of the storage tank is learnt to have come off and by the time the engineers sealed the gap and neutralised the liquid, the damage was done,” he stated.He said the company was asked to adhere to all safety protocols before reopening the plant after lockdown relaxations. “It is for the company to prove that there was no negligence on its part,” Reddy said, adding that none of the company’s employees died of the gas leakage.Watch | Vizag gas leak: PM Modi holds meet with NDMA; gas neutralized | Key details“As of now, the death of eight people has been confirmed.

A large number of people, mostly children and old people, are learnt to have fainted within their homes, assistant commissioner of police Swaroopa Rani said.“The police were unable to enter the colonies initially because of the foul smell. They went around the colonies asking the people to come out of their homes and move to safer places,” she said.An ambulance driver who was rushed to move the sick to the hospitals also was suffocated. One person who got blinded due to burning of eyes accidentally fell into a dried-up well and died.Scenes of people collapsing on the roads due to suffocation and parents carrying their children in their arms, taking them to ambulances went viral in the media.With the help of the police, hundreds of people managed to move to safer places within hours. Those who fell sick were rushed to King George Hospital and some other private hospitals. Scores of cattle and dogs also died of poisonous gas leakage.Teams from the NDRF and the Eastern Naval Command were also pressed into service to evacuate people from the nearby colonies. Fire tenders from Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd were trying to reduce the impact of the gas using water.The gas spread to 20 nearby colonies and caused suffocation to the residents.

The DCs may need to take the help of local clubs and village authorities to prepare the food.The cabinet has decided to open wholesale markets, which were closed during the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were initially imposed for 21 days from March 25 and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3, on all days except Sunday.Last Saturday, 92 people from Manipur were brought back from Guwahati and Mizoram. Now, lawmakers from various constituencies have started sending vehicles to neighbouring states in the north-east to repatriate other stranded people from Manipur after taking permission from authorities concerned.CM Singh, in a video message to the public, has appealed to extend cooperation to the state government’s initiatives to tackle the pandemic.Manipur has zero active Covid-19 positive cases after both the patients, who were found infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, on March 24 and April 2, respectively. Later, they were discharged from hospital on April 12 and 21, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-govt-to-bear-train-fare-of-manipuris-stranded-outside-northeast-region/story-cz6lccmDAlLk7Sm31vs52J.html

More than 1,000 people fell sick after inhaling the poisonous Styrene gas leaked from the plant.The Styrene gas affects the central nervous system, throat, skin, eyes and some other parts of the body, NDRF Director General S N Pradhan said. Styrene is highly flammable and releases a poisonous gas when burnt.The gas can cause nausea and dizziness when inhaled, and experts say that person exposed to the gas should be given medical treatment immediately. Also Watch | At least 8 dead, several sick after gas leak at Andhra Pradesh factoryAccording to US National Library of Medicine, Styrene is used to make polystyrene plastics, fiberglass, rubber, and latex in its liquid form. It occurs naturally in some fruits, vegetables, meats, nuts, and beverages in low levels.Styrene is used to make insulation, pipes, automobile parts, printing cartridges and copy machine toner, food containers, packaging material, carpet backing, luggage, shoes, toys, floor waxes and polishes, according to US National Library of Medicine. Cigarette smoke and vehicle exhaust too contain styrene.The plant in Andhra Pradesh is owned by South Korean battery maker LG Chemical Ltd, and is located around 14 kilometers away from Visakhapatnam city.LG Chem, South Korea’s top petrochemical maker by capacity, took over the facility previously owned by Hindustan Polymers and renamed it as LG Polymers India Private Limited (LGPI) in July, 1997, according to a company website.The LG Polymers plant makes polystyrene products, according to a company website, which are used in manufacturing electric fan blades, cups and cutlery and containers for cosmetic products such as make up.Emergency services evacuated hundreds of people from nearby areas where the plant is situated, a police official in Andhra Pradesh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-styrene-the-gas-that-leaked-from-visakhapatnam-plant-and-killed-8/story-jJ85G6EOw5Ezzz2U2HEP9M.html

Such people deserve our honour and appreciation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-the-world-is-facing-a-crisis-lord-buddha-s-teachings-become-more-relevant-pm/story-qMHviJJDaVNd8FXE6QROLO.html
07-05-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh, hard hit by Covid-19, has no info on samples for 10 days; experts concerned||Unlike its neighbouring states Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh - which continue to share their Covid-19 data on the number of samples collected and tested with the public - the Madhya Pradesh government has stopped doing so.It was on April 26 when the health department said in its daily bulletin that the cumulative number of samples collected stands at 38,708. As many as 8,439 test reports were said to be awaited from laboratories till then.Interestingly, the April 26 bulletin was immediately followed by another bulletin in which the number of cumulative samples was missing and so was the number of reports awaited. The second bulletin had components like the total number of sample reports, positive cases and negative reports only but there were huge discrepancies between the figures on these components as mentioned in both reports.The number of sample reports dipped by 5,000. There was also a huge gap of 9,000 between negative/rejected samples number as mentioned in the first report and negative reports as mentioned in the second one.As per the information obtained from districts on Wednesday, as many as 10,899 samples were taken in Indore, one of the Covid-19 hotspots in the country. The district reported 1,654 patients and 79 deaths till Tuesday.In Ujjain, another hotspot in the state, 3,522 samples were collected so far; in capital Bhopal, the number is about 15,000.While the state government continues to remain silent, health experts say it is only with a high number of testing and transparency in the government’s conduct that the battle against Covid-19 can be won.Last Saturday, the number of people tested in the country for Covid-19 crossed a million.In a joint letter to health secretary and director-general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), public health experts Dr Biswaroop Chatterjee, Amulya Nidhi and SR Azad said, “Madhya Pradesh is testing lesser compared to other badly hit states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan.”“As of May 5, the state has done a total number of 54,595 tests which translates to about 602 tests per million whereas Maharashtra has conducted 1,628 tests per million with total 18,2884 tests so far. In Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan the tests per million stand at 1,483, 4,162 and 1,970 respectively,” they said in the letter.They addedc, “It is a matter of deep concern that April 27 onwards, the state government stopped providing data on total samples and pending test results. Given that almost 1.5 months have passed since the first case was found and cases are constantly increasing the state still has only 10 government testing labs and three private labs.”“The Covid-19 situation has worsened fast in Madhya Pradesh with a total of 3,049 reported positive cases and 176 deaths as of May 5. The state’s fatality rate is 5.77% against the national 3.42% and its test positivity rate is 5.58% against the national average of 3.87 per cent,” the experts said.The letter underlines an immediate need to increase tests, take corrective action without any further delay and adopt a people-centric, transparent and efficient testing strategy in place by setting up more labs, create a strong supply chain for acquiring testing kits, doing more tests and share data transparently with the public.When contacted, additional chief secretary, Health department Mohd Suleman said, “Government of India has decided that only ICMR test data is recognised. So we are only considering the data given by ICMR recognised testing labs. That is included in the bulletin. Labs don’t accept samples which are not as per the ICMR protocol. So the collected samples don’t get tested if they are not in line with protocol.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-hard-hit-by-covid-19-has-no-info-on-samples-for-10-days-experts-concerned/story-nP4g32F8uIq8guZMNvYACI.html

CBI is the nodal agency - or National Central Bureau (NCB) - for Interpol in India.“It is crucial that police officers don’t lose the grip over other crimes due to duties during Covid-19 pandemic, hence this digital learning platform has been created,” said one of the officials cited above. The virtual academy will have over 100 self-paced courses and modules for the law enforcement agencies. According to a statement by Interpol, the virtual academy complements its physical “Global Academy” for 194-member countries.The Global Academy is a network of trusted law enforcement education institutions providing a global approach to law enforcement training, through both face-to-face and distance learning on Interpol tools and services, as well as transnational crime topicsIn a statement, Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock said, “The Covid-19 pandemic is forcing law enforcement to learn precious lessons, and fast, in a changed international security environment.”“However, whilst we are seeing significant growth in certain crimes areas linked to Covid-19 such as fraud and cyber crime, police still have to deal with all forms of transnational crime and terrorism. The Virtual Academy provides a wide range of courses which are essential in helping law enforcement in their daily work and learn from world class training professionals,” he added. In 2019, more than 15,000 online training courses were completed by global law enforcement, complementing its face-to-face sessions which reached around 5,000 officers from across the globe. These sessions ranged from topics such as counter-terrorism and cybercrime, to training on leadership for women in law enforcement and human rights in policing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-interpol-s-virtual-academy-for-learning-during-covid-19-cbi-tells-state-police-departments/story-p6rPdvLnaqNVawQZWhwBKI.html

As far as vaccines are concerned, experts said these will take at least a year to be developed.The Compendium was launched by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research which has information on 200 Covid-19 technologies, ongoing research and technologies already available for commercialisation. Most of these technologies are proof-of-concept (POC) tested and can help the entrepreneurs to take the product to market faster as they do not have to reinvent the wheel, a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology said.Among ongoing research on Covid-19 treatments is raw materials for covid 19 drug being developed by National Chemical Laboratory which will soon be handed over to Department of Pharmaceuticals. Deployable hospital is already in development stage. Modulus a start up in Indian Institute of Technology, Madras research park which has signed an MoU with Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum for developing the technology.Zydus Cadila which is developing the viral membrane protein vaccine also has a second vaccine approach dealing with development of a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vectored vaccine against Covid-19. Bharat Biotech is developing an intranasal vaccine called ‘CoroFlu’ which after clinical trials, the company is likely to produce around 300 million doses of vaccine for global distribution according to the compendium. Indian Immunologicals Limited is also developing a live attenuated severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine which has been found to be effective in Golden Syrian Hamsters. “The technology looks promising for developing a vaccine for prophylactic, active, single dose immunization against coronavirus in humans, with an enhanced safety profile,” the compendium states. Serum Institute of India in collaboration with US-based Codagenix is developing a vaccine which is now in animal testing phase.“The DNA vaccine involves giving a DNA which will produce certain proteins which will help protect against the infection. No antigen will be given. The second measles virus vectored vaccine against covid 19 is nothing but a recombinant vaccine which will have a combination of measles RNA with SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA put into the measles virus. We already know the measles vaccine is effective.,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “The Serum Institute vaccine is also a recombinant vaccine. I am not aware of the details of other vaccines being developed. As far as I know these are all in development stage. They will go through pre-clinical trials in animals and then phase 1 trials in humans for safety and then phase 2 and 3. Trials may be expedited but normally it takes more than a year for all these processes,” added Dr Broor.Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) is developing isolation pods for Covid-19 patients to help them travel safely. A cover is attached with a pod that restricts the patient from having contact with others. The over will be completely sterilized. A light bed is also arranged on the isolation pod according to ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isolation-pods-deployable-hospitals-antibody-gel-among-treatments-being-developed-in-india/story-gkEaXDrUMedyJDV7xI4gbO.html

07-05-2020||India||Taliban-linked Haqqani network, not just ISKP, plotted Kabul gurdwara strike: NDS||Afghan security forces have taken down a centre operated jointly by terror groups Haqqani Network and the so-called Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) that was responsible for bloody attacks including one on Kabul’s gurdwara that killed 28 worshippers on March 25, a statement by the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, said has said.Five terrorists were killed and eight arrested when commando teams attached with Afghanistan’s lead intelligence agency raided two hideouts of the group in and around Kabul, the NDS said.The statement implies that the two Pakistan proxies in Afghanistan - Aslam Farooqui led ISKP and the Taliban deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani-led Haqqani network - which had often targeted each other in the past had taken some steps to work together.This contrasts with Aslam Farooqui’s claim in the early part of his interrogation that his fighters had been on the run under pressure from the Taliban and had been mostly limited to a eastern Afghanistan district.Farooqi was arrested by the NDS last month in raids carried out weeks after four gunmen stormed Guru Har Rai Gurdwara in Kabul’s old city and opened fire from automatic weapons on March 25. According to the police, 28 worshippers were killed in this attack on the Sikh shrine that had drawn sharp condemnation.But Wednesday’s statement by the NDS fits with New Delhi’s assessment that the attack on the gurdwara was ordered by the Taliban at the behest of Pakistani deep state with the larger motive of driving out India from Afghanistan. There are intelligence reports with national security planners in New Delhi that the Taliban, which had stepped up attacks on Afghan security forces after the United States signed a troop withdrawal agreement on February 29, could carry out more attacks on Indian interests and religious minorities.The NDS said the joint centre destroyed by its forces was controlled by Sanaullah, who was responsible for recruitment for the ISKP and was the urban coordinator of Haqqani Network in Kabul.It also held this joint cell responsible for the rocket attacks in March on the inauguration ceremony of President Ashraf Ghani and the Bagram air base, the US military’s largest base in Afghanistan. No one was killed in either attack. But 30 people were killed when rockets landed in the Shahid Mazari Mosque where many members of the ethnic Hazara community had gathered to mark the anniversary of the death of a Hazara leader. According to the NDS, this attack was executed by the joint cell.To be sure, the Taliban has countered the NDS findings, describing it as propaganda. “We have no joint base with ISIS but have fought and eliminated them from the country,” the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted.Kabul watchers in Delhi attribute the Taliban’s rushed denial to the basic principle in the US-Taliban pact that the Taliban would not allow groups such as the ISKP to use Afghan soil to plan attacks against the US and its allies.An arrangement between the Taliban-linked Haqqani network and the ISKP implies that even if the Taliban agrees to end violence, it could use other groups such as Aslam Farooqui’s ISKP to keep sending the rockets via its allies.Afghan officials have accused the Haqqani network, a US-designated terror group, of carrying out major attacks claimed by or blamed on IS-K. The March 25 attack on the gurdwara was one such case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-linked-haqqani-network-not-just-iskp-plotted-kabul-gurdwara-strike-nds/story-iHf776W3zeVtc3CrNnWUTJ.html
07-05-2020||India||Govt extends time for public comments on environment impact regulation||The Union environment ministry has decided to extend the window for submitting public comments to the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification till June 30. Several environmental groups and the Opposition have been demanding that the time period for public comments, which expires on May 22, be extended.The draft EIA notification 2020 which is expected to significantly overhaul the environmental clearance process for all infrastructure projects in the country was issued by the environment ministry on March 23 and almost the entire sixty-day period for public scrutiny of the draft coincided with the lockdown period. The nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 and has been extended till May 17.Former environment minister and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had tweeted on May 1 that environment minister Prakash Javadekar had put out the draft EIA notification giving 60 days for public comments. “This deadline should be extended by 3 months at least due to covid 19 to enable better understanding of the changes proposed.” BJP MP, Rajeev Chandrasekhar also tweeted saying, “Dear Prakash Javadekar ji please extend 60-day time for comments on draft EIA notification 2020 given Coronavirus crisis. This deserves a good, robust public discussion of changes proposed.”On Thursday, the environment ministry said in a statement: “The ministry is in receipt of several representations for extending the notice period expressing concern that the draft EIA notification was published during the lockdown imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore ministry after due consideration deems it fit to extend the notice period up to June 30.”The reason draft EIA 2020 is being seen as important development is because it proposes a number of relaxations for infrastructure projects which have violated the EIA 2006 norms and extends the validity of environmental clearance in various sectors by several years. CK Mishra, secretary, environment, told HT over phone on Wednesday that “the time period for public consultations is likely to be extended till August.”One of the main objectives of the draft is to bring those industries or projects under regulation which have violated the EIA 2006 notification by starting construction work before environmental clearance is granted or by expanding capacity. “Dealing with violation cases” is an entirely new section in the draft notification compared to the EIA notification 2006.The draft states that violations can be reported suo motu by the project proponent, by any government authority or found by the committee appraising such projects. The appraisal committee will assess whether the construction or expansion carried out in violation of the norms can “run sustainably” with “environmental safeguards.” Those that will be regularised will have to pay a late fee for violating norms.“The draft does clarify that closure orders can be issued for any project that are found in violation of the notification. The cognizance is possible if this is found during appraisal of an application. While this is important, it normalizes the occurrence of violations in the first place and is contradictory with the idea of “prior environmental clearance” which is the premise an impact assessment process rests on,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.The draft increases the validity of the environment clearances. The draft provides environment clearance validity for 50 years for mining projects, against 30 years in the present notification; 15 years from river valley projects against 10 years.Project proponents will have to submit environment clearance compliance reports once a year against every six months in the current system. The draft also states that no fresh studies by EAC should be asked for unless “new facts” come to the notice and it becomes “inevitable” to seek additional studies. This completely undermines the public consultation process, as well as the expert inputs of the ministry’s own committees, experts said. The draft can be read on environment ministry’s Parivesh website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-extends-time-for-public-comments-on-environment-impact-regulation/story-DTfA8CWXqa6Z6UyuTjRcyM.html

This happened because several ambulance drivers reportedly refused to enter the village over fear of contracting infection.According to Harekrushna Ojha, a resident of Bainsiria village of Bari block in Jajpur district, hos wife went into labour on Wednesday morning. He called the 108 helpline that manages the Odisha emergency ambulance system to take her to the nearest community health centre 15 km away for delivery. But as soon as the ambulance drivers were told about the village, they refused to pick up the expectant mother, said Ojha.“Soon after my wife complained of labour pains, my younger brother called up 108 helpline for sending an ambulance. But each time, the drivers straightaway refused saying they would enter a Covid-19 village as couple of positive cases were reported from here last month. For over an hour and half not a single ambulance was ready to come,” said Ojha, who sought the help of the sarpanch. However, he too pleaded helplessness in the matter.Finding no other way, Ojha put his wife Kanaklata on a wooden trolley to an ambulance which was waiting about two kilometres away. Ojha’s mother was holding the woman while his brother pulled the trolley.ASHA worker Rina, who had come to assist the pregnant woman, then tried one last time, but the ambulance driver did not enter the village.“We could not lose any time as a woman delivers maximum within an hour of onset of labour. It was risky taking a pregnant woman on a trolley, but we had no other way. The situation was really desparate,” said Rina.District collector Ranjan Das did not comment on the incident. Jajpur has now turned out to be a Covid-19 hotspot in Odisha with 55 positive cases, the highest in the state, followed by Khurda district with 47 cases.On Monday, the fears over Covid-19 had forced a family in Balasore district to bury the head of their family after villagers refused to help them in cremation suspecting that the man had died of the coronavirus disease. Last month, a 60-year-old cancer patient in coastal Odisha town of Balasore had to spend over eight hours outside his rented home after the landlord refused to let him and his family enter the house as he had gone to a hospital in Bhubaneswar, a Covid-19 hotspot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-woman-taken-on-trolley-family-claims-ambulance-refused-to-enter-village-due-to-covid-19-fear/story-d49RgCRjNaqUVZcInoZsxJ.html

That’s why, since our mids are connected, we don’t feel the lack of physical presence. It’s a pleasure to be amongst you, but the situation now is not conducive. That’s why, be it from afar and through the medium of technology, I got the opportunity to speak to you and I’m happy about that.During this difficult time of coronavirus lockdown, there are several people around us who are working 24 hours to help others, to maintain law and order, to cure infected persons and to maintain cleanliness, by sacrificing their own comforts. All such people deserve appreciation and honour.Today, there is a mood of distress in the world. At this time, teachings of Lord Buddha become all the more relevant. He said that people must continuously strive to overcome difficult situations to wriggle out of them. To stop after getting tired is not any alternative.The four truths given by Lord Buddha namely compassion, mercy, equanimity towards pleasure and pain, and accepting everything as it is have been our constant inspiration. Even today, you can see that without any selfishness and discrimination, India is standing strongly behind anyone on the crisis, in the country and anywhere in the world.This is the reason why many ountries remembered India in these times of crisis and India left no stone unturned in extending help. While making every possible effort to save every countryman, India is also sincerely fulfilling its global obligations.Buddha is the symbol of both realisation of India and self-realisation of India. With this self-realisation, India is working in the interest of the world and would continue doing so for the entire humanity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buddha-is-the-symbol-of-india-s-self-realisation-top-quotes-from-pm-modi-s-buddha-purnima-address/story-6nrmqln6fzTjhJNd4vjQ5N.html

A voluntary licence is where a generics drug manufacturer is given permission by the patent holder to make a drug -- for a consideration. India is one of the world’s top generics hubs.“The company is negotiating long-term voluntary licenses with several generic drugmakers in India and Pakistan to produce remdesivir for developing countries. Gilead will provide technology transfers to facilitate this production. Finally, the company is in active discussions with the Medicines Patent Pool, which Gilead has partnered with for many years, to license remdesivir for developing countries,” said Gilead Sciences in a statement released on Wednesday.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), during a pandemic, local manufacturers can start production of a patented drug under certain conditions.“Such drugs can be generically manufactured after paying a royalty amount to the patent holder. There are certain provisions during a pandemic that can be made use of to manufacture the drug, if required,” Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, department of epidemiology and communicable disease, ICMR, had said in one of the media briefings.His reference was probably to a compulsory licence.India is part of the World Health Organisation’s Solidarity Trials for the cure of Covid-19 and has received 1000 doses of the drug for testing.The Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) also has synthesised the key starting materials for remdesivir, which the first step to develop the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a drug.Gilead is also in advanced discussions with Unicef to utilize their extensive experience providing medicines to low- and middle income countries during emergency and humanitarian crises to deliver remdesivir using its well-established distribution networks, to further facilitate access in developing countries during this acute health crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-us-firm-gilead-in-talks-with-indian-drug-companies-to-produce-remdesivir/story-HrEP1knMCBBgfrwAy8QMqL.html

07-05-2020||India||In meet with labour ministry, trade unions say ‘cannot hold migrants captive’||Representatives of trade union organisations on Wednesday held a meeting with Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar via video conferencing and appealed against the use of coercion to stop migrants workers from returning to their homes, sought more trains for them to do so amid the Covid-19 crisis and incentives for their return to their host states.“They [workers] should be provided incentives to return to host states such as cash, electronic passes, free train tickets etc. You cannot hold them captive,” said CK Saji Narayanan, the head of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s labour wing, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh. Narayanan’s comments came a day after Karnataka withdrew a request sent to the Railways to provide trains to ferry migrants from the state back to their homes towns. The development came after representatives from the construction industry met chief minister BS Yediyurappa and expressed concerns about labour shortage if the migrants went back. Over 50,000 people had registered to go back to Bihar alone. The Centre has made an exception for the stranded people and allowed them to travel even as inter-state borders remain closed as part of the national lockdown.At the meeting with Gangwar, the BMS opposed the extension of working hours at factories in several states, saying it violated International Labour Organization conventions and labour laws. “Many are fleeing due to lack of proper treatment. Industrial associations, trade unions, government officials and local elected representatives should collectively undertake a campaign to retain labour at the workplaces...,” Narayanan said. He urged the ministry to ask states to stop pay cuts, and frame regulations and guidelines on automation, robotics etc.The All India Trade Union Congress demanded sufficient trains for workers to return to their home states and improvement in ration distribution. “We asked for the implementation of the ministry’s own advisories in regard to payment of wages, no retrenchment...,” AITUC general secretary Amarjeet Kaur said in a statement after the meeting.As per a statement issued by the ministry, Gangwar pointed out that there is a need to find solutions to the challenges for workers.

07-05-2020||India||MHA tells Bengal to open Bangladesh access||The Centre on Wednesday came down hard on the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal for not allowing movement of goods traffic through border crossings between India and Bangladesh -- a move that it said could jeopardize India’s international commitments to the neighbouring country.In a letter to West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla stated that “the unilateral action on the part of government of West Bengal to stop the cross land border movement of essential goods would have larger implications for the Indian government with regard to its legally binding international commitments.”Bhalla told that by doing so, West Bengal was not just violating the ministry of home affairs’ orders under Disaster Management Act but also Articles 253, 256 and 257 of the Constitution of India. Article 253 of the Constitution deals with the legislation for giving effect to international agreements while articles 256 and 257 give powers to the Centre for issuing directions to the state.“It has been reported that goods traffic through border crossings between India and Bangladesh, falling in West Bengal, has still not resumed. As a result, a large number of trucks carrying essential supplies, bound for Bangladesh, are stranded at different border crossing points,” the home secretary wrote in his letter.“A number of drivers of such vehicles, while returning from Bangladesh, have also not been allowed to cross the border, and are stranded in Bangladesh,” Bhalla added. He reminded the state government of lockdown measures issued on May 1 according to which no state/union territory shall stop movement of cargo for cross-border land trade under treaties with neighbouring countries. He directed the Bengal chief secretary to allow access land border transportation through all Indo-Bangladesh borders “without any further delay” and send the report by Wednesday.The state, however, maintained that it was following all norms. “We have been adhering to all norms of lockdown and social distancing. In case of Petrapole (a land port at the Bangladesh border) there has been some public issue. We will address the issue in due time after careful consideration of all the aspects involved,” said Alapan Bandopadhyay, state home secretary.The Centre also slammed the state government for violating lockdown instructions and social distancing norms, based on the findings of Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCT), as instances of people openly playing cricket or football, bathing in rivers and overcrowding in bazaars (markets) have come to its notice. The state on Wednesday reported 112 new cases taking the tally to over 1450 and four deaths||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-tells-bengal-to-open-bangladesh-access/story-BY8x89zRBAMcxli3DgGvCM.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Labour ministry helplines get over 10,000 distress calls||“We have run out of food. Can you please ask someone to come and help us?’’ This was the SOS call that Suraj Pal, a factory worker from Faridabad, placed to the labour helpline on Tuesday. Pal and six of his associates have been stuck in an aluminium factory in the industrial hub ever since the lockdown started in late March. This is the second time they are running out of food. It happened last month, prompting a similar SOS call -- and they managed to get some relief. “My employer isn’t taking calls any more,’’ Suraj Pal told HT. “We tried to leave but the police says that we cannot go without proper registration. Please, can you ask them to send us some food as we have run out?. Or maybe they can take us home to Bareilly?”Pal’s call is just one of around 10,500 calls that the labour ministry’s 20 helplines have received since April 17. The helplines are located across 31 states and manned by 75 senior officers. None of the officers is trained to deal with distress calls, but as a majority of the calls is about hunger and helplessness, they’ve all had to learn to tackle these emergencies. “These helplines were actually started to help with wage issues and provident funds but 60% of the calls are in the state’s jurisdictions. So we get in touch with local authorities and get them to organise help for the callers,’’ said the official coordinating the helplines requesting anonymity. Suraj Pal’s call threw the officials because even though food was an issue being handled by state and local officials, they knew it was too urgent to wait. “We are trying to get someone to get food to them urgently.’’ “While most of the distress calls are about being removed from their jobs or not getting wages, there are also many who call for help with recharging (topping up) their phones,’’ said the official, adding that stranded workers needed it to communicate with their family.Ever since the ministry of home affairs announced trains to ferry stranded persons, that’s become the main theme of calls. “My phone hasn’t stopped ringing,’’ said regional labour commissioner in Telengana, VT Thomas, who is managing a helpline. “Labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand all want to go home, we tell them to either contact the deputy labour commissioner or the local police official.”Interestingly, some have also tried to use the helpline as an employment exchange. “Our Port Blair office received a call from a contractor,he asked if we could put him in touch with stranded labourers because one particular factory wanted to reopen,” said an official who asked not to be named. “We put him in touch with the district administration and that factory also opened.”Regarding calls about wages, the official cited above said we reach out to the employers and tell them they can’t stop wages because it is illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-labour-ministry-helplines-get-over-10-000-distress-calls/story-hMoMRSY9QaunXsWNpCIaUN.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Migrants bitter about being forced to work against their wishes||Anger and disappointment coursed through the migrant worker population in Karnataka a day after the state cancelled special trains to take the labourers home even as other states insisted they had no intention of following suit.The controversial late-night decision also sparked a political tussle with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pointing out the economic benefits of workers staying back and the Congress alleging the stoppage of trains was a violation of human rights.The state, which had earlier sent six trains of workers to Bhubaneswar, Patna and Hatia, wrote to the Railways on Tuesday night withdrawing its request for additional trains. The decision came after a meeting of chief minister BS Yediyurappa with construction industry representatives, who expressed concern that work will grind to a halt if the labourers left the state.The surprise move sent shockwaves through the state’s migrant population.“I want to see my family including my two children, I don’t want to work here,” said 36- year-old Vinod Kumar, who hails from Bihar and worked as a steel rod bender in a factory in Bengaluru. “I don’t want the food or money or anything else they are providing. I just want to go back and be with my family.”The government started running the single-destination, no-stops Shramik Special trains on May 1 and more than 100,000 migrants have been ferried in 122 trains since, the railways ministry said. Another 42 trains ran on Wednesday.Gujarat has sent the maximum number of such trains (25) to other states, while Bihar has received the most (13). A train usually has 24 coaches with each carrying a little over 50 passengers in place of 72. These trains run for distances of over 500 km with at least 90% occupancy.Yediyurappa defended his decision at a press briefing where he announced a ₹1,610 crore economic stimulus package. “We have requested them [the workers] to stay back as economic activity has restarted and we have provided them all the facilities they have asked for.” The CM also pointed out that 100,000 people had been allowed to travel on 3,500 state government bus trips for inter-district movement.Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya called it a “bold and necessary move”.“It will help migrant labourers who came here with hopes of a better life to restart their dreams. Also it will kickstart economic activities full throttle. Karnataka will emerge out of this stronger!”But the Congress didn’t agree.Former minister Priyank Kharge said anybody who wants to go should be allowed and questioned whether the migrants were being treated as bonded labour. State Congress chief DK Shivakumar said the government should have tried to win over the hearts and minds of the migrants rather than cancelling trains and trying to hold them captive. “But this is a government which cannot see, cannot hear and doesn’t have a heart,” he added.A senior state government official defended the move, saying the workers would have been sent to 14-day quarantine once they reached their destination. “Several states have been reluctant to accept them. Here they can get back to a normal life…we are paying ₹5,000 for all registered construction workers.”In neighbouring Telangana, the government said it would continue to send back workers, at least 500,000 of whom are stranded in the state. On Wednesday morning, three trains carrying 4,000 labourers left the state.“We have made arrangements for 40 special trains every day for one week for these migrant labourers, but their respective states requested us to go slow,” said Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. However, the real estate industry in Hyderabad expressed apprehension at the departure of the workers.“More than 80% of the workforce in real estate sector comprises migrant workers, particularly from Bihar, Jharkhand, UP, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. This en-masse exodus of these workers will definitely hamper projects,” said V Rajasekhar Reddy, general secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), Telangana chapter.Despite industry concerns, a number of other states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh said they won’t stop trains.“If the governments in those states, where our Andhra workers are held up, are not showing interest in making arrangements for their transport, the AP government itself will provide transport facility to bring them back,” chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said on Wednesday.Madhya Pradesh additional chief secretary ICP Keshri said all workers from the state will be brought back and arrangements were being made. Jharkhand transport secretary K Ravi Kumar said a total of 10,054 people including 2,146 students have arrived in Jharkhand on 12 special trains.“We are expecting the rush to continue for at least a week,” Kumar said.In Bihar, where close to 15,000 migrants and students returned on Wednesday by 13 trains from five states, the officials said stiff challenges lay ahead. “We have entered a challenging phase, with more people returning to their hometowns. The real test starts now,” said a senior state government official who declined to be named.(With inputs from other state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-migrants-bitter-about-being-forced-to-work-against-their-wishes/story-VyTF0RgKDdUmauersoaVYO.html
07-05-2020||India||Open the mind locks||The Instagram group Bois Locker Room was outed on May 3 and has since, caused immense outrage on the internet. The private messaging group comprised a number of young boys from South Delhi who would share pictures of girls — many underage — on the group, and speak in a derogatory manner about the girls sharing explicit details and even private pictures of the girls. The worst came when a few of the boys issued rape threats to a couple of girls who exposed them and their chat group. Legally, a suo moto cognizance has been taken by Delhi Commission for Women against these boys, however keeping legalities aside, experts believe that the problem is much deeper and needs more than just stricter laws or implementation of existing ones to do away with such cases. “A lot of factors go into developing such behavioural traits in young men. The portrayal of women in media, the social environment that these boys grow up in, and of course, the fact that when you are a teenager, your body develops faster than your brain. Hence, teenagers don’t think their actions through. So, these acts are a result of a mix of hormones, neurodevelopmental changes and your environment where you are living,” says Advaita Nigudkar, consultant psychologist. 18-yr-old admin of lewd chat room held; 5 more members identifiedhttps://t.co/U9FTIABFvu pic.twitter.com/gKsGrt9ldyLaw and orderSunaina Kanojia, Officer on special duty, Institute of Cyber Security and Law, Delhi University, says that one should be careful of the video calls one engages in since “virtual contact has increased due to the lockdown”. “Many cases that have been reported to us at DU involve a cyber-breach of a student’s personal photo or information by known sources like partners, friends etc. Don’t share personal or intimate photos or videos with anyone at all, even if you know them well. Live chats and videos can also be taped and one must always be mindful of this,” she says. Anyesh Roy, DCP CyPAD (Cyber Prevention, Awareness and Detection Centre), adds that it is pertinent for youngsters to seek help from parents if they get into something because of peer pressure and realise it is wrong. “Lack of communication between children, and parents or teachers, can prevent children from opening up. Do not for a moment think you can get away after indulging in unlawful cyber activity as digital prints are always left behind on the devices used and many other platforms,” warns Roy.  Shubham Singh, Cyber Expert, who helped unearth all the bois locker room group participants’ information and contact details, says, “If anyone has been a victim of cyber crime, they should immediately share that with their parents or friends without hesitating. In case of cyber breaches, also contact your local police station or cyber cell. Update privacy settings on your social media accounts. Remember that you can also report anonymously about any kind of crime on the official government cyber crime website.”  #boyslockerroom a telling tale of how toxic masculinity starts young! Underage boys gleefully planning how to rape & gangrape minor girls. Parents & teachers must address this with those Kids.. Not enough to ‘hang rapists’ .. we must attack the mentality that creates rapists! https://t.co/Jw4cFQ9gXMKavita Mungi, mental health counselor, believes that women need to be made aware of their rights, and everyone should be educated about cyber exploitation, sexting, defamation etc. “We definitely need stricter laws as it will have a strong impact as a deterrent to such deviant behaviour. Women should be aware of the existence of cyber crime cells that they can report to,” she says. Alternatively, Sadaf Vidha, therapist and researcher, says that the problem does not solely lie with the laws. “We cannot just depend on punishment and the legal system as a resolution for sexual crimes. We have to start early with new parents and young boys to break down concepts of gender and sexuality. We need multiple-level interventions, gender sexuality education at each and every level — for adults, kids, and very young kids. The automatic process that we have been following of getting married and having children needs to stop. It has to be a mindful decision to become a parent and then one needs to explain the concepts of body sexuality and gender to kids. There are countries that have extensive programmes like that such as Malaysia and Finland. So, our government needs to look into that,” says Vidha. How can parents help?Vidha says that even though, we may have convinced ourselves that we live in a modern society, this incident has shown that we have in fact, just become very good at covering up our sexism instead of getting rid of it altogether. “We need to talk about everyday sexism and patriarchy with our kids which is not happening. We may be equipping our girls more to achieve more in their career, but we have still not broken down emotions, femininity and body to boys. We are also not talking to our kids about how our bodies can be misused by people. The problem is the monster myth which says that there is one bad man or few bad men out there and the rest of us are okay. According to the monster myth, we do not take accountability as a society that at some level we are all contributing to rape culture. Parents also believe that benign sexism and patriarchy that we follow at home is okay as long as somebody doesn’t become a ‘monster’ but this is how monsters are made,” adds Vidha.  With expert @rakshit.tandon !A post shared by  Richa Chadha (@therichachadha) on May 6, 2020 at 9:10am PDTDos and DontsIf a minor is making a profile on social media it is advised that the profile be monitored actively by the parent or guardianBe mindful of the consequences of sharing any personal information or photograph on an online space as it can be downloaded and replicated in minutesBe aware that people who are part of various groups that are indulging in unlawful activities, even if they are inactive member will be liable to legal actionSchool and parents must also talk to children about the risks of being cyber bullied or peer pressured in to unlawful cyber activities.

He got loads of “love and warmth” from his fans and friends.Shashank says, “Writing is a creative process and gives you depth in life. Writing involves imagination and visualization.” His recent poem sends a strong message. In the midst of the corona outbreak, there have been communal debates in the media, and Shashank’s poem talks about unity in diversity. “It is indeed disturbing. Of late, in the media, there has been so much focus on communal news. Why are we not discussing the important things such as food, shelter, and transportation for the needy. Nowadays, I don’t feel the need to be updated on the latest situation, and that makes me peaceful. Other than a couple of media personnel, who are not biased, everything else is a big circus out there.”Talking about his love for poetry and how it all started, Vyas says, “It all started in 2009 when I lost my mother and I wasn’t getting any work. As there was a lot of time on hand, I would go to the beach and pen down my thoughts. Those poems are still with me in my diary. Later, I got busy with my professional life and writing took a backseat. And now, when I have time, I thought of writing again. With time, we also mature in our thoughts and take inspiration from our experience.

07-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Here’s how we should assess our progress in the fight against the spread of Covid-19.On May 5, there were 2,991 new cases of Covid-19 in India. I’ve explained previously that this doesn’t mean all 2,991 cases were discovered in the preceding 24 hours – just that the numbers were being reported in that period. Of these, 1,942 were from three states -- Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. Without these three states, the number would have been 1,049.On May 4, there were 3,861 new cases, but excluding Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, there were 1,391.The corresponding number on May 3 was 1,298. On May 2, it was 1,298 again. And on May 1, it was 827.So, the numbers, arranged in sequence (most recent first) are: 1049, 1391, 1298, 1298, and 827. In the preceding five days, it was 822, 678, 832, 752, and 877.I’ve done this exercise with three states, but you could, say, exclude three more (I’d pick West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Delhi). On May 5, the number would then be 651. On May 4, 600.Is there a pattern to these numbers? What would happen if we were to leave out these six states since, say, April 1?I asked Jamie Mullick, who has been in charge of the HT Covid-19 dashboard, and he sent me two charts reproduced along with this piece (Charts 1 and 2). One was the number of new cases excluding the six states since April 1 (with a helpful five-day average line thrown in for reference and analysis). Another was a straight comparison of the number of new cases in these six states, and in the rest of India since April 1. Two things are clear from this.One, these six states have driven the increase in the daily number of cases in India. Without them, the increase wouldn’t be as sharp.But, and this is the second reading, the number of cases in the rest of India, especially as shown by the five-day average, is still rising. It seemed to be flattening towards the end of April, but it has started climbing again, albeit gradually, in May.It isn’t difficult to see why – Punjab and Rajasthan have seen new hot spots emerge in the past week. If we increase the scope of the analysis from six states to eight (to be excluded), then the curve appears to be flattening (Chart 3). Is that reason for cheer?Yes, and no.Yes, because it shows that apart from these eight states, the rest of India appears to have gotten the better of Covid-19. No, because there will always be new hot spots that emerge.But there are two very important learnings that emerge from this iterative exercise.The first is that containment and zoning are actually good approaches to dealing with Covid-19 given the geographical concentration of cases. This has been known since Wuhan, and how the Chinese dealt with it, but merits repetition.The second is that, as evident from the numbers coming out of Delhi and Tamil Nadu, no state can afford to lower its guard. Indeed, the spike in cases in Chennai over the past week can be directly attributed to the folly of the administration in announcing a hard lockdown for four days between April 26 and April 29. People rushed to stock up, especially to the large vegetable market of Koyambedu in Chennai, and many of the cases that have emerged over the past week have been traced back to that market.If, two weeks from now, Chart 1 (the number of new cases excluding the six states) shows a flattening or flattened curve, and Chart 2 (the number of new cases excluding the eight states) continues to show a downward curve, then it would be reason for cheer (and to redo the graphs with, say, only three states excluded).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-F0iEdLePI9KzmkLLA0WlsI.html

Every five years, doctors need to renew their licences to practice. As per norms, doctors need to earn 30 credit points over a period of five years by attending conferences and seminars. Those who fail to score the 30 points are not eligible to renew their licence. Thus, they get disqualified from medical practice. “Registered medical practitioners are at the forefront of the war against coronavirus and not only are they facing the daunting task of handling patients, they are also fighting to keep their own worries and emotional stress at bay. They are selfless, hardworking and diligent individuals who save lives on a daily basis. The noble profession of a doctor takes some serious dedication and sacrifice,” reads the circular of MMC issued on April 29. To encourage doctors to actively participate in the struggle against Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19, MMC will grant two credit points per day up to a maximum of 10 to doctors. They have divided the doctors into three types—- those who are serving in government hospitals or institutions, doctors working in private hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients and medical practitioners who are participating in fever, community, mobile clinics primarily for the diagnosis of patients.According to MMC, they have taken the decision to encourage doctors to come forward for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Doctors with specialisation in forensic science, psychiatry, community medicine, orthopaedics among others may not be directly involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients but can help in screening patients and providing basic care to asymptomatic patients in Covid Care Centres. “By serving the nation during the time of the pandemic, doctors can gain points which will help them to renew their medical licences. This is a form of a reward for the Covid-19 frontliners. We have already extended the certificate renewal time of the doctors by three months,” Dr Shivkumar Utture, president of MMC said. The doctors can claim the Covid certificate from deans, district collectors, corporation health officers or civil surgeons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mmc-to-award-doctors-working-with-covid-19-patients-credit-points-to-renew-licence/story-bKVk9EsszwtpSYQlV56mAP.html
07-05-2020||India||French researcher flags Aarogya flaws, govt denies||The Union government’s Aarogya Setu application has vulnerabilities that could compromise the identity and movement of the millions of Indians who use it, according to a French computer researcher who posted a technical analysis of the flaws on Wednesday, and ostensibly illustrated how he could determine whether someone reported being infected at sensitive locations such as Parliament.The developers of the application dismissed the findings as a risk and said it was part of the application’s design that is meant to allow users to determine who in their vicinity is unwell, infected or healthy. But the defence that was dismissed by the Frenchman – who goes by the nom de guerre of Elliot Alderson --- and a second cyber expert HT spoke to.The government also said the platform is “absolutely robust, safe and secure”. “This is a technological invention of India -- ministry of electronics and information technology, our scientists, NIC, Niti Aayog and some private (entities) -- whereby it is a perfectly accountable platform to help in the fight against COVID-19,” Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told PTI.The posts by Alderson add to the misgivings expressed by privacy experts around apps such as Aarogya Setu, which has been made mandatory for an increasing number of Indians in recent days as officials push it as a crucial tool to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.According to Alderson, the application’s location functionality can be paired with a technique called triangulation, which could allow anyone who can manipulate the programme at a technical level to determine who is infected in a specific, 1-metre area.Triangulation refers to the technique of using multiple data points to zero in on a precise information or location that is otherwise available on a more vague scale. “Triangulation is location tracking via multiple calls to the API (a component of the app) where at every iteration, a lower value is chosen. Say the first call could be 5 KM and then the next call would be 1 KM and so on,” said cyber security researcher Anand V.This was possible because apps can be reverse engineered and modified to extract data that otherwise should be inaccessible. “He used a reverse engineering tool called Frida to modify the App and feed the locations via a script,” said Anand, adding that in this manner, the entire app can be rewritten to create an imitation.“What Elliot has done is to create a modified Aarogya Setu app that simply did what it is not supposed to do. And the developers could not detect it unless he reported it,” said Anand, adding: “Imagine ISI and others doing exactly the same thing without reporting it.”The contention by the experts is that this presented a particular risk to Indians, who can potentially be targeted by domestic as well as foreign cyber criminals. “The mandatory nature of the app has already created a thriving mod industry,” Anand said.On April 30, security agencies warned army paramilitary troops against an Aarogya Setu imitation that was being spread to steal sensitive data, news agency PTI reported quoting officials.MyGov CEO Abhishek Singh told HT that the concerns raised by Alderson are incorrect and of 90 million users, only the data of 0.05% users are on the server. “The app only takes basic data, and as specified in the privacy policy, all personal data is collected only once and is encrypted, after which a device ID is created. Subsequent to that, all interactions happen only with the device ID,” Singh said.According to Anand, the vulnerability disclosed on Wednesday was one of the core issues with the Aarogya Setu: “Location collection is meaningless. It is a privacy nightmare and today’s revelations showed precisely why,” he said.A second issue is that the Aarogya Setu uses “static ID” to store contact history. This refers to how the programme logs a close contact between two people. If person A and person B come close enough for the infection to spread between them, the app remembers the devices by using randomly generated identifiers. This identifier does not change, which means if someone can access these static IDs, they track the health status of the person.“Any static ID that you obtain can be used to figure out what happened to the person behind the static ID,” said Anand. Alderson, in a post on Tuesday, described how he was able to break into the Aarogya Setu and access any file used by the app, which would include those that store such static IDs.A third issue, Anand added, was that the code was not open source, which means its functionalities and vulnerabilities cannot be tested. “Make it open source to create trust and don’t bait and switch to something else that will last long after the pandemic is gone,” he said.An official from the information and technology ministry said none of the revelations indicated Aarogya Setu had been hacked. “There has been no sort of hacking or breach of privacy in the Aarogya Setu. The allegations are based on amateur attempts by changing location and data correlation to portray it as hacking. The app would have shown similar data to anyone at a particular location. Do not indulge in petty attempts to attract attention while we are in the midst of a pandemic. Ethics are important,” said this official, asking not to be named.Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said Alderson pointed out that the flaws outlined by Rahul Gandhi were absolutely correct. The problems, Surjewala added, were spread over three areas: that the Aarogya Setu’s data collection violated the right to privacy, that it was not developed by the government’s engineers and data was stored on foreign servers and that human control in the backend could manipulate the health status of an individual||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-researcher-flags-aarogya-flaws-govt-denies/story-Ea0mGXS3NWRvlfYSBJJYaK.html
07-05-2020||India||Top Hizbul commander Riyaz Naikoo killed in encounter||Riyaz Naikoo, 35, a top terrorist of the Hizbul Mujahideen, was killed in an encounter with security forces at his village in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, officials said on Wednesday, announcing a major breakthrough that is expected to weaken the home-grown terror group significantly. Naikoo, who carried a Rs 12 lakh reward on his head, was among four militants killed in Pulwama after security forces launched three separate, coordinated operations in a 25km radius on Tuesday night and early Wednesday after inputs that the Hizbul operational commander could be hiding in the area. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that according to inputs Naikoo was visiting his family on Tuesday; he is believed to have stayed overnight at a hideout in Awantipora’s Gulzarpora Beighpora village. Naikoo, also known as Zubair ul Islam and Bin Qasim, who emerged as the face of the Hizbul in the Valley and propagated radicalism through audio and video messages on social media — much like his predecessor Burhan Wani — and another terrorist were shot dead after a five-hour gunfight.According to a statement by the police, Naikoo was involved in the killings of civilians including truck drivers and policemen. Among Kashmir’s new generation of terrorists, he effectively used the social media for recruitment. The people familiar with the matter said that in June, he would have completed eight years as a terrorist with the Hizbul Mujahideen. The people added that the Kashmir Police’s anti-militancy unit, Special Operations Group, knew he was going to be in the village and also that he was going to spend the night there. Late on Tuesday itself, a contingent of J&K Police and troopers from the 21 Rashtriya Rifles surrounded the village. They launched their operation in the early hours of Wednesday. A firefight ensued. When it was over, the terrorist and his associate were found in the bunker. Both died of gunshot wounds. “It is a major success for the security forces in Kashmir,” a senior J&K police officer said on condition of anonymity. The police statement said Naikoo was involved in the killing of a panchayat sarpanch’s father, Haji Ghulan Mohd Dar, in 2014, that of head constable Ashiq Hussain Mir, and more recently, the murder of migrant workers and truck drivers. Authorities suspended mobile internet and SMS services soon after the encounter, fearing the circulation of provocative messages following the death of the local terrorist leader and an overall deterioration in law and order situation. Additional security forces were deployed in the four districts of Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag, considered the hotbed of militancy.After the July 2016 encounter killing of Hizbul leader Wani, a resident of Tral area in Pulwama, stone-pelting mobs descended on streets and clashed with security forces, resulting in the deaths of 75 civilians and two law enforcement personnel in four months in one of the most turbulent phases in militancy in Kashmir, according to official data. But several media reports put the death toll much higher. Officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Naikoo’s body might not be handed over to his family and could be buried in another district to avoid crowds and to ensure adherence to social distancing norms in place due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The successful operation came just four days after the killing of five security men, including the Commanding Officer of a Rashtriya Rifles battalion and a Major, during an encounter in north Kashmir’s Handwara. Two terrorists of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, too, were killed in the gunfight.Since March 21, over 30 terrorists have been killed in 15 gun battles across the Valley. Twenty security personnel lost their lives in these encounters.A police spokesperson confirmed the killing of Naikoo, though the army said it will not reveal the names of those gunned down.Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said: “The security forces are the heroes who eliminated four terrorists in 24 hours. We shall not glorify the terrorists by releasing their names.” Two more terrorists were killed in Sharali Khrew, 12km from Naikoo’s village, a senior police officer who was part of the operation said, requesting anonymity. An overground worker was arrested at the third operation site, Sathura Tral. Officials said the operation to track down Naikoo began at least two days ago. The army and the police even brought earth-digging equipment, including four JCB machines, to Naikoo’s village after inputs that the wanted terrorist could be using an underground hideout, according to villagers.Soon after the news of the operation surfaced, youngsters started pelting stones at security forces. Eleven people were injured in the scuffle.As security forces surrounded six-seven houses in the village, they came under fire from Naikoo and his associate. An encounter ensued, and both the terrorists were shot dead. The other militant killed with Naikoo was believed to be Adil Ahmed of Panzan village in Pulwama district. He was active for the past two years. His identity was not confirmed by the police or government authorities who also chose not to divulge details of the two others killed on Wednesday.Experts said the operation could be a major boost for security forces. “Leadership decapitation is always a big blow to terror organisations. There is both a physical dimension of an organisation suddenly losing someone who was in control and also the psychological dimension of the effect on morale and having to find a replacement,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-hizb-commander-riyaz-naikoo-killed-in-encounter/story-PZKYBjj7pFDO0AwqpoLp3O.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: 50,000 cases and counting, fresh spikes in urban centres||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the country crossed 50,000 on Wednesday, nearly doubling over the course of 11 days, even as limited reopening of businesses made necessary by a sluggish economy triggered worries of another wave of the contagion across hot spots.The spread of the infectious disease has largely been pushed by urban hot spots in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi, the three worst-hit states. On Wednesday, 3,490 new Covid-19 cases were diagnosed and 98 more deaths from the disease were reported, taking the total tally to 52,967 and fatalities to 1,711.The latest 10,000 infections were recorded in three days, two fewer than it took for the tally to go from about 30,000 to 40,000. It took seven days for the cases to climb from 20,000 to 30,000. India recorded its first 10,000 Covid-19 cases in nearly 43 days, with a wave of infections beginning in March after three isolated cases were first reported in Kerala in January. The disease’s doubling rate, which is defined as the average period it takes for a twofold rise, decreased from 11.5 days on May 3 – the cases hit 40,000 on that day – to 10.3 on Wednesday, the first time the figure has significantly reduced during the lockdown. The doubling rate -- which is calculated over a period of last seven days -- was four days at the beginning of April. Experts say the peak of the outbreak is yet to come. Some projections show the peak for the current wave of cases could hit in four-six weeks, with studies expecting another spurt in winter this year.On Wednesday, the number of infections in Delhi rose to 5,532 after 428 new cases were reported. On average, India has reported 2,900 cases over the last five days. The corresponding numbers for the previous five days and those before that were 1,731 and 1,547. The data, which is based on official figures from states, shows that more than a third of the total cases have been reported over the past week.Maharashtra reported 1,233 new cases and 34 more deaths during the day and its overall tally was 16,758. Of these, 10,527 cases – about a fifth of the national tally – have been reported in Mumbai alone. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said he will hold a meeting with Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to discuss the worsening situation in the state.“The situation in Maharashtra is certainly a matter of concern right now as 34 out of 36 districts are affected by Covid-19… Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nagpur, Nashik, Aurangabad, Solapur, among the 34 districts are a cause of concern for us,” the minister said at a news briefing, adding that a team from the Centre will provide further help to the state.Maharashtra is followed by Gujarat, which recorded 6,625 cases till Wednesday.The surge of Covid-19 continued in Tamil Nadu as the state recorded its biggest single-day jump of 771 cases, the majority of them linked to the hot spot of a market in Koyambedu. The total infections in the state stood at 4,829.Experts fear India’s tally may increase as the government plans to bring back a large number of Indians stranded abroad.In the first week of a massive air operation expected to begin on Friday, 64 flights will bring 15,000 Indian citizens home from 12 countries. All those who travel back have to pay for their tickets, undergo screening and quarantine after landing. The navy has already kicked off one leg of the evacuation exercise by dispatching two warships to the Maldives.The Union government has maintained that the country is on the right path in controlling the infections. While experts have praised India’s action in enforcing a nationwide lockdown on March 25, they say the next few weeks will be crucial for the country to flatten its curve of infections.On Monday, the third phase of the nationwide lockdown, which allows considerable relaxations in low-risk areas, began after nearly 40 days of strict restrictions. Experts say that while the impact of the lockdown appeared to have relatively controlled the spread, the gains could get undermined if clusters were not contained effectively, and people not tested widely. The next few weeks will determine the country’s trajectory in managing the outbreak and preventing the health care infrastructure from being overrun.The number of samples tested for Covid-19 in India crossed a million on Saturday, up from 38,914 on April 1, which took the number of tests to almost 783 per million of the population. The health ministry expects testing to cross 100,000 tests a day soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-000-cases-and-counting-fresh-spikes-in-urban-centres/story-Q23ovgTu3J7k6m5MGfSVzL.html
07-05-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 scourge, Dharavi’s residents struggle to fight hunger||Besieged by Covid-19 infections, financially struck low by the lockdown and turned a containment zone, the people of Asia’s largest slum are now struggling to keep hunger at bay. Home to at least quarter of a million residents across communities, Dharavi -- spread across around 240 hectares of south-central Mumbai -- houses thousands of small-scale businesses and entrepreneurs from pottery to tailoring units, bakeries and leather goods makers. Within a month of recording its first case on April 1, the number of positive cases had increased to 407; by May 6 the total number of cases in Dharavi was 733, with 21 deaths reported.In the face of such adversity, a group of 10 young men -- all residents of Dharavi’s Rajiv Gandhi Nagar -- are trying to make sure that people do not go hungry. The group, which calls itself Dharavi Boys over social media platforms, consists of college students who pooled money to support a handful of families in dire need of food. Soon, donations began to pour in through their extended networks of friends, and two days ago, they set up a Feed Dharavi campaign on crowdfunding site, Ketto. Till date, they have been able to support at least 100 families. They have their own Twitter handle: @DharaviBoys, with 13 followers at present. Their feed, however, is replete with messages of thanks to those who have donated money for their initiative. On May 1, the day they set up the account, they tweeted:“The lockdown has been extended. For us, the news is clear: more days without work and food. We want YOU to reach out to the people of Dharavi. Please help our families with at least basic food supplies. #dharavi #mumbai #india #COVID19 #corona #coronavirusindia”Stanley Anto, a social worker based in Kalamboli, Navi Mumbai, offered support to the group; within a day of setting up the account on Twitter, they also released a poster: “For as little as Rs. 1720, you can help us provide at least a month’s supply of food rations to a needy family. Please reach out to us if you can help!” Less than a week old, the feed regularly posts the contributions it has received, as well as the food rations it has distributed till now. A family living in the United States contributed Rs 40,000; another young boy in Pune broke his piggy bank to donate a sum. “We began this #feedDharavi campaign because when we saw families around us struggling, we just couldn’t sit back and watch. With the little we had, we only managed to feed a few.And we thought that it would be the end of our efforts. Then, Stanley sir came to our aid and helped us feed more families. And just like us, he wasn’t satisfied. So, he roped in his friends and family and together, we fed a few more,” their twitter feed read on May 4.  “Almost all people in these slums are daily wage earners and not going to work for so long means they have absolutely no money and hence cannot buy food. As young students, we thought of doing something for people from our own locality and hence decided to pool some resources,” said Vikas Jaiswar, a 24-year-old who graduated with an engineering degree from a Navi Mumbai college last year. The group, which claims to not belong to any political or religious organisation but a “informal group of youngsters” called the Friendly Life Youth Group, has tied up with local traders who arrange for the supplies which includes rice, flour, oil, salt and sugar. However, as the cases rise, the young men are also facing several difficulties in their work. “A couple from our locality who was providing similar help caught the virus and they are in the hospital. We are all very scared when we go out but we take adequate precautions and use masks, sanitisers and gloves in the whole process,” Jaiswar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-disease-scourge-dharavi-s-residents-struggle-to-fight-hunger/story-RAn9zyZFaKDxivf4792bZI.html
07-05-2020||India||Early quarantine, Covid-19 testing suggested for loss of taste, smell||A leading UK-based scientific journal’s editor-in-chief has urged front line health workers to see a sudden loss of smell and taste as early symptoms of mild coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to get quarantined and tested.“A proposal, actually a plea, from several doctors on the frontline of Covid-19. Those with a loss of smell should be advised to self-isolate and be tested. This simple manoeuvre could save lives,” tweeted Dr Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet.“Amnosia, or the loss of smell, and, with it, the altering of the sense of taste, is a well-established symptom of Covid-19, just like dry cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. There are very few conditions that lead to a sudden loss of smell, so it should be treated as an early sign, especially by people who risk exposure at the front lines and those who develop it with other Covid-19 symptoms,” said Dr Ajay Swaroop, chairman of the department of Ear, Nose, Throat, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi.Health workers are at high risk of infection both from undiagnosed cases and from patients in isolation wards.Last month, researchers from the University of California (UC) San Diego found Covid-19 patients who, with a loss of smell and taste, had a 10-fold higher risk of being hospitalised compared to those without any symptom.“Based on our study, if you have smell and taste loss, you are more than 10 times more likely to have Covid-19 infection than other causes of infection. The most common first sign of a Covid-19 infection remains fever, but fatigue and loss of smell and taste follow as other very common initial symptoms,” said Dr Carol Yan, an otolaryngologist, and head and neck surgeon at UC San Diego Health. The findings were published in the journal International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology on April 12.The San Diago study found that among those who reported loss of smell and taste, the loss was typically profound, not mild. The effect was, however, temporary, and both smell and taste were restored within two to four weeks of infection.“Among the Covid-19 patients with smell loss, more than 70 per cent had reported improvement of smell at the time of the survey and of those who hadn’t reported improvement, many had only been diagnosed recently,” said Yan.Covid-19 symptoms include fever, dry cough, tiredness, shortness of breath, or difficulty in breathing. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a sudden loss of taste or smell, along with either cough or shortness of breath, should be taken as a sign of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-quarantine-testing-suggested-for-loss-of-taste-smell/story-TTm4naxJ3tCtAkjPcHY2EN.html
07-05-2020||India||BMC ramps up infra to tackle Covid-19 cases spike in Mumbai||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is ramping up health care infrastructure to tackle a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the financial capital of Mumbai, the city which has so far accounted for a fifth of India’s cases, even as the authority’s worst-case projection pegs the likely number of infections in the city by the end of this month at 75,000. On Wednesday, the total number of cases in Mumbai stood at 10,714 cases, with 412 people dying of the infectious disease. There are 2,083 containment zones in the city.“The way to deal with this situation is to be prepared. We should not be taken by surprise at a later date, and caught scrambling for resources. Mumbai is better off overestimating the extent of the spread of Covid-19. To be prepared, we need hospital and quarantine beds to match our projected figures; we need more doctors to attend to patients being treated at hospitals, more nurses, personal protective equipment (PPE) for our front line staff,” a senior BMC officer said on condition of anonymity.The BMC is preparing to convert Mumbai’s large open spaces, playgrounds and sports complexes into temporary quarantine centres or Covid Care Centres (CCCs). The Mahalaxmi Race Course is set to house 200 isolation beds in its parking lot, the Mahim Nature Park will have 600 beds, the Richardson and Cruddas factory near JJ Hospital will have 200 beds, the Bandra Kurla Complex’s exhibition grounds are set to house 500 beds, the Nehru Science Centre will have 100 beds and the Andheri Sports complex will have 100 beds. With these, among others, the present capacity of 14,000 beds will be expanded to 34,000 beds, according to the official. The BMC is also readying 350 municipal schools to create an additional capacity of 35,000 beds.As approximately 60% of the total cases are asymptomatic, the city needs to ramp up the number of beds at CCCs alongside increasing the number of available hospital beds, experts say. “We have decided to move asymptomatic patients to CCCs so that the hospital beds they would otherwise have utilised can be made available for patients who need urgent and constant medical attention,” said municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi.High-risk contacts of Covid-19-positive patients, who were earlier being moved to CCCs, are now being asked to quarantine themselves at home, unless they live in small houses shared by more family members. “We are able to make more CCC beds available for asymptomatic positive patients,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-ramps-up-infra-to-tackle-case-spike/story-5nGfcIeQQKfCqN3qsoFWJP.html
07-05-2020||India||With 769 new cases, Mumbai Covid-19 cases surge past the 10,000-mark||Mumbai surged past 10,000 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday after recording 769 new infections, the highest single-day jump in the city worst hit by the pathogen as authorities scaled up testing to contain the outbreak that is expected to peak by the end of the month.Twenty five people died in the coastal city on Tuesday, pushing the death toll up to 412. The city has a recovery rate of around 16% with 1,686 patients overcoming the disease as of Tuesday.Maharashtra also saw its biggest daily spike in case numbers with 1,233 persons testing positive for the virus on Wednesday, taking the tally of cases to 16,758. The state also recorded 34 deaths, which takes its total fatalities to 651.Maharashtra’s doubling rate currently stands at 10 days, slightly lower than the corresponding figure for the country that stood at 10.7. Roughly two-thirds of the cases in the state are from Mumbai, which now has 10,714 infections.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said it expects around 75,000 cases by the end of the month and plans to ramp up testing capacity to around 10,000 daily in the coming two weeks from its current capacity of 6,000 tests.In Mumbai, nearly 100,000 tests have been conducted with a daily average of roughly 4,000. Across India, these figures stand at 1.27 million and 19,600.The highest number of cases in the city are from Worli and Prabhadevi that fall under the G South Ward, where the tally is close to 1,000 followed by Dharavi (G North Ward) with 773 cases.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, “The doubling rate of Mumbai (rate at which the positive cases double) is still the same at 10 days, and basis on that we have projected 75,000 cases by end of this month. This does not necessarily mean that we will have that much cases, but we have to be ready for the same. We have readied beds for around 60,000 patients, and in the coming days we should be ready with beds for all the projected cases.”To tackle the surge in cases, the state government has asked private doctors below 55 and ones without co-morbidities to report with immediate effect to Covid-19 dedicated hospitals for treatment of patients“The decision on private doctors was taken considering the demand in the coming day. Currently, as per the Department of Medical Education and Research (DMER), there are about 15,000 doctors in Mumbai who are at home. I appeal to private doctors that the state needs you now and they should participate in this work. The services of the doctors would primarily be for Mumbai. If needed their services can be used elsewhere as well,” health minister Rajesh Tope told reporters.He held a meeting with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on the preparation and planning related to the pandemic. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray interacted with the army, navy, railways and Mumbai Port Trust officials to provide their hospitals in Mumbai, Pune and other major cities as “part of preparedness”.Experts said increasing testing capacity must be augmented with community quarantining for potential patients. “Mere increasing of tests will not help us detecting more cases, and there are not much resources for testing asymptomatic suspects nor it is medically advisable. Hence, community quarantine is something we have to focus at and also educate the citizens of getting quarantined institutionally, in case home quarantine is not possible,” said Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-769-new-cases-mumbai-surges-past-the-10-000-mark/story-DU65Jg8Xpno4Fd6WJoHtwL.html
07-05-2020||India||Delhi court orders FIR against two women for communal slurs, lockdown violation||A Delhi court on Wednesday directed the city police to register an FIR against two women who had allegedly violated the lockdown orders and passed communal slurs in the Rodgran, Lal Kuan on April 16, stating that this might lead to communal tension in the area which had witnessed tension due to a parking fight.Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor ordered that the case be registered against the two women under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 153A (vilification or attacks upon the religion, race, place of birth, residence, language) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs).According to a complaint by a local resident, on April 16, the two women—Mamta and Suraiya—had allegedly tried to disrupt the communal harmony by passing communally disparaging remarks. The complainant Waiz Islam contended that these two women were carrying metal rods in their hands and caused public annoyance by smashing the doors of houses and shops, mostly populated by the Muslims.He said the video of the incident was taken and uploaded on the web. The complaint added that the area is communally sensitive and has already witnessed communal tension due to a parking issue. He said that even though the matter was reported to the Station House Officer (SHO) and an email was also sent to the DCP, no action has been taken so far.In an Action Taken Report (ATR), the Delhi police informed the court that the two women were out on the streets to feed the stray dogs and had a heated exchange with the people of Rodgran. The police said the ladies did not pass any communal slurs and a local press reporter uploaded the video on the web without verifying it.However, the court said that the duo had violated the lockdown and even though they belonged to an NGO, they should have carried proper passes granting them permission to roam freely. The judge also pointed out that both the women were residents of Farshkahan, Lal Kuan and Gali Jamun Wali, Ballimaran, around 450 and 750 meters respectively from the place of the incident.The Metropolitan Magistrate said that there is no justification as to what the women were doing in the area where the incident occurred. He said all the offences are cognizable in nature and requires investigation.“…prima facie commission of cognizable offence is shown. The area of occurrence is a sensitive area which has already witnessed communal tension on a previous occasion, therefore, (if) incidents like these are not taken in law, it would lead to communal disharmony and disturbance in public peace and tranquillity, which the nation is not prepared (for) at this time of Covid-19,” the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-orders-fir-against-two-women-for-communal-slurs-lockdown-violation/story-kgXEhmePTxKQBdHYItoYkL.html
07-05-2020||India||Media body asks govt for stimulus package||The print media industry has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 4500 crore during the months of March and April, the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) said on Wednesday, seeking a relief and stimulus package for the sector that employees three million people directly or indirectly.In a statement released on Wednesday, Shailesh Gupta, President of the INS said the body has requested the Centre for a stimulus package and also sought the support of all state governments and public sector firms , as well as the Bureau of Outreach and Communication (BOC) to take immediate steps to release the dues (for advertising by government and government departments) payable up to April. “Newspapers are facing the most turbulent and difficult period of all times. This industry directly and indirectly gives employment to 3 million people. However, against all odds and in spite of the increasing costs with no returns, all necessary steps are taken to ensure that the newspaper reaches every morning to its readers in every nook and corner of the country regularly,” Gupta said.The INS president on behalf of its members, expressed his gratitude and appreciated the efforts of the Chief Minister of Gujarat Vijay Rupani who has promised to clear all the pending payments arising from government advertising till April. “This move will provide much needed respite to the print media industry, which has lost nearly 4500 Crores during March and April,” the INS statement said.We look forward to a similar approach from Prime Minister Modi, as over the past few weeks INS has requested the Union Government for a stimulus package, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-body-asks-govt-for-stimulus-package/story-BALnsKK7MN8AWAXHw4tNVK.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 task force gauges treatment tech being developed||Among various treatment technologies being evaluated by the Centre’s Covid-19 task force are deployable or mobile hospitals; a DNA vaccine against the major viral membrane protein responsible for the cell entry of coronavirus; the development of antibodies; and an antibody gel to inactivate Sars-CoV-2 virus at the point of entry.These are in various stages of research and development according to National Research Development Corporation’s (NRDC) Compendium of Indian Technologies for combating Covid-19 released on Wednesday. As far as vaccines are concerned, experts said these will take at least a year to be developed.The compendium was launched by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, which has information on 200 Covid-19 technologies, ongoing research, and technologies already available for commercialisation. Most of these technologies are proof-of-concept (POC) tested, and can help entrepreneurs take the product to market faster, a statement issued by the Union ministry of Science & Technology said.According to the compendium, Zydus Cadila, which is developing the viral membrane protein vaccine, is also involved in the development of a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vector vaccine against Covid-19; Bharat Biotech is developing an intranasal vaccine called ‘CoroFlu’; Indian Immunologicals Limited is developing a live attenuated severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine which has been found to be effective in Golden Syrian Hamsters; and Serum Institute of India, in collaboration with US-based Codagenix, is developing a vaccine which is now in animal testing phase.“The DNA vaccine involves giving a DNA which will produce certain proteins to help protect against the infection. No antigen will be given. The second measles virus vectored vaccine is nothing but a recombinant vaccine which will have a combination of measles RNA with Sars-CoV-2 virus RNA. The Serum Institute vaccine is also a recombinant vaccine,” said Dr Shobha Broor, Dr former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.“As far as I know, these are all in development stage. They will go through pre-clinical trials in animals and then phase 1 trials in humans for safety and then phase 2 and 3. Trials may be expedited but normally it takes more than a year for all these processes,” added Dr Broor.The compendium says deployable hospitals are already in development stage. Modulus, a start-up in the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras research park, has signed an MoU with Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), Trivandrum to develop the technology. It adds that SCTIMST is also developing isolation pods -- with a cover and light bed -- for Covid-19 patients to help them travel safely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/task-force-gauges-treatment-tech-being-developed/story-DJRqvhQfMMMlOS4oV01TXP.html
07-05-2020||India||Delhi HC upholds Sanjeev Chawla bail in match fixing case||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday upheld the bail granted to alleged bookie Sanjeev Chawla by a trial court last week. Chawla, an accused in the 2000 cricket match fixing scandal,was extradited to India from the UK in February. Justice Asha Menon said that there is no evidence either through action or words which show that Chawla “has or intends to thwart the process of justice or prevent fair trial”. “The State has not succeeded in making out a case for cancellation of bail of the accused….. ,” the court said while recommending the use of technology used by countries to track under-trials who are out on bail. The court also said that though the Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain referred to the existence of an alleged syndicate, the existence of such a syndicate was still being investigated. The ruling came on a plea by Delhi Police which had sought cancellation of bail granted to Chawla contending that he would try to abscond, and tamper with evidence. The ASG had also said that it took seven years (after filing of the charge sheet in 2013) to extradite Chawla from the UK, and there is evidence that he had fixed matches with the former South African captain Hansie Cronje. The court, however, said it cannot be overlooked that out of the remaining four accused in the case, three were arrested in the year 2000, when the FIR was registered, and all of them are on bail. The high court told Chawla not to leave the city and keep his phone operational at all times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-upholds-sanjeev-chawla-bail-in-match-fixing-case/story-ybZqGa0VHVVkcOZ4WoAF6I.html
07-05-2020||India||18-year-old admin of lewd chat room held from Noida; 5 more members identified||The Delhi Police on Wednesday arrested an 18-year-old from Noida and said he was an administrator of an Instagram group in which members discussed raping their classmates and made lurid remarks while sharing their photos.The arrest came a day after investigators said the group, “Bois Locker Room”, was found to have 22 members – two of them adults and studying in colleges – after they took into custody a 15-year-old boy over the chat messages.After the arrest of the 18-year-old on Wednesday, a senior police officer said on condition of anonymity: “He has told us that he had created the group in the first week of April and added a close group of friends from Noida and Delhi. He then made some of them admin of the same group. Those new admins further added their friends from their schools and coaching centres and colleges in Delhi and NCR.” The officer said that the 18-year-old recently took his Class 12 examinations at a school in Noida.On the arrest of the 15-year-old a day earlier, the official said: “The boy was accused by some other members of the group of being the admin of the group. While the boy has denied being an admin, we have got to know that there was more than one admin.” Though apprehended by the police, the Delhi schoolboy is currently with his parents. “The juvenile justice board is currently not open for these cases. So, we are letting him be with his parents on the condition that he wouldn’t leave the city without our permission,” the officer said.Confirming the arrest of the 18-year-old teenager on Wednesday, Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police (cybercrime), said his department was still waiting for details from Instagram. “We had asked them for information about the alleged group and its members. The report from the platform is awaited.”On Tuesday, a statement by Facebook, the parent company of Instagram, said they take such issues “very seriously”. An official said that Instagram was in touch with the Delhi Police. “The devices of the identified members of the group have been seized and sent for forensic analysis… We are ascertaining the roles of other members,” Roy said.Until the details from Instagram are provided, investigators said they were relying on “material evidence” such as screenshots of the conversations and the versions of the adult suspects who were being interrogated and the interview of the minors. “Till Tuesday, we knew of 22 members in that group. Today, we have got to know of five more members, taking the total to 27. While we know all of them by their names, we have so far got the details of 14 of them. Six of them are adults. Eight others are minors,” said a third officer, who requested anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18-yr-old-admin-of-lewd-chat-room-held-5-more-members-identified/story-g6FkJYRRWYA1uzL6O9PSCI.html
07-05-2020||India||‘Leader decapitation always a blow’: Experts on Hizbul chief Riyaz Naikoo’s killing||The killing on Wednesday of the chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Riyaz Naikoo, has dealt a body blow to the banned terror outfit in the Kashmir Valley, experts said. Naikoo, who led HM since 2017, carried a Rs 12 lakh bounty on his head. He was killed with another terrorist at his native Beighbora village in Kahsmir’s Pulwama district. A Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) spokesperson identified Naikoo as one of the terrorists killed, while the Indian Army said it would not glorify terrorists by releasing their names.Lt Gen D S Hooda (retd), a former commander of the army’s northern command, said leadership decapitation is always a big blow to terror organisations. “There is both a physical dimension of an organisation suddenly losing someone who was in control and also the psychological dimension of the effect on morale and having to find a replacement,” he said.Hooda, who said all these factors induce fear and panic among terrorist organisations, congratulated the security forces for great success. Naikoo’s killing came days after five security men, including the commanding officer of a Rashtriya Rifles battalion and a major, were killed in a counterterror operation in north Kashmir’s Handwara.Experts said the killing of Naikoo in his own village was possible because the security forces had accurate intelligence about his movements. “People are sick of these terrorists and their diktats. They are providing intelligence to security personnel. Someone will take Naikoo’s place eventually but Hizbul Mujahideen has its back against the wall,” said Lt Gen BS Jaswal (retd), also a former commander of the army’s northern command.Indian Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said they won’t confirm the names of the terrorists killed. “The security forces are the heroes who eliminated 4 terrorists in 24 hours,” he said. Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director-general of military operations, agreed with the army’s decision and said that “terrorists should not be glorified”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leader-decapitation-always-a-blow/story-bZZFfXc8hQQmoaTBjOHCOP.html
07-05-2020||India||150 highly trained foreign terrorists in Kashmir Valley, say experts||Around 150 highly-trained foreign terrorists mostly belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) are active in the Kashmir Valley, two people involved in counter-insurgency in the region said on Wednesday amid a spike in the violence there. Four terrorists, including Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo who carried a bounty of Rs 12 lakh on his head, were killed in gun battles with security forces in Kashmir on Wednesday. Security forces have intensified operations in Kashmir amid a nationwide Covid-19 lockdown and killed at least 36 terrorists since late March. Around 20 soldiers, including a high-ranking army officer, have been killed during the same period. According to the government data, 13 of the 68 terrorists killed in Jammu & Kashmir this year were foreigners. Foreign terrorists accounted for 31 out of 156 killed in gun battles with security forces in the Union Territory last year. According to the data, 219 locals joined militancy in Kashmir in 2018, 119 in 2019 and 35 this year till date.The presence of the higher number of foreign terrorists in the Valley has particularly set alarm bells ringing among the security forces and intelligence agencies. A large number of them are believed to have infiltrated into India in April. Close to 150 local militants were also active in the Valley. Most of the foreign terrorists are usually holed up in Pulwama, Anantnag, Kupwara, Shopian, Kulgam and Baramulla districts and they try to attack camps of security forces or their patrols.“The presence of over 150 FTs [foreign terrorists] in the Valley that too in the first four months of the year is worrisome. This number is likely to swell with the opening of infiltration routes as over 250 terrorists are waiting at the launch pads across the border,” said one of the officials cited above. The second counter-insurgency official said the foreign terrorists are getting support from locals while they hide for weeks in different villages.A large number of foreign terrorists are believed to be a part of the new outfit called The Resistance Front (TRF) created by the Pakistan army and spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence in response to the nullification last year of the Constitution’s Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Indian agencies believe TRF is the LeT’s new name as Islamabad faces international scrutiny over the terror groups sheltered in Pakistan. Terror groups have changed their names in the past too in similar situations. Lt Gen Satish Dua (retd), a former commander of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, said Pakistan has been trying to step up its activities in the Valley after Article 370 was nullified. “There was no internet for so many months. So, there was no communication. The intelligence about the movement of FTs was weak as well as these terrorists were also not moving much. But they are under pressure to carry out strikes,” Dua said, referring to the communications blackout imposed last year to check protests against the nullification. Dua said through moves like creating TRF, terror groups were trying to “repackage their methodology and aggregate various groups”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/150-highly-trained-foreign-terrorists-in-valley-experts/story-AS5WY3Nu3GG6eQTAVs6vBP.html
07-05-2020||India||Riyaz Naikoo, schoolteacher to one of Kashmir Valley’s most wanted men||Riyaz Naikoo, who rose to prominence in the Hizbul ranks after the encounter killing of militant leader Burhan Wani in 2016, dodged the police for eight years, before he was finally killed in an encounter in his village in south Kashmir’s Pulwama on Wednesday. After Wani’s death, he was actively involved in militancy in Kashmir, especially south Kashmir. A resident of Gulzarpora Beighpora village, Naikoo was named in the killings of civilians including truck drivers, and policemen, according to a statement by the police.Before joining the Hizbul Mujahideen, Naikoo used to teach mathematics at a private school in Pulwama. The son of a farmer, Naikoo was detained by security forces during the unrest of 2010 and released in 2012. He was believed to have been radicalised around the same time.After Wani’s death created a vacuum in Hizbul, Naikoo stepped up, and circulated his audio and video messages on the social media to attract the youth. According to the security establishment, the bespectacled de facto chief Hizbul chief used the web to find new recruits. A postgraduate, he carried a reward of Rs 12 lakh on his head. Naikoo was listed a category “A++” militant, which is the classification for most-wanted militants in the Valley. The forces have actively pursued him over the past couple of years and launched several operations in south Kashmir to trap him. He managed to escape every time — until Wednesday, when he and an associate were killed in Gulzarpora Beighpora, 16km from Pulwama town. According to local residents, he had come to his village to meet his ailing mother. In the third week of May 2012, he left home, according to news agency PTI. In 2016, he made a dramatic appearance at the funeral of a militant in Shopian carrying a Kalashnikov rifle. He fired several shots in the air, starting a trend of giving gun salute to militants who were killed by security forces.Naikoo released a video in 2017, saying he would welcome the return of Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir Valley and claimed that terrorists were not enemies of the Pandits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schoolteacher-to-one-of-valley-s-most-wanted-men/story-XnDOtwi6ndTqRDnERCxNjM.html
07-05-2020||India||Spike in encounters in recent days as Pakistan pushes terrorists||Increased surveillance by security forces and fresh infiltration attempts — some of them successful — by militants are behind the frequent encounters in Jammu and Kashmir over the past one and a half months, according to officials. Since March 21, at least 33 militants and two of their associates have been killed in 15 gunfights across the Valley. Most of these encounters took place in four districts of south Kashmir — Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag, which are considered the hotbed of militancy.Twenty security personnel lost their lives in this period. Eighteen were killed in gunfights and in attacks by militants, and two army men died on the Line of Control (LoC) in ceasefire violations by Pakistan.A senior police officer who did not want to be named said the security grid has increased surveillance in the four districts of south Kashmir, while also keeping a close watch on the LoC. “There is a pattern of encounters going up in the months of April and May. Last year too, several operations were seen in Kashmir during these months,” the officer said. “March, April and May are the months when the snow starts melting on the upper reaches (of the Himalayas), and militants start infiltrating from PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) into Kashmir — which results in several encounters,” the officer added. He said with modern surveillance gadgets, security forces are registering big successes in tracking and zeroing in on militants. Another officer, who too did not want to be named, put emphasis on the need for technology-based surveillance in anti-militancy operations, while underscoring the importance of tip-offs by sources in such campaigns. “Once a militant comes in our radar, he is tracked through electronic surveillance, and the success is remarkable. Also, human intelligence inputs help the forces to coordinate operations in the better way,” the second officer said.Earlier, Dilbag Singh, Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, too, cited fresh infiltration attempts reported from north Kashmir’s Uri and Kupwara sectors as reasons behind frequent encounters.“We get to know about militants and chase them. Sometimes, we also suffer casualties during operations,” Singh said on Tuesday in an event paying tributes to three CRPF personnel.The three troopers, deployed at a check post, were killed in an attack in north Kashmir’s Handwara town. A section of security officials and experts believes ceasefire violations by Pakistan are a desperate attempt to foment unrest in India. In the security grid, many consider these ceasefire violations an attempt to give a cover fire to help militants crossing over to India.Even on Wednesday, Pakistan resorted to firing on forward areas along the LoC in two sectors of J&K’s Poonch , drawing retaliation from India, a defence spokesperson said. There was no immediate report of any casualty.Cross-border shelling between the two sides was going on till the filing of this report. “They (Pakistan) want the Kashmir issue alive,” Major General (retired) GS Jamwal said. “We should continue to maintain pressure...and ensure we don’t lose our men but inflict maximum damage on them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surveillance-infiltration-behind-frequent-attacks/story-HVMRbcKI3TuWMjNoq7j3ML.html
07-05-2020||India||States increase liquor taxes in bid to raise revenue amid Covid-19 crisis||On Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka governments decided to increase taxes on liquor and fuel to mop up money to fight the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, a few days after Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal increased taxes on liquor.Delhi has put a 70% cess on all categories of liquor and Andhra Pradesh increased 75% tax on liquor to fund the fight against Covid-19.Several states, including West Bengal, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, on Wednesday reported up to 20% higher excise revenue than usual and said the rush reported on Monday was slowly abating. However, women in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, Bolangir in Odishsa and in some parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh protested over the reopening of liquor shops, saying it would derail their families. In West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, some women wielding sticks beat people queuing outside liquor vends.The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Wednesday approved proposals making petrol, diesel and liquor costlier to earn an additional Rs 4,429 crore in 2020-2021, said the state’s finance minister Suresh Khanna. He said the price of petrol will increase by Rs 2 per litre from the current price of Rs 71.91 and diesel by Re 1 per litre from Rs 62.86. The new prices came into efffect from Wednesday night. The UP cabinet decided to make liquor costlier by Rs 5 per bottle in case of country made liquor to Rs 400 per bottle (of more than 500 ml) in the case of imported brands of foreign liquor. For brands of regular and premium categories, an additional Rs 20 will be charged on a 180 ml bottle, Rs 30 on a 180 ml to 500 ml bottle and Rs 50 on bottles containing more than 500 ml alcohol, he said. For imported liquor, Rs 100 more will be charged on a 180 ml bottle while Rs 200 more will be charged on bottles between 180 ml and 500 ml. An additional Rs 400 will be charged on bottles that have more than 500 ml of imported liquor.Since May 4, when the liquor shops opened in the state, the UP government has earned revenue of Rs 200 crore. “We got maximum revenue on Wednesday even though there was so much hype on Monday,” an official said. In 2019-20, UP had earned revenue of Rs 27,323 crore from liquor sales against the target of Rs 30,000 crore. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa announced an increase in liquor prices by 11% and a stimulus package worth Rs 1,610 crore. As a part of the package, the government has decided to pay Rs 25,000 per hectare up to a maximum of one hectare, one time compensation of Rs 5,000 to 60,000 washer men (dhobis), 2,30,000 barbers, 7.75 lakh auto rickshaw and taxi drivers.In West Bengal, a huge rush was witnessed outside liquor stores for the second consecutive day despite the government increasing the prices by 30%. Bengal’s commissioner, excise, Niranjan Das, said the sale of liquor in last two days was about Rs 58 crore, which is slightly higher than normal days.  On average, Bengal gets Rs 25 crore every day from excise revenue. “On Monday, the liquor sale was about Rs 29 crore and on Tuesday it was about Rs 28 crore even though bars and liquor shops in malls are closed,” Das said, adding liquor sale contributes substantially to the state’s revenue.Similarly, revenue from liquor sale has been encouraging in Assam. In three days, the state earned Rs 75 crore as revenue from liquor sales. In March, till the lockdown was imposed, the state earned Rs 65 crore, officials said. In April, due to lockdown, the state had earned only Rs six crore from liquor sales. Rajasthan reported a revenue of Rs 40 to 45 crore on Tuesday and Madhya Pradesh about Rs 40 crore.In Haryana, where shops opened in Wednesday, there were long queues outside the liquor vends in several districts, such as Bhiwani, Dadri, Rohtak and Sonepat districts. However, in many places the vends did because there was not enough stock, officials said. In Uttarakhand’s Nainital, people queued outside a shop, amid a hailstorm, while maintaining social distancing, as the state government reported good increase in revenue. RK Pandey, a resident of Kumaon, who waited for 30 minutes outside a liquor store, said: “Liquor shops were closed for six weeks and people are not sure whether it will remain open tomorrow or not so they are stocking liquor.”There were reports of women protesting against the opening of vends from some districts, such as Uttarkashi and Chamoli. Sunita Negi, head of Virpur village, said, “People have not been working here in the village and nearby villages due to the coronavirus pandemic. The situation will only worsen if liquor shops are opened as the men will spend money on liquor.”Liquor shops remained closed in Jharkhand, Kerala and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-increase-liquor-taxes-in-bid-to-raise-revenue-amid-crisis/story-TTIPqGrj5yWit5hlkNwJtN.html
07-05-2020||India||Chemists asked to stock up on 55 key drugs given to Covid-19 patients||Wholesalers and retailers of drugs have been asked to maintain stocks of 55 drugs given to Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and 96 medicines used for treating other chronic co-morbidities that increase the risk of complications and deaths. The directorate general of health services (DGHS) has prepared the list and the Drugs Controller General of India’s office has forwarded it to the members of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), an industry body representing pharmacies and wholesalers in the pharma trade. “A detailed exercise has been undertaken by the DGHS which has prepared a list of 55 medicines for ICU management and another 96 drugs for general availability and treatment of various co-morbid conditions, which may be required during these times… In light of this current pandemic, it is absolutely essential that sufficient market availability of these drugs along with other essential drugs is ensured by your members. These steps will go a long way in the effective clinical management of the pandemic,” said a note written by the Union health ministry’s officer on special duty, Sudhansh Pant, to AIOCD.The drugs include vasopressors (used to raise low blood pressure), those used for arrhythmia (for irregular heart beat) and other cardiac emergencies, analgesics (pain killers), sedatives (sleeping pills), muscle relaxants, antibiotics and antimicrobial agents.The list also has an estimate of the consumption of drugs for 10 days in the ICU by one patient, 25 patients and 150 patients. A separate estimate has been given of drugs used to treat chronic health conditions across the country for the next three months.The list also includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as paracetamols, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen; antibacterial agents such as albendazole, amoxicillin, ampicillin, azithromycin, doxycycline, ofloxacin etc. Other drugs include antifungal, antiviral, gastrointestinal, dermatological and anti-allergic ones, hormones, and vitamins.The estimated minimum quantity to be stocked is as per the World Health Organisation’s recommended quantity per thousand population, which is between 10 and 4000 units per 1000 population. AIOCD, in turn, has sent out a directive to chemists regarding the listed drugs. “…as a precautionary measure, it has been advised to maintain optimum availability of listed 55 and 96 drugs sent to you all beforehand to avoid shortages in case of emergency for ICU patients. Hope you shall circulate this message to all your Chemists and Stockists in your States...,” the AIOCD said in a letter.Retail Distributors Chemists Association president Sandeep Nangi called this a stock-taking exercise to ensure there is no shortage of any essential medicines. “The government does regular monitoring of the inventory. There is no shortage of any medicines as of now in the entire supply chain.”Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram, said these drugs are readily available for patients in ICUs and others and that there has been no shortage. “The list by and large covers all essential medicines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chemists-asked-to-stock-up-on-55-key-drugs/story-3LJ0fTyym8aZXDWXnQYx1O.html
07-05-2020||India||Murdered Delhi cop’s husband kills himself, say police||Nearly 14 hours after a 32-year-old Delhi Police woman constable was found shot to death in a car in Delhi’s Lodhi Colony, her husband, who was the prime suspect in the murder case, allegedly killed himself with his service pistol at Jamalpur village in Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Meerut Tuesday night, officials of Delhi and UP Police said.Around 11pm, a joint team of Delhi Police’s south district and the special cell was questioning the head constable Manoj’s relatives in the village regarding his whereabouts when they heard a gunshot in a sugarcane field nearby. They rushed to the field and found Manoj bleeding from the head.A bullet entry wound was found in his right temple and his service pistol was lying nearby. The local police were informed about the incident, deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said.Brajesh Kumar Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Incholi police station, said that the head constable’s body was sent to a government hospital for autopsy. “The pistol has been sent to a forensic lab for examination. Inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) have been initiated,” Singh said.On Tuesday around 9am, the body of constable Renu Malik was found on the front passenger seat of a Maruti Ritz car in Lodhi Colony. She was posted to the outer-north district’s Covid cell. The police started working on the theory that her husband, head constable Manoj who was posted to the special cell, had killed her due to marital discord. He was missing since her murder and the car belonged to his colleague.The initial probe revealed that the couple was living separately but was in touch on the phone. Since both of them are dead now, the exact sequence of events leading to their deaths has not yet been ascertained.“Whether the constable was killed by her husband, who then used the same service pistol to kill himself is being probed. He, however, was our prime suspect as all the circumstantial evidence pointed towards him,” DCP Thakur added. Many police officers suspect that the head constable may have killed himself out of guilt. His relatives told the police that they asked him to surrender when he came seeking shelter at their home, one of the officers said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murdered-cop-s-husband-kills-himself/story-Uktq4oTgz09N7lYJMndRFJ.html
07-05-2020||India||Indian bizman, cook land in Delhi aboard Zambia evacuation plane||When a Royal Air Charters special flight landed in New Delhi on Wednesday to ferry back Zambian nationals from the Capital and Mumbai, it had on board two passengers who were not supposed to be there -- an Indian businessman and his cook.The special evacuation flight was allowed by India’s ministry of home affairs (MHA) to fly back 39 persons including Zambian diplomat Steven Simasandu to Lusaka, but officials at the airport were surprised when the flight, which was supposed to be empty except for the crew, landed with Rajnish Gupta and Suresh Kumar Baheliya, according to people directly familiar with the matter.Gupta, 47, a businessman who has business interests and an apartment in Lusaka, was travelling with Baheliya, his cook. He had managed to convince Zambian authorities to let him fly in on the special flight, which landed in Delhi via Muscat. Gupta told the officials at the airport that he was in Lusaka for work when the lockdown was enforced and that he managed to persuade Zambian government authorities that he had to be back in India. It wasn’t immediately clear how Gupta managed to convince Zambian authorities to let him travel to India. The Zambian High Commission did not respond to calls seeking comment. More than 300,000  Indians are stuck around the world on account of the lockdown and the cancellation of all flights. Starting Thursday, the Indian government is running a massive evacuation operation to get many of them back to India. On Tuesday, the government said it would run 64 flights in the first week, starting Thursday, to fly around 15,000 Indians back home. According to guidelines issued for the operation, preference was to be given to those with expiring visas, people who were laid off, the elderly, students, pregnant women, and people with family medical emergencies.When the plane landed at about 2pm on Wednesday, Indian authorities were shocked to find the two Indians on board because the Directorate general of Civil aviation (DGCA) permit had no mention of any incoming Indian passenger. HT has reviewed a copy of the note . Till evening, the flight, which was to take on Zambians from Delhi and then fly to Mumbai where more Zambians were to board, was waiting on the tarmac, with Gupta and Baheliya next to it. “Someone can’t just get on a plane like this illegally and come here,’’ said a DGCA official. “He will not be allowed to get off the flight.’’But therein lay the big dilemma for the officials. “He (Gupta) is an Indian citizen after all and so we can’t send him back,’’ said an immigration official.And so, as the discussions raged Wednesday evening, Gupta stood on the tarmac, closely watched by two security guards. “Even if he manages to stay back in India, he will face action and will be taken straight to quarantine,’’ said an airport official.After consultations with the Ministry of External Affairs, the immigration officials issued a show cause notice to the two passengers. The CISF which guards the airport were officially told to put the two back on the flight. However, the two were refusing to budge. The Zambian passengers were left waiting till shortly after 11pm, when a quick response team of 20 people surrounded Gupta and forced him onto the plane. Late on Wednesday night, the plane took off for Mumbai to pick up the rest of the passengers before heading to Zambia.The Delhi Airport spokesperson said that he had no information about the incident. HT also contacted the Foreigner Registration Offices which handles the immigration department under the home ministry but there was no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-bizman-cook-land-in-delhi-aboard-zambia-evacuation-plane/story-Hm2ZGDvIYbDhgxcFktvxuL.html
07-05-2020||India||Ahmedabad under hard lockdown as Covid-19 cases near 5,000||The Gujarat government on Wednesday imposed a hard lockdown in Ahmedabad to curb the spread of Covid-19 and warned off a punishment under the Epidemic Diseases Act for violators. The city has recorded 4,735 positive coronavirus disease cases till Wednesday and 298 deaths. It accounts for 70% of the total 6,662 cases in the state, and 74% of the 396 deaths. According to a government order, everything except ATMs and health facilities will be closed from midnight on Wednesday. Only three transport of milk and vegetables will be allowed, an order issued by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation said. “For effective implementation of social distancing and to minimize crowding to reduce the spread of infection in the city of Ahmedabad, all shops shall be closed except providing only milks and medicines,” said Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar. “Those failing to obey these orders shall be penalized under section 188 and 270 of IPC and section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act,” he said.Kumar replaced the former commissioner Vijay Mehra on Tuesday when Mehra was quarantined after coming in contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus disease. Ahmedabad is the worst affected district in the state, followed by Surat, which has 772 cases, Vadodara 421, Bhavanagar 82 and Anand 76. Out of these 368 deaths, 273 are from Ahmedabad, 33 from Surat, 30 from Vadodra and rest from other districts.Of all the cases in Ahmedabad, about one-fourth are from Jamalpur, a locality of 3.5 lakh people in central Ahmedabad.“When the first case was reported from Jamalpur on March 19, nobody took it seriously. The person was tested and sent back home. Even contract tracing was not done properly, let alone isolating his family,” said a senior Gujarat government official, who did not wish to be named.The official, who is a part of the team working on containment strategy for Ahmedabad, said the lockdown norms were not properly implemented and there were no efforts to identify those infected. “In the first week to 10 days [of the lockdown], only those who visited the hospital with Covid-19 symptoms were tested. No random testing was done,” he said.Gujarat chief minister, Vijay Rupani in an interview to HT had attributed the high number of cases to large number of international and domestic travelers. “There was a complete ban on movement of people. However, Gujarat is one of the leading states in India with a large number of international and domestic travellers. This increases the possibility of more cases. By the time we registered our first case on March 19, we’d screened around 30,000 passengers and put them under quarantine. We ensured strict implementation of MHA guidelines,” Rupani had said.The chief minister said a large number of people, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in New Delhi, came back and by the time the officials could track them, they had already come in contact with a large number of people. “This led to the rise of cases. Another reason for rise in cases is our intensive testing capacity. With a capacity of 3,000 per day, we have tested around 80,000 people till date,” he said.Experts, however, attributed the high numbers to failure to enforce lockdown stricly. Dr Parthiv Mehta, an Ahmedabad based pulmonologist, said, “Enforcement has improved now. We need special audit of all deaths to find out how many died because of co-morbid conditions as Gujarat has high incident of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmedabad-under-hard-lockdown-as-cases-near-5-000/story-tUEqnMzM61tddtiirzZNFM.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Public transport may resume soon, says Nitin Gadkari||Public transport may resume soon with measures related to social distancing and hygiene in place as the resumption along with reopening of highways will go a long way in instilling confidence among the public, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said Wednesday.In his address to Bus & Car Operators Confederation Of India members via video conferencing, Gadkari said a standard operating procedure will have to be drafted for operating public transport with social distancing norms and for adopting measures like hand wash, sanitising, face masks, etc. Public transport has been suspended across the country since March when the ongoing lockdown was imposed to ensure social distancing to check the Covid-19 spread. The Centre has made an exception for the operation of bus and train services to enable movement of the stranded people.A ban on regular air, rail travel and interstate transport remained as the Centre extended the lockdown until May 17 last week. Taxi and cab aggregators were allowed to operate with two passengers even as inter and intra-district buses remain prohibited in orange zones.In a statement, the Union road transport and highways ministry said Gadkari assured the operators that the government is aware of their problems and will support them to mitigate their issues. Gadkari said his ministry was looking at adopting the ‘London model’ of public transport, which will involve promotion of private investment in the sector. He added the pandemic has presented India an opportunity to seek global investments from firms looking to exit the Chinese market.The confederation members made suggestions like extending interest payment exemptions, restarting public transport, and deferring state taxes, etc. All Indian Motor Transport Congress president Kultaran Singh Atwal said the transport sector was facing a severe downturn due to persistent lockdown. He said a majority of operators are small and unable to sustain the financial pressure. “The government must extend a helping hand to more than 200 million people dependent on this sector...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-transport-may-resume-soon-gadkari/story-NwQ95NOEXXyNgs3vhb260N.html
07-05-2020||India||Congress asks Centre to spell out Covid-19 lockdown exit strategy||Several Congress chief ministers on Wednesday accused the Union government of taking decisions arbitrarily and not consulting them on key issues such as the classification of Covid-19 zones, while party chief Sonia Gandhi asked the Centre to spell out its lockdown exit strategy.In a discussion between Sonia Gandhi, the CMs, and other senior Congress leaders via video conferencing, the demand for a sizeable stimulus package for the states -- to combat the coronavirus pandemic and the economic fallout of the national lockdown -- was also raised, according to the Congress party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala. “What after May 17? What criteria is the government using to judge how long the lockdown will continue?” Surjewala quoted Gandhi as having said at the meeting.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit back to many of the issues raised, saying the Congress was politicising the Covid-19 fight, particularly at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken along all the chief ministers by holding multiple interactions with them since the start of the lockdown in late March.Modi first announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the deadly pathogen on March 25. The lockdown was then extended till May 3, and later till May 17, but with several relaxations that first kicked in on April 20 and then at the start of the third phase on May 4.Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who addressed the meeting, also talked about the path ahead. “We need to know, as Soniaji said, what will happen after Lockdown 3.0? The chief ministers need to deliberate and ask as to what is the strategy of the government of India to get the country out of lockdown,” Singh told the meeting, according to Surjewala.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said the central piece of strategy to fight Covid-19 is to protect the elderly and those who are diabetic and with heart conditions, Surjewala added.The meeting came days after Sonia Gandhi announced that her party will pay for the train travel of stranded migrant workers -- a move that triggered a slugfest between the Congress and the BJP. The opposition party accused the government of being insensitive to the plight of stranded migrant workers while the BJP claimed that railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost.Giving further details of Wednesday’s meeting, Surjewala quoted Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh as having said that his government had set up two committees to strategise on how to come out of the lockdown and on suggesting ways and means for the economic revival. “Our concern is the people sitting in Delhi are deciding on classification of zones without knowing what is happening on the ground,” he said, according to Surjewala.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot demanded financial assistance from the Centre to states to sustain the impact of the Covid-19. “Until an extensive stimulus package is given, how will states and the country run? We have lost Rs 10,000 crore of revenue. States have repeatedly requested the Prime Minister for a financial package but we are yet to hear from the Centre,” Surjewala quoted Gehlot as saying.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said states were facing an acute economic crisis and needed immediate financial assistance. “Chhattisgarh is one state where 80% of small industries have restarted and nearly 85,000 workers have returned to work,” he said at the meeting.Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy said the Centre was deciding on zones without consulting the states. “This is creating an anomalous situation. No state or chief minister is consulted. Why? The Prime Minister is not saying a word on the economic package for states,” he said.The Congress chief minsters also pointed out that the Centre is pushing the states towards the fiscal distress by not announcing and allocating resources to fight the pandemic as also the looming economic crisis. They told the meeting that they will again write to the Prime Minister seeking financial assistance so that the battle against Covid-19 is fought jointly, with the Centre leading it and the states being the executing partners on the ground.Former finance minister P Chidambaram said at the meeting that financial condition of the states was dire but no money was being allocated by the Centre.The BJP hit back on all these issues. “The Congress is trying to create a wedge between chief ministers of the Congress-ruled states and the non-Congress ruled states. At a time when everyone should join forces, questions are being raised about when the lockdown will be relaxed,” BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said.“If the Congress cannot cooperate with the government it should not make efforts to create divisions. The way Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are raising questions every day it is weakening the war against coronavirus,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-asks-centre-to-spell-out-lockdown-exit-strategy/story-N4sRLcw1qiqu5HrxMJbdJN.html

07-05-2020||India||Life in the time of Covid-19: Finding new ways to care, and self-care||When the going gets tough, the tough will somehow get by. But what if you’re at home with a loved one who is frail, aged or ailing? It’s hard being the only caregiver, with little or no help. It can help to create contingency plans, take precautionary measures, and try and build a new support system to replace the one you no longer have access to. And do not neglect to take care of yourself as well.Plans A and BThe most common concern is running out of medication and not being able to fill up a prescription again, or replace an essential device like a pulse oximeter or glucose monitor. Nita Ghosh of Kolkata typically kept her husband’s medication stocked for three months at a time — he has a motor neuron disease. But with stocks running low with suppliers, her own stocks dipped to 15 days’ during the first lockdown. Nita has since expanded her list of stockists in the city, so she doesn’t have to rely on only one.She has also contacted her local police station. On their advice, she sent a photo of her husband’s disability certificate to his physiotherapist in case she needed to call him for a session and he was stopped while in transit.Stepping upFamily members are also learning how to fill in for medical assistants in case they can’t make it. Software engineer Rajeshwari Mitra from Bhubaneswar is helping her ailing father, a neurological patient, with his exercise regimen. “He is bedridden, but my mother and I coax him to sit up and do his stretches,” she says. Keeping up an ailing person’s morale and encouraging him to stick to his routine are essential, when even the local doctor may not be a phone call away.Rajni Aggarwal, who works with an international packers firm in Delhi, lives with her mother who is confined to her bed by rheumatoid arthritis and a spine fracture. There are many factors pulling Rajni down. “The agency that provided attendants is charging double. Stress caused mom to have bladder issues and I began to get nervous. I called two of our local doctors. One said he would a house call, for Rs 5,000,” she says. Her support system came in handy. She did a video call with her friend’s mother, a retired doctor; her medication has calmed Rajni’s mother.During the day Rajni does yoga, listens to music and makes caricatures of herself and her friends which she then shares via WhatsApp. These conversations help lift her spirits, and her mother’s. “I show them to my mom and we have a good laugh,” Rajni says. “In these times, that is so important. It doesn’t make the troubles go away, but it makes them smaller.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/life-in-the-time-of-covid-19-finding-new-ways-to-care-and-self-care/story-pIf44zmoFaWZ5uXayWzTHI.html

07-05-2020||India||‘Have to get used to the virus, expect flights to start soon’: Hardeep Puri||Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri talks about the government’s mammoth plan to evacuate stranded Indians, coordinating with the states to ensure their quarantine, the resumption of domestic flights and public transport in an interview to Anisha Dutta.Edited excerpts: Q: What is the scale of this massive rescue plan that the Indian government is going to begin from tomorrow? You have given an estimate of about 1,90,000 people but there is no clarity on how many stranded Indians we are expecting. The figure of 1,90,000 was a figure which was a working hypothesis for MEA initially. Our missions are in touch with people who have expressed a desire to come back then the missions do an outreach through associations of different Indians and groupings. When we started looking at the mechanics and modalities for the evacuation flights and we started getting into greater detail the first impression that we got was that the overall figure of 1,90,000 would actually be conservative and the figure would end up many times higher than this. The total number of Indian nationals in the Gulf alone goes into several million. Some of them need to come back because they are in distress, some of them have had their Visas expired, some of them are facing deportation and others are in an emergency situation. If you put these together the figure is going to be well beyond 190,000 to 200,000. If it were a normal situation through normal civil aviation operations, you could carry these people back but the fact of the matter is domestic civil aviation and international flights have been under lockdown since March 23, therefore our ability to bring these people back is directly dependent on the arrangements that the state governments can make to receive these people. It is absolutely imperative that all those coming from abroad will have to be subjected to mandatory 14 days quarantine.  Also Watch | New Covid-19 test, invented in India, may be deployed within a monthTomorrow three flights are planned one to Singapore and two to Abu Dhabi. We will see how this process proceeds. How much satisfaction in terms of risk minimization we get. An operation of this magnitude, 190,000 might be the largest and the most comprehensive programme ever attempted and in a difficult operating time when you are dealing with an invisible enemy. In the coming days we will refine the programme for the coming weeks—we will add more countries and add more flights. Q: How long will this take? I am not committing myself to the total number to be evacuated, within how much period of time we do this in will depend on the manner in which we are able to execute this in consultation with the state governments. As far as the civil aviation component is concerned we can ramp that up. We have 650 aircraft at our disposal; some of them are long haul. It depends on the behaviour of the virus and the situation in the states which are receiving these people. We have a plan of the first week to ferry 14,800 people in 64 flights, in the next week we will look at an increase in numbers depending on our experience during this first week. Q: Is there a plan to help NRI’s stuck in India? How does the government plan to ferry them back? All Indian citizens who are ordinarily NRI’s, those who are on long-term work Visas, those who are green card holders etc, yes we would be happy to open the booking for them. But you have to factor in another issue which is that many countries are not receiving or not willing to receive people who are not their nationals. For instance, I thought people from Dubai who are stranded here could be sent back but they are not allowing any foreign nationals to come back even those with long term working Visas. Hence unless these restrictions are lifted by the receiving country the airlines cannot do anything about it. In the United States and United Kingdom there is no difficulty, we are booking people on the outgoing flights. Q: You used the word ‘evacuation’ and you talk about it as a commercial operation as well. What do we call it? Where does it say that the term evacuation means it has to be gratis? Nowhere. Let’s look at this realistically, these are people who went abroad to earn their livelihood, some are in difficult situations because they don’t have jobs anymore but at the same time the state is providing a service through a civil aviation company. That company (Air India) is also being barely kept afloat, it requires an infusion of Rs 500 crore to 600 crore every month to keep up. We are providing a service so we have to levy a charge. There are irresponsible members of opposition parties saying it should be free and well that’s one sure way of running the economy to the ground. It cannot be done free because there’s a cost to it and the charge which has been levied like Rs 12,000 from the Gulf, Rs 50,000 from UK…it is reasonable considering that the flight will have to go reasonably empty one way and it may not be 100% full on the way back. A plan has been devised that they go from the port of embarkation to a pre- designated port of disembarkation and the passengers are taken into government mandated paid quarantine facilities arranged by the state government. Q: Is there a plan now after this to begin rescue flight operations domestically as well as for those stranded in different states? When you have a country like India which has the world’s third largest civil aviation domestic market…pre-Covid-19 we were dealing with 435 million passengers. Obviously, people are stranded, I have been getting requests from people asking when they will resume because they have to meet their family or some other urgency but all these decisions will have to be taken after we factor in the behaviour of the virus. In the process of easing mobility you don’t want exponential growth in the infections. Since the Prime Minister took decisions very early in the day, those were bold and very timely decisions, we were able to control the spread. Today, our overall number is less than 50,000 with a doubling rate of 12-13 days and total fatality is about 1600. Compared to global figures these numbers are more under control and hence we can draw some satisfaction. But in the process of opening mobility there is always a risk whether you are opening mobility through surface transport of different kinds or ship or planes. Hence you have to simultaneously do two things; put in place safeguards and precautionary measures and Standard Operating Procedures and on the other hand you ease mobility. I think we have reached a stage where we will just start getting used to the idea that the virus is going to be around for a while but we will not allow it to completely circumscribe or curtail our normal economic activity which is vital to keep the country going. Q: One sense from the government is that there will be a gradual resumption of services? How will it be done when and if the government decides to allow? The civil aviation resumption of domestic traffic cannot be taken in isolation. When you open up domestic flights you will also have to open up traffic in railways, and other modes of surface transport. Even the Delhi Metro has a ridership of 6.5 million a day and will have to be opened accordingly. It will all be part of a package. My expectation is that we will do it in a slow and calibrated manner. I want to reiterate that the decisions remain to be taken. When they are taken, I expect that we will do it in a gradual manner—first 25% operations then gradually increase. On when will it happen? I am hoping sooner than later but again it is dependent on economic activity. In the last few days a range of economic activities have opened up substantially. In the coming weeks I expect it to be eased and a calibrated opening taking place including domestic aviation and finally civil aviation overall. Q: When can we expect an economic stimulus for the civil aviation sector?I am not in the habit of anticipating what my senior colleague the finance minister is going to say. My ministry and all the senior officials have personally been in touch with all the airlines. We know exactly where they are seeking relief and have brainstormed with them and passed on some of their suggestions to the finance ministry. But the size of the package, stimulus etc is not for me to comment. We have to create an ecosystem so that when the crisis is over we emerge from it stronger. It would mean the amount of damage for the stakeholders in the sector is minimised. The stakeholders are the airlines themselves, the airport operators, the tourism industry etc, who are all at a severe disadvantage right now. But the eternal optimist that I am, I am hoping that we will navigate our way out of this. Some airlines were taking advance bookings and you issued a clear directive to stop and also to reimburse bookings made during the lockdown. Some airlines have opened advance bookings again, how will you control that? It is a very complicated situation, the airline ticketing structure is very complicated where you have passenger as a user, the travel agents and then you have the airline. In the normal system that we follow, which is a deregulated system, the airline is supposed to put on its website its lower fare and the highest fare and then they can charge according to the market mechanism. I realised what was happening pretty early, a lot of people who were in distress because they had booked a flight and it got cancelled due to the lockdown so I issued an advisory saying that people should be reimbursed. When I found that some airlines were not following that, I was compelled to issue a directive. Meanwhile, there are other tickets which people had booked before the lockdown, now there is a demand that they reimburse those also and the matter is before the Supreme Court because someone had filed a PIL. I can’t comment on it because my ministry will have to take a position there. We will have to look at the interest of the passengers primarily but also look at the situation of the airlines. But clearly if a passenger booked a ticket and got affected by the lockdown it should be reimbursed but if he booked in advance; it’s a global practice.

07-05-2020||India||Counter Covid-19 with courage, fight like a soldier: Kargil hero||We humans experience the same fears, the same hopes and the same uncertainties. Covid-19 has shown us that what happens to one person can soon affect other beings all over the world. But it has also taught us that courage and compassion can help us overcome any crisis.Triple amputee Kargil war veteran, Naik Deepchand recalls how during the war, soldiers sometimes had no ration, but courage and the spirit of unity kept them going. “India as a nation is trying its best to contain the virus. The crisis shows that we must all take responsibility. We must combine our inner courage and patience with empirical science to protect our future from such threats,” he says. Deepchand says, “Courage is the primary thing. The medicine that can kill this virus is courage. Humein iss mahamaari se ladna hai, darrna nahi hai.”He says that at this moment, the entire nation is united as one. “Unke chale jaane se poora desh pareshan hai, koi nahi pooch raha ki woh Hindu the ya Muslim. Chand logon ne bana diya dushman mazhab ko, farak nahi padta ki kaun Kapoor hai, kaun Khan hai. (The whole nation is mourning Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor’s death. No one’s asking if they were Hindu or Muslim.  Very few people nurture religious hate, it doesn’t matter if one’s a Kapoor or a Khan),” he says.This pandemic serves as a lesson that only by giving up hate and acting with kindness towards all, we can beat the virus. He says, “Our determination made us win the war. The battle against corona is similar, we all are soldiers in this fight and we can win it together.”Being consciously happy even in chaotic circumstances like a pandemic goes a long way to help us cope. He says, “Life is short, so live each moment. Don’t criticise anything or anyone. Listen to your inner voice which is always of love and compassion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/counter-covid-19-with-courage-fight-like-a-soldier-kargil-hero/story-1XtcjcvAHRv7liOujfIi0O.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Pharma firm seeks approval to conduct clinical trials of hepatitis medicine||Zydus Cadila has sought permission from India’s drugs controller to conduct clinical trials to test the efficacy of its antiviral hepatitis medicine to treat adults affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The medicine, called Pegylated Interferon allpha-2b, is used to treat viral hepatitis B and C, and other viral liver infections. Interferon has been used in the treatment of Covid-19 in China and Cuba, and is a part of the treatment guidelines of the Chinese government.In a statement, the company contended that its biological therapy, Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b, sold under the trade name PegiHepTM, could emerge as one of the pathways to treat Covid-19 as it has shown to reduce viral load and generate virus eliminating specific immune response in past studies.“The central drugs control department has received an application from them, and it is being considered. However, there has not been any decision taken over it yet,” said a senior official in the Union health ministry who asked not to be named. “We are working with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have opened an investigational new drug (IND) filing for Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b for the treatment of Covid-19. We are also working with the Department of Biotechnology to investigate the role of Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b for COVID 19 and are planning to undertake clinical trials for this,” Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd added in the statement.When the human body contracts an infection due to a viral attack, it produces a group of molecules called Type 1 interferons as a first line of defence.Interferon alpha is one such Type 1 interferon molecule that not only slows down viral replication but also helps activate the two arms of the human immune system: innate, for immediate killing of the virus; and adaptive, for long-lasting immunity.In some past studies in the US and China, the medicine has shown to improve the condition of Covid-19 patients.The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, showed evidence of a direct anti-viral effect of interferon alpha against coronavirus in-vitro.The second research by a group of universities in China, Australia and Canada retrospectively analysed 77 moderate Covid-19 subjects in Wuhan and observed that those who received Interferon alpha-2b showed a reduction in the duration of virus shedding period and even in levels of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6.The study suggested that if a long-acting molecule like the drug is given early on in the infection, the patient suffering from Covid-19 will show improvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pharma-firm-seeks-approval-to-conduct-clinical-trials-of-its-hepatitis-medicine/story-cKGyKQxpIU1JrfyBTv88sK.html
07-05-2020||India||In fight against Covid-19, increased testing and better infra critical||Diagnostic testing for Covid-19 has been the topic du jour in India – from government offices to boardrooms to online chatrooms. Debates range from whether we are doing enough testing to whether we are testing the right people. Continuous media coverage on availability of test kits, quality of the kits and effectiveness of testing protocols has often led to confusion on how to expand testing capacity.It is now well accepted that we are in a marathon fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. India has been in a nationwide lockdown since March 25 that has been extended twice -- to May 17 -- with some relaxations in restrictions. This was essential and well-timed -- helping reduce the spread of the disease ( the doubling rate of cases, 3.4 days prior to the lockdown, is 11 days currently) and providing time to ramp up the healthcare infrastructure. However, in this battle between lives and livelihoods, we cannot ignore the crippling impact the lockdown has had on India’s economy. Already the unemployment rate has risen to 23%, from 8.4 % in mid-March. Diagnostic testing is an important weapon in this fight. It helps to identify infected individuals and treat them; also it helps in breaking the chain of transmission and supports decision making on easing restrictions. Countries like South Korea have already shown how large-scale testing can control the disease without resorting to a nationwide lockdown.India: Current state of testingCovid testing in India has evolved rapidly. Until mid-March, testing was focused on only symptomatic international travellers or symptomatic contacts of such travellers in the belief that the spread was largely restricted to international travellers. Over time, with identification of cases with no travel-related history, these guidelines evolved to include symptomatic local patients, healthcare workers, asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases and patients exhibiting SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) and influenza like symptoms. Currently, Indian testing guidelines stand in line with those of countries like South Korea and Germany. With the new guidelines in place, testing has been ramped up by over 35 times during the last five weeks from an average of 2,000 tests / day (last week of March) to more than 70,000 tests (early May). A heartening indicator is that with the scaling-up of testing, positivity rates have remained one of the lowest in the world at -- 4%. This increase has been driven by multiple government interventions. More than 150 testing labs have been additionally approved in the last four weeks. Pooled testing protocols in locations with low positivity rates have been created and testing has been included in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) package. Shifting to the next gearViewed this way, the overall picture does not seem as grim as many have claimed. However, reviewing the state- wise status of testing, it is seen that there are wide disparities which point to the need for urgent segmented action. Refer to Exhibit 2States in Quadrant I (e.g. West Bengal) are seeing low testing rates despite high positivity and need to immediately ramp up testing to understand the true spread. States in Quadrant II (like Delhi and Maharashtra) show a high spread while having high testing rates. These geographies have had many outbreaks in clusters and need to continue large-scale testing to identify and treat patients. Many states fall in Quadrant III (e.g. Bihar) where testing has been sub-scale. While they currently see low positivity, they need to enhance testing to understand the spread and support decisions to open up gradually.While cumulative cases in India have exceeded 40,000, a granular review shows eight cities contribute over 45% of cases, while 250+ districts have no reported cases. This, in addition to the concentration of growth of Covid-19 in particular areas, allows for a regional review to decide on lifting lockdown restrictions. This could be supported with thorough testing to enable informed decision making.This is where the different available testing options lend themselves to appropriate use cases. We have the gold standard RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) tests that detect the presence of a viral genome in the body; they can be deployed largely in identification of infected patients and treatment. These are expensive and need specialised molecular diagnostic equipment and trained professionals to operate the equipment. On the other hand, serological tests detect the presence of antibodies (that develop in the body as an immune response) and are useful to detect past infections. While such tests are less useful in immediate response (and should not be used for clinical diagnosis), they can be used to track disease development. They could also assess individuals who are immune and can be safely brought back to the workforce. Antibody kits were added to our testing regime, but were challenged due to a few faulty kits. With additional kits getting approved, the quality of test kits should be regularly confirmed through periodic quality checksWe should think of these tests as weapons in our arsenal, and deploy a segmented approach for testing in India, which is customized by region depending on the current level of disease spread. See Exhibit 3 * High disease spread and high growth: Continue large scale RT-PCR testing to support identification of cases. Deploy rapid testing in hotspots to quickly assess community immunity* High disease spread but low growth: Leverage combination of antibody tests to test herd immunity coupled with RT-PCR tests for diagnosis* Low disease spread and high growth: Leverage pooled testing at scale to quickly identify new hotspots* Low disease spread and low growth: Leverage RT-PCR tests for Influenza-like-illnesses /SARI cases and healthcare workers and serological testing to monitor disease surveillanceOperationalising the ramp-upThe testing value chain is complex and has several bottlenecks. Starting from sample collection where it is crucial to ensure availability of skilled phlebotomists (people trained to draw blood from a patient) with full protective personal equipment (PPE). Subsequently, the lab testing process requires availability of technicians with training in molecular biology, infrastructure such as biosafety rooms, sufficient kits and reagents and finally RT-PCR machines – the most critical equipment needed in the current molecular testing regime. While government interventions have ensured sufficient supply of kits (with enough stocks to conduct 100,000 tests / day for the next two months and ramp-up beyond this as needed), PCR machines, sample collection process and regional lab availability may emerge as future bottlenecks. Given this, it is recommended to focus on four priorities:* Lab Capacity: Address regional disparities in lab capacity. States like Jharkhand and Chattisgarh have less than five labs while labs in Gujarat are near capacity with current disease spread. Private sector collaboration can help plug these gaps * PCR machines: ~400 PCR machines are available in approved labs in India currently. This is sufficient to conduct 70-80,000 tests / day in the public sector and 30-40,000 tests / day in the private sector. The positive side is that India already has a sufficient installed base (1400+ machines) across public and private sector and capacity can be ramped up even more by adding these machines to the approved list* Setup of fever clinics to enable sample collection: Taking learnings from South Korea and other countries, India should set up fever clinics in each locality to do screening and sample collection* Leverage innovations: Innovations like pooled testing, nano-reaction based tests and RT-LAMP {Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) technology could further enhance capacityDiagnostic testing is crucial to the fight against Covid. As we move into a post-lockdown era and contemplate recovery, government officials, corporate leaders and healthcare experts will all have to confront the need for testing. Unfortunately, it is neither simple to implement nor a panacea to all problems. It will be important that all stakeholders (public and private sector) work jointly to address this challenge and bring forth their respective strengths to help win this fight.
