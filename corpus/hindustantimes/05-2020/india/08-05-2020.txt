Mumbai has seen 4,455 cases and 196 deaths in the period.The tragic rail accident killing 16 migrant workers in Aurangabad on Friday morning led to a blame game between governments. The state government has blamed it on the Centre for the delay in response to the state’s demand for special trains for the evacuation of migrants. But at the same time, the authorities are facing the criticism within for the failure of the district administration in putting the migrants in shelter camps.“Allowing the migrants to walk on the highways and railway track was a big flaw in the system. They were walking for the last four-five days on the highways in the absence of means to travel back to their homes. They should have been given confidence about the travelling arrangements to return,” said a minister requesting anonymity.The ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party have criticized BJP-ruled states like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka alleging that the states have been refusing entry to the migrants going back from Maharashtra. Congress leader and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said on Friday that that owing to the delay in the permissions from other states the evacuation has been delayed. “We have more than 10 lakh migrant workers who want to go back to their respective states. 32 Shramik trains have so far departed from various stations in Maharashtra, but a few states are not giving permission as quickly as expected. The entire process of sending these migrants is intricate and time consuming and needs quick response from the receiving states,” Thorat said.The expert committee of bureaucrats including retired IAS officers constituted to suggest the steps for the revival of the state economy submitted its report to the state government on Friday. The committee has suggested, among others, for the earmarking of the ‘Negative’ list of activities than ‘Permitted’ list during lockdown to outline the non-containment zones. It has stated that it will help in boosting business activities. It has suggested that the list be based on activities precluding social distancing and the activities that are not very critical for economy.The committee has also recommended emphasis on Mumbai by launching a special project to re-start the economy and has also suggested a special programme to support vulnerable groups like street vendors, drivers, and self employed service providers. It has also recommended addressing individual sectors and activities and new business classes. Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar said that the report will now be kept before the state cabinet for a final nod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-inches-towards-20-000-mark-with-1-089-new-covid-19-cases-today/story-0662foK22AzPSHDaD2GPbN.html

Issues such as the WHO’s mandate and an investigation of its working can be taken up later, when we have dealt with the immediate issue,” said one of the people cited above.During the prime minister’s recent conversations with heads of state and government and in external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s discussions with his counterparts, the focus has been on combating Covid-19 and finding solutions to the worldwide crisis, the people said.“All our conversations with heads of state or government or with foreign ministers have been about how to cooperate to deal with the crisis and work together to develop vaccines and therapeutic solutions,” the first person said.“The conversations have also been about reliable supply chains that can be of use to states,” the person added.The people, however, made it clear that India wants to see the WHO’s mandate strengthened. India also wants to work with others on ways to increase the WHO’s capacity to handle pandemics and crises, they added.“These are issues we can come to when we have more breathing space to deal with them,” the person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reforming-who-can-be-taken-up-after-overcoming-covid-19-pandemic-india/story-d8t0C0fZEmgnKSgnWPtgUM.html

We have arrested Rajesh,” the ACP said.The Congress alleged that Rajesh was a BJP worker and fleecing helpless migrant workers who wanted to go home by Shramik Special trains.But the BJP said he had nothing to do with the party. “Rajesh Verma is not a BJP worker. The party has not asked any of its workers to book tickets.

There is a need for relaxing certain provisions of the Factories Act, 1948 thereby extending the working hours for optimum utilization of the workers in the factories which have been allowed to operate during the shutdown. The Pramod Sawant-led government’s decision comes a day after Madhya Pradesh took a similar decision, increasing the factory shifts from eight to 12 hours in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.As per the relaxations granted, the total number of hours of work in any day shall not exceed twelve while spread over, inclusive of intervals for rest, shall not exceed thirteen hours in any one day. The total number of hours of work in any week, including overtime has also been amended to reflect the change and now shall not exceed sixty. It is also mandated that no worker shall work for more than five hours before he has had an interval of at least half an hour and that where a worker works in a factory for more than forty-eight hours in any week, s/he shall, in respect of overtime work, be entitled to wages at the rate of twice his ordinary rate of wages.The Centre recently announced relaxation in curbs during nationwide lockdown to revive the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-goa-allows-factories-to-have-12-hour-shifts-due-to-shortage-of-workers/story-Hd3GglmylYmEryZ7EOYqBJ.html

These workers are expected to return to work in rice mills across the state.State civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar, Civil Supplies Corporation chairman M Srinivas Reddy, Rytu Bandhu chairman P Rajeshwar Reddy and state nodal officer Sandeep Kumar Sultania received them at Lingampally station and offered them flowers and biscuit packets.Normally, these workers go to their native villages when the agricultural operations in the state are in full swing and return to Telangana to work in rice mills only after the harvesting season. This time, too, these workers had left for their native places much before the lockdown was enforced but were held up in their states.Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar said the migrant workers would work in rice mills in Miryalaguda, Nalgonda, Karimnagar, Jagitial, Peddapalli, Sultanabad, Siddipet, Mancherial and several other places in Telangana. They were sent to their respective destinations in buses arranged by the state road transport corporation.Masks were provided and physical distance was maintained in the trains and buses.On the other hand, thousands of migrant labourers from different parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have been demanding that the Telangana government make arrangements for their return to their native places.Though Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced that 40 special trains would be engaged everyday to ferry migrant workers to their respective states for one week, it could not keep its commitment as the other state governments had not given approval to accept these workers.Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar said so far, the state government could engage only 13 trains in three days. As per the standard operating protocol of the railways, no trains can be operated to other states to transport workers, unless these states allow them.“We have written letters to these state governments to allow trains carrying workers from their respective states. Once we get the clearance, we shall ferry the workers,” he said.Out of 2.61 lakh migrant workers who had registered their names with the police stations in their respective areas, only around 25,000 workers had been sent to their native places. Out of them, nearly 2.49 lakh workers are present within Greater Hyderabad limits.“I have been going to Gachibowli police station to know about the fate of the special train for the last one week. But the police are sending me back. How long should I wait?” asked Ram Vilas, a construction labourer from Katihar district in Bihar.For the last two days, hundreds of migrant workers have been thronging the police stations making similar enquiries. “They are not allowing us to go to our native places even on foot, nor are they making any alternative travel arrangements,” lamented Sunil Kumar from Gorakhpur.The Cyberabad police commissioner said it would take some time for the government to transport so many migrant labourers in view of limited number of trains and lack of consent from their respective state governments.He pointed out that labour-intensive activities like construction, industries have been started in Telangana. “As all the states are dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, all the people going there will be put under quarantine after medical examination. So, it is better for them to stay back and take part in the work to earn money,” Sajjannar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-reverse-migration-225-workers-from-bihar-return-to-telangana-to-work-in-rice-mills/story-aXJD7McGSLhb5A3zFoRdbO.html
08-05-2020||India||BRO makes Kailash Mansarovar Yatra easier for pilgrims||The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is set to become easier and smoother for pilgrims than ever before, with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) completing a key road in Uttarakhand that will cut travel time drastically as people will no longer have to undertake a grueling trek to reach the sacred place, the defence ministry said on Friday.Hundreds of pilgrims travel to the 6,638-metre Mount Kailash, located near Mansarovar Lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region, every year with the belief that circumambulating the holy mountain brings good fortune.The BRO has built a road from Dharchula to Lipulekh (the gateway to Kailash-Mansarovar) --- a stretch of 80 km --- at an altitude ranging from 6000 feet to 17,060 feet, creating the shortest route for the Yatra, the ministry said in a statement.“Now, people can drive up to Lipulekh in vehicles. They will no longer have to trek for five to six days,” said a senior government official. The new road is an extension of the Pithoragarh-Tawaghat-Ghatiabagarh road.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the new road link will allow pilgrims to complete the Yatra in just one week compared to two to three weeks it took earlier. He inaugurated the road through video conferencing.“While combating Covid-19 pandemic, the BRO in Uttarakhand has connected Kailash Mansarovar route to Lipulekh pass at a ht of 17,060 ft; thus providing connectivity to border villages and security forces,” the minister said on Twitter.“The arduous trek through treacherous high-altitude terrain can now be avoided. At present, the travel to Kailash-Mansarovar takes around two to three weeks through Sikkim or Nepal routes. The Lipulekh route had a trek of 90 km and the elderly yartris faced lot of difficulties,” the statement said.The routes through Sikkim and Nepal require the pilgrims to travel 20% of their journey on Indian roads and 80% on Chinese roads. “With the opening of new road, this ratio has been reversed. Now pilgrims will traverse 84% land journey on Indian roads and only 16% in China,” the defence ministry said.Singh said with the crucial road link had fulfilled the decades-old dreams and aspirations of local people and pilgrims.BRO chief Lieutenant General Harpal Singh said the construction of the road was a challenging task due to a raft of factors such as constant snow fall, high altitude and extremely low temperatures --- factors that restricted the annual working season to five months.One of the biggest challenges for the BRO is to arrange a large labour force to carry out construction of key roads and tunnels in far-flung areas as Covid-19 sweeps through the country, as reported by Hindustan Times on April 28.The BRO’s peak working season extends from May to November. Migrant workers are a key part of the BRO’s workforce involved in building strategic roads, along the country’s northern border with China, scattered across Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bro-makes-kailash-mansarovar-yatra-easier-for-pilgrims/story-4PPuxKOVbXRsVLWhC1gJpO.html

I appeal to the migrant labourers that they should not get restless. We are in touch with various states. Keep your patience for a few more days. Maharashtra government is with you,” Uddhav said.Uddhav’s assurance follows a similar appeal by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who said the state government was in the process of bringing back stranded labourers from other states. He pointed out that about 80,000 workers had already been repatriated.“I will like to make an appeal to all the labourers stranded in other states to stay where they are. The state government is making all arrangements to bring them back,” he said.The bodies of the migrant labourers will now be brought back to Madhya Pradesh after Chouhan spoke to Uddhav and Railways minister Piyush Goyal, requesting for a special train to bring back their bodies. Four others who were injured in the incident are under treatment.The labourers who were killed in the accident belonged to Shahdol and Umaria districts in Madhya Pradesh, said state police.Also Read: Aurangabad train accident: Loco pilot blew horn to warn labourers, says ministryThe Railways has announced a comprehensive probe into the accident which took place at 5.15 am near Karmad, around 30 km from Aurangabad.Madhya Pradesh government has announced of Rs 5 lakh each for the kin of the deceased as ex-gratia amount. A team of high ranking officials from Madhya Pradesh is flying to Aurangabad in a special plane and it will arrange for last rites of the labourers and the treatment of the injured.Several thousands of migrant labourers employed in Maharashtra have been desperate to reach home. While the state governments in partnership with the railways are now running special Shramik specials to take them home, several have been found to be walking along the highways in absence of interstate road transport during the nationwide lockdown clamped to slow down the spread of coronavirus.

The top court also asked special judge SK Yadav to make use of video conferencing facilities to ensure that recording of evidence is complete and there is no inordinate delay in concluding the trial.“We may indicate that video conferencing facilities are available and should be used by Shri Yadav in order to complete all evidence…We extend the period to complete evidence and deliver judgment till August 31”, the bench headed by justice Rohinton Nariman said after the special judge wrote to the court on May 6 stating that recording of evidence is yet to be completed.This would be the third time the court is setting a deadline for completion of trial in the 28-year-old case. The BJP leaders are on trial for the 1992 demolition of Babri Masjid at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. They have been charged for various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that include promoting enmity between religious groups (section 153A), making statements affecting national integration (section 153B) or which are likely to cause public mischief (section 505).In April 2017, the top court had ordered that additional charges of criminal conspiracy under section 120B of the IPC should be framed against the accused BJP leaders. BJP leader Kalyan Singh, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Masjid was demolished and who is one of the accused in the case, was given immunity by the top court under Article 361 of the Constitution since he was the Governor of Rajasthan. Article 361 affords protection to the President and Governor from criminal proceedings when in office.The apex court had also ordered the special court to complete trial within two years.However, the matter was taken up again by the Supreme Court in July 2019 after the special judge sought additional time to complete the trial and deliver his judgment. The apex court allowed the same and extended the deadline by 9 more months.The deadline expired on April 19 and the special judge Yadav wrote to the apex court on May 6 seeking further extension of time.The court then listed the case on Friday and decided to extend the deadline one last time.“We are cognisant of the fact that Shri Yadav is making all efforts in order that the trial reach a just conclusion. However, given the original time frame and the extended time frame, the effort must now be to complete the proceedings and deliver judgment latest by August 31,” the Supreme Court said.In its historic verdict on November 9 last year in the Babri demolition case, the court decided the title suit in favour of Hindu parties while also acknowledging that the demolition of the masjid which stood at the site was a “calculated act.”“During the pendency of the suits, the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship. The Muslims have been wrongly deprived of a mosque which had been constructed well over 450 years ago”, the November 9 judgment said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/complete-babri-trial-against-lk-advani-others-by-august-31-supreme-court/story-uNZIpR2DDn3UGMBdJta94J.html

On Thursday, the state recorded eight new cases and three more were registered on Friday, taking the state tally to 56.Seven of the 11 new cases in the last two days were detected in Silchar among returnees from Ajmer, but a couple among the other four found positive in Guwahati had no contact or travel history.“From these cases, we can clearly assume there is spread of coronavirus infection in Guwahati. That is why I request the public to immediately call 104 or get in touch with our healthcare personnel if they have symptoms of dry cough, fever, respiratory issues and diarrhoea,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Friday.The two Guwahati cases to have triggered an alarm include a 16-year-old girl who was detected to be Covid-19 positive after her death on Thursday and a 55-year-old woman. The other two cases include a doctor enrolled in MD course at Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) who was involved in the screening of Covid-19 patients at the hospital and the fourth person had returned from West Bengal on May 6.“We are sorry that since her disease couldn’t be detected earlier, the 16-year-old passed away. It is also unfortunate that the PG student who was involved in screening Covid-19 patients in GMCH was found positive,” Sarma said.Authorities have closed GMCH, the biggest hospital in Assam, for new patients till May 10 in order to sanitize the premises. A total of 386 persons including two GMCH professors, doctors, students, nurses and attendants have been placed in quarantine and their swabs taken for tests.The two hostels at GMCH for the PG students have been declared containment zones. Likewise, the employee’s colony of B. Barooah Cancer Institute (BBCI) where the 16-year-old girl was staying with her grandmother has also been turned into a containment zone.“We have decided to test all the 700 patients at the GMCH and all other doctors, nurses, hospital attendants etc for Covid-19. Talks are on with private labs in Delhi to get the tests done expeditiously,” Sarma said.In view of the latest developments, the state government has decided to put all persons returning to Assam in quarantine facilities at 5 different locations and test them for the virus.Till Thursday a total of 1032 persons had returned to Assam by road from other states using private vehicles or hired transport.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alert-in-assam-after-persons-with-no-contact-or-travel-history-test-covid-19-positive/story-XpxYnDGeUqUdXGJCgZi1NO.html

The first two flights from the UAE arrived in Kerala on Thursday.During the second week of the repatriation programme, there will be greater use of feeder flights both outside the country and within India, the people said. For instance, feeder flights could bring Indians stranded in Latin American countries to a point in the US for a return flight to India.“The main issue is the commercial viability of the operations to ensure what Air India does is self-sustaining. The flights are being operated at cost and this is not a profit-making venture,” the person cited above said, explaining why the government opted to charge for ferrying stranded nationals back to India.Noting that the government hadn’t charged for previous evacuation flights, the person added, “In the past, evacuations were from conflict zones and in emergency situations. Now, we are talking about a repatriation of people who want to return to India.“They have the means to return. They are studying and working abroad, they will finance their own return to India at minimum cost.”The people said the cost of tickets from West Asian states, for instance, were reasonable when compared to the rates of airlines from other countries that are currently operating. The government is also trying to increase the viability of Air India’s operations by allowing people on outbound flights provided they long-term visas or residency permits and the destination countries are willing to receive them, the people said.The external affairs ministry’s online platform, on which requests received by Indian missions from citizens wanting to return are regularly uploaded, has so far recorded a total of 67,833 requests. About 34% requests or about 22,500 were from students, 30% or nearly 16,000 from migrant workers, 9,250 from short-term visa holders whose visas had expired, more than 5,500 from people with medical emergencies or seeking treatment for terminal illnesses, more than 4,000 from stranded tourists, more than 3,000 from pregnant women and the elderly and more than 1,100 from people who wanted to return due to a death in the family.These repatriation requests were from Kerala, which topped the list with more than 25,200; Tamil Nadu, with some 6,600; Maharashtra, with about 4,300; Uttar Pradesh, with more than 3,715; Rajasthan, with more than 3,300; and Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi, all with more than 2,000 requests each.On Thursday, an Air India flight from Abu Dhabi to Kochi brought back 181 people while another Air India flight from Dubai to Kozhikode returned with 182 passengers. On Friday, an Air India flight from Singapore to Delhi returned with 234 passengers while another flight from Dhaka to Srinagar brought back 168 passengers.There will be a total of 27 flights from West Asia during the first week of Vande Bharat, including 11 from the UAE, five each from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and two each from Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.During the same period, there will be seven flights from Bangladesh to bring back nationals to Srinagar, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. There will be another 14 flights from Southeast Asia, including five each from Singapore and the Philippines and four from Malaysia.There will also be seven flights in the first week from four airports in the US – New York, Washington, Chicago and San Francisco, and seven more flights from London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vande-bharat-mission-to-be-expanded-to-russia-central-asia-europe-in-2nd-week/story-EprVKFYb9xDBTRgxbqcSbO.html

Besides, farming tools are designed only for men,” Sharma said.The skewed gender policy makes procuring of both seeds and loans difficult for women farmers, she added.The stakeholders urged the NCW to issue an advisory to all the states to ensure women get access to credit without any interest or collateral, as many don’t hold land titles and some are sharecroppers.Another suggestion was made to provide women with job cards under a scheme such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).The stakeholders advocated that women must get these opportunities amid a competitive labour market because many male migrant workers have headed home due to the loss of their livelihood triggered by the Covid-19 induced lockdown restrictions and a battered economy. It was also suggested a universal public distribution scheme (PDS) could be implemented coupled with bridging the gender wage gap in the farm sector.The percentage of women farmers and farm labourers is open to debate. An Oxfam report has cited that 70% of Indian cultivators and agriculture labourers are women, while a 2011 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) had pegged the figure at 30%.The 2017-18 Economic Survey pointed at the “feminisation” of the agriculture sector, as more women took up farm jobs.Seema Kulkarni of Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch (MAAKAM), who took part in the virtual discussions on Friday, said that widows of farmers, who committed suicides, are the most vulnerable amid the pandemic during this kharif season.“These widows haven’t sold their harvests. They have neither seed availability nor access to any resource. Loan waivers, too, haven’t been sanctioned, as most of them receive loans through self-help groups and microfinance that charge exorbitant rates of interest. The process of sanctioning loans needs to be institutionalised. Besides, a list of vulnerable women needs to be compiled on a priority basis,” she said.In January, MAKAAM had written to the Centre to write off farm loan debts and provide a monthly pension of Rs 5,000. It had also batted for MGNREGA job cards for women affected by farm loan suicides. The officials from the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development, department of agriculture, National Rural Livelihood Mission, National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, PM Kisan, and National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and also representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Oxfam, and MAAKAM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-credit-facilities-mgrega-job-cards-to-women-ncw-advisory-to-states/story-hiZb7GtJWVtDKY2eunxreL.html

He said it might take another 48 hours.With regards to the gas leak, he said it occurred during maintenance in preparation to restart production halted during the lockdown.At a review meeting in the morning, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy directed the officials to identify hazardous factories in and around Visakhapatnam located in densely populated areas.

No 223 of May 5 and also the norms stipulated by TASMAC and the court.While submitting some photographs and visuals of media reports, he said: “It is reported through visual media that officials of TASMAC and as well as the Police officials were unprepared to manage overcrowding at the shops.” Six hundred new Covid-19 positive cases, including 399 in Chennai, were reported in the state today, said state health minister C Vijayabaskar.The resumption of liquor sales in the state was welcomed with bursting of crackers and distribution of cakes by some boisterous booze lovers as consumers lined up in front of the stores since early morning to get their quota.Opposing the move to reopen the liquor stores, DMK president M K Stalin, clad in black, held a placard and a black flag in front of his house, claiming that opening of liquor shops would lead to further increase in the spread of coronavirus.The government had defended the move citing opening up of liquor stores in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and people going there in large numbers to buy booze.Even before the shops were opened at 10 am in non- containment zones, the queue extended upto a few kilometers in several localities including those that fall under Cuddalore, Villupuram, Kancheepuram, Chengelpet and Tiruvallur districts.Store workers sported masks and gloves while dispensing alcoholic beverages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-to-be-sold-only-through-online-or-door-delivery-orders-madras-hc/story-QgEBfbCmPp4nxQfTYKF1mI.html
08-05-2020||India||‘Rahul Gandhi out of sync with reality’: BJP’s sharp comeback on Covid-19 fight||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday accused senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of being out of touch with reality and out of sync with those state governments which had Congress at the helm amid the enormous health crisis brought about by the Covid-19 disease.“We don’t know which world Rahul Gandhi is living in. The fight against the coronavirus pandemic best exemplifies Team India spirit fostered by PM Narendra Modi. Views and experiences of state governments have largely contributed to the framing and revision of the Central government’s guidelines,” BJP spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao said, reacting to the Congress leader’s claim that India would lose the battle against Covid-19 if the fight was restricted to the Prime Minister’s Office.In a sharp criticism to the Congress leader’s comments where he said that the Prime Minister needed to devolve power and there would be a calamity if the BJP-led union government tried to centralise the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the BJP said that Gandhi was out of sync with even those states where the Congress was in power.ALSO READ | ‘Dispel fear among people about Covid-19’: Rahul Gandhi to PM Modi“Rahul Gandhi is out of touch with reality and out of sync with his own party ruled state governments,” the BJP spokesperson said.Earlier on Friday, Rahul Gandhi had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the fear among people about the coronavirus disease and also attempt to decentralise by making the states partners in decision-making.The former Congress president held an hour-long news briefing via a video conference, his second such in about a month. The senior Congress leader had earlier addressed the media on April 16, when he had emphasised that the lockdown was not a solution to defeat Covid-19 but just a pause button to curb the spread of the infection. He had also demanded a proper exit strategy from the nationwide lockdown which the Prime Minister, he had said, needed to inform the people of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-out-of-sync-with-reality-bjp-s-sharp-comeback-on-covid-19-fight/story-8cPlf3tDT3ao7eAAU596uN.html

It is part of the mandatory childhood immunization programme in many countries including India.“Our research showed that the rate of affected people is significantly lower in countries like ours than developed nations which did not make BCG vaccination mandatory,” said Prof Arindam Banik, director of a management institute, who led the group of four researchers from reputed institutes.“Such vaccination somehow dilutes the virulence of novel coronavirus and develops immunity among a large number of people,” he told PTI.Besides India, infants in countries like Portugal, Turkey, South Korea, Indonesia, Egypt and Ethiopia get BCG vaccination and all these countries have witnessed less Covid-19 cases. Whereas in the USA, Italy and the UK where that vaccination is not mandatory, a large number of people were afflicted with the disease, Banik said.The findings will come out in a prestigious journal soon.To calculate the rate of novel coronavirus infected people, the researchers took into account 45 days starting from the day the first such case was reported in a country and then divided its population by the number of Covid-19 cases.“The 45-day period varies from one country to another.If the starting point is February-end for Italy, it is early March for England, mid-January for China and March-end for India,” Banik told PTI.Asked about the contention by many health experts that the rate of affected people in India is no way less than countries like the US and the UK, Banik said epidemiologists divide the total number of affected with total number of tests and that shows the figure on the higher side.“We are confident that the Covid-19 situation will not be as severe in the later phase as in Europe where black, Asian migrants were the worst-hit as the healthcare system was less accessible to them,” he said.Besides BCG vaccination, the academician said, they analysed other factors that determine the fatality rates across 29 economies spread across both the developing and developed world.“We have explored various econometric models. Based on available data, our study revealed that factors such as public health system, population age structure, poverty level and BCG vaccination are powerful contributory factors in determining fatality rates among those afflicted with novel coronavirus,” he said.The findings also indicate that population age structure can lead to high fatality rate across countries.“The study shows that the population above 65 are at significant risk from Covid-19 contagion. Such findings are more consistent in the context of Europe. According to a WHO report, top 30 countries with the largest percentage of over- 65 population, all barring Japan are the member states in Europe and these countries are severely affected by Covid-19,” he said.Evidence shows that over 95 per cent of those died there are more than 65 years of age and over 50 per cent of all deaths were people aged 80 years or older, he said.“The WHO report also suggests that 8 out of 10 deaths are occurring in individuals with at least one underlying co- morbidity condition, particular those with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mandatory-bcg-vaccination-may-make-covid-19-less-virulent-in-india-study/story-iMvOo11WpAomquZMBi4jRP.html

It said Air India will operate 64 flights till May 13 to bring back around 15,000 Indians stranded abroad due to the coronavirus lockdown.India imposed a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country, grounding all domestic and international flights since late March.After the returnees reached IGI airport, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said all arrangements have been made for the Indians coming from other countries.“Delhi govt has made all arrangements for the Indians arriving from abroad,” he tweeted.All the arriving passengers were put through screening and triaging to find out any infection of coronavirus.After immigration and customs formalities, they headed towards paid quarantine facilities where they will spend 14 days, before going home.Officials in Srinagar said the 167 medical students underwent screening at the airport before they were sent to administrative quarantine for a period of 14 days as mandated under the guidelines issued for curbing the spread of COVID-19.Srinagar Deputy Commissioner Shahid Iqbal Chaudhary expressed his gratitude to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka for the “tremendous efforts” in getting these students home.“Profound gratitude to Indian High Commission @ihcdhaka for tremendous efforts. More to follow. For convenience of students -- bulk tickets next,” Chaudhary said in a tweet. The High Commission of India in Bangladesh had launched a dedicated link on its website for the registration for Indians wishing to return home. High Commissioner Riva Ganguly Das interacted with the students at the airport as they prepared to complete the formalities to fly back home.“It (the flight) is carrying only students. The students are enrolled in medical colleges in the country. We were in constant touch with them and their colleges have also taken good care of them,” she said in Dhaka prior to the departure.She further said that a total of seven flights will be operated from Dhaka.Strict precautionary measures were taken to ensure social distancing when the Indians arrived at the IGI airport. The returnees waved, smiled and gave thumbs-up to waiting mediapersons as they were taken to quarantine facilities in buses.“Those from Delhi will stay at 8-10 hotels that have been readied in New Delhi, South and South East Delhi as well as Aerocity, as paid quarantine facilities,” said a government official.Nearly 20 buses, including of DTC and neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, were deployed at IGI airport for carrying people to quarantine facilities.According to standard operating procedure of the government for Indians arriving at IGI airport, resident commissioners and nodal officers will take care of people of their respective states regarding transport and quarantine facilities.Several medical teams drawn from municipal corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council, and Rao Tula Ram Memorial Hospital were deployed for screening the passengers from Singapore.Meanwhile, an Air India flight with around 200 Indians from Sharjah will arrive in Lucknow on Saturday night, A K Sharma, director of the Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport, said. Over 700 Indians are also being evacuated by sea from the Maldives who were stranded in the scenic island due to the COVID-19 linked international travel restrictions.The Indian Navy’s amphibious warship INS Jalashwa reached Male on Thursday to undertake the massive repatriation mission named ‘Operation Samudra Setu’, the High Commission of India in Maldives said.The first Naval ship from Male is expected to arrive at the Cochin Port on May 10, Port Trust officials in Kochi said.The INS Jalashwa is properly equipped with relief materials, COVID-19 protection gear along with medical and administrative support staff.The INS Magar, an amphibious warfare vessel of the Indian Navy, will also join the repatriation mission in Male as part of the efforts to bring back around 1,000 stranded Indian nationals to the Kochi port in Kerala over the next few days.

In view of this all, the SPCBs should ensure immediate compliance of the advisory,” the note said.The SPCBs will have to ensure that pollution control equipment, connectivity of online emissions monitoring systems with the CPCB and state board servers, effluent treatment plants, including safety equipment, are kept in operational conditions before resuming operations after the lockdown restrictions are lifted.“The boards shall ensure that all units take utmost care in handling hazardous chemicals by using trained manpower,” the advisory said.“The SPCBs will closely monitor any violation of environmental norms, ensure the safety of workers and residents in the vicinity and that units comply with all conditions stipulated in the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemical (Amendment) Rules, 1989, and the Chemical Accidents (Emergency Planning, Preparedness, and Response) Rules, 1996 without fail,” it added.“Three industrial accidents occurred on Thursday, coincidentally, when factories are reopening after relaxations from Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. One commonality among these incidents has been poor operational and maintenance practices during the lockdown and the other is a shortage of skilled staff for maintenance work. Maintaining power stations or any industries with less staff is always a risk. Such incidents in this scenario are not surprising,” industry experts said.“The toll of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions has not only pulled the economy down, but has also put lives at risk for industrial workers and townships,” said Nivit Kumar Yadav of Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment’s (CSE) industrial pollution unit.“Styrene gas must be kept at a temperature below 17 degrees Celsius. However, since the Vishakhapatnam plant was under a partial shutdown mode, its maintenance activities were irregular. Another industrial disaster was reported at a paper mill in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, when gas leaks affected the unit’s housekeeping staff. The third incident occurred at Neyveli thermal power station, when two boilers of a 210-megawatt (MW) capacity plant blasted, and 10 people sustained injuries. While these boiler units were in a running condition, poor maintenance practices due to less manpower in the plant are being suspected as the reason for the blast. Industries are in haste to restart their operations after the lockdown restrictions are lifted, which could be detrimental to workers’ safety and that of the neighbourhood. We recommend better operational guidelines for industrial plants as they get set to resume their operations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-safety-audits-and-prevent-chemical-leakages-before-resuming-ops-cpcb-advisory-to-states/story-NqiDV3O2zJCA0vCkECXQkM.html

The state government had earlier received flak for not testing enough.Despite an increase, it is lagging behind Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, among others, in testing. While Bengal has conducted 32,572 tests till May 7, all these states had crossed the 30,000-mark by the third week of April.“We have increased the number of tests conducted per day more than 10 times since April first week. While on April 6 we had tested only 186 samples, on May 7 we tested 2611 samples,” said a senior official of the state health department.While the opposition parties and various doctors’ platforms had been criticising the state for low tests, the union home ministry sent a letter to the state’s chief secretary saying that Bengal’s response to Covid-19 has been characterised by a very low rate of testing in proportion to the population and a very high rate of mortality of 13.2%, which is the highest for any state.“The number of tests per million is now around 300. Even 10 days ago it was around 188 per million. We are lagging in tests (per million) because of various reasons. Initially, we didn’t have enough laboratories. Later, kits were found to be faulty, the matter had to be taken up with the ICMR,” said a top official of the state health department.Allegations had also surfaced that the state was not sending enough kits to the ICMR-NICED, which is a regional level Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) under the union health ministry. “While we started with only one testing facility in March, the state now has 17 testing facilities, including five private laboratories. In many districts, where the disease has a low prevalence rate, pool sampling is being done to cover as many people. We had also started rapid antibody tests but it had to be stopped after kits were found to be faulty by the ICMR,” said another health department official.With more tests being done every day the number of Covid-19 patients in the state has almost doubled in the last one week. While the number of infected patients on May 1 was 795, it has shot up to 1,548 till May 7. Around 79 people have died so far due to Covid-19, while another 72 Covd-19 patients have died due to comorbidity, the state government said.While West Bengal has just crossed 30,000 tests, some states have already conducted more than one lakh tests. Maharashtra has already tested more than two lakh samples, while Andhra Pradesh has done around 1.5 lakh tests till May 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/increased-10-times-bengal-after-criticism-over-low-covid-19-tests/story-WxhgLuaSnpVUpeYm1ijdCO.html

Local priests, too, resumed work and conducted the ash-immersion rituals.According to priests, normally in Haridwar, about 2000 to 5000 people arrive daily for ash-immersion rituals, post-cremation rituals and ‘Pitra Karmakand’ (forefather’s soul-related rites) which had been disrupted due to the nationwide lockdown affecting their livelihood.Har-Ki-Pauri is considered to be an ancient place with religious significance. It is believed that nectar of the gods had fallen here after a tug-of-war between deities and demons, as per Hindu mythology.Haridwar district administration, however, has specified that only two persons and a driver are allowed to accompany an urn to be immersed at Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga Ghat.Cabinet spokesperson Madan Kaushik said that adherence to the guidelines issued by the local administration and health department regarding Covid-19 preventive measures like wearing of face masks, social distancing and time-bound return to their respective home destinations was a must for carrying out the rituals.Terming the decision as a step in the right direction, office bearers of Ganga Sabha, the main managing body of Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga Ghat, said ash immersion should have been allowed a fortnight ago.“Ash immersion rituals are part of ancient tradition and customs which help in providing salvation (moksha) to the departed soul. It’s quite sad that after funeral rites people had to keep urns of the deceased for quite some time, but now the government has taken the right decision to allow it again,” said Pradeep Jha, president Ganga Sabha.Haridwar priests, who had last week submitted a memorandum to the state government demanding the lifting of the prohibition at Har-Ki-Pauri, were quite busy as people with urns turned up at the Ghats from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR region, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and even beyond.Akhil Bharatiya Yuva Teerth Purohit president Ujjwal Pundit said the lockdown has severely affected their livelihood as they primarily depend on last rites related rituals and special prayers for the deceased.There are nearly 2000 priests in Haridwar involved in ash immersion rituals for several generations.Meanwhile, the ashram and dharamshala owners have demanded the opening of some eateries and tea stalls at Har-Ki-Pauri for people coming from other states.“We have been waiting for more than a week to get the permission, finally Uttarakhand government has granted the same. We have been traveling for the past seven hours. We have reached Haridwar and it is overwhelming that finally, we will be able to immerse the ashes in the Ganga,” said Vijay Singh from Haryana.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ash-immersion-in-haridwar-begins-on-uttarakhand-s-nod-to-rituals-for-the-dead/story-2J5MgkO0d5FDdbC24dJ32L.html

In his plea, he said, churches can be opened with 25% occupancy and he contended that the long lockdown is leaving a spiritual vacuum among devotees.The petitioner Saju Joseph pleaded that since most norms were eased in the state, regulated visits of devotees to churches could be allowed. Hearing the plea, the court observed that the state was yet to come out of the pandemic threat and many churches are providing virtual offerings these days. Justice Shaji P Chaly who was heading the division bench said no devotee was affected by the closure as he could access visuals of ceremonies online.But the counsel for the petitioner contended that devotees can’t receive ‘holy communion’ due to the closure of churches. Continued closure of religious places of worship is leaving a spiritual vacuum among believers and they can be opened after adhering to social distancing norms. He also suggested that each church can carry 25% of its occupancy to suit this.But both, the Union and state governments, opposed the plea vehemently saying no relaxation can be made at this juncture. They said any concessions to a particular sect will open a floodgate and weaken the strict lockdown norms. Big religious gatherings, private parties, wedding ceremonies, political meetings and receptions can’t be allowed now, they said. The court later adjourned the hearing till May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-kerala-hc-to-open-churches-with-25-occupancy-amid-lockdown/story-WZJ2XdCyvJav6ZUT3hXhQN.html

After walking for about 36 kilometres, these workers started feeling tired and sat on the track between Karnad and Badnapur railway stations for taking some rest. They gradually went into deep sleep.It was at 5.22 am that the approaching goods train ran over these labourers, the railways ministry said in a statement. The driver tried to stop the train but couldn’t do so in time, it added.An inquiry has been ordered into the incident by the railway authorities.The railway safety watchdog has written to the ministry saying that the labourers who were crushed by the goods train were lying on the railway tracks as they were under the impression that no trains have been plying since the lockdown.“Apparently, the affected persons had gathered along the track under the impression that the train services have been suspended due to Covid-19 lockdown. Furthermore, false sense of security may have come to their minds about there being no trains on run whereas freight, parcel specials have been running from before and now migrant specials have also started plying,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-rights-commission-sends-notice-to-maharashtra-after-16-migrants-killed-in-train-accident/story-wEgy5OcQD7EtZvFlId561N.html

08-05-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi offers Centre 8 point remedy for Covid-battered economy||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has recommended implementation of an eight-point formula to revive the Indian economy and reduce the financial stress caused by the coronavirus outbreak in the country.The Congress on Friday released the recommendations in a statement attributed to the former party president and Wayanad MP a few hours after he expressed his opinions on the government’s Covid-19 containment efforts in a digitised live chat session.Gandhi’s statement questions why the Centre had not announced a second fiscal relief package for individuals and businesses like other prominent economies in the west. “In India, the government has been dragging its feet on announcing an economic package targeting vulnerable groups like farmers, migrant labourers and daily wage earners as well as industry clusters like travel and tourism, automobiles, retail, etc. that have been severely damaged,” the statement says.The longer the government “delays” announcing this package the more “the pain” will grow, it adds.The statement then goes on to offer the contours of an economic stimulus package that has emerged during an internal consultative process in the Congress party.Here is a summation of the main recommendations listed in Gandhi’s statement.1. Income Support- Extend income support to at least 13 crore poorest households. Transfer Rs 7,500 preferably to each household. Even if only Rs 5,000 is transferred to each of the 13 crore poorest households, then it will only amount to Rs 65,000 crore, which we can and must afford.2. MGNREGA- 100 days of guaranteed employment under the scheme should be doubled to 200 days. Close to 28-30% of our population now resides in urban areas where a programme like MGNREGA should be introduced.3. Food Security- Ensure food security for even 11 crore people outside the PDS. Please ensure delivery of 10 kg food grains (rice or wheat) 1 kg pulses and 1 kg sugar to every individual for a period of next six months.4. Agriculture and Farmers – Empower and support the ‘Anndata’ farmer by transferring Rs 10,000 as urgent economic support to each of the 8.22 crore PM KISAN Yojana accounts. Purchase every ounce of food grains at MSP and remove GST on fertilizers, pesticides and agriculture equipment immediately.5. MSMEs- 6.25 crore MSMEs generate over 11 crore jobs. Give 1 lakh crore ‘Wage Protection Scheme’ and 1 lakh crore ‘Credit Guarantee Scheme’ to MSMEs. Give six months interest subsidy as equal to six months of interest on loan taken by SMEs.6. Large Industries – Similar credit guarantee and interest subsidy facilities must be extended to big businesses as well. This will ensure that the value chain survives and no layoffs happen.7. Shopkeepers- Except for hotspots, retail supply chains should be restored to bring relief to around 7 crore shopkeepers.8. Migrant labour – I am deeply disturbed and saddened by trains being cancelled and migrants being forced to stay back in some states. They are not bonded labour and should be allowed to return home according to their own free will.

The duo sprayed petrol on the victim and burned him when he was sleeping around 3am on Thursday.The deceased has been identified as 40-year-old Shyam Sundar Kumhar. According to police officials, the incident was reported from Chak 6 PHM village falling under Khajuwala police station area. “Around 7pm, Kumhar, who is a mechanic, returned from the workshop where he worked. He had his dinner and was using mobile phone till 1am. Around 3am in the morning, his daughter, identified as Priyanka (19) along with her mother Pushpa (38), went inside Kumhar’s thatch where he was sleeping on bed. Priyanka was carrying a jug with petrol which she sprinkled on her father’s mouth and bed and Pushpa lit a torch made by tying a cloth on the branch of a neem tree and put it on her husband’s mouth and fled the spot,” said Vikram Singh, station house officer (SHO), Khajuwala police station.The fire later spread across the thatch and Kumhar was burnt alive. The neighbours informed the police about the incident after which a team of police and officials of the forensic science laboratory reached the spot for inspection.The mother-daughter duo, hiding in an old army bunker located 10 kilometres away from the village, was caught on the basis of the footprints made in the sand dunes from the incident site to the bunker.“Kumhar was a mechanic which is why he used to keep petrol in his home and her wife was aware of this. Both of them have been detained. The daughter said that her age is 19 but that is yet to be confirmed,” the Khajuwala SHO added.The neighbours told police that Kumhar got married to Pushpa Devi, resident of Goluwala village, 20 years ago but the couple used to have frequent fights. Because of the fights, the deceased man had built a separate house for the family to live.Apart from Priyanka, the couple have two more children – one son, identified as Daya Shankar who studies in a private school in Sikar and another daughter, 10-year-old Sapna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40-yr-old-man-burnt-to-death-by-wife-daughter-in-rajasthan-bikaner/story-pUe2dW1DxVmaVAe3xbH82H.html

The judge said he will have to be treated at a government hospital.Acting on Bhatt’s plea, Justice Dangre had on May 6 directed a public prosecutor to “make a statement about the situation in connection with Covid-19 prevailing in Arthur Road jail”.His plea filed through advocate Kiran Padalkar, stated that “the applicant is aged 66 years and a chronic heart patient who has undergone by-pass surgery and diagnosed with coronary artery disease and also suffering from hypertension.”Bhatt had sought interim bail in view of the Supreme Court’s directive to states and union territories to decongest prisons in view of the coronavirus pandemic.CBI counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had, however, opposed the plea stating that pursuant to the directives of the apex court, a High Power Committee constituted by the state government has decided to grant temporary bail only to the prisoners charged with offences punishable with not more than 7 years imprisonment and Bhatt’s case was not covered under the apex court directives.Justice Dangre, had however, noted the apprehension expressed by the accused because of his peculiar health condition and the health crisis being faced by the world, and directed the public prosecutor to make the statement on Friday.Additional public prosecutor Shahaji Shinde, accordingly on Friday, informed the court that a number of inmates and some staff members of the Arthur Road jail have been found to be infected with coronavirus and Bhatt was among those inmates.In a massive fraud allegedly perpetuated by fugitive jeweller Nirav Modi and his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi, CBI has also booked Bhatt and others under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. They are also booked by the enforcement directorate under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.According to information given by the Maharashtra home department, 77 inmates and 26 staff members of the Arthur Road jail have tested positive for the coronavirus infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pnb-bank-fraud-accused-hemant-bhatt-tests-covid-19-positive-hc-rejects-temporary-bail-plea/story-iJmmzw0cmkLyqunCi1UzhP.html

The railway safety watchdog, who is appointed under the civil aviation ministry, has written a letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, saying that the labourers who were crushed by the goods train were lying on the railway tracks as they were under the impression that no trains have been plying since the lockdown. “Apparently, the affected persons had gathered along the track under the impression that the train services have been suspended due to Covid-19 lockdown. Furthermore, false sense of security may have come to their minds about there being no trains on run whereas freight, parcel specials have been running from before and now migrant specials have also started plying,” he wrote. At least 16 migrant labourers were crushed to death in the early hours of Friday morning by a goods train in Maharashtra after they fell asleep on the tracks. An inquiry has been ordered by the railway safety commissioner. “It is with a heavy heart that I solicit your kind attention to the unfortunate incident of around 14-16 persons run over by a goods train…as discussed with you, statutory inquiry by CRS has been ordered into this incident,” he wrote. “Now that such an incident of migrants or other persons walking along the track leading to consequent deaths have come to notice, all our efforts must be made to prevent recurrence of such incidents in the future,” he added. The safety commissioner said, as an abundant precaution, it is essential that all railway personnel connected with train operations, maintenance, and patrolling activities should be cautioned to immediately communicate any occurrence of persons walking along the track, “if noticed by them, to the nearest station so that necessary action like caution order to all passing trains…may be taken.” The safety commissioner has instructed that a ‘caution order’ will have to be given to ensure special precautions. “In consequence of the line being under repair or for any other reason, special precautions are necessary, a Caution Order detailing the kilometres between which such precautions are necessary, the reasons for taking such precautions, and the speed at which a train shall travel, shall be handed to the Loco Pilot at the stopping station immediately short of the place where such precautions are necessary, or at such other stations and in such manner, as prescribed under special instructions,” the letter said. The loco pilot driving the freight train that was involved in the incident of running over labourers in Aurangabad district, Maharashtra, had tried to warn them by honking upon spotting them and also tried to stop the train, the railway ministry said Friday. “The Controller or the Centralised Traffic control Operator, on becoming aware of such defect or failure, shall inform the same to the railway servant responsible for the maintenance of the equipment and other railway servants concerned,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-thought-trains-not-plying-railway-safety-watchdog-after-16-killed/story-aNOeQXjljXE12xucIbNDNK.html
08-05-2020||India||Trucks carrying essential goods during lockdown being used to traffick drugs: NCB||The free inter-state movement of trucks and other essential goods carrying vehicles during the lockdown period is being misused by criminals to traffick drugs in the country, the NCB said on Friday after it busted some rackets.The federal agency, over the last two weeks, seized 60 kg of opium, a total of 61,638 psychotropic tablets, 840 bottles of codeine based cough syrup and 574 kgs of ‘ganja’ (cannabis) after conducting operations across the country. “It is worrying to note that drug traffickers are using the free inter-state movement of essential commodity vehicles during the lockdown period to aid the trafficking efforts,” Narcotics Control Bureau’s Deputy Director (operations) K P S Malhotra said. The agency has increased vigil across all state borders in view of these new developments, he added. The country is in the third phase of the lockdown, that began on March 25, to cut the chain of coronavirus infection. The sleuths of the anti-narcotics agency intercepted a Maharashtra registered truck on the intervening night of May 4-5 in Kodapura area of Surat (Gujarat) and recovered 574 kgs of cannabis that was allegedly concealed under a load of potatoes. “The consignment had its origin in Odisha and was sourced to Surat. The trafficking network is spread across the states of Gujarat, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra,” Malhotra said. In a similar seizure, an NCB team seized 60 kgs of opium from a Haryana registered truck from the Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh on April 28. The narcotics was recovered from “under the driver’s seat,” the officer said. Initial investigation reveals that the opium was sourced from near Chouparan in Jharkhand and was destined to Haryana, another senior official of the agency said. B Singh, the driver and the owner of the truck, has been arrested.   It is uncommon for opium to be sourced from Jharkhand and all efforts are being made to trace the source of the seized drug, he added.   In an another case, the agency seized  61,368 psychotropic tablets and 840 bottles of codeine based cough syrup from the Patan district of Gujarat on April 26. A person, J Kumar Patel, was arrested by the agency under the provision of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS). These drugs cannot be sold by any medical store without a valid medical prescription from a registered medical practitioner, Malhotra said. Such drugs, he added, usually reach the illegal market by way of diversion from illicit drug manufacturers, wholesalers or retail chemists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trucks-carrying-essential-goods-during-lockdown-being-used-to-traffick-drugs-ncb/story-axQyQYN2DtLO216b98MBKJ.html
08-05-2020||India||Kerala HC seeks govt response on plea against Aarogya Setu||The Kerala high court on Friday sought the response of the central government to a plea challenging its May 1 directive to make the mobile application, Aarogya Setu, mandatory for all persons working in government and private companies.The bench headed by justice Shaji P Chaly, however, did not stay the government directive but asked authorities to file a response by May 12. The petitioner, John Daniel, who is the general secretary of the Thrissur district Congress committee, challenged the government’s order, alleging that it violates the privacy and autonomy of an individual. He submitted that Aarogya setu collects personal information without the consent of an individual. He also pointed out that the Centre’s directive asked states to act under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against anyone who does not install the app. Section 188 states that any person who disobeys an order given by a public servant can be punished with imprisonment of up to six months.“If a particular citizen disapproves the use of the same, it could be said that the information was forcibly and coercively taken from him without his consent and by inflicting fear of penal consequences. Such coercive and forcible extraction of personal information from an individual is unheard of in a democratic and republic setup and it is attribute of a dictatorial system,” the petition stated.The central government launched Aarogya Setu on April 2 to disseminate information regarding Covid-19 and to collect data from individuals. It uses a smartphone’s GPS and bluetooth features to track people with coronavirus infection. It uses bluetooth to determine whether or not an individual has been within six feet of a Covid-19 patient by scanning through the database of cases across India.On April 29, the app was made mandatory for all central government employees. On May 1, it was extended to all employees employed in private and public institutions.The petitioner’s argument was that the app is a tracking a mobile application which continuously collects data of an individual once installed on a mobile phone. By forcing people to download the app, there is no question of consent in providing personal information, the petitioner claimed.Autonomy of an individual is central to the right to life as per the 2017 judgment of the Supreme Court in KS Puttaswamy, the petitioner submitted.“There arises no question of consent in the providing of information which has been made compulsory. Hence, when a citizen of the Nation downloads and uses the application, complying with the directives [of the central government], there is absolutely no consent obtained from him,” the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-seeks-govt-response-on-plea-against-aarogya-setu/story-u02vN6ny0EMsqtjIKvKhgM.html

Under this, ICMR will conduct the trial in 21 hospitals, to assess safety & efficacy of convalescent plasma,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry.Agarwal said five of these hospitals were in Maharashtra, four in Gujarat, two each in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, and one each in Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana and Chandigarh.Convalescent plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from cured Covid-19 patients and injecting them in the blood of sick patients suffering from coronavirus. The transfusion of plasma is carried out through a machine which separates the plasma from the blood which is then retransferred into the donor. The plasmas thus obtained is injected into a sick coronavirus patient. A donor supplies 300-500 ml of plasma and the transfusion process takes between 60-90 minutes.An antibody is a passive vaccine which assists in bringing down the viral load thus controlling the infection.The Union health ministry had advised against considering plasma therapy to be an approved treatment for coronavirus and added it should only be used for research and trial purposes to check its efficacy. If used indiscriminately, the therapy could lead to life-threatening complications.Experts have opined that large scale use of Plasma therapy is limited by the availability of the volume of plasma and the challenge of its careful screening for the presence of other infections that if unwittingly transferred to the recipient, can lead to complications.Two coronavirus patients were given convalescent plasma therapy at the SMS hospital in Jaipur a couple of days ago and doctors said they showed improvement. They also said that it was important to understand at what stage a patient requires plasma therapy.In Mumbai, however, Maharashtra’s first novel coronavirus patient to undergo the clinical trial for plasma therapy died last month.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21-hospitals-across-india-cleared-for-stage-2-of-plasma-therapy-most-in-worst-hit-maharashtra/story-OXEPRbyLnn7cjomcb0CrtL.html

08-05-2020||India||‘Stay where you are’: Shivraj Chouhan appeals to migrants after train tragedy||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday appealed to stranded migrant workers to stay wherever they are. Chouhan’s comments came hours after 16 migrants who were sleeping on railway tracks were run over by a train in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad.“I will like to make an appeal to all the labourers stranded in other states to stay where they are. The state government is making all arrangements to bring them back. The process is going on in full swing and we will accomplish the mission with support of railways. About 80,000 labourers have been brought back,” said Chouhan.Having walked several kilometres, the labourers sat down for rest on the tracks and then fell asleep. Soon after a goods train ran over them. The accident took place between Jalna and Aurangabad in the Nanded Division of South Central Railway. The Railways have ordered an inquiry into the incident after CM Chouhan dialled minister Piyush Goyal seeking a probe. The labourers who were killed in the accident belonged to Shahdol and Umaria districts in Madhya Pradesh, said police. The authorities are trying to verify the identity of each and every labourer, said Superintendent of police, Shahdol, Satyendra Shukla.Twelve among those who were identified are: Achchhelal Kachhi, Ajit Jeevan Singh, Brijgendra Singh, Muneem Singh and Nemshah Singh, all residents of Umaria district; Suresh Kol, Dharmendra Singh, Brajesh Gond, Rajbaba Horan Singh, Brajesh Singh and Shivdayal Gajraj Singh from Shahdol district; and Indrakumar Mauryaveer, a resident of Katni district in Madhya Pradesh.A police officer said the labourers worked in a steel plant in Jalna district. They left Jalna at 7 pm on Thursday and walked on the road to Badnapore. Later they started walking along the railway tracks, he added. “As they got tired having walked about 36 kilometres, they sat on the railway track to have some rest. Later, they fell asleep on the tracks when the train ran over them,” said the officer.CM Chouhan has announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 5 lakh each to next to the kin of the deceased. “A team of high ranking officials from Madhya will fly to Aurangabad in a special plane. The team will make all arrangements for last rites of the labourers and treatment of the injured,” said Chouhan.Congress leader Digvijaya Singh sought answers from the state government over the tragedy.“Did the Madhya Pradesh government have the labourers registered? If registration was done, what were arrangements made by the state government to bring them back? The government should feel ashamed. Instead of issuing statements, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should do something for the labourers,” said Singh.(With input from Monika Pandey in Jabalpur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stay-where-you-are-shivraj-chouhan-appeals-to-migrants-after-train-tragedy/story-81XzUROI3DWY6hIB59it4N.html
08-05-2020||India||In the back-end of the Covid-19 fight, big data works silently||“We are now at the bottom of the peak,” says Dr Deepak Agrawal, professor of neurosciences at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). What he means is that the Covid-19 pandemic in India hasn’t reached a stage in which the number of cases multiplies exponentially. And India, he said, shouldn’t reach a crisis point like the US did, when the fight against Covid-19 was hindered by a critical shortage of ventilators that meant doctors had to decide who among a myriad patients needed to be put on one.Agrawal is the co-inventor, along with robotics engineer Divakar Vaish, of the world’s smallest full intensive care unit portable ventilator. It runs on an Android platform and is already in use at ICUs in AIIMS, the country’s most reputed public hospital.The device, with 600 installations, is proving handy in the fight against Covid-19. To be sure, the share of Covid-19 patients needing a ventilator right now remains small in India, Agrawal said.Behind the scenes, India’s fight against the coronavirus is a high-tech battle, thanks to the country’s vanguard software services industry. Federal authorities are reaping its fullest potential in fighting a pandemic that has infected 56,342 people so far.Technology developers are working at breakneck speed for solutions, making officials at the state-run policy think-tank, Niti Aayog, picky.The story starts with low-cost ventilators and goes all the way to artificial intelligence (AI) applications and drone-monitored social distancing, a review by the interministerial empowered group no. 6 (EG 6) shows. EG 6, one of the several federal panels formed to contain the spread of Covid-19, is headed by Niti Aayog’s CEO Amitabh Kant and responsible for leveraging technologies against Covid-19.A dystopian scenarioFor arriving employees at Fastrek, a courier company in Hyderabad, the first point of reporting isn’t the supervisor, but an automated thermal scanner. It’s a dystopic scene. Masked employees stand face-to-face before a robot that records temperatures. Such screening is essential to catching the coronavirus infection early.Similarly, Gurugram-based Staqu Technologies has installed AI-enabled thermal imaging cameras for screening essential services workers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Staqu Technologies’s built-in thermal device can measure body temperature from a distance of up to 10 metres and prints workers’ entry passes.Asimov Robotics’s “Karmi-bot” is trialling medicine dispensing duties at isolation wards in hospitals. It can even conduct video calls with caregivers. “These are just a few of the innovators who are taking the fight to the pandemic,” said Kant.In India’s Covid-19 fightback, big-data analysts sit silently at the back end. “Data and technology are the biggest warriors in the fight against Covid-19. And one of the things they can do is recommend the extent of lockdown on a hyperlocal level in a granular manner. Such a level of complex decision making is impossible to make without the use of data,” says Ashwin Srivastava, the CEO of Sapio, an AI solutions firm.The authorities have carved up the country’s districts into hotspots, non-hotspots, red, orange and green zones, depending on their vulnerability and Covid-19 case counts.Sapio Umbrella’s lockdown platform, which uses big data technology, claims to provide an optimum plan for lockdowns, down to the village level that can be extrapolated to larger areas.Privacy concernsThe government’s Aarogya Setu, a contact tracing app, reached 80 million downloads in just over 13 days, making it the world’s fastest downloaded app, according to Kant.Smartphone tools have become popular globally for tracking people for Covid-19. As surveillance goes viral in India, like elsewhere, it has set off demand for privacy preserving solutions.“Everything is presented as though it is an inevitable trade-off,” said Prasanna S, a lawyer who has voiced concern over privacy violations in the fight against Covid. “If the government asks us to part of with our privacy, then there needs to be rigour and hard empirical basis. For instance, there should be evidence to say that a specific application is going to be safe and has a 50% chance of flattening the curve,” he said.In the absence of a vaccine, Gupta says, the right technology is critical to fight the worst pandemic in a century. Federal officials are gung-ho about the support they have received from technology developers, who see future business potential.“If the results are so encouraging in the health sector, then with adequate support and a robust regulatory framework, this can be replicated across most sectors, helping India become self-sufficient and the nerve centre for growth and capability,” says Kant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-back-end-of-the-covid-fight-big-data-works-silently/story-PzzI8szh3T5ztIMW9JoDoJ.html

A high-level inquiry headed by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (South Central Circle) has been ordered to investigate the incident and find out the cause. “The Commissioner of Railway Safety will hold an independent inquiry in today’s labourers runover incident in Parbhani-Manmad section of Nanded Railway division of South Central Railway,” the ministry said. Union Railways minister Piyush Goyal is closely monitoring the situation and it is being briefing on the steps taken in this regard, it added.According to railways, the workers left Jalna at 7 pm on Thursday and initially walked on road and later onto the track towards Aurangabad. After walking for about 36 kilometres, these workers started feeling tired and sat on the track between Karnad and Badnapur railway stations for taking some rest and gradually went into deep sleep.Also read: Railway Ministry orders inquiry into Aurangabad train accident“In an unfortunate event that occurred in the wee hours of May 8, morning, around 5:22 hrs, a group of persons who were sleeping on railway tracks, were hit by a goods train proceeding towards Mandmad. The incident occurred between Badnapur and Karmad stations on the Parbhani-Manmad section of Nanded Division,” it added. Five others who were injured were taken to the Aurangabad Civil Hospital, railways said. The accident happened between Jalna and Aurangabad in the Nanded Division of South Central Railway in Karmad police station area of the Aurangabad district.“Out of the group comprising of about 19 persons, 14 succumbed to death on the spot and 2 have succumbed to the injuries subsequently. One person with minor injuries is being treated at the Aurangabad Civil Hospital,” the ministry said. Maharashtra Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) on Friday announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of those who were killed in the Aurangabad train accident.According to a senior official, the railways does not consider accidents that happen due to external factors as ‘railway accidents’ and hence is not bound to provide ex-gratia relief to the victim’s families. “It is provided only in accidents where the railway is involved such as derailment of trains etc. In this case, states and the Centre are likely to provide the relief,” the official said.Also read: Madhya Pradesh CM announces Rs 5 lakh aid for kin of labourers killed in Maharashtra“Extremely anguished by the loss of lives due to the rail accident in Aurangabad, Maharashtra.

Opposition parties alleged the Centre’s transport policy of providing buses and trains to transport migrant workers during the Covid-19 lockdown was poorly designed. “It is obvious that the transport policy of providing buses and trains to transport migrant workers was poorly designed, planned, coordinated and implemented. Once the policy was announced, government should have gone to the rescue of the trekkers and provided buses or trains to them to continue their journey. The tragedy that happened this morning could have been avoided if governments had gone to the rescue of the migrant workers in time,” Congress Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aurangabad-train-accident-loco-pilot-blew-horn-to-warn-labourers-says-ministry/story-6w346N8zEfF9U7lElypx0I.html

The account was deactivated immediately after reactions started coming in, criticising his comment.The AAP executive member has been speaking about issues related to the migrants who have been trying to return to their hometowns. Her post, which led to her being abused on Twitter, related to the death of 16 migrant workers who were killed on a rail track in Aurangabad on Friday.  Why are these migrants still walking? Doesnt @PiyushGoyal have a train to run them over with?#ShameOnBJP https://t.co/QCjgp8yy9AThe abuse against Sharma led to widespread outrage on social media. The Twitter user reportedly resorted to an abusive comment while suggesting means to Sharma for protecting the migrants from running over. “I have already made an online complaint to Mumbai police but have not yet got any reply from them. I am also sending a written complaint and mail to Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, home minister Anil Deshmukh and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with details about the person,” Sharma said.“I have gathered some information about the person who tweeted about me, his name is Shashank Singh and he is from Kolkata but I am not sure.

08-05-2020||India||Andhra Pradesh gas leak: NGT slaps interim penalty of Rs 50 cr on LG Polymers India||The National Green Tribunal slapped an interim penalty of Rs 50 crore on LG Polymers India and sought response from the Centre and others on Friday in the gas leak incident in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, saying “there appears to be a failure to comply with the said Rules and other statutory provisions”.A bench, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, set up a 5-member Committee to probe Thursday’s gas leak incident in the chemical factory, in which 11 people were killed and 1,000 exposed, and submit a report before May 18.“Having regard to the prima facie material regarding the extent of damage to life, public health and environment, we direct LG Polymers India Pvt Ltd to forthwith deposit an initial amount of Rs 50 crore, with the District Magistrate, Vishakhapatnam, which will abide by further orders of this tribunal. The amount is being fixed having regard to the financial worth of the company and the extent of the damage caused,” the bench said.The NGT issued notices to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, L G Polymers India, Andhra Pradesh State Pollution Control Board, Central Pollution Control Board, Vishakhapatnam District Magistrate and sought their response before May 18, the next date of hearing.The committee comprises former AP High Court judge Justice B Seshasayana Reddy; V Rama Chandra Murthy, Former Vice Chancellor, Andhra University, Vizag; Professor Pulipati King, Head of Chemical Engineering Department, Andhra University; CPCB Member Secretary, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology Director, and head of NEERI in Vizag.The NGT directed Vishakhapatnam DM and regional office of State Pollution Control Board to provide logistic support to the committee to enable their fact-finding and reporting. “The Chairman, CPCB may steer and facilitate the functioning of the committee using available technology. CPCB will bear the initial cost of functioning of the Committee to the extent necessary. The committee will be at liberty to take assistance of such experts, individuals and institutions as may be considered necessary,” the bench said.The committee may visit and inspect the site at the earliest and give its report before May 18 by email and the site visit may be initially conducted by members available locally in consideration with outside members online, the NGT said.The committee has to submit report on sequence of events, causes of failure and persons and authorities responsible, extent of damage to life among others.The NGT said that Styrene gas is a hazardous chemical as defined under Rule 2(e) read with Entry 583 of Schedule I to the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemical Rules, 1989 and the Rules require on-site and off-site Emergency Plans to ensure prevention of damage. “There appears to be a failure to comply with the said Rules and other statutory provisions. Leakage of hazardous gas at such a scale adversely affecting public health and environment, clearly attracts the principle of ‘Strict Liability’ against the enterprise engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous industry,” the bench said, adding that such an entity is liable to restore the damage caused under the Environment Law, apart from other statutory liability. The statutory authorities responsible for authorising and regulating such activities may also be accountable for their lapses, the NGT said.The matter was taken up suo-motu (on its own) by NGT on the basis of media reports to the effect that leakage of hazardous gas, Styrene, took place on May 7 from a chemical factory owned by the South Korean company LG Polymers India Pvt Ltd, R.R. Venkatpuram village, Pendurthy Mandal, Vishakhapatnam resulting in death of 11 persons. A major early morning chemical leak from a polymer plant near Visakhapatnam impacted villages in a five-km radius, leaving many people dead and scores of citizens suffering from breathlessness and other problems, as the AP government ordered a probe into the issue. The leak was noticed by company staff who were reportedly inspecting machines to restart the factory and raised an alarm.Hours after the styrene gas leak around 2.30 am on Thursday from the multinational L G Polymers Plant at R R Venkatapuram village near here, scores of people could be seen lying unconscious on sidewalks, near ditches and on the road, raising fears of a major industrial disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-gas-leak-ngt-slaps-interim-penalty-of-rs-50-cr-on-lg-polymers-india/story-M1Djsf1TjLlvSCvJFqy9uN.html
08-05-2020||India||RSS labour wing criticises move to amend labour laws amid Covid-19 outbreak||The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the labour wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has criticised the move by the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Uttar Pradesh (UP) governments to amend their labour laws, alleging that the hurriedly made decisions would strip workers of job security amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak across the country.In a bid to woo investors to their respective states and make a desperate bid to emerge as an alternative manufacturing hub to China amid the Covid-19 crisis, both MP and UP announced a raft of changes to their labour laws this week.While MP has allowed longer working hours and a 1,000-day labour law holiday for new investors, UP has also brought in Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance, 2020, exempting companies from complying with several labour norms for the next three years.The BMS, which claims the affiliation of over 6,000 labour unions, said it would urge the Centre to prevail upon the state governments to roll back their ‘labour-unfriendly’ decisions.“This is the worst time to make amendments to the labour laws. These changes will make the workers more vulnerable to job losses, especially at a time when the country should be joining hands to rebuild their lives and the economy hit by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said CK Saji Narayana, president, BMS.He said the heart-wrenching reports of stranded migrant labourers across states, who have been forced to sleep on railway tracks and walk back for hundreds of kilometres to their native places due to the nationwide lockdown restrictions, are growing evidence of “workers being treated badly by both their employers and the government”.The BMS chief demanded a universal safety law for workers. “There is a need to reinforce safety provisions and more so after the Visakhapatnam gas plant tragedy on Thursday. For instance, MP’s amended law has done away with the need of even installing a fire extinguisher if an industrial unit employs less than 50 people,” he said.Earlier, HT had reported that various state governments are amending labour laws to attract new investments. In April, the BJP has submitted a report to the Union government, recommending revisiting the labour and land acquisition laws in a bid to woo investors.A BJP functionary from UP said the state is in talks with several companies, who are considering moving their production base from China to India. He, however, refused to divulge the names of companies with whom talks have been initiated.“It’s important to pitch India as an investment destination because it guarantees investment, jobs and allows rebuilding the economy,” the functionary said, adding that the workers’ rights and interests would be safeguarded and not “compromised”.Narayanan, however, disagreed with such claims. He cited that India couldn’t overnight dispense with its laws amid a rush to emerge as an alternative to China as a manufacturing hub.“This rush to become an investment destination is akin to a viral outbreak. The rule of law is fundamental to a civilised society. We cannot allow jungle raj, and turn the labour sector into a veritable conflict zone,” he warned.He debunked the BJP’s report to the Centre pitching for labour law reforms on the grounds that they impede investments and escalate costs. “India cannot do away with labour protection norms just because it wants to compete with China,” Narayan said.Earlier this week, Prof Biswajit Dhar of the Jawahar Lal Nehru University had told HT that changing labour laws amid the pandemic would not solve the government’s problems.He suggested that the government must focus on moving forward by adopting an employment policy that creates more jobs and better social security for workers.On Thursday, MP chief minister Shivaraj Singh Chouhan defended the state government’s decision to amend its labour laws. “Industrial reforms were long-awaited. We plan to increase job opportunities for the people by wooing investors to the state. MP is blessed with ample resources such as water, land, forests and skilled youth power. This is the right time to amend the rules as per new requirements and to simplify them to attract industries that are willing to shift from other places,” he said.Amended labour laws would facilitate the establishment of new industries, create new job opportunities and workers’ interests would also be safeguarded, he added.In UP, Siddharth Nath Singh, cabinet minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME), investment and export promotion, khadi and village industries said on Thursday after holding a meeting with Satoshi Suzuki, ambassador of Japan to India, that the state is geared up to attract and receive Japanese investments moving out of China and made a pointed reference to the new labour reforms.The Japanese representatives have appreciated the Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance, 2020, said a person, who was privy to the discussions in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-labour-wing-criticises-move-to-amend-labour-laws-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-YFm87opPyyZ4JpEpz8QGSM.html
08-05-2020||India||‘Dispel fear among people about Covid-19’: Rahul Gandhi to PM Modi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to dispel the fear among people about the coronavirus disease, decentralise by making the states partners in decision-making and immediately put money in the people’s hands to enable them to tide over the crisis triggered by the pandemic.Gandhi said the mindset of the people about the coronavirus needs to be changed by reinforcing the fact that this is a dangerous disease for just 1-2% of the population who are old and those who have diabetic and heart conditions.“We need to decentralise power in dealing with the virus and take this fight to the district level. If we restrict this fight to the PMO only, we will lose. The Prime Minister must devolve power. If we centralise, there will be a calamity,” he told reporters during an hour-long news conference addressed through video-conferencing.ALSO READ | ‘Lockdown not an on-off switch’: Rahul Gandhi asks govt to spell out post-May 17 strategy“The Prime Minister has to trust chief ministers and the chief ministers in turn have to trust the district magistrates. Leave the decisions to categorise zones on the basis of the situation to them. Delhi does not have an idea about the situation on the ground,” he added.The BJP countered the Congress leader by alleging that he was “out of touch with reality” and that PM Modi is at the forefront of this grave challenge.“We don’t know which world Rahul Gandhi is living in. Fight against Coronavirus pandemic best exemplifies Team India spirit fostered by PM Narendra Modi. Views and experiences of state governments have largely contributed to the framing and revision of Central government’s guidelines. Rahul is out of touch with reality and out of sync with his own party ruled state governments,” said GVL Narsimha Rao, BJP spokesperson.This was Gandhi’s second press conference during the lockdown period. The former Congress chief had earlier addressed the media on April 16, when he insisted that the lockdown is not a solution to defeat Covid-19 but a pause button and stressed the need for having a comprehensive exit strategy in place to ensure that the coronavirus does not come back once the restrictions are lifted.This time as well, Gandhi called upon the government to specify the criteria it would use to open the lockdown or continue it post May 17.Gandhi said the need of the hour is to have a strong Indian at every level. “The Prime Minister has his own style. I am not saying that is wrong, that is his way. But in my view, in such a situation a strong Prime Minister along with a lot of strong chief ministers and a lot of strong collectors are needed,” he added.“I want us to tackle the disease at the local level itself. I want a strong Indian leader to stand in front of this disease - be it a collector or a farmer,” the former Congress chief elaborated.While asserting that this is not the time to crticise the government, he said the people should think of the country first and not think in partisan terms like one belongs to the RSS, BJP or the Congress.“Everyone has a responsibility. Everyone should forget which party they belong to, the only thing to be remembered is that we are all Indians and together we have to end the fear and the economy has to be brought back on track,” Gandhi said.He said the government needs to work on a psychological change and if it has to open lockdown, it has to convert people’s fear of the disease into confidence, as it is not deadly for 98-99% of them.Gandhi said the idea of injecting immediately a sum of Rs 7500 directly into the hands of poor is critical and demanded an immediate financial package to protect the industry which provides jobs.“We have to protect the job creators and have to build a wall for them to protect jobs and wages of workers. We have to give them financial support,” he said.He said the economic package is being delayed as the government feels India could be downgraded by international agencies.“We need to start our domestic economy soon, the more time we lose, the worse impact it will have,” added Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispel-fear-among-people-about-covid-19-rahul-gandhi-to-pm-modi/story-a5mj0sHkkF37rVUJq6fliJ.html

08-05-2020||India||Treat issue of migrant workers as national emergency, academicians urge govt||Migrant workers being forced two stay put in the states they work in or being forced to restart work can lead to a situation of unrest, a group of academicians and civil society members have cautioned.In statement issued on Friday, the group urged states and the central government to make arrangements for the safe travel of the migrant workers and said, “The understandable angry outbursts of millions of migrant labourers stranded in these economic centres have created volcanic situations that can create a serious law and order problem in the country.”On Friday morning, at least 16 people were killed when they were run over by a train in Maharashtra as Aurangabad. According to railway officials, the workers were walking towards their home state of Madhya Pradesh after losing their jobs during the lockdown imposed to check the coronavirus pandemic.In the absence of public transport that has already been stalled in keeping with the lockdown conditions, workers across states are being forced to walk. The signatories - Rajesh Tandon of PRIA Delhi, Amitabh Kundu of RIS, Dr Jagadananda of CYSD, Bhubaneshwar; Yogesh Kumar of Samarthan, Bhopal and Dr Sheela Patel of SPARC, Mumbai - have urged the central government and the states to treat the issue of migrant workers as a “national emergency”.“Fear, uncertainty, distress and inhumane treatment by local officials and police have resulted in a situation where widespread unrest and violence may occur anytime. The only option is for the central government to ask railways to ferry them home in hundreds of trains from all main economic centres, and to manage this process in an orderly manner, without harassment and stampede,” the statement issued by the groups reads.The group said it has been receiving reports from Mumbai, Pune, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi and several other urban centres where the lockdown has made migrant labour anxious to return home. “Our estimate based on the past census and NSS data and ground level information is that nearly 6 to 8 million of them are still stranded and a desperate to go home. Many of them are hungry and without shelter,” the statement said.Referring to reports of states forcing workers to stay back, such as in Karnataka (though the state later rolled back the decision), the group said workers cannot be subject to inhuman conditions.“We hear reports the time in business community have advise state governments to keep them within the states for restarting the economy post lock down. While giving definite offer of jobs in social security is welcome, they can be no logic to detain them against their wishes,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treat-issue-of-migrant-workers-as-national-emergency-academicians-urge-govt/story-AnZo4tYcIG1jPBoJM9xuCL.html
08-05-2020||India||Before lifting lockdown, govt needs to bring transparency in exit plan: Rahul||Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi said on Friday that the nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) is not like an on-off switch, saying that if the government wants to end the lockdown, it must bring physiological change in the minds of the people and transperancy in exit plan.In a video conference with mediapersons, Rahul Gandhi, who is also an MP from Kerala’s Wayanad, said, “We have been having internal discussions on the suggestions to we would be giving the government.” He said the country is beginning to run into a little bit of problem. “There is a strong feeling that we need to immediately release packages to the MSMEs, give money in the hands of the poor and have a strategy for the migrants besides preparing for the opening of the lockdown,” he said. Rahul Gandhi also urged the Central government to provide little bit of “transparency” about its actions. “We need to understand that when they lift the lockdown, what would be the criteria for it, what are the boxes they want to tick before actually initiating the process. It is important that government tells the people about these criteria,” the Congress leader said. “We simply cannot continue without providing support to the people who are suffering due to the lockdown,” he added. The Congress leader further said that the lockdown is not only switching on a key, it requires a number of things to happen, it needs a psychological change.According to Rahul Gandhi, the Covid-19 disease is currently very dangerous for the elderly, and people with ailments like diabetis, cardiac problem and lung disease. “We need to bring a psychological change in the minds of the people. If the government wants to open up, it has to turn this fear into a sense of confidence. Otherwise people will start going out the moment the lockdown is lifted,” he said. “We need a stratgy to open up the lockdown.

The train departed at around 12 noon and was flagged off by Kunal, the Nodal Officer for coordinating the departure and entry of persons into the state as well as the North Goa Superintendent of Police Utkrisht Prasoon. “Today one train departed Goa for Gwalior having 1196 passengers having shramik special. This is our first train from Goa to Gwalior and this train is expected to reach tomorrow morning,” Kunal (he doesn’t use a surname) said. “This train is taking people from the distressed category of people who have registered with us to go online and also through the survey conducted by the department so they are belonging to eight districts of Madhya Pradesh we have already alerted the nodal officer of MP at Gwalior where they will be received and these passengers will be transported to their respective district by dedicated buses. After final screening at the boarding point eight passengers were taken out for further checks,” Kunal said. The process for the transfer of the people -- mostly labourers who were housed at various relief camps set up by the state government, began on Thursday with those selected asked to gather where they were screened for symptoms and after verification brought to the railway station in specially arranged buses and boarded on the train. More trains are scheduled to be organized over the coming days depending on the availability. More than 10,000 labourers each from UP and Bihar too are awaiting trains while those from Karnataka are being dropped back by buses arranged by the Goa government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-first-shramik-special-train-from-goa-leaves-for-gwalior/story-teiw8DfCZRIkMm2Vi88kPM.html
08-05-2020||India||Bharat Biotech eyes human monoclonal antibody therapy for Covid-19||The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has sanctioned a project led by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech to develop human monoclonal antibodies as a therapy for Covid-19 in the next six months.The project was approved under CSIR’s flagship programme, New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI). Apart from Bharat Biotech, one of India’s major vaccine manufacturers, the project brings together academia – the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) in Pune and the Indian Institute of Technology in Indore – and industry players such as PredOmix Technologies in Gurgaon.Lab-grown antibodies have been shown to block coronaviurs infections in laboratories in the Netherlands and Israel, and could emerge as a critical tool to stop the spread of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies are man-made proteins that act like natural antibodies and work by identifying and binding to the virus to destroy it.CSIR’s project is aimed at creating an alternate therapeutic regimen by generating highly effective and specific human monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralising SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“Although efforts are underway for the development of drugs and vaccines for controlling the Covid-19 pandemic, these are slow and expensive processes with uncertainties. Therefore, an alternate therapeutic regimen for early deployment is critical,” Bharat Biotech said in a statement.Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella said: “The purpose of vaccination is to protect the healthy against future infections and it alone may not provide the complete solution. We feel monoclonal antibody therapy will provide a viable option. The question is of how to treat those individuals who are already infected?“Plus, we do not yet know how effective an anti-SARS-CoV2 vaccine will be in elderly people and those with co-morbidities. Given the large number of Indians suffering from hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases, this becomes an important issue.”Talking about the novel antibodies approach, Ella said: “While Israel and the Netherlands have recently announced the development of virus-neutralising antibodies, our approach is to develop a powerful cocktail of neutralising antibodies that can also simultaneously block mutational variants of the virus.“We are fast-tracking the development process, to make the antibodies available within the next six months and thus improve the treatment efficacy.”Ella said plasma therapy had shown some promise but inherent problems associated with the approach severely limited its wider use. Large-scale deployment of plasma therapy is limited by the availability of plasma. “There is also a challenge in carefully screening convalescent plasma for the presence of other infections that could be unwittingly transferred to the recipient,” he said.NMITLI is the largest public-private-partnership effort under CSIR within the research and development domain in the country. It looks beyond today’s technology and seeks to build, capture and retain for India a leadership position by synergising the best competencies of publicly funded research institutions, academia and private industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-eyes-human-monoclonal-antibody-therapy-for-covid-19/story-Unw8L9c89PsMnQIjH9Cd7J.html

It will take less time,” said Vimal Goswami, chief engineer of the project ‘Hirak,’ under which the road stretch was built by Border Road Organisation( BRO).Following the inauguration, Rajnath Singh tweeted, “Delighted to inaugurate the Link Road to Mansarovar Yatra today. The BRO achieved road connectivity from Dharchula to Lipulekh (China Border) known as Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra Route. Also flagged off a convoy of vehicles from Pithoragarh to Gunji through video conferencing”.Lauding the role of BRO engineers, Singh added, “I congratulate the BRO engineers and personnel whose dedication made this achievement possible. Team BRO has done tremendous work in recent years and played a significant role in connecting the border areas”.Rajnath Singh also flagged off a caravan of nine vehicles from Pithoragarh to Gunji to indicate that both passengers and load can be sent by the new road stretch through mountainous terrain, said Vimal GoswamiUnion road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had announced last year that this road stretch would be completed by April 2020.According to BRO officials, while machines used in construction of the road had been imported from Australia, the air connectivity to supply materials and fuel for it was ensured by constructing a small airstrip for army and air force helicopters at Budhi Camp, the upper portion of the road stretch.“This helped us to facilitate movement of helicopters, supplying material for the construction work.” said the BRO officer.“While 51 km long part beyond Buddi had been constructed earlier, the stretch between Lakhanpur to Bundi posed many challenges and took much time,” said Vimal Goswami.The construction of this strategic road stretch began in 2008, and it was scheduled to be completed in 2013 but got delayed due to the tough terrain between Nazang to Bundi village.“The 15 km stretch was the most challenging. Its construction was outsourced in 2015 to a private company under technical guidance of BRO engineers, which completed this part despite all odds,” said Goswami.The locals are also happy with the new road stretch.“This road is a boon for residents of all seven villages in Vyans valley. It used to take 5 days to reach their high altitude villages from Dharchula and vice versa. Now it will take only 4 hours.“It will also help the winter and summer migration of tribal people to the upper Himalayan region. Overall it will strengthen border security and boost the economy in the bordering villages,” said Shalu Datal, a social worker based in Dharchula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-inaugurates-kailash-mansarovar-road-link-via-video-conference/story-kvQ89OKstk8FmYtvNzNXdO.html

The petiton argued that the government cannot meddle with human life by allowing crowds to gather outside liquor shops.As the government took first steps to relax the Covid-19 lockdown to revive the economy, hundreds queued up at liquor stores in New Delhi and other cities.Some stores in parts of Delhi had to be closed due to the large number of people gathered there.The Delhi government even imposed a special tax of 70 per cent on retail liquor purchases to deter large gatherings but that did not stop people from coming out and heading towards the liquor shops.It then introduced a token system which people can buy online. The move is aimed at stopping people from coming out and gather outside liquor shops.The Uttar Pradesh government recently announced an increase in prices of all categories of liquor, including country liquor, to mop up additional revenue of Rs 2,350 crore.A similar plea has also been filed in the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi to start online sale of liquor to ensure social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic.The petitioner sought direction to the Delhi government to evolve a proper policy to start the online sale of liquor and deliver it to the consumers’ homes at a time when the entire machinery of the country is tirelessly working to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.After the lockdown was extended till May 17, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued new guidelines allowing liquor shops to open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-should-consider-indirect-sale-home-delivery-of-liquor-observes-supreme-court/story-qsjPvnQ3gfi8MAL1BO5xgL.html

The workers sleeping on rail tracks were crushed to death by a goods train on Friday morning.“Two days ago I had tweeted why the central and state governments are oblivious of the fact that thousands of migrant workers are still trudging to their home states,” Chidambaram said.“It is obvious that the transport policy of providing buses and trains to transport migrant workers was poorly designed, planned, coordinated and implemented,” he said in a series of tweets.The decision to provide buses and trains was “hopelessly belated”, he alleged, adding that lakhs of persons had already begun their trek to their home states when the decision was made.Once the policy was announced, the government should have gone to the rescue of the trekkers and provided buses or trains to them to continue their journey, the former Union minister said.“The tragedy that happened this morning could have been avoided if governments had gone to the rescue of the migrant workers in time,” Chidambaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hopelessly-belated-chidambaram-on-decision-to-provide-trains-to-migrants/story-dwXQadYaUBqZVrPtNaIQHI.html

08-05-2020||India||Facing outrage, Ghaziabad high-rise withdraws notice to stop entry of doctors, healthcare workers||The owners association of a high-rise in Vaishali withdrew a notice asking doctors and healthcare workers living in the complex to stay in Delhi until the end of the Covid-19 lockdown after the measure was strongly criticised on social media.The Neelpadam Kunj Apartment Owners Association issued a communication on May 7 for stopping the entry and exit of doctors and healthcare workers from May 10, and asked them to make temporary arrangements for staying in Delhi while the lockdown is in force.The association withdrew the notice within hours after it was criticised by netizens on Thursday night following its circulation on social media. It issued another communication in which it said its “advisory notice was issued on the evening of May 7, 2020 by mistake and has been withdrawn in the night of May 7, 2020”.The association’s office-bearers said their communication to residents was based on a notification issued by Ghaziabad’s municipal commissioner to his zonal in-charges on May 5.The municipal commissioner’s notification had said the zonal in-charges should get in touch with RWAs and local councillors and request doctors and healthcare workers, who live in Ghaziabad and work in Delhi, to make arrangements for their stay in the national capital during the lockdown.“We had issued a letter on Thursday evening on the basis of the letter issued by the municipal commissioner. But our letter was withdrawn on Thursday night and another letter was issued about the withdrawal of our first letter. We didn’t have clarity about the letter from the municipal commissioner, which was in the form of an appeal and non-binding,” said Ram Tiwari, president of the board of managers of the association.He said about 35 families live in Neelpadam Kunj, one of the oldest high-rises in Ghaziabad that comprises 568 flats.“Our first letter was also in the form of an advisory and never implemented. It was to be implemented from May 10. But no doctors or paramedical staff or healthcare workers were stopped from our side. We have one positive case in our high-rise and the patient’s family members have tested negative and returned home. This is why the administration sealed a portion of the building,” Tiwari said.Other owners’ associations and RWAs have not implemented the municipal commissioner’s appeal. The controversy started after Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer NK Gupta wrote a letter on April 30 with the heading “appeal” to municipal commissioner Dinesh Chandra.Gupta’s letter came in the wake of a number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad attributed to medically acquired infections. Other cases in Ghaziabad are also related to doctors and healthcare workers getting infected and their neighbourhoods being sealed.On May 5, Chandra forwarded Gupta’s letter to his zonal in-charges. He maintained his letter was an appeal and RWAs and councillors were to make “humble appeals” to doctors and healthcare workers. He told HT on Thursday the letter was issued in public interest and wasn’t binding.“We have also reiterated this to the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Ghaziabad. The appeal is non-binding. But it was issued with an intention to prevent people in high-rises from getting infected through medically acquired infections,” Gupta said, adding 25% of cases in the district are linked to medically acquired infections.The IMA’s office-bearers will hold a meeting with the Ghaziabad district magistrate on Friday to discuss the issue.“Doctors and healthcare personnel are taking best possible precautions about infections. We feel the issue should have been taken up at the government level (UP and Delhi governments) to make arrangements for doctors and healthcare workers and should not have been publicised. It should have been for other people involved in providing essential services,” said IMA Ghaziabad president VB Jindal.“We don’t want such a stigma which may be seen as discrimination. We feel RWAs or councillors shouldn’t be given powers to restrict doctors,” he added.The Ghaziabad district magistrate had issued orders for strict sealing of the border with Delhi and cited six positive cases that emerged after local residents travelled to the national capital. On April 26, the district magistrate issued an advisory to commuters going to Delhi to leave Ghaziabad’s borders by 9am and come back only after 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facing-outrage-ghaziabad-high-rise-withdraws-notice-to-stop-entry-of-doctors-healthcare-workers/story-lYvxPQKiS9EvGaM1IMxG8N.html

TASMAC has a total of 5,300 outlets and employs more than 25,000 people. Choas prevailed at retail outlets in several districts including Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chengalpattu.Police had to resort to mild lathi-charge in some of the districts as desperate tipplers gave social distancing norms a go-by. Police had a tough time controlling crowds wanting to buy liquor as all TASMAC outlets have been closed in the state since March 24. Preliminary estimates of the state government indicated that Rs 150 crore worth of liquor was sold in Tamil Nadu.The government’s move to open the TASMAC outlets had attracted criticism from opposition parties including DMK’s M K Stalin, Congress party and others. However, the state government struggling for revenue had decided to go ahead with the sales. In 2018-19, TASMAC alone generated revenues of Rs 31,157.83 crore.Meanwhile two more deaths were also reported because of Covid-19 on Thursday taking the cumulative tally to 37. Out of the 580 new cases registered on Thursday, government officials admitted that 316 of them were from Chennai with bulk of them being attributed to the Koyambedu market cluster. As of Thursday, there are 3,822 active Covid-19 cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-sees-liquor-sales-of-rs-150-crore-on-day-1-of-reopening/story-WQImr9eKT2BnNlsXwpSqML.html
08-05-2020||India||AIIMS in Delhi to resume health care services in phased manner||The Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is likely to open up its health care services in a phased manner from next week after it shut down all but its emergency services on March 24 following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.“We’re looking at re-starting limited outpatient departments (OPDs) and surgical departments. The opening up will start in a phased manner,” said Dr. Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, Delhi.On March 24, the hospital had shut down all its non-emergency departments, including surgical departments and specialty clinics, and only kept its emergency open for non-Covid-19 patients.The decision was in line with a Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s directive, urging hospitals to postpone all non-essential services and elective procedures in a bid to free up ventilators and intensive care unit (ICU) beds for Covid-19 positive cases.In early April, the hospital had started teleconsultation facility for its follow-up cases, where a patient can book an appointment online.“The departments that are managing well through telemedicine will be asked to continue. We’ll begin with semi-emergency and comfortable day-care surgeries that don’t require too much manpower, and also minimal infrastructure,” said Dr. Guleria.In the first phase, gallstone removal, hernia, and other such surgeries will be conducted, as they require less number of hospitalisation days ensuring beds are not occupied for long and also minimum use of ventillator.The hospital has set up its trauma centre and its cancer hospital in Jhajjar, Haryana, as dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.“Dedicated Covid-19 facility goes beyond hospital infrastructure and largely involves nurturing human resources. We’ll have to divide our staff into Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 groups. Simultaneously, we need to keep a close watch on the surge in Covid-19 positive cases. Initially, we’ll start with opening up a limited number of departments, and depending upon how the situation evolves over the next few weeks, we may open up some more, if the Covid-19 curve remains under control,” said Dr. Guleria.“There’s a huge risk of a non-Covid-19 patient testing positive. We’ve had a similar experience recently, where a trauma patient tested Covid-19 positive. The challenge in the gradual opening up of departments is to factor these critical aspects in mind. We’ll have to monitor the evolving situation closely,” he said. “Everything has to be thought through. We’ve to re-define our new normal. The medical practice will undergo a paradigm shift soon,” he added.The central government-run Safdarjung Hospital has also opened up its outpatient clinics for new patients from Wednesday.The opening up of more hospitals in the national capital, which had earlier restricted its services to emergency only, will ease the burden on the Delhi government-run hospitals, as most of them have been running on more than 100% capacity. The constraints were drawn to the Centre’s attention by the Delhi government earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-in-delhi-to-resume-health-care-services-in-phased-manner/story-W6D5p6ZTPVmYcpU1LBLmuK.html

08-05-2020||India||Maha govt issues SOP to deploy state buses to ferry stranded people||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government on Thursday issued the standard operating procedure (SOP) to deploy 10,000 state transport buses to ferry stranded people to their home districts in the state, while amending an earlier order and doing away with the need to attach a medical certificate to the registration form to facilitate their return journey. State transport minister Anil Parab held talks with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during a strategy meeting held on Thursday to discuss the measures that need to be taken to aggressively contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the state.“We’ve made arrangements for 10,000 state-run buses to ferry these stranded people in a group of 22-24 people. We’ve asked divisional officers to set up a control room to keep the stranded people informed about the bus service,” Parab said.On Thursday, Maharashtra recorded the second-highest spike in Covid-19 positive cases on a single day, as it reported 1,216 new cases. The maximum number of Covid-19 related deaths on a single day in the state was also reported on Thursday at 43, taking the overall toll to 694.Maharashtra has recorded over 1,000 cases in the last two days, raising concerns over the spread of the pandemic.In Mumbai, the epicentre of the outbreak in the state, 680 new Covid-19 positive cases were detected on Thursday, as the total count rose to 11,394.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the government has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities to start aggressive institutional quarantine to curb the spread of Covid-19 cases, which has also been suggested by a visiting Central team. He, however, admitted that social distancing norms cannot always be ensured for residents, who live cheek-by-jowl in cramped tenements such as in the congested Dharavi slums, where institutional quarantine may work as the best precautionary measure.CM Thackeray has hinted at extending the ongoing lockdown restrictions till May 31. On Thursday, the state government amended an earlier order and issued a clarification that there is no need to attach a medical certificate to the registration form to facilitate the journey for stranded people back to their respective districts. The decision was taken after serpentine queues were seen outside private practitioners’ chambers and following allegations that some doctors were overcharging the stranded for the medical certificate.The BMC authorities have reserved 3,343 rooms in 88 city hotels to quarantine the 1,900 stranded Indian nationals, who started flying into the city from Thursday evening by special flights from abroad.The incoming Indian nationals are being allowed to move into the hotels for a compulsory 14-day quarantine after they undergo screening by a team of BMC doctors.The state health department has conducted 2,02,105 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. So far, 1,83,880 people have tested negative.Presently, Maharashtra has 1,087 active containment zones. Around 12,021 survey teams, comprising doctors and paramedical staff, have screened over 51.76 lakh people in the state for SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, the health department officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-govt-issues-sop-to-deploy-state-buses-to-ferry-stranded-people/story-b9WwoxkhVOgBrQMPUPSjQP.html
08-05-2020||India||Contagious skin disease hits desert foxes in Rajasthan, ecologists raise alarm||Ecologists working in and around the Desert National Park in Rajasthan have raised an alarm over mange, a contagious skin disease, in desert fox. On Thursday, they spotted six animals with the disease, cause by infestation of mite, in Fatehgarh area of Jaisalmer.Earlier, Wildlife Institute of India researchers working in the area recorded a fox with mild mange disease symptoms in Sudashree ‘A’ enclosure. Three more foxes with mange-like symptoms have been reported from outside the sanctuary area in and around the field firing range in Pokhran.This has put the wildlife officials on alert even as the officials of the animal husbandry department are managing mange in domestic camels in Jaisalmer.“The field staff has been alerted to report any new occurrences and the animal with symptoms are being tracked so that in case of a need, appropriate intervention could be undertaken,” said a department note sent to Jaipur by the office of deputy conservator of forest (wildlife), Desert National Park.Mange was first reported in the national park in 2006. After that, every year, the occurrence has increased. “In last one year, we have observed about 30-35% desert foxes with infection, 5-8% of them with severe infection (without hair on body) in which stage the animal loses its appetite for hunting and is always scratching body before finally dying due to maggot infection on deep scratches,” said ecologist Dr Sumit Dookia.According to the state forest department’s wildlife census of 2019, there are about 1,000 foxes in Jaisalmer. “My guess about the infection in population is of around 30% in the above mentioned areas and this needs attention of the state authorities,” said Dookia.He said major areas of infection are Sanvtha, Nedan, Sanavada, Lathi, Bhadariya, Odhaniya-Chacha, Dholiya (all in Pokhran block) and Sam, Sudasari, Ganga, Bidha, Jamra, Nimba, and few surrounding areas (all in Desert National Park).Dookia, assistant professor in School of Environment Management at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University in New Delhi, worked on a UGC-funded project on ecology of desert fox from 2012 to 2015. “During that time, my research scholar continuously followed many desert foxes with mange infection. The ultimate end is all of them died and at the same time village dogs were also seen with infection,” he said.Dookia said that even though Indian fox is also present in same habitat, but none of them were found with this infection.The note from DCF said the disease is self-limiting “so there’s hardly any chance of rapid mass spread in the wildlife population”. “As the disease does not take the shape of an epidemic threatening the fox population, at this point, this office does not find it necessary to make any clinical intervention,” the note added.Principal secretary of forest department Sreya Guha said the animal husbandry department is dealing with the outbreak in domestic camels; forest department is on alert.Bhawani Singh Rathore, additional director (health) in animal husbandry department said they were doing survey of the affected areas to provide treatment to camels and undertake control activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contagious-skin-disease-hits-desert-foxes-in-rajasthan-ecologists-raise-alarm/story-4JKZJ5jT4BLojqb0uXuBRL.html
08-05-2020||India||Assam’s biggest hospital closes as PG student tests Covid-19 positive||The Assam government has closed the state’s biggest hospital, Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH), for new patients after a post-graduate (PG) medical student was among the eight new Covid-19 positive cases detected on Thursday. Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma made the announcement on Twitter on Friday morning after the student was found positive for Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease. “A PG student at GMCH has tested Covid positive last night. Consequently, we have to screen everyone who came in contact with him and sanitize the entire GMCH premises....we have to close the hospital for new patients for next few days,” Sarma tweeted.“Although we are closing the hospital for new patients, special arrangements will be in place for patients already admitted and collection of new swab samples. Soliciting cooperation and understanding from all in the interest of public safety,” he added.The GMCH hostel where the doctor was staying and another hostel have been declared as containment zones, and all residents asked to stay indoors.Three persons in Guwahati and four more in Silchar, too, tested positive, taking the state’s tally to 53 cases.The new cases came to light after one of the passengers, a notorious car thief from Dhekiajuli in Sonipur district, was tested positive. All other passengers of the bus and drivers have been put in quarantine facilities and 11 areas in Silchar declared as containment zones.“The bus reached Silchar with permission from district magistrate of Ajmer. No social distancing norms were followed as it carried 42 passengers,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Thursday.“While other passengers were asked to be in home quarantine, swab samples of one were taken as precaution. His samples tested positive. The person has several police cases registered against him,” he added.The incident has led Assam government to revise its strategy of home quarantine for people returning to the state following relaxations allowed by the Union home ministry. Earlier only those who showed symptoms were to be placed in facility quarantine or tested for Covid-19.“From now all persons returning from red zones in other parts of the country will be put in compulsory facility quarantine for at least three days (even if they are asymptomatic) till results of their swab tests are available,” said Sarma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-biggest-hospital-closes-as-pg-student-tests-covid-19-positive/story-ucGVhAUQ7aZxMp2CgyDfOL.html

Subsequently, they were kept in quarantine facility in a police station from where they escaped on Thursday night,” said the Collector.The officer said that total 47 migrant labourers came back from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to Dantewada and were kept at a quarantine facility in Aranpur police station area before allowing them to go their native villages.“No symptom of coronavirus was found in these labourers,” said the collector.“We have informed sarpanch and secretary of the concerned village panchayat but till now they have not reached to their village. It is presently not possible for administration and police to reach Nahadi village because it is core area of Maoists,” said the Collector.No case of Covid-19 was reported from Bastar division which comprises seven districts - Bastar, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Dantewada, Sukma and Bijapur.Total 59 cases have been reported in Chhattisgarh till now in which 38 recovered and discharged from hospital.Two patients of Covid-19, including one nursing officer of a quarantine centre, were discharged from AIIMS in state capital Raipur on Thursday after they tested negative in the second consecutive test.The nursing officer is 35-year-old while another patient, who hails from Surajpur, is 25.Presently, AIIMS has 21 active Covid-19 positive patients and all are in stable condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/22-migrant-labourers-escape-from-covid-19-quarantine-centre-in-chhattisgarh/story-qy2BuODN4ILpLp3YDjl0OI.html

08-05-2020||India||Swadeshi Jagran Manch and chemists want Aarogya Setu to stop online medicine sale||The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has expressed its concerns about Aarogya Setu, a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tracking mobile application developed by the National Informatics Centre.On Thursday, the SJM said it has written to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and to the Union Ministry for Health & Family Welfare, flagging concerns about allowing e-pharmacies, including Aarogya Setu Mitr, to sale medicines in the country.“A government-owned web application should not be allowed to undertake an activity, which is against the law. There are over seven lakh chemists in the country, who will be severely affected by allowing e-commerce platforms to sell medicines,” said Ashwani Mahajan, national co-convenor, SJM.On Monday, the government allowed the sale of medicines and also seeking medical advice on Arogya Setu while launching the Aarogya Setu Mitr portal. The platform, developed on a public-private partnership model between the government and Swasth Foundation, Project StepOne, Tata Bridgital Health and Tech Mahindra’s healthcare initiative Connectsense Telehealth, offers teleconsultation services and doorstep delivery of medicines and laboratory test results. The portal collects the user’s IP address, postal code and mobile phone device details. Companies such as 1mg, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Metropolis, SRL Diagnostics and Thyrocare are engaged for doorstep laboratory tests, while Netmeds, PharmaEasy, 1mg, and Medlife have been chosen to deliver medicines and laboratory test results.A government official, who is involved with the app and its backend operations, said that as public health was the primary motive of the app, telemedicine was the intended logical next step. “We wanted to offer a 360-degree solution to users under lockdown restrictions. The Centre has identified the sale of medicine on e-commerce sites as an essential service,” the official said. Yash Aggarwal, legal head of South Chemists and Distributors Association in New Delhi, also criticised the move. He cited a December 2018 Delhi high court order that stayed the online sale of medicines without a valid licence. “It’s illegal to sell drugs online. On March 26, the Union health ministry allowed the doorstep delivery of drugs with some conditions making the online sale of medicines legal in the country,” Aggarwal said.Prashant Tandon of 1mg, whose company is delivering laboratory test results and medicines on doorsteps, said that they do not have access to a patient’s data. “The data management for e-pharmacies are defined and violations invite action. The e-pharmacy can assess the prescription, and there’s a clear audit trail for digital transactions. The regulator can track the sales of medicines on our platforms transparently, which some offline sellers, however, don’t maintain,” Tandon said. He said that e-pharmacies are not allowed to sell schedule X drugs. “Schedule X drugs such as narcotics are not sold online, as the draft rules on e-pharmacies don’t allow them,” he said. Aggarwal also pointed out that when users click on the link on the Aarogya Setu Mitr portal to purchase medicines, it takes them to an external website, which is owned by a private firm.“There are security and privacy issues as well. How can we allow classified information about a person to be collected by a private company?” Agarwal asked, demanding that the government immediately suspend the sale of medicines online. In a letter to Principal Scientific advisor K Vijay Raghavan and NITI Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant, Aggarwal said, “The notification issued by the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare leaves no doubt that home delivery was never allowed under the Drugs and Cosmetic Rules, 1945, and e-pharmacies are functioning against the law before the notification was issued. However, even this notification has not given them a legal right to operate and home deliver the medicines.”“This notification is valid only in extraordinary times such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Mostly pharmacies act as aggregators, which are not allowed under the notification as a valid licence needs to be issued under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. The delivery of medicines also has to be done by a licensee in the same revenue district, which further makes it clear that these rules are not meant for e-pharmacies,” the letter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swadeshi-jagran-manch-and-chemists-want-aarogya-setu-to-stop-online-medicine-sale/story-j9geqCtxY8pLkeYiEafXJL.html

We need to understand, when they open, what is the criteria for that, what are the boxes they want ticked off before they actually start to open,” Gandhi said in a digital press briefing.“The lockdown is not a key, that you switch it on and it’s gone. It requires number of things to happen. It requires a psychological change. The government needs to understand that it’s not an on-off switch,” he added.The former Congress president also talked about the coronavirus disease Covid-19, which has triggered the nationwide lockdown. He said that barring a few categories of people, the disease is not dangerous.“The disease is dangerious for a few categories of people. It is dangerous for old people, for those who have diabetes, hypertension etc. But other than that, it is not a dangerous disease. So we have to make a psychological change in the mind of the people. Currently, people are very scared. The government, if it wants to open up, will have to turn this fear into a sense of confidence,” said Gandhi.He added that opening up has to be a transition. “You need to have a strategy.”Gandhi has been holding discussions with public intellectuals through video conferencing where he has been talking about Covid-19 and what India needs to do going forward. Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee were his first two guests.Two days ago, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had asked the central government to spell out its strategy whether it will lift or continue with the nationwide lockdown on May 17.“What after May 17? What criteria is the government using to judge how long the lockdown will continue?” she had said in her opening remarks at a video-conferencing of party’s chief ministers and senior leaders.Addressing the meeting, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, “We need to know, as Soniaji said, what will happen after the lockdown 3.0? Soniaji has already pointed out. CM’s need to deliberate and ask as to what is the strategy of Govt of India to get the country out of lockdown?”The party had recently announced that it will pay for the train travel of stranded migrant workers, a move that triggered a slugfest between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Opposition party accused the government of being insensitive to the plight of stranded migrant workers while the BJP claimed that railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-not-an-on-off-switch-rahul-gandhi-asks-govt-to-spell-out-post-may-17-strategy/story-0hV8divxr4gTXFjBWOk45O.html

Residents of five villages have been evacuated to safer places, and there was no need for people in other villages and residential colonies to be shifted, he said. “There is nothing to worry for the people of Visakhapatnam,” Meena added.State authorities and officials from LG Polymers said they were investigating what caused the leak of styrene gas, which is toxic and injurious to human health, but a preliminary situation report by district officials said the trigger was a malfunction in equipment, which caused the temperature to rise and the organic compound styrene – normally a liquid – to vaporise. The people who died on Thursday were identified as: Appala Narsamma (45), Kundana Sriya (6), A Chandramouli (19), Ch Ganga Raju (48), B Narayanamma (35), N Greeshma (9), Meka Krishna Murthy (72), P Varalaxmi (38), N Nani (40), P Shankar Rao (40) and V Nukaraju (60). The twelfth person who was declared dead at Kothavalasa primary health centre was Gangadhara Chowdary (32). “All of them belonged to Venkatapuram and Gopalapatnam villages,” the police commissioner said.According to Andhra Medical College principal Dr Sudhakar, 193 people, including 47 children, are undergoing treatment at state-run King George Hospital, and another 100 are being treated at different hospitals in the city.“Those in the KGH are all out of danger. They would be discharged later in the day after they recover completely and after ensuring that the situation in their villages has become normal,” he said.Panic gripped several villages near the LG Polymers plant at R R Venkatapuram on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam late on Thursday night over reports of fresh fumes with pungent smell emanating from the factory. People descended on streets and tried to leave their villages. The situation was quickly brought under control. The police made announcements on loudspeakers, asking them not to panic and return to their homes.In a tweet, industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy appealed to people not to believe in rumours, but to go only by official announcements.Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission has taken suo motu cognisance of media reports about the Vizag incident. The commission also issued a notice to the Andhra Pradesh chief secretary, calling for a detailed report in the matter, including on areas such as status of the rescue operation, treatment provided to the affected people, and relief provided by the state authorities to the affected families.A notice has also been issued to the director general of police, seeking information on the registration of first information reports (FIRs) within four weeks and the status of the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-gas-leak-toll-reaches-12-police-say-situation-under-control/story-41s7FGyFfqn5O1JZTMUGVK.html

Also, 11 areas in Cachar district have been declared as containment zones,” the minister said.“The bus reached Silchar on Wednesday after the Ajmer district magistrate allowed it to travel, despite nationwide lockdown restrictions. All 42 passengers on board of the bus didn’t follow any social distancing norms,” Sarma said.“While other passengers were asked to be quarantined at home, swab samples of one of them were taken as a precautionary measure. His samples tested Covid-19 positive,” he added.The incident has led Assam government to revise its strategy regarding home quarantine for people returning to the state following relaxations allowed by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.Earlier, only those who tested Covid-19 positive or showed symptoms were to be placed in a quarantine facility.“Now, all those returning from red zones in other parts of the country will be put under compulsory quarantine at a facility for at least three days even if they are asymptomatic and till the time the results of their swab samples tests are available,” said Sarma.The state government is also planning to introduce a daily quota system of how many people returning from other states would be allowed to enter Assam in the wake of the Ajmer incident.So far, Assam Police has issued 375 passes allowing entry of 2,056 people returning to the state from other parts of the country. While permits of 3,420 other passengers are under process.CHALLENGING PHASESarma raised concerns about the challenging phase amid the easing of lockdown restrictions.“We’ve entered a challenging phase, as people are coming back from other states and may turn out of the carriers of the viral infection. SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, won’t be lax because of the government’s relaxations. I request people to be careful and not to step out of their homes unless absolutely necessary,” Sarma said.The state government will impose a fine of Rs 500 under the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, from Friday against anyone found not wearing a mask in public places.The government has spent Rs 60 crore in providing assistance of Rs 2,000 each for nearly two lakh migrant workers, who have been stranded outside the state because of the pandemic. Sarma pledged that the financial aid would continue for the next few weeks.Similarly, the government has decided to give Rs 5,000 each to students, who are looking to come back home from western and southern parts of the country and Rs 3,000 and Rs 2,000 from northern and eastern parts, respectively.Those students interested to return can call at 18003453525 or email to assamstudenthelpdesk@gmail.com. Students will receive the cash only after they return to Assam.Also, all the villagers in the state’s 25,000-odd villages have started undergoing health check-ups from Thursday, and their swab samples, if necessary, will be collected to conduct Covid-19 tests. The villagers’ health check-up regime is likely to be completed within a month, Sarma added.CHANGE IN ACADEMIC SESSION?The state government is considering introducing changes in the school calendar because of the impact of lockdown restrictions and pandemic’s aftershocks.Though school session in Assam follow the calendar-year format, such as from January to December, the government may extend it till March for the current session like other parts of the country and the next session may begin in April.“This year we’re announcing summer break for schools from May 1 to May 31 because of the lockdown. Even if the lockdown is lifted after May 17, students don’t have to come to school till the end of the month,” Sarma, who also holds the education portfolio, said.The minister announced that the secondary and higher secondary examination results would be announced in June and instead of hard copies digitised mark sheets would be made available for students online.“Students can take admissions in schools and colleges using these digital mark sheets. The admission process will also be conducted online. School and college authorities can verify the mark sheets from the official board website,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-ajmer-sharif-returnees-new-worry-for-assam-govt/story-dCuvSnG4fxykevzbIXYNMK.html
08-05-2020||India||Maharashtra train accident: How 16 migrant labourers were killed||A train in India crashed into a group of migrant workers walking along the railroad tracks on to their way back to their home state on Friday, killing at least 16.The railway ministry has launched a probe into the incident.According to railway officials, the workers were walking towards their home state Madhya Pradesh after they lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Most public transportation has already been cancelled due to the lockdown.These workers had started from Jalna to go to Bhusawal (both in Maharashtra) - a distance of 157 kilometre - and had planned to go to their native places Umariya and Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh, which is about 850 kilometres away.According to railways, they left Jalna at 7 pm on Thursday and initially walked on road and later onto the track towards Aurangabad. After walking for about 36 kilometres, these workers started feeling tired and sat on the track between Karnad and Badnapur railway stations for taking some rest. They gradually went into deep sleep.It was at 5.22 am that the approaching goods train ran over these labourers, the railways ministry said in a statement. The driver tried to stop the train but couldn’t do so in time, it added.There were 14 people on the track, two adjacent to the track and three away from it, the railways said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the deaths on Twitter. “Extremely anguished by the loss of lives due to the rail accident in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Have spoken to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and he is closely monitoring the situation. All possible assistance required is being provided,” he tweeted.Amid the nationwide lockdown, thousands of migrant workers stranded in several other cities have been on an unending toil to return to their native places on foot.The interstate bus service, passenger, mail and express train services have been suspended since March 24.The Railways has started running ‘Shramik Special’ trains to transport the stranded migrants to their native places since May 1. Till Thursday railways has run 201 ‘Shramik Special’ trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-train-accident-how-16-migrant-labourers-were-killed/story-kdJHMdZU3T2ubxXNdnUKYL.html
08-05-2020||India||‘Lax environmental norms during recession could lead to industries bypassing environmental safeguards’||Inland waterways, hydroelectric projects up to 25 megawatts, small irrigation projects, some industrial parks or housing projects will only require an “environment permission” from authorities to begin construction under the new draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2020. These projects’ environmental impacts will not be assessed in detail because they are believed to have a small environmental footprint, according to reviews of the draft by several researchers.On March 23, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had issued draft EIA notification 2020, which is expected to bring major changes in the way infrastructure projects such as industries, mines, large townships are granted environmental clearance and regulated. The EIA notification 2020, which will replace the EIA notification 2006, has been in the eye of a storm, as environmental groups and political leaders have been calling for debate and clarity on what these changes mean for the country’s fragile ecosystem.Kanchi Kohli and Manju Menon, both of whom specialise in infrastructure, ecology, and resource politics at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, have reviewed the new draft recently and shared their thoughts with HT. Edited excerpts from the interview:Is the draft EIA 2020 significantly different from EIA notification 2006? What do you make of this new draft?At first glance, it seems that the draft EIA 2020 is not very different from the EIA notification 2006. It appears that EIA 2020 only collates all the amendments, executive clarifications, and the court directions that were already in effect between 2006 and now. This draft puts it all together into one document.What makes this draft so unique is that this is the government’s thinking when our economy is crashing like never before because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. This draft creates a complacency that may be dangerous. It makes one feel like this is familiar and that things just got a bit worse. But that is the farthest thing from truth because all the assumptions that the EIA system is based on are under scrutiny now. We may not have too many major projects coming up due to recession. If projects do come up they may not have funds or may not want to invest in environmental safeguards and they may want resources handed to them cheaply so they can reap profits even during a recession. If this is a possibility we are looking at, should we not be thinking carefully before we put this EIA mechanism in place?The draft EIA 2020 has been notified at a time when there is a massive economic slowdown due to Covid-19. If notified, will EIA 2020 boost economic growth by simplifying processes for industries and infrastructure?Environmental approvals cannot boost the economy. Successive governments have propagated this myth by calling environmental approval procedures a hurdle. The ministry has made the frequency of approvals and ease of securing them as its target objective based on this misplaced logic. It keeps recirculating this false narrative of environment vs. development. Speedy approvals may, at best, help to secure investments from the market and finances from banks in the short term. At worst, if approvals are given to wrong projects, they can bring entire sectors, if not the whole economy crashing. We have examples of this in the 2014 Coalgate scandal and the Hydel-gate of the dams in the north-east. The real estate sector is also a good case in point.What does the draft EIA 2020 mean for India’s environment? How does it affect existing environmental standards?The draft has brought 43 sectors within its regulatory purview but it thins down the regulatory process for them. The draft lays out a six-step process and many definitions, giving the impression that there is an elaborate process of scrutiny in place before a project is approved.However, all this needs to be read with the range of exemptions and provisos. For instance, many projects would only require an Environmental Permission (EP) without detailed assessments or public hearings. The draft is also lenient towards expansion and “modernisation” projects that basically use more advanced technologies. For instance, all projects can enhance their capacity by 10% without any appraisals and only filing an online application. The draft proposes that the regulators take the project’s word for these aspects.The draft sets severe limits to the quality of project appraisal, increases the validity of the approval period, gives exemptions to more sectors from the public consultation, allows lenient monitoring and compliance protocols. These are all examples of lowering the standards of environmental regulation of projects.How does the draft EIA impact people? Does it have enough provisions for impacted communities to be heard?Common people have always been and continue to be peripheral to the EIA notification. The public hearing process has been in the notification since 1997, and it still remains with its form and purpose immensely watered down. For example, the EIA 2006 notification had reduced the scope of public hearings. No wonder, when people came to the hearing to speak about how profoundly the project would impact their resources, they simply ticked the procedural boxes.Yet, this public space is very important for all of us. As people, who may be affected by projects, we need information about the project, we need to know from its proponents why they think it’s a good idea to promote it and we need our views about it to be heard by all the stakeholders. This is a reasonable expectation to have in a democracy.Public hearings are still there in the notification but it has been contained a lot by reducing the notice period from 30 to 20 days and by exempting many projects from public hearings altogether. There is a clause in the draft that says that there should be ‘no postponement of date, time, venue of a public hearing’ unless some untoward emergency situation occurs and the postponement will be done only on the recommendations of the authorities concerned.There is a contentious provision in the draft on regularising EIA violations or projects, which have already come up without following due processes. What will be the impact of this provision? Can we expect more projects to violate?This is one of the more significant aspects of the draft EIA 2020. The clause is a big public admission from the government that the EIA system suffers from plenty of violations and this is systemic. This acknowledgment has come due to the hard work of many people and organisations, who have pointed out project violations, documented them, and taken them to task. It seems that the government is ready to admit that development projects have operated outside the framework of the law. So, whether this problem of rampant violations should be handled through statutory law or through government regulation? In this proposal, the government is trying to deal with violations like they are remediation projects.We are not all that confident that the government can carry through this attention it wants to give to violations because it has historically played a facilitative role to development projects in its job as an environmental regulator. It appears difficult that this same institution can restrain projects and extract from them both remediation and compensation costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lax-environmental-norms-during-recession-could-lead-to-industries-bypassing-environmental-safeguards/story-P3mAqONXrfLsauB8321lfK.html

These names don’t have a religious label but suggest that it is a homebred.THE NAME GAMEThe Resistance Front was launched to give terror in Kashmir an indigenous faceTRF was conceived to ward off international pressure on Pakistan from FATFThree top handlers of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan control the TRFLashkar-e-Taiba terrorists form the core of the TRFTRF has claimed responsibility of most major firefights with security forcesOfficials say this is a facade, to help the terror group gain space in the public mindThe intelligence report said the Lashkar leaders formed the core of the TRF.“TRF is being controlled from Pakistan by top three Lashkar handlers: Sajad Jatt for South Kashmir, Khalid for Central Kashmir and Hanzala Adnan for North Kashmir,” the intelligence report accessed by Hindustan Times said.At this point of time, security officials said, the effort appeared to be to project the TRF as a formidable group to attract local recruits. Like when five terrorists and an equal number of army soldiers were killed in the Keran sector in early April, the TRF’s social media managers in Pakistan claimed responsibility.Also Read: From a Twitter handle, the story of Pakistan’s new terror group for KashmirThe group even claimed responsibility for the gunfight in Handwara this weekend that cost security forces five lives including that of an army colonel. One of the two terrorists killed in the operation was later identified by the police as Lashkar commander Haider, a Pakistani national. The other was a local terrorist, a resident of Handwara.“Almost every TRF terrorist, arrested or killed, has been listed in our records under the Lashkar-e-Taiba,” Jammu and Kashmir Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said. Lately, TRF had expanded their net and were also inducting Hizbul terrorists, he said.“The idea is to show the world that what Kashmir has is local militancy,” said KumarAlso Watch : Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo eliminated: All the key detailsImran Khan wades inAs Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday tweeted a swipe at India accusing New Delhi of trying to “find a pretext for a false flag operation targeting Pakistan” - it was seen to be a response to reports of Pakistan’s attempt to infiltrate terrorists - Khan underlined the claim that Kashmir’s troubles were home-grown.“The Indigenous Kashmiri resistance against Indian Occupation is a direct consequence of India’s oppression & brutalisation of Kashmiris,” he tweeted.Khan had last week brought in former director general of the Pak military’s Inter-Services Public Relations Lt Gen (retired) Asim Saleem Bajwa as his new special assistant to lead his media team.Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson followed up on Imran Khan’s tweet on Thursday with a detailed statement that elaborated Khan’s point.“India must realise that it cannot break the will of the Kashmiri people and suppress their indigenous resistance movement through the use of force... We also categorically reject, once again, the baseless Indian allegations of infiltration,” spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said.It was the second time this week that she was using the phrase.The first was two days after the TRF claimed to be involved in the May 3 Handwara encounter involving the Lashkar commander, Haider. “Attributing this indigenous Kashmiri resistance to any alleged “infiltration” is a travesty,” she had tweeted on May 5.How Lashkar hand-holds TRF in KashmirBack in Kashmir, intelligence officials said the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s old guard was focussing on getting TRF new recruits from the Kashmir valley.In north Kashmir, officials said LeT terrorists such as Mehrajdduin Halwal were consolidating the TRF’s base on the ground. Its social media handles, which are being fed content traced back to locations in Pakistan, have been campaigning aggressively. The earliest version of its social media handles too had been traced to internet protocol addresses in Pakistan.“We have now got this account on social media platform Telegram blocked,” Kashmir Police chief Vijay Kumar said, suggesting this is why the group had not put out any updates about the encounter that led to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen’s boss in Kashmir Riyaz Naikoo.For now, security officials expect the TRF to carry out grenade attacks, mostly using its overground workers or fresh recruits rather than risk its trained hands. A grenade attack, lobbed in Srinagar’s Hari Singh High Street in October last year was one of its first terror attacks. The group had, however, lost dozens of grenades when some of its overground workers ferrying AK-47 and grenades were caught by the police in March and are believed to be looking to replenish their supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-launches-terror-s-new-face-in-kashmir-imran-khan-follows-up-on-twitter/story-vDmvByzkeowrW8OKruhS3M.html

But, even before they could wake up, a deadly gas leaked from a chemical factory nearby and jolted them out of their sleep.The pre-dawn disaster - it struck at 2.30 am - led to the death of 11 people and left more than 1,000 struggling for breath.Video from news agency ANI showed emergency workers in the area rushing to help victims, some of whom appeared to be listless and disoriented.A number of victims lay unconscious streetside, as some volunteers fanned them and others rushed to carry them into ambulances. The scene evoked memories of the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy that left at least 4,000 people dead and another 500,000 injured when methyl isocyanate leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in the Madhya Pradesh capital.“The leak was so intense that it turned into a fog and only around 9.30 am could we understand what exactly it was as the thick fog that formed in the area cleared,” news agency PTI quoted district collector V Vinay Chand as saying.The gas spread to villages over a five kilometre radius.As rescuers rushed to take people to the hospital, many others were seen gasping for breath as they tried to flee, disoriented by the vapours. “No one could breathe. I couldn’t see anything for some time,” Vijay Raju, a local resident, said by phone. “For a moment, I thought I would die.”Narendra, another villager, said he sensed something was wrong after he woke up in the middle of the night. “Around 2.30 am, I woke up as my skin was itching. I opened my eyes but felt a burning sensation. I sensed some danger and woke up my family,” he said.State authorities and officials from LG Polymers said they were investigating what caused the leak but a preliminary situation report by district officials said the trigger was a malfunction in equipment, which caused the temperature to rise and the organic compound styrene - normally a liquid - to vaporise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-turned-into-a-fog-locals-recount-vizag-gas-leak-in-which-11-were-killed/story-EV1NfQCJwvrMIR4KwpV1oJ.html

With this, the state expects to generate additional revenue of Rs 250 crore. The price hike on liquor will be effective from Friday.The price of petrol and diesel were increased by Rs 2 and Re 1 per litre respectively. At present, the price of petrol in the state is Rs 72.55 per litre and diesel costs Rs 63.17 per litre. The increase in petrol and diesel price will help the state government generate additional revenue of Rs 120 crore.During the cabinet meeting, 15 proposals were discussed, of which 13 were passed, said Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and spokesperson of the state government.Kaushik said various issues related to coronavirus epidemic were discussed during the meeting. He said they were expecting the centre to categorise all districts in the state under orange and green zone within a day or two.At present, Haridwar is the only district which is under the red zone. The state has 61 positive Covid-19 cases out of which 39 (64 %) have recovered. “This situation here is much better than in the neighbouring state Uttar Pradesh or at the national level,” said Kaushik.Kaushik said that 1.7 lakh people stranded in other states have registered for return to the state so far. “Of these, 7,625 from Garhwal and 4,895 from Kumaon have urged that they want to return using private vehicles. Those who want to return through public transport provided by the state government include 79,592 from Garhwal and 78,137 from Kumaon region. These stranded people will be brought back over the next few days”, he saidTo retain the people who have returned to the state during the lockdown, employment through Mukhyamantri Swarojgar Yojana will be provided to them, said Kaushik. “Under MSME, we have created three categories, and these people will be provided loans to start their ventures here so that they can stay in their home state and earn their livelihood”, he said.According to the state rural development and migration commission, over 59,360 migrants working away from their home districts have returned to the state during the lockdown.SS Negi, vice chairman of the commission, said, “We have utilised the database of the returned migrants created by the state health department. Using the details, we contacted some of them to find out what measures could be taken to make them start working here.”Negi said out of the total 60,000 people approximately, “65% work in other states like Delhi, Goa and Chhattisgarh followed by 25 % in plain cities of the state and 5% in foreign countries like Australia, New Zealand, Gulf and China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/healthcare-tax-on-sale-of-liquor-hiked-prices-of-petrol-diesel-to-generate-revenue-in-uttarakhand/story-fPIpISJnzM9L0KCyQyD0LJ.html
08-05-2020||India||Govt asks factories to exercise caution after gas leak at Visakhapatnam plant||Union chemicals and fertilisers minister D V Sadananda Gowda on Thursday urged all public and private chemical makers to exercise caution and care while reopening their plants that suspended operations due to the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19.Union environment ministry and state pollution control boards issued separate directives to all companies to take precautions while restarting.The announcements came on a day when three separate accidents killed 11 and left several injured in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh.All the fatalities were in Visakhapatnam, where a styrene gas leak at a polymer plant forced the evacuation of thousands of people in the 3-kilometre radius.In Tamil Nadu, a boiler at an NLC India thermal power plant in Cuddalore exploded, causing brief blaze. The incident left two workers injured, an NLC official said. “Due to pressure, there was an explosion in the boiler and it led to a flash fire injuring six workers and two technicians.”In the third incident, seven workers fell ill — three of them seriously — after inhaling poisonous gas at Shakti Paper Mill in Chhattisgarh’s Raigarh, police said. The incident occurred when the victims were cleaning a recycling chamber late on Wednesday, said SP Santosh Singh.The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) recommended better operational guidelines be given to the plants. “The (Visakhapatnam) leakage has happened due to irregular maintenance of storage tanks during the lockdown.Styrene must be kept at a temperature below 17C however since the plant was under partial shutdown the maintenance activities were irregular. Another industry disaster was reported at a Paper mill in Chhattisgarh -- when gas leaks affected the workers who were housekeeping at the units. The third incident was at Neyveli thermal power station. Two boilers of 210 MW capacity blasted... While these boiler units were in running condition, poor maintenance practices due to less manpower in the plant is suspected a reason for the blast. It is clear industries are in haste to restart operation post lockdown...” said Nivit K Yadav, industries researcher, CSE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-factories-to-exercise-caution-after-gas-leak-at-visakhapatnam-plant/story-SbVJAGgmb8Ye7nPUFn3vmM.html

08-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||There are four animals that have become relevant in the context of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This column is about them.It was only in 2013, after a decade of looking for the source of the Sars-CoV (or Sars-CoV-1) virus that causes the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that scientists found the natural host of the virus, horseshoe bats — specifically, horseshoe bats in a cave outside a large city in China’s Yunnan province. Somehow, the virus had made the jump from the bats, to civets in Guangdong, and from them to humans (the Chinese eat civet meat and the first people to be infected were wildlife traders from Guangdong). A fascinating article in Scientific American in March narrated this quest as part of its profile of Shi Zhengli, a virologist in Wuhan. Scientists say the bats may well be the natural host of the virus that causes the coronavirus disease too.Horseshoe bats, then, are the first animals of relevance in the context of Covid-19. That shouldn’t surprise anyone. Research has established that bats are hosts to more zoonoses (pathogens that can cross over to humans, causing an infection) than any other species.Sometimes, the transmission happens directly. Sometimes, it happens through another animal. In the case of Sars, it was the masked palm civet that was the intermediary. In the case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or Mers, it was a species of camel. In the case of Covid-19, scientists believe the intermediary was the pangolin — specifically, the Malayan Pangolin. India has a species of pangolin too, the Indian Pangolin. Pangolins are widely used in Chinese medicine, so it’s easy to see how Sars-CoV-2 could have jumped from bats to pangolins to humans.The pangolin, then is the second animal of relevance in the context of Covid-19, which, as of Thursday, has infected 3.8 million people, and killed 265,000 (of the 3.8 million, 1.3 million have recovered).The global scale of the pandemic, which has no cure right now, has meant everyone knows the significance of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. This is the vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford. The vaccine hopes to tackle Covid-19 by injecting a weakened adenovirus into which genetic material from Sars-CoV-2 has been inserted — something that should generate an immune response. The adenovirus the scientists at Oxford are using is one that causes cold in chimpanzees, which explains the name of the vaccine (Ch for chimpanzee and Ad for adenovirus). We humans share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees and bonobos (another ape, and one that belongs to the same genus as chimpanzees).Chimpanzees are the third animal of relevance in the context of Covid-19, especially given that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 remains our best bet yet. There are expectations that it will be available this year itself, and India’s Serum Institute has already started making it — taking a bet that an ongoing clinical trial will work.But chimpanzees aren’t the only potential saviours of the human race. Over the past two days, there has been a lot of focus on llamas, the ungulates with pretty eyelashes. It turns out that they have antibodies that can tackle Covid-19 (the findings of a study on this were published earlier this week on the respected journal, Cell). It also turns out that the antibodies produced by llamas can be merged with antibodies produced by other species, including humans. Indeed, research has shown that all other members of the family llamas belong to, camelidae, produce antibodies with the same property — they are stable at higher temperatures, and lend themselves to genetic engineering because of their small size.The llama, then, is the fourth animal of relevance in the context of the pandemic. And if llamas hold the answer to the virus, they will become as famous as the horses that helped humankind in the fight against diphtheria -- but that’s another story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-8OgLIJ3cGJa9ZrI77F725M.html

At present, there is only one active case in the district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-more-nanded-linked-covid-19-cases-reported-in-punjab/story-IAAEOLOGwK4VsBnZdHxrcP.html
08-05-2020||India||‘Evacuation precautionary’: Vizag police dismiss report of second gas leak||Police in Visakhapatnam on Friday rejected late night reports of another gas leak at the chemical plant in RR Venkatapuram village and said that the order to evacuate people from nearby areas was only precautionary, according to news agency ANI. People residing in the 2 km radius of the surrounding gas leakage area were ordered to evacuate late Thursday night. Vishakhapatnam Police Commissioner RK Meena assured people that there was no need to panic and that the evacuation was only a precautionary measure.“People are requested to evacuate the area only within 2 km radius of the spot as a precautionary measure. People beyond the 2 km radius don’t need to evacuate or come out on the road. No need to panic,” the police commissioner was quoted as saying.The development comes in the backdrop of styrene gas leakage at LG Polymers industry in Vishakhapatnam’s RR Venkatapuram village early Thursday that left 11 people dead, 25 critically ill and close to 1,000 were reported sick. Late Thursday, ANI quoted Visakhapatnam District Fire Officer Sandeep Anand as saying, “Around 50 fire staffers, with NDRF’s support, are carrying out the operation. We’ve ordered evacuation of villages in 2-3 km radius for safe side precautions.” Ten more fire tenders, including two foam tenders were present at the spot while ambulances have been kept ready for any emergency, he added.State authorities and officials from LG Polymers are probing the cause of the leakage. However, a preliminary situation report by district officials said the trigger was a malfunction in equipment, which caused the temperature to rise and the organic compound styrene – normally a liquid – to vaporise.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has announced Rs 1 crore each as compensation to the next of kin of the deceased. Those undergoing treatment on ventilator would get Rs 10 lakh each while others who are hospitalised but not on ventilator, would received Rs 1 lakh each as compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gas-fumes-leak-again-from-tanker-at-visakhapatnam-site-report/story-E4Dv2tG3OAU0mqIwmvsaxJ.html
08-05-2020||India||2 deaths in BSF, forces’ Covid-19 case count nears 500||The Border Security Force (BSF) on Thursday said that two of its personnel succumbed to the coronavirus disease, while a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawan deployed at Mumbai airport died, even as the total Covid-19 cases in central paramilitary forces reached close to 500.These were first casualties due to the pandemic in the border guarding force, BSF, and CISF, which guards several airports and the Delhi Metro. Both the BSF personnel died this week in Delhi. While the BSF reported 41 new cases on Thursday, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) reported 21 fresh infections, CISF 10, and the Sashastra Seema Bal five. Till Wednesday, the tally of Covid-19 cases in the paramilitary forces was around 400, according to government data.BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj said in a statement that the first jawan was critically ill patient, and died after he contracted the infection while at a super-speciality hospital for treatment. The second jawan died at Safdarjung hospital on May 4. His Covid-19 test was done after his death, prior to the post-mortem examination. The result confirming the infection came only on Wednesday. The BSF’s fresh 41 new infections have taken the force’s Covid-19 tally to 193 across the country.“Prahari pariwar (the BSF family) is grief-stricken with deaths of two personnel during this pandemic,” a BSF statement said. “Braving the challenges of securing frontiers, working with civil administration and while shouldering other essential responsibilities, 41 new Covid-19 positive cases have been reported since yesterday. Most of these BSF personnel have been aiding civil police in duties during this critical phase of the Covid-19 pandemic,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-deaths-in-bsf-forces-case-count-nears-500/story-RKlFvAL03Pcj9eMCBdSD3H.html
08-05-2020||India||5,231 railway coaches to be used as Covid-19 isolation wards at 215 stations||The Centre has drafted a plan to deploy 5,231 railway coaches as isolation wards across 215 stations in 15 states “considering the possibility of an increase in cases of Covid-19.”The ministry of railways said on Thursday the plan is to use these coaches if a state has “exhausted the facilities and needs to augment capacities for isolation...”The health ministry has come out with a standard operating procedure (SOP) for deploying these coaches. “The coaches can be used for very mild cases that can be clinically assigned to the COVID care centres as per guidelines issued by the health ministry,” it said.The coaches shall be deployed in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha. The national carrier will provide health care facilities in 85 of the 215 stations. In the rest of the 130 stations, states will run the operations only if they are able to provide staff and essential medicines, the ministry said.According to the health ministry guidelines, states will request the railways for the deployment of such coaches if the need arises. After allocation by the railways, coaches will be placed at the required station with necessary infrastructure. The concerned district collector/magistrate or a nodal officer appointed by the government will be handed over the responsibility.Catering arrangements shall be done by the Indian Railways’ catering arm, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), the guidelines said. Watering, electricity as well as repairs required shall be taken care of by the railways. The Railway Protection Force will ensure security to the coaches, patients and staff working there.The railways will designate state-wise nodal officers for allocation of trains and for coordinating with the respective state governments.“As far as possible, wherever cases are admitted in the COVID Care Centre coach, preferably individual cabin should be assigned for each case. Should the situation warrant, up to a maximum of two confirmed patients can be assigned in individual cabin,” the guidelines said.Additionally, the national carrier will deploy more than 2,500 doctors and 35,000 paramedic staff to combat Covid-19. Doctors and paramedics are being recruited on a temporary basis by various zones of the railways, the guidelines said. Around 5,000 beds in 17 dedicated hospitals and 33 hospital blocks in railway hospitals have been identified for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-231-rly-coaches-to-be-used-as-isolation-wards-at-215-stations/story-jpUjLPyw8uRLZKPjhCx4kI.html

Ahmedabad accounted for more than half of the cases--4,991-- and Surat 799. Of the 425 deaths, 321 have been reported from Ahmedabad and 37 from Surat.Gujarat was among the states where the Centre last month deputed interministerial teams to probe perceived lapses in efforts to control Covid-19 and violations of lockdown regulations.Gujarat police chief Shivanand Jha said the paramilitary forces will monitor the containment areas in Ahmedabad and Surat as the rate of transmission of the virus is higher there. “A special reserve force has been assigned to Gujarat for the strict implementation of lockdown as per chief minister Vijay Rupani’s request to the Centre,” he said. He added all shops except pharmacies and dairies will remain shut in the state until May 15.Jha said the paramilitary forces were deployed to curb the movement of people. He added the lockdown will be stricter in the containment areas.“We have issued orders for continuous patrolling to ensure no one violates the lockdown. ...in such areas, only certain roads will be open, and only authorised persons will be allowed to move. Legal actions will be taken against those stepping out without permissions and their vehicles will be impounded. If shops other than those selling medicines and milk are found to be open, their owners will be arrested and strict action will be taken,” Jha said.The state government has barred all movement from 7 pm to 7 am and ordered the closure of roads and bridges for the purpose. The state police have been instructed to increase checking while the paramilitary, civil defense, home guard, and all other forces were on high alert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-carry-out-flag-marches-in-guj-to-enforce-curbs/story-5CRMiHnOyqMatiUMUaom6M.html
08-05-2020||India||12 DTH channels catering to all classes in the offing||The Union human resources development (HRD) ministry is planning to start 12 direct-to-home (DTH) television channels, each catering to students from one academic year, to serve as virtual classrooms at a time when schools are shut due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and there are questions if the online learning might leave behind those with slow or limited connectivity.Two senior government officials familiar with the matter said that the ministry sees this as a way to bridge the digital divide for students from Classes 1 to 12.“The ministry is pursuing a ‘one class, one channel’ plan. The department of school education and literacy may anchor these 12 channels with appropriate content for every class. The expertise of agencies such as the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) and CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) may be used to develop content and run these channels,” said the official who asked not to be named.While several schools have started online classes, there have been connectivity concerns, and concerns over the amount of additional screen time children will end up being exposed to.“Internet cannot reach everyone. Therefore, the HRD ministry is exploring radio and television as well. One of the major initiatives is to start 12 DTH channels, each dedicated to one class, from Standard 1 to 12. Appropriate subject-relared content, in different languages, will be beamed to homes. These channels will be free,” said a second official on condition of anonymity.Some institutions have been using DTH to disseminate education, and it is these existing Swayam Prabha channels which will be repackaged, the official added.A third official said that a DTH channel catering to higher education sector is also on the cards, and may be launched in consultation with the All India Council for Higher Education (AICTE).Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did a review of the education sector, and his focus was on leveraging technology to ensure that even those in the remotest parts are reached, said the official cited above. The HRD ministry has been working on an e-Vidya plan, according to the officials.In an interview to HT last month, Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said that to address the digital divide, his ministry had tied up with Information & Broadcasting ministry to air Swayam Prabha channels on their DTH platform, Tata Sky, and Airtel DTH. Earlier, these Swayam channels were be available on DD-DTH, Dish TV, and Jio TV App. “Now a student anywhere in India can request the DTH service provider for these channels without any extra cost as these are free-to-air channels. Swayam Prabha is a group of 32 DTH channels providing high quality educational curriculum based course contents covering diverse disciplines,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-dth-channels-catering-to-all-classes-in-the-offing/story-nZlEDi8EPe0phmvmOoHWNO.html
08-05-2020||India||New J&K terror outfit run by LeT brass: Intel||The Resistance Front (TRF), a new terror group that has taken responsibility for major attacks and gunfights in Jammu & Kashmir over the past few weeks, is controlled by three top handlers of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in Pakistan, according to an intelligence report submitted to national security planners in New Delhi.The idea behind TRF is to give terror in Kashmir an indigenous face, while also warding off international pressure on Pakistan, particularly from anti-terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that is keeping a close watch on Islamabad’s activities, the report added.Security officials aware of the matter said that TRF was launched late last year after Parliament nullified Jammu & Kashmir’s special status on August 5, and divided the state into two centrally administered Union territories — Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir.Attempts to put an India label on terror activities, one of the security officials cited above said, are reflected in the names Pakistani’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) has picked for new groups -- such as TRF or the low-key JK Pir Panjal Peace Forum. These names don’t have a religious label, but suggest that they are India-bred, the official said on condition of anonymity.The intelligence report prepared by Indian security officials on TRF said Lashkar leaders formed the core of the group. At this point, it said, efforts appeared to be concentrated on projecting TRF as a formidable force to attract local recruits.“TRF is being controlled from Pakistan by top three Lashkar handlers: Sajad Jatt for South Kashmir, Khalid for Central Kashmir and Hanzala Adnan for North Kashmir,” said the report accessed by HT.TRF’s social media managers in Pakistan claimed responsibility after five terrorists and an equal number of army soldiers were killed in the Keran sector early April.The group also claimed responsibility for the gunfight in north Kashmir’s Handwara town that killed five security men, including the commanding officer of a Rashtriya Rifles battalion and a Major, over the weekend. One of the two terrorists killed in the operation was later identified as Lashkar commander Haider, a Pakistani national. The other person was a local terrorist, a resident of Handwara.In Twitter posts on Wednesday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan accused India of trying to “find a pretext for a false flag operation” targeting his country even as he put emphasis on what he called indigenous “Kashmiri resistance” in the region. His tweets were seen by security experts as a response to reports of Pakistan’s attempt to send terrorists into India.Last week, Khan brought in Lt Gen (retired) Asim Saleem Bajwa, a former director general of the Pakistani military’s inter-services public relations, as his new special assistant.Indian intelligence officials said the LeT’s old guard was focusing on getting TRF new recruits from the Kashmir Valley.In north Kashmir, they added, LeT terrorists such as Mehrajdduin Halwal are consolidating TRF’s base. Also, the group’s social media handles, which feature content traced back to locations in Pakistan, have been campaigning aggressively. The earliest version of its social media handles has been traced to internet protocol addresses in Pakistan.For now, security officials expect TRF to carry out grenade attacks, mostly using its overground workers or fresh recruits rather than risking its trained hands. A grenade lobbed in Srinagar’s Hari Singh High Street in October last year was one of its first attacks, they said. The group, however, lost dozens of grenades when the police caught some of its overground workers ferrying arms and ammunition in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-j-k-terror-outfit-run-by-let-brass-intel/story-wLZ5ACFQJMHVa8kt7weTPO.html
08-05-2020||India||2 warships sent to Maldives to bring back stranded Indians||The first phase of an operation by the navy to bring back Indians stranded overseas will begin on Friday after two warships dispatched to the Maldives reach the island nation late in the night.The navy said on Thursday that INS Jalashwa had reached the shores of Maldives and phase one of the operation called ‘Samudra Setu’ will commence on Friday.The navy’s solitary landing platform dock , the INS Jalashwa, (formerly known as USS Trenton) was bought from the United States 13 years ago. The second ship, INS Magar, is expected to arrive in the Maldives later on Thursday night.Indians being brought from Male to Kochi on INS Jalashwa will have to pay $40 for the transportation as “evacuation services charge,” the High Commission of India in Maldives said on Thursday. Former navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash told Hindustan Times that such a charge was being imposed for the first time. “This has never happened before,” he said.The high commission said on Twitter that the amount would be collected at the service fee collection counter after completion of the immigration process at Velana International Airport in the Maldives. “If this is humanitarian assistance, why are people being charged,” said two senior retired navy officers asking not to be named.The evacuated personnel will be disembarked in Kochi and handed over the respective agencies of various states. The navy said the ‘Samudra Setu’ is being carried out with the cooperation of various central ministries and state governments. All people will be given basic amenities and medical care during the voyage.The navy has kept two ships on standby for evacuation from the Gulf --- INS Shardul and INS Airavat.The navy on Tuesday dispatched two amphibious warships to Male to evacuate Indians stranded in the Maldives amid the swift spread of coronavirus disease globally. The navy is bringing back Indian nationals stuck overseas under operation Samudra Setu and is expected to help around 1,000 people.Indian warships have carried out large-scale evacuations in the past.Operation Sukoon was launched by navy to evacuate Indian, Sri Lankan and Nepalese nationals, as well as Lebanese nationals with Indian spouses, from the conflict zone during the 2006 Lebanon War. The task force consisted of INS Mumbai, INS Brahmaputra, INS Betwa and fleet tanker INS Shakti. A total of 2,280 people including 1,764 Indians were evacuated.In 2015, the navy carried out a major evacuation from Yemen under Operation Raahat. Indian ships Sumitra, Mumbai, Tarkash were among the vessels that took part in the operation. It resulted in the evacuation of 3,074 people from Yemen, including 1,291 foreign nationals||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-warships-sent-to-maldives-to-bring-back-stranded-indians/story-QMeLbfmr8MXULhN3VJD8cI.html
08-05-2020||India||Llama antibodies hold clue to Covid-19 treatment||Winter, a four-year-old chocolate brown female llama in a Belgian farm, may hold clues to mitigating the Covid-19 crisis, according to scientists.Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin linked two copies of a special kind of antibody produced by llamas to create a new antibody that binds to a key protein on Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease. Initial test results to be published in the journal Cell on May 28 indicate that this antibody blocks viruses that display the spike protein - including Sars-CoV-2 - from entering and infecting cells. The inspiration to do this research came from a study conducted on Winter by the same team in 2016.Back then, when Winter was nine months old, researchers were studying two earlier coronaviruses: Sars-CoV-1 (which caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003), and Mers-CoV (which caused the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012). Winter was injected with spike proteins from those viruses over six weeks. Researchers then collected a blood sample and isolated antibodies that bound to each version of the spike protein. One of them showed promise in stopping the virus from infecting cells.“That was exciting to me because I’d been working on this for years. But there wasn’t a big need for a coronavirus treatment then. This was just basic research. Now, this can potentially have some translational implications too,” said Daniel Wrapp, a graduate student in McLellan Lab and co-first author of the paper in a statement published on University of Austin website.“This is one of the first antibodies known to neutralise Sars-CoV-2,” said Jason McLellan, associate professor of molecular biosciences at UT Austin and co-senior author. The University of Texas team is now preparing to conduct preclinical studies in animals such as hamsters or primates. Unlike vaccines that have to be given in advance to provide protection, antibodies can be given to people who are already sick to reduce severity of disease. They start working immediately, the authors said.When the immune systems of llamas or other camelids detect bacteria and viruses, they produce two types of antibodies: one that is similar to human antibodies, and another so tiny that they’re called nanobodies. Aravind Penmatsa, scientist at Indian Institute of Science has been studying this unique quality, and his group isolated camel antibodies with help from National Research Centre on Camel, Bikaner.“Camels and llamas have a unique antibody structure that lacks the light chain that is conventionally present in other species including humans. Conventional antibodies have both the heavy and light chains and resemble a “Y” shaped molecule. Despite lacking the light chain, camelid antibodies retain the neutralising ability of the large antibodies within a single domain called the VHH or nanobodies. Due to their small size, the camelid or llama antibodies have unique advantages, for instance, ease of production, and greater ability to interact with deep cavities and pockets on target surfaces,” said Penmatsa , responding to the University of Texas study over email.Penmatsa has an ongoing study on the effectiveness of camel antibodies in treating antimicrobial resistance.Camelid antibodies are being studied for their potential in monitoring and treatment of tumors, therapies for inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, drug delivery and passive immunotherapy according to an article in Frontiers journal.But experts warned that it may take a long time before such findings develop into therapy. “It’s still a long way to go. The paper has shown the potential of these antibodies in inhibiting coronavirus from entering mammalian cells. Further pre-clinical experiments are needed in relevant animal models to see if antibodies are stable and neutralise the virus inside animals. Generally pre-clinical studies take years but considering the pandemic challenge this can be done in months to a year,” said Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/llama-antibodies-hold-clue-to-covid-19-treatment/story-JI6hw0lySiBFORGkXDfSJN.html
08-05-2020||India||India set to lead post-pandemic baby boom: UN||India will be at the centre of a baby boom triggered by the Covid-19 outbreak, which has prompted lockdowns across the world and confined residents indoors, according to a report by the United Nations. “The pandemic could strain health care capacities for mothers and newborns,” the report by Unicef, released on Thursday, warned.“An estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Unicef said. This represents a spike for the period assessed. “New mothers and newborns will be greeted by harsh realities.”India, with 20.1 million births, tops the nations with the anticipated highest numbers of births in the nine months since the World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11 declared the outbreak pandemic, the UN body said. India declared a three-week nationwide lockdown with effect from March 25 that has since been extended twice, until May 17.Following India will be countries such as China (13.5 million births), Nigeria (6.4 million), Pakistan (5 million) and Indonesia (4 million).According to estimates of the United Nations Population Fund, 141 million births were recorded worldwide last year, of which 27.2 were in India. “Covid-19 containment measures can disrupt life-saving health services such as childbirth care, putting millions of pregnant mothers and their babies at great risk,” Unicef’s executive director, Henrietta Fore, said in the global report. Developing countries are especially at risk, she said.The UN body made projections for a 40-week period between March 11 and December 16, 2020, in its estimate based upon the WHO’s March 11 assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic.India has made considerable progress in social indicators, but still lags many countries in indices such as maternal health, access to contraception and immunisation. While India is expected to become the most populous country by 2015, the country’s population is increasing at slower pace than before. The total fertility rate -- that is the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime -- for the country currently stands at 2.2 children for every woman; it was marginally higher, at 2.3, from 2013 to 2016. “The government’s population policy objectives are in alignment with national development goals. There is considerable campaign towards family planning and two-child norm,” an official of Niti Aayog, the government’s policy think tank, said on condition of anonymity.According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), the prevalence rate of anaemia among Indian women has witnessed just a speck of minor improvement from 55% in 2005-06 to 53% in 2015-16.Unicef said most of the countries which will witness a baby boom (including India) had “high neonatal mortality rates” even before the pandemic and “may see these levels increase with Covid-19 conditions”.“That’s very true. Family welfare has got a big knockdown. Access to birth-control measures during the lockdown has been scarce. There is a high possibility of unprotected sex among spouses. Adequate resources must be reserved for a birth boom,” said Dr Sushil Sharma, a public health expert and chairman of the Arthritis Foundation of India.According to Purushottam M Kulkarni of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, data from the NHFS shows that between 2005-06 and 2015-16 (NFHS-4), there has been little improvement in access to contraception, indicating an unmet need for contraception.Unmet need for contraception is measured as the share of women who are fertile and want to postpone their next birth or stop childbearing altogether but don’t have access to contraception.Even wealthier countries are affected by this crisis, the UN body said. “In the US, the sixth highest country in terms of expected number of births, over 3.3 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. In New York, authorities are looking into alternative birthing centres as many pregnant women are worried about giving birth in hospitals.”Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns died every year, or 1 every 11 seconds, mostly of preventable causes, data from WHO show. The UN body called for allocating dedicated resources to lifesaving services and supplies for maternal and child health. India’s maternal mortality rate (MMR) declined from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-2016 to 122 in 2015-2018, according to the latest data available with the National Sample Registration System.“We still do badly, despite improvements in several indicators... Better institutional health care for newborns and mothers are even more important now,” said Abishek Jaiswal, a demographer with Allahabad University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-lead-post-pandemic-baby-boom-un/story-EBThzqy9cPskYpL6L6WLTP.html
08-05-2020||India||Hizb commander Riyaz Naikoo buried 100km from his hometown to avoid crowding||Hizbul Mujahideen operational commander Riyaz Naikoo was buried around 100 kilometres from his village on Thursday, a day after he and an associate were killed in an encounter with security forces in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The two local militants were buried in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district to avoid crowding and to ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines during the lockdown. It was not clear if Naikoo’s family members were present.The 35-year-old top Hizbul leader and was killed in his village, Gulzarpora Beighpora, after a five-hour gunfight on Wednesday, in what security experts described as a big success for the Indian forces.Strict restrictions imposed in Kashmir after the encounter continued for the second day with mobile internet and prepaid phone services suspended. Stone-pelters, provoked by messages on the social media, have clashed with forces after encounters targeting local militants in the past. Over 16 people were injured in protests that ensued in south Kashmir after Naikoo’s death. Though there were reports that a person died due to his injuries, officials did not confirm any death.Divulging what led to the successful operation, Jammu and Kashmir director general of police Dilbag Singh said the people who made an underground hideout close to the house of Naikoo led security forces to him.“This hideout was close to his house and was inside the wall…the people who had constructed the hideout led us there. We have intruded their overground network,” he said.”He released videos/audios on a number of occasions carrying pro-Pakistan and separatist propaganda and executed a series of attacks on policemen, security forces and civilians,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hizb-commander-naikoo-buried-100km-from-his-hometown-to-avoid-crowding/story-rHHqlp7Q8rbdzuun3cpj6N.html
08-05-2020||India||11 die in Vizag factory gas leak, hundreds evacuated||At least 11 people died, 25 were left critically ill, and close to 1,000 were affected after a chemical from a factory leaked and hung as smog over nearby villages in Visakhapatnam district in the early hours of Thursday, jolting awake hundreds of residents who choked due to the toxic gas before they could flee the area.State authorities and officials from LG Polymers said they were investigating what caused the leak but a preliminary situation report by district officials said the trigger was a malfunction in equipment, which caused the temperature to rise and the organic compound styrene – normally a liquid – to vaporise. The incident prompted the Union government to issue an advisory to chemical plants to take extra precautions while restarting their operations from what will be more than a month’s halt due to the nationwide shutdown in place to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “About 20km from Visakhapatnam, styrene gas, which is toxic and injurious to human health, was leaked. Nearly 1,000 people living around the area may have been impacted and have been evacuated,” said National Disaster Management Authority member Kamal Kishore at a press briefing in New Delhi. Videos and photos from the area showed men, women and children unconscious in the streets, some lying next to fallen motorcycles. The scene evoked memories of the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy that left at least 4,000 people dead and another 500,000 injured when methyl isocyanate leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in the Madhya Pradesh capital.Styrene can affect people’s breathing and brain function, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria said the briefing, adding: “Some may have trouble breathing and may need a ventilator. We have to monitor their oxygen levels, respiratory rate and in case of a bronchospasm, they may need steroids.”However, the illness is not universally fatal, he added. According to Andhra Pradesh director general of police Gautam Sawang, two of the fatalities were caused when people collapsed while running from the site. The others died because they were exposed to toxic levels of the gas. A chemical disaster response team was dispatched to the area and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to officials of the ministry of home affairs and the NDMA to take stock of the situation. Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has ordered a probe into the matter, Sawang added.According to a preliminary report prepared by district officials, Thursday’s incident was triggered by a malfunction in the refrigeration unit that was meant to keep the styrene at below 20°C. “Styrene monomer is normally in a liquid state and is safe below a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. But, because of the malfunctioning of the refrigeration unit, the chemical started gasifying,” said district collector V Vinay Chand, quoting the report submitted by the Factories Department, PTI reported.The leak was so intense that it turned into a fog and “only around 9.30am could we understand what exactly it was as the thick fog that formed in the area cleared,” Chand added.LG Chem Ltd, which owns LG Polymers, is South Korea’s largest chemical company and is part of the LG Corp conglomerate. The company said it is cooperating with Indian authorities to help residents and employees.LG polymers produces synthetic materials known as polystyrene and engineering plastic compounds. Styrene is a hydrocarbon that is used as a precursor -- an ingredient -- in the making of these products. “The gas leakage is now under control, but the leaked gas can cause nausea and dizziness, so we are investing every effort to ensure proper treatment is provided swiftly,” LG Chem said in a statement.Experts warned the incident, and two others that took place on Thursday – an explosion in a boiler unit of a factory in Tamil Nadu and a toxic gas leak at a paper mill in Chhattisgarh – underscore the need to reopen industries carefully. In the other two incidents, 14 people were left ill with no fatalities. “Three industrial accidents have happened today coincidentally when factories are reopening after relaxations from Covid-19 lockdown. One of the commonalities among these incidents has been poor operational and maintenance practises during the lockdown and other is shortage of skilled staff for maintenance work. Maintaining power stations or any industries with less staff is a risk and such incidents in this scenario are not surprising,” said Nivit K Yadav, industries researcher at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).“It is clear industries are in haste to restart operation post lockdown which could be detrimental to worker’s safety and safety of the neighbourhood. CSE recommends better operational guidelines be given to the plants which will be restarting post lockdown,” he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-die-in-vizag-factory-gas-leak-hundreds-evacuated/story-iOeF207wdSKYSSeX7OKbNI.html

Police and fire service personnel rushed to the scene and took out the body of the nun, who had been staying at the convent for more than a year. The exact cause of her death was not immediately known and police said it will be determined only when they get her post-mortem report. Police suspect it to be a case of suicide. “As of now, no foul play is suspected,” said a police officer on the condition of anonymity and added the nun was undergoing training.Police have registered an unnatural death case. A student was found dead in a well at a convent in Kerala’s Kottayam in 1992. It was initially dismissed as a case of suicide before investigators concluded the student had been murdered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nun-found-dead-in-well-at-kerala-convent-police-suicide-suspected/story-RSfof4EuYWJlaaYWJvhWhP.html
08-05-2020||India||Over 9,300 Military Engineer Services posts set to be abolished||Over 9,300 posts in the Military Engineer Services (MES) are set to be abolished as defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday approved a proposal made by the army’s Engineer-in-Chief in this regard, the defence ministry said in a statement. The MES is a construction and maintenance agency of the armed forces and has an annual budget of around Rs 13,000 crore.The abolition of the posts is one of the outcomes of the recommendations made by the Lt Gen DB Shekatkar committee report on enhancing the army’s combat potential and trimming its expenditure.“One of the recommendations made by the committee was to restructure the civilian workforce in a manner that the work of MES could be partly done by departmentally employed staff and other works could be outsourced,” said the statement on the abolition of 9,304 posts out of total 13,157 vacancies of the basic and industrial staff of the MES.The ministry said the recommendation to cut the posts was aimed at making the MES an effective organisation, with a leaner workforce well equipped to handle complex issues in an efficient and cost-effective manner.Welcoming the move to abolish the posts, Shekatkar said this was an important step towards the progressive reduction of the workforce in the coming years. “The MES is a World War II concept. It’s a drain on our resources. It’s very important to spend our resources judiciously. There will be no increase in the defence budget for the next two to three years because of the situation created by Covid-19. We have to use our money wisely as our adversaries will not wait for us to build capabilities,” Shekatkar said.The MES is responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of all army, navy and air force infrastructure but experts believe outsourcing these works is a better and cheaper option.The Shekatkar panel made 188 suggestions of which 99 have been accepted by the ministry and others are under consideration.The recommendations relate to several organisations including the MES, Defence Research and Development Organisation, Directorate General of Quality Assurance, Directorate General of Defence Estates, the Ordnance Factory Board and defence accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-9-300-military-engineer-services-posts-set-to-be-abolished/story-BuzJTKmdhdvi9H4t2irAhM.html
08-05-2020||India||Former Punjab top cop booked in 1991 abduction case||Former Punjab police chief Sumedh Singh Saini and seven other ex-policemen have been booked for the alleged enforced disappearance of a junior engineer in 1991.Saini was Chandigarh’s senior police superintendent when Balwant Singh Multani, the junior engineer, was picked up following a terrorist attack on Saini which left four policemen dead.“An FIR [First Information Report] was registered against Saini and others on the complaint of Jalandhar-resident and Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh,” a Punjab police officer said.In the fresh complaint, Palwinder Singh cited Saini’s influence and said they could not get justice because of it.“After retirement of Saini [in June 2018], our family again got some courage to resume our efforts to fight for justice,” Palwinder Singh said in his complaint.The Central Bureau of Investigation initiated a probe against Saini over the disappearance of Multani, who was a resident of Mohali near Chandigarh, in 2007 on Punjab and Haryana high court’s directions. The Supreme Court quashed the probe in 2011 after then Shiromani Akali Dal-led Punjab government challenged the high court order.On Thursday, a Punjab police spokesperson said the apex court had also given the family the liberty to take recourse to fresh proceedings.Saini accused Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh of trying to settle a score with him. “What comments are required when a chief minister joins hands with anti-national elements to settle a personal score for having him booked for corruption?” said Saini.Saini challenged a state vigilance bureau’s closure report in the Ludhiana City Centre scam in 2018 in which Amarinder Singh was an accused. Amarinder Singh termed Saini’s allegations as baseless. “There is no question of political interference and the law will take its own course.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-top-cop-booked-in-1991-abduction-case/story-VkdRYXhcqK0LbdeMLkPBYJ.html
08-05-2020||India||Not every virus mutation is issue of concern, say experts||Has Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), mutated to become more deadly and contagious? Researchers around the world have identified dozens of mutations that they said has made the virus more lethal or transmissible, or both, which has fuelled uncertainty about the future, but experts say there is no significant mutation to suggest change in viral behaviour.Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US recently caused alarm when they identified 14 mutations, of which “the mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; after beginning to spread in Europe in early February, when introduced to new regions it repeatedly and rapidly becomes the dominant form”. The study, published in pre-print server, bioRxiv, on April 29, has not been peer-reviewed.Independent experts say these findings have no clinical significance. All viruses mutate. A virus causes infection by entering the host cell and making copies of itself, which it does by duplicating its genes. Small errors in the duplication become mutations, which usually have no effect on viral behaviour. “It is normal for viruses to change over time and to become more or less transmissible, cause more or less fatalities. The virus causing Covid-19 disease remains relatively stable so far,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, World Health Organization (WHO), South-East Asia region, of which India is apart.Not every mutation creates a new strain, which is used to describe a lineage that is significantly different from earlier viruses. “In my opinion, there is no clear evidence of any different strains of clinical significance. By sequence, one can identify phylogenetic clades, some of which show mutations of possible significance. Until proven by clinical, or, at the very least, experimental studies, one should avoid speaking of strains in the clinical sense of the word,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), New Delhi. CSIR-IGIB, along with the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi, has submitted 53 sequences of Covid-19 genomes to Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), which is the largest submission by any group in India.“All viruses mutate all the time, there’s no significant mutation,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, WHO. Mutations that affect transmissibility, virulence, antigenicity, and resistance to available treatment are the ones that affect how a virus spreads, how deadly it is, its ability to evade the immune system and drugs and vaccines used to treat it.“Once more sequences to be made available from all countries with identified cases, an analysis of the virus that shows these adaptations will inform WHO’s advice to countries,” said Dr Khetrapal Singh.“Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected. So far we cannot say whether Sars-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious,” said Professor Francois Balloux, from University College London Genetics Institute, UK, and co-lead author of a study that identified 198 recurring mutations to the virus, in a statement. The study was published in the journal, Infection, Genetics and Evolution on May 6.The viruses without the D mutation? include the one that emerged in Wuhan, China, while viruses with the G mutation? first appeared in February, and, by April, had become dominant strains across most parts of the world. But this could just be because people with the G mutation travelled more, met more people, and took fewer precautions, leading to super spreading.Past studies of coronaviruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), show that this family of viruses change at one-tenth the speed of influenza viruses, and scientists believe Sars-CoV-2 also has a slow mutation rate.Developing a vaccine against viruses that mutate quickly is a huge challenge. In the case of flu viruses, the vaccine has to be changed every year to protect against the three to four specific strains causing most of the infections.Most work on vaccines and drugs against Sars-Cov-2 target the spike protein to prevent it from entering human cells to cause infection. At least 120 vaccine projects are in various stages of development , of which seven have entered clinical human trials to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine on healthy volunteers, according to the WHO. Another 82 are in the pre-clinical animal trial phases, and at least two have been found to protect monkeys from infection. “We need to develop drugs and vaccines that cannot be easily evaded by the virus,” said Professor Balloux.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-every-virus-mutation-is-issue-of-concern-say-experts/story-P5Ta4Av0aHGG7Qo6uaS1pO.html
08-05-2020||India||India kicks off op to fly back citizens, 363 evacuees from UAE land in Kerala||Thirty nine pregnant women were among the 363 people who returned to India from the United Arab Emirates on Thursday night via two Air India Express flights that formed the first leg of a massive repatriation programme involving 12 countries and 15,000 passengers.The first flight of the ‘Mission ‘Vande Bharat’ carrying 181 people from Abu Dhabi landed in Kochi around 10pm on Thursday. The second flight with 182 passengers from Dubai landed in Kozhikkode roughly 20 minutes later.As the passengers – many of them aged, disabled or children – disembarked from the flight, many were seen wiping tears.“I am delighted to be in my place. Thank God, I will with my parents for my first delivery. Really grateful to all,” said a pregnant woman on the Kochi flight who refused to share her name.Shah Jahan, who boarded the flight from Abu Dhabi, said he decided to return to India as he had lost his job. “ I am happy to be a part of the first evacuation flight,” he said.The state government has set up quarantine and isolation facilities near the international airports and also arranged vacant flats, houses and houseboats to accommodate the passengers.But as the flight carried many vulnerable and old people, the authorities decided to quarantine them in their respective districts. Once they came out of the airport, they were taken to their respective native districts in special buses and vehicles. “We are going by the government directive,” said Ernakulam collector S Suhas.Passengers started arriving at Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports as early as 9.30am on Thursday. Some of the passengers were carrying the Tricolour.Indian ambassador Pavan Kapoor was seen inquiring about the procedure from some of the passengers undergoing medical screening at the Abu Dhabi airport.“Kudos to all the passengers for waiting patiently for their turn for medical screening and many thanks to all the frontline health workers and airport staff for extending full support,” the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi tweeted. “Vanda Bharat Mission, the world’s biggest repatriation exercise starts today. More than 350 Indian from UAE will be flying back. Thanks to all,” Kapoor said.“All of them have cleared the tests,” Consul General of India in Dubai, Vipul, was quoted as saying by the Gulf News.He said the criteria of passengers’ selection included medical cases, loss of jobs, pregnant women and senior citizens. Those with complications and financial issues were also picked.In the first week of the massive operation, 64 flights will bring 15,000 Indian citizens home from 12 countries. All those who travel back will have to pay for their tickets, undergo strict screening processes, download the Aarogya Setu app, and go into institutional quarantine after landing.The first phase runs from May 7 to May 13 and involves the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Bangladesh, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States. All international passengers will be charged for the journey and fares from Gulf countries to Kerala range from Rs 15,000 to Rs 16,000. Rescue flights from London will cost Rs 50,000 while flights from the United States have been priced at Rs 1,00,000.At least 300,000 people have people have registered to come back in West Asia alone but the authorities are focusing only on “compelling cases”.A set of standard operating procedures by the Union home ministry said that priority will be given to “asymptomatic” migrant labourers/workers abroad who have been laid off, short term visa holders faced with expiry (of visas), persons with medical emergency, pregnant women, the elderly, students, and those required to return to India due to the death of a family member.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/363-evacuees-from-uae-land-in-kerala/story-mBFknR5e8rbPVuzvkz4wRM.html
08-05-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine development sees unparalleled progress||US President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign took off with him telling potential voters that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready by the end of 2020, even as European leaders pledged to raise US $8.3 billion to “kickstart an unprecedented global co-operation” between scientists, industry, governments and philanthropies for vaccine development.Global efforts to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have progressed at an unprecedented pace aiming to stop the spread of the pandemic, which has infected 3.5 million people, killed 250,000 and wrecked global economies within four months.At least 120 vaccine projects are in various stages of development since China shared the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, with the World Health Organization (WHO) on January, 12, 2020. Of these, seven have entered human trials to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine on healthy volunteers, according to WHO. Another 82 are in pre-clinical animal trial phases, and at least two have been found to protect monkeys from infection. Also Watch: Covid-19: India begins testing possible cure on patients at PGI Chandigarh Johnson & Johnson, which was singled out by Trump as an example of vaccine success, said last month that it will be ready to produce 600 million to 900 million doses of its potential vaccine by April 2021 if human trials set to begin in September go as planned. Pfizer and the German company, BioNTech, said if their human trials are successful, they can produce millions of doses by the end of 2020. Vaccine development, on average, takes 10.71 years from the preclinical phase, and has a market entry probability of 6%, according to a study in peer reviewed journal, PLOS One. The development includes at least three human trials to test their safety, dosage and the strength and duration of the protection they offer, followed by production, licensure, deployment of vaccines and plans for post-marketing surveillance.“With Covid-19, the goal is to develop, test and manufacture a vaccine on a scale of hundreds of millions of doses within 12 to 18 months. Since the vaccine will be needed very quickly, an unprecedented approach has been taken by the companies. Since approvals are expected for an emergency use of the vaccine, they will start mass manufacturing as soon as they finish phase 2 trials and move to phase 3, and, in doing so, risk the failure of phase 3. In such cases, consortiums and countries fund for risk reduction and provide market commitments,” said Dr N K Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Pune-based Serum Institute of India started work 10 days ago on manufacturing in parallel to the human safety trials, the Oxford experimental vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, at its own risk. “SII plans to begin manufacturing the ChAdOx1 vaccine in anticipation of the clinical trials in the UK succeeding by September/October. SII will initiate the manufacture at its own risk to jump-start manufacturing and have enough doses available, if the clinical trials work,” said SII CEO, Adar Poonawalla in a statement.  WHO last week organised a meeting of vaccine manufacturers and national regulatory authorities in its South-East Asia Region, of which India, Indonesia and Thailand are a part. The three countries are among the world’s largest vaccine manufacturers.“The manufacturing capacity that exists in the region is of the quality and scale required to produce and roll out a Covid-19 vaccine globally. This region is a vaccine manufacturing powerhouse, and it must now also play a lead role in overcoming the ongoing pandemic,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia. At the virtual meeting, leading manufacturers from India, Indonesia and Thailand discussed timelines and production capacity, while regulatory bodies discussed how to fast-track processes to make large scale production and deployment of Covid-19 vaccines possible by the end of the year. “The way this pandemic is progressing, we are left with no choice but to have an emergency use vaccine within eight months, we can’t afford to wait for years. In the case of Covid-19, we already have some experience from SARS CoV-1 and MERS platforms, which have been used previously for delivering other vaccines. The same is the case with proven adjuvants [a substance which increases the body’s immune response to an antigen], which could be used. So considering the fact that we are not starting from scratch, it is in the realm of possibility,” said Dr Ganguly.Last month, WHO launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which brings together key global health actors, private sector partners and other stakeholders to accelerate the development and production of Covid-19 essential health technologies, including vaccines, and to help guarantee equitable access. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently said it’s “within the realm of possibility” to have a vaccine widely available by January, but only if drug companies are willing to assume the risk of beginning to ramp up production of the vaccine before it is fully tested and approved.Vaccines have led to the global eradication of small pox, and wiped out polio from most countries of the world, except Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria, where it remains endemic. Vaccines for diseases such as HIV, however, remain elusive after two decades of effort.“All countries are now preparing to safely transition towards a new normal in which social and economic life can function amid low or no Covid-19 transmission. No country is safe until we all are safe, for which an effective vaccine that is accessible to all is needed,” said Dr Khetrapal Singh.Coronavirus vaccines: types and methodsCovid-19 vaccines use a wide variety of platforms and techniques to train the immune system to identify the Sars-CoV-2 virus and block or destroy it before it infects the body.Most vaccines feed immune cells, a signature of the unique spike protein on the surface of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which it uses to enter human cells to cause infection.An effective vaccine is one that generates neutralising antibodies, which store the genetic blueprint of the virus to give long-lasting protection.At least eight vaccine types that rely on different viruses or viral parts are being developed.Virus vaccinesAt least seven teams are developing vaccines using the Sars-CoV-2 virus in a weakened or inactivated form, such as those against measles and polio. Sinovac Biotech in Beijing is testing an inactivated form of Sars-CoV-2 in humans.Weakened virus: A virus is conventionally weakened for a vaccine by being passed through animal or human cells until it picks up mutations that make it less able to cause disease. Codagenix in New York is working with Pune-based Serum Institute of India to weaken SARS-CoV-2 by altering its genetic code so that viral proteins are produced less efficiently.Inactivated virus: The virus is made uninfectious using chemicals, such as formaldehyde, or heat.Nucleic-acid vaccinesAround 20 projects are using coronavirus genetic material (DNA or RNA) to prompt an immune response. The nucleic acid is inserted into human cells, which then churn out copies of the virus protein. Most coronavirus vaccines encode the virus’s spike protein.RNA- and DNA-based vaccines are safe and easy to develop: to produce them involves making genetic material only, not the virus. But they are unproven: no licensed vaccines use this technologyViral-vector vaccinesA weakened virus, such as measles or adenovirus, is genetically engineered to produce coronavirus proteins in the body without causing disease. There are two types of weakened viruses, those that can still replicate within cells, and those that cannot, because key genes have been disabled.Replicating viral vector (such as weakened measles): The newly-approved Ebola vaccine is an example of a viral-vector vaccine that replicates within cells to provoke a strong immune response. The vaccine is safe but existing immunity to the vector could blunt the vaccine’s effectiveness.Non-replicating viral vector (such as adenovirus): No licensed vaccines use this method, but they have a long history in gene therapy. Booster shots can be needed to induce long-lasting immunity. US-based pharma major, Johnson & Johnson, and Oxford University are using this approach.Protein-based vaccinesCoronavirus proteins, of fragments of proteins or protein shells, that mimic the coronavirus’s outer coat, are injected directly into the body.Protein subunits: Twenty-eight teams are working on vaccines with viral protein subunits, with most of them focusing on the virus’s spike protein or a key part of it called the receptor binding domain. Similar vaccines against the Sars virus protected monkeys against infection, but they haven’t been tested in people. To work, these vaccines might require adjuvants, or immune-stimulating molecules delivered alongside the vaccine, as well as multiple doses.Virus-like particles: Empty virus shells mimic the coronavirus structure, but aren’t infectious because they lack genetic material. Five teams are working on ‘virus-like particle’ vaccines, which can trigger a strong immune response, but can be difficult to manufacture.Source: Nature||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-development-sees-unparalleled-progress/story-PtAQIKRHB9omEFWbdUfJKI.html
08-05-2020||India||Dissent brews in Delhi Gymkhana over plan to counter govt takeover||The Delhi Gymkhana Club is facing dissent within its own governing body over the strategy to counter a petition filed in the National Company Law Tribunal by the government to take over the club’s management on grounds of financial irregularities and promoting nepotism.Three members of the governing body have lodged their dissent over “exorbitant legal fees” in writing with president,DR Soni ,a retired lieutenant general, people with knowledge of the information said.They have also flagged as “unwise strategy” the Club’s response to the petition. The three-members are former Indian Police Service officer Parvez Hayat, committee member Pooja Singh and Indian Statistical Services officer Ganga Kumar. Hayat and Kumar declined to comment on the matter. Singh could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.The Club had been given till May 8 to file its response to a petition by the ministry of corporate affairs alleging “parivarwaad” (nepotism), financial irregularities, misuse of allocated land and issues related to membership as the primary reasons behind its move to acquire the Delhi Gymkhana Club.Management of the Delhi Gymkhana, said members of the present governing body, has decided to plead no wrongdoing. “They are planning to file a response saying that the case is entirely motivated and has been filed by those who were denied membership of the club,” said a member privy to the developments.According to a former governing body member, the three dissenters had first written to BS Randhawa, a retired admiral, who is in charge of legal affairs at the club, and then to the president, Soni, who was unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts to contact him.“The dissent has been going on from 23rd March when the first notice was sent,” said a second member privy to the developments. “Some feel that the club is not being defended in the right manner. The governing body can take a view that there were some violations of the Articles of Association and ask for three months to take corrective measures and rectify the situation.”One of the mainstays of the government’s petition, filed by north region director Raj Singh, is that the club was arbitrarily granting membership. A white paper published by the Club in October 2014 too had flagged and addressed serious issues relating to membership of the club.The dissent of the three governing body members is being widely circulated on ‘Hamara Gymkhana’, a WhatsApp group for members, said a member of the club.“Tomorrow there can be a serious frauds investigation,” said the second member. “Why do lawyers have to be paid Rs 1.5 crore to fight a case in NCLT?. The three members suggested that the Club hire one lawyer instead of two.”According to the first member, some in the governing body feel they are being left out of crucial decisions.“No one gets time to analyse any of the agenda items,” the first member said. “Most decisions are last-minute. On Thursday, the governing body met to cast a ballot to approve the strategy. They weren’t even given a copy of the final reply.”The second member added that while the governing body members were given a copy of the draft response, no one was told what would be in the final one.“The printouts were handed out during the course of the meeting for a period of two hours,” said the second member. “No one was allowed to take a copy of the response with them.”The two said that the governing body lacked transparency. “If it were truly transparent, it would reflect faithfully in the minutes uploaded on the website, but even those aren’t put out,” said the first member.The second person, however, added that the solution does not lie in the club being taken over by the government. “The answer is not that the central government should take over the club, but rather in fixing the issues that have come up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-in-delhi-gymkhana-governing-body-over-response-to-govt-s-takeover-bid/story-TLNbIg8IK9dAgEQ4CQ5zGL.html
08-05-2020||India||35 years later, Bhopal gas leak failures resurface in Vizag||As I see images of the Vizag gas leak from the LG plant and hear of the deaths and injured people, it is an eerie flashback to the time I visited Bhopal in 1985 a few weeks after the toxic gas leaked from the Union Carbide plant in December 1984. I was shocked to see the number of people sick and dying in the Bhopal hospitals. In both cases, the accident happened at night and the gas plume escaping from the plant affected the nearby community. Both plants were resuming production after a period of downtime, and it is clear that errors occurred in the protocols.As it turned out, the methyl isocyanate gas from the Union Carbide plant was more toxic than the styrene that leaked from the LG plant. However, the 11 deaths so far and hundreds of affected people in hospital indicate that styrene must have escaped in extremely high concentrations and affected the nearby population. Styrene is a chemical used in plastic and rubber manufacturing, and is toxic to the brain and lungs. The permissible exposure level (PEL) mandated by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is 100 ppm (parts per million) for an adult worker for eight hours and the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health level is 700 ppm. This level has been severely exceeded, indicated by the number of deaths and injured.The health effects of styrene on the lung include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, cough, shortness of breath, chemical inflammation of the lung tissues, and possible accumulation of fluid which can lead to death, a condition known as pulmonary edema. Brain effects include a feeling of drunkenness, changes in colour vision, tiredness, confusion, slowed reaction time, concentration and balance problems. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified styrene as a possible carcinogen. There is no known antidote to this toxin so aggressive supportive management and treatment is the need of the hour. The supportive treatment is typically washing skin to remove the chemical, administration of oxygen, and symptomatic treatment.The questions that need to be answered immediately are: How much of the toxin escaped into the environment? What were the emission levels downwind of the plant? Are there other toxins that also escaped? What is the area of spread of the gas? Which neighborhoods are affected, Did the toxin seep into the soil and water? And how many people were at risk of exposure to this toxic gas cloud? Some of these questions can be answered by urgently modelling the gas plume dispersion. Note that the PEL of 100 ppm is for a healthy adult worker but the exposed population in Vizag would certainly comprise children, pregnant women, older individuals, and people with heart, lung, and other disabilities which would render them more vulnerable to the toxic effects of styrene. In addition, in people with Covid-19 infection, the inflammatory effects of styrene could be far worse. Concurrent with the immediate treatment, a search must be made for the population potentially exposed to styrene, so that they may be monitored in the immediate aftermath, as well as in the medium and long term.Thirty six years after the Bhopal disaster, it is distressing to see accidents from hazardous industries. The fields of occupational and environmental medicine, toxicology, and epidemiology which study and prevent industrial accidents have still not been developed adequately to cater for the amount of industrial development that has occurred in India. After the Bhopal disaster, I was frustrated that this field was not available in India and I had to go overseas to study these subjects. In 2020, I’m not sure very much has changed.

08-05-2020||India||Congress leader moves Kerala high court over Aarogya Setu app||The central government’s May 1 directive to make the mobile application Aarogya Setu mandatory for all persons working in government and private companies was challenged by a Congress leader in the Kerala high court on Thursday for violating right to privacy and autonomy. The Aarogya Setu collects personal information of an individual without his or her consent and such coercive and forcible extraction of personal information is unheard of in a democratic and republic setup and is the attribute of a dictatorial system, the plea by the general secretary of the Thrissur district Congress Committee, John Daniel alleged.“The petitioner is aggrieved by the order issued by Government of India, which makes the use of the mobile application, Arogya Setu, mandatory for all. The petitioner is aggrieved by the dilution of the concepts of personal autonomy and informed consent effected by virtue of this mandatory imposition”, the plea filed through advocates Sriram Parakkat, KR Sripathi and Anupama Subramanian stated. The central government had launched Aarogya Setu on April 2 as a digital contact-tracing tool and to disseminate information regarding Covid-19. Contact-tracing is the practice of finding potential new infections that an infected person may have caused by coming close to other people.Arogya Setu uses a smartphone’s GPS and Bluetooth features to track contact and location trails. The petitioner’s case was built on the argument that the app is a tracking mobile application which continuously collects data of an individual once it is installed on the mobile phone.The petitioner argued that Aarogya Setu collects the personal information of a registered user including name, phone number, age, sex, profession, countries visited in the last 30 days and whether a person is a smoker or non smoker and his or her medical condition. The May 1 order of the central government also directed state governments to proceed under section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) against anyone who violates lockdown measures including the failure to install the app. Section 188 of the IPC states that any person who disobeys an order given by a public servant can be punished with imprisonment up to 6 months.The plea specifically assailed clause 15 of Annexure 1 of the May 1 order as per which the use of the app was made mandatory for all employees. Clause 15 also states that it shall be the responsibility of the head of the respective organisations to ensure that all employees use the Aarogya Setu app.“Clause 15 mandating the use of the application, Arogya Setu takes away the right of a person to decide and control the use of information pertaining to him. He is forced to give away data to a system which he may or may not approve of, thereby attacking his right of informational autonomy”, the petition said. Autonomy of an individual is central to the right to life as per the 2017 judgment of the Supreme Court in KS Puttaswamy, the petitioner submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-leader-moves-court-over-aarogya-setu-app/story-GOd3dCTqYPrfl0437fCaoI.html

Great level of dedication and commitment towards her work,” Ravi tweeted.Kumari, whose husband died 15 years ago, slipped on a puddle near her home in a slum near Lalit Bhawan towards the end of March. However, this did not dissuade her from conducting a door-to-door survey initiated by the Bihar government in April to check for respiratory distress and influenza-like illness which are associated with symptoms of coronavirus. Using a stick to help her walk, Kumari visited at least 380 houses in the slums near the office of the Bihar Public Service Commission and later, the slum adjacent to Patna Electricity Supply Undertaking — where she resides — from April 16 to May 3.“I realised if I take leave and stay home, people in my area will suffer. Given the adverse circumstances because of the coronavirus pandemic, I decided not to leave my people when they needed me the most,” she said.Kumari, accompanied by an auxiliary nursing midwife, would set out each morning at 8 am and visit at least 25 households everyday till noon. A resident of a one-room shanty, Kumari has three children — a 23-year-old daughter and two sons, aged 22 and 18, who are pursuing their studies. She receives a monthly stipend of Rs 5,650 and her job is to ensure that the government’s social welfare programme reaches every beneficiary.“People in my area trust me. They will not allow any AWW other than me to administer polio drop or any other vaccination to their young children. It is a question of trust. I knew if any other AWW was drafted in my place to survey the area, many people may have been left out of the survey,” she added.“Vimla was adamant to work, despite our willingness to grant her leave,” said Patna district programme officer Bharti Priyamvada, who is with the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), an arm of the social welfare department.“She is a very active, dedicated and responsible worker who has never shied away from any responsibility entrusted upon her. She is not scared of any adversity too. In fact, I had granted her leave, but she did not avail of it,” said Renu Kumari, a child development project officer. The survey, which was earlier confined to only four districts of the state of Bihar has now been extended to cover all 38 districts. Already seven, including Begusarai, Gaya, Nalanda and Siwan, have been completed. “The initial part of the survey, which was to map those who had come from abroad in March, is over. We are now keeping an eye on the migrant workers who are coming into the state capital. We expect to complete the exercise by mid-May,” said the DM.Of the 170 million houses surveyed since April 16, 3,819 people were found to have symptoms of fever with cough and shortage of breath. Bihar has recorded 541 cases of coronavirus with four deaths reported so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leg-injury-doesn-t-stop-govt-worker-from-carrying-out-health-surveys/story-zR89KV5CEexfUAMgwDnznK.html

The prison has a capacity to house 800 prisoners but it is housing 2,700. No new prisoners have been sent to this jail since the first week of April because of overcrowding.The undertrial, who is facing charges under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, developed a high fever on April 30. He was taken to Mumbai’s JJ Hospital on May 2 after he suffered a paralytic attack. Samples of 150 people working in and lodged at the prison were taken for testing after the undertrial tested positive. “At least 200 more swabs were taken from the Arthur Road prison on Thursday,” said the officer. Two staff members who stayed at a guest house near the jail and had taken another prisoner to JJ Hospital, too, tested positive.Jail authorities were yet to identify the source of the virus. The officer said the possibility of cleaning staff, sanitisation workers or essential service providers being the source cannot be ruled out.The outbreak of the disease in the prison has led to panic among family members of the inmates. “Relatives of the prisoners have been asking us to file bail pleas. We have to explain to them that the courts are not entertaining any applications for bail in cases where punishment is more than seven years,” said lawyer Prakash Salingekar.Chetan Banne, another lawyer, said he is filing a plea for an accused who has multiple cases registered against him. “The accused is desperate to be out on bail because of the condition at the Arthur Road jail.”Former Supreme Court judge A K Sikri cited the Supreme Court’s order in April on decongesting jails and said it should be followed in letter and spirit. Another retired Supreme Court judge, Madan Lokur, said the undertrial review committee should meet regularly and expedite the applications for release on bail. “The state and district legal services authorities should play a proactive role in ensuring the inmates are released,” said Lokur. He added section 436A of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for the release of inmates, who have served more than half of their sentences.Madhurima Dhanuka of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative said it is a difficult situation and needs to be tackled on a war footing. “Preventive measures need to be taken to stop the further spread of the virus in jails...” (With inputs from KAY Dodhiya & Charul Shah)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/77-inmates-26-officials-test-positive-in-prison-outbreak/story-rpw2ZLnfYOJXtU861hAuoK.html
08-05-2020||India||In shadow of Covid-19 crisis, Agra stares at long road to recovery||It was the perfect photo opportunity. Agra rolled out the red carpet for US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for their visit to the Taj Mahal Febuary 24. The visit went off well and the Taj city had, once again, made its mark as an international host. The euphoria didn’t last long. On March 2, five members of an Agra-based family tested positive for the coronavirus disease, causing the cancellation of public gatherings, and fear of the infection spreading marred Holi on March 9. Yet, March ended with only 12 Covid-19 cases in Agra, eight of whom recovered and were discharged from hospital.Nevertheless, all was not well. The Taj Mahal, the jewel in Agra’s crown, was closed to the public on March 17 and it has remained shut ever since.“The 1971 India-Pakistan war was the last time the Taj Mahal was closed for a long duration. Back then, it was off-limits for the public for about a fortnight. A black cloth covered the marble monument to save it from enemy planes. The foundation of Agra’s economy rests on tourism centred around the Taj Mahal. This time, the monument has remained closed for about a month-and-a-half. There is no possibility of it reopening in the near future,” says Rajeev Saxena, vice- president, Tourism Guild of Agra.“Nearly seven to eight million tourists visit the Taj Mahal every year. The tourism business of Agra is estimated to be around Rs 1,500 crore annually. The local hotel industry’s share is Rs 700 crore to Rs 800 crore. About four to five lakh (400,000-500,000) residents of Agra are directly or indirectly linked to tourism,” says Saxena.Agra is now in the red zone. It has reported over 500 Covid-19 cases so far and ranks 11th nationwide.“It will be a long battle for Agra. Much depends on when surface transport resumes plying. The hospitality business cannot thrive with strict social distancing norms. Even when they reopen, hotels will have to reduce their guest in-take but they will have to keep the staff in full strength. This will enhance the room tariff,” says Saxena.“It may take a year or two for the situation to return to normal. Agra is not going to be the same in the near future,” he says.“Besides tourists, conferences and weddings held in hotels contribute to the tourism trade here. With social distancing norms in force, the future does not appear healthy,” says Saxena.Tourism information officer Pradeep Tamta says it will take another six months for the revival of tourism in Agra.“The hotel industry and the travel trade are all looking for an early revival. We have to work a lot while sanitising hotels, cabs and other means of transport once Covid-19 is on the backfoot. We are keeping our fingers crossed,” Tamta says.KC Jain, secretary of the Agra Development Foundation, agrees the road to normality will be a long one. Nevertheless, he is optimistic that sooner or later, the Taj Mahal gates will reopen and the city’s economy, based on tourism and the footwear industry, will bounce back.“Tourism is a leisure activity. The global economic scenario should also remain healthy. Certainly, there are challenges ahead. But the way number of Covid-19 cases is increasing in Agra, it may delay normalcy,” says Jain.Shamshuddin, a veteran tourist guide, says the gains from US President Donald Trump’s Agra visit were swept away by Covid-19 cases.As for the footwear industry, it remains doubtful whether its showpiece event, ‘Meet at Agra’, will be held in the second half of the year due to the Covid-19 situation.Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Export Council (AFMEC) holds the event. Agra has a 28% share in India’s footwear exports but given the scenario in the European market, tough days are ahead, those in the know of things say.“The footwear business in Agra is worth about Rs 4,000 crore. About 65 % of Indians wear footwear made in Agra. The export business is worth about Rs 3,000 crore, but exporters are yet to receive payments for consignments they sent prior to the coronavirus outbreak,” says Gagan Dass Ramani, president of the Agra Shoe Factors Federation.“The Rs 4,000 crore domestic market will shrink to Rs 1,000 crore even if the Covid-19 situation does not worsen. There is uncertainty over the footwear trade, the backbone of Agra’s economy,” he says.“For the domestic market’s requirement, we use (shoe) uppers imported from China. But we have to look for new markets like Taiwan in the changed global scenario,” he adds.Similarly, Noori Darwaza lanes, famous for Agra’s famous dalmoth, a salted snack, and petha sweet are wearing a deserted look. Most workers employed in the trade have returned to their villages due to the lockdown.Rajesh Agarwal, president of the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Gate Petha Utpadan Samiti, says revival of the petha and dalmoth industry depends on the tourism industry. “Five hundred units and 3,000 retail shops, beside farmers producing the ash gourd vegetable (a type of white pumpkin) used in petha, are all jobless these days. The petha industry in Agra is also dependent on the tourism trade. These small-scale units need government support,” he says.“There is a market for petha in rural areas as well as it is a cheaper option for sweets and it is purchased by farmers to welcome guests. About a lakh (100,000) people are associated with the petha trade in Agra,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-shadow-of-covid-crisis-agra-stares-at-long-road-to-recovery/story-C6Y36lnkRQJMDHgIkLNqYL.html
08-05-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh brings in labour reforms amid Covid-19 crisis||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday announced that the process of issuing registrations and licenses for factories, shops, etc will now be completed in a day as part of a series of labour reforms to increase industrial activities, job opportunities as well as to woo fresh investments and safeguard interests of labourers.He called the announcement revolutionary. “Registrations/licenses under the different labour laws will be issued in just one day. Earlier, this time was 30 days,” he said. “Under the Contract Labour Act, licenses will be issued for entire contract periods instead of just for calendar years. The process of issuing registration/license will be online. With a view to encouraging startups, a provision has been made for one-time registrations and the provision for renewal has been done away with.”He said the duration of factory shifts has been increased from 8 hours to 12 hours in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Chouhan added a provision has been made to maintain a single register instead of 61 registers under labour laws and filing of one return instead of 13 returns. Chouhan announced that under the Factory Act, an exemption has been given to factories for their inspection for three months. “The employers will be allowed to have a third party inspection of factories by the inspectors of their choice. Establishments employing less than 50 workers have been excluded from inspections under various labour laws. Now inspections will be possible only with the permission of the labour commissioner and on the basis of complaints.”Shops will also now remain open in the non-Covid-19 areas from 6 am to midnight. Earlier, they were allowed to remain open from 8 am to 10 pm daily. Opposition Congress lawmaker Hiralal Alawa opposed the amendments saying they will give enough powers to factory owners to exploit the labourers at will as they will have no fear of any inspection or inquiry. “The amendments mean the labourers will be treated as bonded labourers and they will not be able to seek justice from the labour courts or it will take years for them to get justice given the complexities involved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-brings-in-labour-reforms-amid-crisis/story-L5KTrSdFAGHoG0smgvnNyK.html
08-05-2020||India||Covid-19 peak likely to hit between May and August: AIIMS director||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India is likely to see its peak between May and August, said Dr Randeep Guleria, director All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi.“This is based on several mathematic modelling data that is available on disease progression, depending on whose data you are looking at. Several data experts are at work, but one cannot definitely predict when the disease is going to peak in India because it depends on a number of variables that are dynamic in nature, such as the effect of lockdown and other measures. The peak may vary accordingly, which is why even the same group sometimes comes up with different projections. The current projections give a range between May and August,” said Dr Guleria.The graph is currently showing an upwards trend, with the total number of Covid-19 positive cases reported in a day having nearly doubled from 1,790 a week ago on April 30 to 3,561 cases on May 7, taking the total number of infected in the country to 52,952 so far. The number of deaths reported from Covid-19 currently is 1,783. The number of critical Covid-19 cases -- those put on ventilator, needing oxygen support, or undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit -- has also seen significant increase, with 1.1% of the active Covid-19 cases on ventilators, 3.3% on oxygen support and 4.8% patients in ICUs across India as on May 7, according to health ministry data. The number has shot up significantly in just three days, as on May 4, the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had announced that the percentage of ventilator patients fluctuated between 0.33 and 0.37%, those needing oxygen support was 1.5% and those undergoing treatment in ICUs was 2.34%.“Our disease control is the best in the world,” said the health minister.Dr Guleria agrees. “The number of patients needing ventilator or on ICU beds may have shot up in past few days but the overall number of critically ill patients is still very small. Covid-19 patients in India are largely on oxygen support. It is still within the limits of what we have as far as resources are concerned. Our infrastructure hasn’t been overwhelmed. In fact, far from it,” he said.As of now, 821 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, with 1,50,059 beds (1, 32,219 isolation beds and 17,840 ICU beds) and 1,898 dedicated Covid Health Centres, with 1,19,109 beds (1, 09,286 isolation beds and 9,823 ICU beds), along with 7,569 quarantine centres, are now available in the country to manage patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-peak-likely-to-hit-between-may-and-august-aiims-director/story-HNru194rIaRPLkpy0f0pMK.html
08-05-2020||India||Govt okays home, hotel isolation for milder Covid-19 patients||Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients with mild symptoms can stay in hotels and service apartments in case they don’t have space in their own residences to confine themselves in isolation, according to the Union health ministry’s revised guidelines on home quarantine for Covid patients.The facility can be offered on paid basis as is being done by certain states for travellers and contacts of covid-19 cases. The price can be pre-decided by state governments.“There are large number of facilities such as hotels, service apartments, lodges which remain unoccupied due to impact of COVID-19 on travel and tourism. There are also instances where people who don’t have requisite space at home may opt for such facilities. This is likely to reduce the pressure on the family, give comfort to the person, and protect the family members and immediate neighborhood,” read the health ministry guidelines.The ministry has issued standard operating procedures that are applicable both for facility quarantine, facility isolation in hotels, service apartments, lodges etc.“It is an extension of health ministry’s earlier guidelines on home quarantine for positive patients. Since about 80% positive cases have mild symptoms they do not really require to be in a hospital, and many people do not have adequate space in their homes to be able to successfully isolate themselves, for such people it was decided to allow them to use private facilities. Earlier also hotels, lodges, hostels etc have served as quarantined centres, it will be the same with extra precautions,” said an official from the health ministry, requesting anonymity.It will be states’ responsibility to ensure that the quarantine and isolation facility will not co-exist.These facilities will offer single room on paid basis to contacts, cases with attached washrooms. The tariff for the accommodation and services shall be fixed by the facility in consultation with the state government and widely publicized.“The facility dedicated for isolation will follow the norms established for COVID Care Centre as available. The cases shall only be kept in an isolation facility, if the cases are clinically assessed to be pre-symptomatic or very mild. Such facility that opts for isolation will have separate earmarked areas for keeping suspect cases and confirmed cases and will ensure no inter-mingling of these two categories,” the guidelines further reads.The facility owner will have to make additional arrangements for an in-house trained doctor and a nurse on 24X7 basis. The doctor will monitor the contacts, cases in quarantine, isolation facilities once a day on basic parameters of temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and pulse oxymetry and keep record of the same.The doctor engaged by the facility will inform the District Surveillance Officer regarding the list of admitted cases or contacts, and their health status. The facility should network with an approved laboratory for testing samples as per ICMR guidelines. The patients should not be allowed to meet visitors. However, they can talk on phone. The facility will provide Wi-Fi facility and ensure that the client downloads the Aarogya Setu App on mobile.The linens, towels etc. and rooms should be disinfected and the facility will follow infection prevention control practices as per health ministry guidelines.The in-house catering should only provide room services for freshly cooked food duly following physical distancing and environmental sanitation. The discharge of patients from the facility will be as per the health ministry directive for discharged of covid-19 patients from the hospital.“The most important discharge criteria is that these people should test negative twice in a span of 24 hours, and should be certified fit to be discharged from their treating medical doctor,” the official added.Experts say as long as the protocol is followed, there is no harm in home or facility isolation of mild positive cases.“I am a big believer of home isolation as at least 90% of the cases, according to me are mild enough to not require hospitalization. As long precautions are taken and there is regular medical consultation, it is a good idea,” said T Jacob John, senior virologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-okays-home-hotel-isolation-for-milder-patients/story-V28ypulkLyMQVLE3Q5FoxK.html
08-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: In U-turn, Karnataka govt allows migrants to go back in special trains||Karnataka reversed on Thursday its decision to stop special trains for migrants after widespread anger and condemnation even as thousands of workers in other parts of the country said they opted to not go back to their native states because of slowly expanding employment opportunities.The Karnataka government wrote to Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Odisha to seek their consent for receiving the workers and said it intends to start daily trains from Friday until May 15. Two days ago, the administration had withdrawn its request to the railways to run the trains. The decision had come hours after chief minister BS Yediyurappa met representatives of the construction industry who expressed apprehension that projects will grind to a halt if workers left the state in thousands.But the decision angered migrant workers who said they feared for their health and wanted to go home, and stirred a political controversy with the opposition Congress saying the government was treating the migrants like bonded labour and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party saying it would boost the local economy.Close to half a million workers across India have left for their home in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar in the past week on special Shramik trains. Around 10 million people have registered with the helpline launched by various states for migrant workers and stranded people.But not everyone wants to leave, especially from India’s industrial towns, where factories are slowly rebooting.Kapil Kumar, 33, a native of Mathura district in UP, has decided to stay back in Surat, saying he needs to earn to feed his family. “What will I do in Mathura?” asked the landless farmer.“The wait (for the lockdown to end) is killing us. But, we have been assured that the work will start soon and then we can earn good money,” Kumar, a construction worker, said, claiming that he earns up to Rs 20,000 per month by working in two shifts of eight hours each in a day.In Surat, officials say only 200,000 of the 2.5 million migrant workers in Surat have registered to go back home. Kumar said he knew of 15 families from UP who have not registered.Sharvan Meghwanshi, of Bihar’s Begusarai district and a union leader in Surat, many workers have not left. “Initially, few workers left for Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. But when they told us over phone that they have been kept in quarantine and there are no arrangements of food and employment, workers decided against going back home,” he said.In Ludhiana, which has about two million migrant workers, only 400,000 have registered to return. Similarly, in Bengaluru, of about 1.5 million workers, around 100,000 have registered.The reason: Current lockdown rules allow almost all industries in green and yellow zones. Moreover, the harvest season is over in heartland states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and the workers are eager to return to industrial town in the north and west.Manmohan Agarwal, who runs a paint manufacturing unit in Lucknow, expected the industries to run its operations fully from next Monday. “As the harvesting season got over, we started getting calls from workers enquiring about resumption of work. Like industrialists, workers also want industries to start operation,” he said.Awadesh Agarwal, president, Indian Industries Association (IIA), Lucknow chapter, an industry lobby body of the MSME sector, hoped the governments will allow public transport. “Labour will not be a problem, if public transport is allowed,” he said.As per UP chief secretary RK Tewari’s May 5 order, industrial activity with up to 50% workers can start even in the red zones without any public transport. Around 1,500 industries have been allowed operation in Lucknow, a red zone. No permission is required in green and orange zones.In Punjab’s industrial town of Jalandhar and Ludhiana, many factories have started work. From about two percent industries operational last week, the number has increased to about 25% this week, officials said, adding that they estimate about 50% industries would start operations by May 17 in green and orange zones.Jalandhar’s industries department general manager, Bhola Singh Brar, said more than 2,000 of the total 14,500 industrial units in the district were operational and close to 300 are seeking permission every day. “As of now, we have enough workers,” said Narinder Singh Saggu, president of focal point industrial units.In Ludhiana, around 7,000 units with reduced capacities were functional. “Meeting and being with family is their utmost priority. But, if industries resume operations many would stay back,” said Tarsem Jodhan, President of Punjab Mazdoor Union.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/k-taka-allows-migrant-trains-daily-services-likely-from-today/story-u0UW1ekB7Q5hUplTfcGzBI.html

Doordarshan’s Kashmir channel is telecast in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.Doordarshan’s weather bulletin will have forecasts for Mirpur and Muzaffarabad in Occupied Kashmir and Gilgit in Northern Areas.“The step will also be a constant reminder to the Imran Khan government and its few supporters that India will not allow Islamabad to take any steps to legitimise its illegal occupation,” said a senior government official.The decision coincided with New Delhi’s strong protests this week over the order of Pakistan’s top court that provided for setting up a caretaker administration in Gilgit-Baltistan to hold fresh elections.India claims the whole of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, including the Gilgit-Baltistan region, which was given near-provincial status by the Pakistan government in 2009.Also Watch: ‘They want riots...’: PoK activist on Pakistan bid to hold Gilgit Baltistan pollsIn January 2019, Pakistan’s top court had ruled that its powers extended to “Gilgit-Baltistan” provoking sharp protest from New Delhi, which declared “the so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, has been, is and shall remain an integral part of India”.Last week, Pakistan’s Supreme Court went a step further and allowed the government to amend the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan Order 2018 to set up a caretaker administration in the region to conduct fresh elections.

Naikoo had come to meet his family on Tuesday and stayed overnight at a hideout in Awantipora’s Beighbora village. This was home turf.The 32-year-old, also known by his alias Zubair ul Islam and Bin Qasim, was counted among Kashmir’s most-experienced terrorists. On 5 June, Riyaz Naikoo would have completed eight years in the Hizbul Mujahideen, a rarity in a career where many don’t last for more than a few years. Security forces had come close to cornering him on several occasions; he managed to dodge them every time.WATCH | Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo eliminated: All the key detailsBut on Tuesday, Kashmir Police’s anti-militancy unit Special Operations Group (SOG) had pinpointed information about his movements. He was going to be in his village to meet his family and relatives. According to one account, the SOG had an idea where he would stay overnight.Riyaz Naikoo, the calculative Hizbul terroristHe was the chief operational commander of Hizbul Mujahideen in Jammu and KashmirNaikoo took command of Hizbul Mujahideen after Zakir Musa defected from HizbulRiyaz Naikoo used audio and video clips put out on social media to motivate youth to join terrorHis audio and video messages articulated separatist ideology and praised PakistanJ&K police says he was the brain behind revival of Hizbul in J&KHe is blamed for killing several police personnel and civiliansNaikoo funded terror by looting money from orchard owners and illicit cultivation of opium in south KashmirHizbul Mujahideen has been found to be involved in narco trade in Jammu as wellNaikoo had taken credit for freeing Lashkar-e-Taiba’s Naveed Jutt from custody in 2018Naveed Jutt was shot dead in November 2018, months after his escapeIt was getting dark by the time a large contingent of Jammu and Kashmir police and the 21 Rashtriya Rifles started surrounding the village. “And then, they lay low, waiting for dawn to make the move,” a senior police officer said.A gun battle erupted early on Wednesday.He had been trapped and there was no way to escape.When the firefight was over, security personnel found Riyaz Naikoo in a bunker from where he had been firing at them. He and his associate had died of gunshot wounds.“It is a major success for the security forces in Kashmir,” a senior Jammu and Kashmir Police officer told Hindustan Times. J&K police chief Dilbag Singh had been monitoring the entire operation that the police insisted could break the back of the Hizbul Mujahideen in south Kashmir.In the records of Jammu and Kashmir police, Riyaz Naikoo was listed as “A++” terrorist who had a reward of Rs 1.2 million on his head.
