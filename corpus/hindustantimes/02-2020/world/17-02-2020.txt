The Pakistani military, which had kept Ehsan in detention for three years, has declined to comment but, asked by reporters about the report, Interior Minister Ijaz Shah, said: “That is correct, that is correct.”Shah, a retired brigadier general, added that “you will hear good news” in response to questions about whether there had been progress in hunting down Ehsan.Ehsan later told a Reuters reporter by telephone that he had already left Pakistan and arrived in Turkey together with his wife and children. He said he had surrendered to the army under a deal, and escaped only after the agreement was not honoured. He said he escaped on Jan. 11 but did not clarify how he had broken out of a maximum-security military prison and made his way to another country. Pakistani analysts and experts on militant Islam have voiced doubt about Ehsan’s claim to have escaped. They have speculated that he may have been converted into an asset by the state and that reports he was on the run could be a ruse to plant him back in the Islamist militant scene for use as an informant.After Ehsan’s surrender in 2017, local Geo News TV aired an interview he gave in custody in which he asserted that the intelligence services of Pakistan’s arch-rival, India, had been funding and arming Pakistani Taliban fighters.The Pakistan army pledged to put Ehsan on trial but has not done so.Taliban attacks in Pakistan have declined in recent months since the army carried out several operations against sanctuaries used by the Islamist militant groups in lawless districts along the border with Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-interior-minister-confirms-escape-of-taliban-leader-who-justified-malala-shooting/story-GXdtKVtWAsMq6GU7zVKzJN.html
17-02-2020||World||‘Extinction Rebellion’ climate protesters dig up Cambridge college’s lawn||Extinction Rebellion climate protesters dug up the lawn of Trinity College, Cambridge on Monday, as part of a week-long series of demonstrations in Britain’s ancient university town.The activists dug up the grass in front of the 16th-century “Great Gate”, digging channels in the turf with shovels and pitchforks and planting Extinction Rebellion flags.Trinity had ramped up security measures, closing the college, library and chapel to tourists for the week, so the protesters were not able to access the central “Great Court.”A spokeswoman for the college refused to comment on the incident but said that a statement would be released later.Extinction Rebellion says it wants non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it says will bring starvation and social collapse.“Trinity College must cut ties with fossil fuel companies and stop trying to hawk off nature for profit,” Extinction Rebellion Cambridge on its Facebook page. “Oh, and it should take the opportunity to replace the lawn with flowers. Spring is just around the corner after all.” In anticipation of the week’s protests, another of Cambridge’s colleges, St. Catharine’s, closed the main gate leading to its 17th-century court over concerns that Extinction Rebellion protesters would set up a campsite on the grass.“One of Extinction Rebellions oppositions, is to green space being kept behind walls and only accessible to those in power and privilege,” an email sent to students by the college’s head porter said.“Although our Main Court is actually open for viewing, there is a concern they may try to take it over and possibly camp on it,” the email said.Earlier this year, a group of students at the University of Oxford set up a camp in the front quad of St John’s college for five days, to protest the college’s investment in fossil fuel companies.Inspired by this, climate protesters in Cambridge put up tents on the lawn in front of King’s College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extinction-rebellion-climate-protesters-dig-up-cambridge-college-s-lawn/story-4E7tJZN9wtcz7chKvVGInN.html
17-02-2020||World||‘This is not India’: Pak judge jabs India after cases against Pashtun protesters dropped||A Pakistani judge on Monday took a jibe at India while wrapping up a case against 23 people protesting against the arrest of a Pashtun activist known for criticising the country’s powerful military.Chief Justice Athar Minallah of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) took up the bail petitions of 23 workers of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Move­ment (PTM) and Awami Workers Party (AWP), who were arrested by the Islamabad police last month for staging protest.“Everyone’s constitutional rights will be protected. This is Pakistan, not India,” Chief Justice Minallah said.During the hearing the chief justice said that “we don’t expect that a democratic government will curb freedom of expression.””An elected democratic government cannot place curbs on freedom of expression. (We) shouldn’t fear criticism,” he remarked, adding that the courts will protect the constitutional rights of the people.He asked the people to come to the court if they were not allowed by the government to hold protests.“If you want to protest, get permission. If you don’t get permission, the court is here,” he said.When Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat told the court that all charges against the protesters had been dropped, the chief justice concluded that case, allowing all 23 activists to go free.Last month, protesters were holding protests in front of the National Press Club here against the arrest of Manzoor Pashteen, the chief of the rights-based alliance PTM, when he was detained.Pashteen attended a gathering on January 18 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan city where he had allegedly said that the 1973 Constitution violated basic human rights.The 27-year-old activist was arrested along with nine other PTM workers from Peshawar, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-judge-takes-jibe-at-india-after-cases-against-pastun-protesters-dropped/story-5sYjIFAaYAgUT0JdmIUvsI.html
17-02-2020||World||Over 3,000 Chinese medical workers infected with coronavirus until Feb 11: Study||More than 3,000 medical workers could have been infected with the coronavirus (covid-19) pathogen by February 11, a new study by the top Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found, adding that many cases among them were severe in nature.The study found that – contrary to what was being assumed earlier -- the covid-19 was much more infectious than both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the middle-eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS). The new study again revealed the dangerous environment front line medics are working in the outbreak epicentre Wuhan and other cities of the Hubei province – most often while tackling the disease amid a serious shortage of protective clothing.“Among the 422 medical institutions providing diagnosis and treatment services for patients with new coronary pneumonia (covid-19), a total of 3,019 medical staff were infected with the new coronavirus,” the CDC study conducted on more than 72,000 patients with both confirmed and suspected cases said.The cases among the medics, the study said included confirmed cases, suspected cases, clinically diagnosed cases, and asymptomatic infections.They could have been infected from non-occupational exposures as well, the study said.The large-scale study and analysis was published on Monday in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology.It is titled “Analysis of the Epidemiological Features of New Coronavirus Pneumonia” which was written by the CDC’s Epidemiology Group of the Emergency Response Mechanism of New Coronavirus Pneumonia.The report states that, as of now, there is no evidence that a “super spreader” incident has occurred in any of the medical institutions.However, “…the report reminds that serious medical staff infections have occurred in some areas of Wuhan and Hubei, but the specific causes of medical staff infections and protection failures have yet to be investigated further,” the report quoted in Chinese local media said.The study analysed all covid-19 patients (included suspected ones) until February 11.“Early cases suggest that the new crown virus may not be as severe as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the rapidly increasing number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission suggest that the virus is more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The report believes that although the new coronavirus 2019 is highly contagious, most patients show mild symptoms and have a low overall crude case fatality rate,” the study said.The CDC said “…in late December 2019, an unexplained mass of pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, China, which caused the concern of the health authorities. On December 31, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention sent a rapid response team to Wuhan. Possible causes were excluded one by one, including influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, SARS, and MERS.The first confirmed case of covid-19 outside Hubei was recorded in Guangdong in January 19.“This is the first confirmed case of new coronary pneumonia reported in a province other than Hubei in China,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-3-000-chinese-medical-workers-infected-with-coronavirus-until-feb-11-study/story-j7fsSBMHJPo7NNpZg68uiO.html
17-02-2020||World||German far right arrests reveal ‘shocking’ mosque attack plot||Members of a German extreme right group arrested last week were believed to have been plotting “shocking” large-scale attacks on mosques similar to the ones carried out in New Zealand last year, the government said Monday. Officials said that investigations into 12 men detained in police raids across Germany Friday had indicated they planned major attacks, following media reports over the weekend the group aimed to launch several simultaneous mass-casualty assaults on Muslims during prayers.“It’s shocking what has been revealed here, that there are cells here that appear to have become radicalised in such a short space of time,” interior ministry spokesman Bjoern Gruenewaelder told reporters at a Berlin press conference.“It is the task of the state, and of course of this government, to protect free practice of religion in this country, with no reference to what religion it might be,” Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said.“Anyone practising their religion in Germany within our legal order should be able to do so without being endangered or threatened”.- Suspended policeman -According to media reports, the group planned to use semi-automatic weapons to copy last March’s attacks in Christchurch in New Zealand in which 51 people were killed at two mosques.Investigators learned about the plot from someone who had infiltrated the group, the reports said.The alleged leader of the group, which was known to the authorities and whose meetings and chat activity had been under observation, had detailed his plans at a meeting organised with his accomplices last week.According to German daily Bild, the leader was a 53-year-old from Augsburg named by investigators as Werner S.Prosecutors said Friday they had launched early morning raids to determine whether the suspects already had weapons or other supplies that could be used in an attack.Of the 12 men arrested on Friday, four are believed to have founded the group while eight more had promised to support them with money and weapons. The suspects, all of whom are German citizens, also included a police officer previously suspended over his links to the far right, North-Rhine Westphalia state interior minister Herbert Reul said Friday.Bild claimed to have identified him as Thorsten W., a 50-year-old medieval history enthusiast whose posts online included pictures of himself with a sword and shield and rants describing Germany as a “radical left dictatorship”. - ‘Vigilant’ -German authorities have turned increased attention to the country’s underground extreme right scene since the murder of conservative local politician Walter Luebcke last June.In an October attack on a synagogue in eastern city Halle, an assailant armed with home-made weapons killed two people at random on the street and in a Turkish restaurant after failing to breach the temple’s solid wooden door.Interior ministry spokesman Gruenewaelder said police have identified around 50 extreme right adherents as “dangerous” individuals who could carry out a violent attack, compared with 660 Islamists and fewer than 10 far-left extremists.In the summer of 2019, authorities arrested more than 30 people linked to a neo-Nazi movement called “Northern Cross”.They were suspected of planning to murder a number of leftwing and pro-migrant figures after ordering body bags and quicklime, a chemical often spread at mass grave sites, regional newspaper group RND reported. On Monday, Gruenewaelder said that the latest arrests “prove that the security services are remaining vigilant”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-far-right-arrests-reveal-shocking-mosque-attack-plot/story-uD3kw2WVUkyygrjP2eGseM.html
17-02-2020||World||Imran Khan warns of new refugee crisis in Pak due to India’s policies||Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday warned that Pakistan may face another refugee crisis if the international community failed to take notice of the current situation in India.Speaking at the two-day refugee summit in Islamabad on 40 years of hosting Afghan refugees in Pakistan, he said India’s “ultranationalist ideology going unchecked could lead to destruction and the region could become a flashpoint”, The Express Tribune quoted him as saying.He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that India can destroy Pakistan in 11 days is not a responsible statement by a premier of a nuclear state with a huge population, the paper reported. Khan made the statement in the presence of visiting UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who was also attending the summit.He said because of the “Hindutva” ideology, Kashmiris have been lockdown for over 200 days. He alleged under the same ideology, the BJP-led government passed two discriminatory nationalistic legislations, targeting 200 million Muslims in India.Khan was referring to India’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the revocation of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The new citizenship law passed by the Indian Parliament in December 2019 offers citizenship to non-Muslim persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The Indian government has maintained that the CAA is an internal matter of the country and stressed that the goal is to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries. India revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5. Reacting to India’s move, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner.India has always maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is its integral part and ruled out any third party mediation, including either from the UN or the US, saying it is a bilateral issue with Pakistan. Khan said if the international community does not take notice of this situation, it will create another refugee crisis for Pakistan as Muslims of India will move to Pakistan. “This is not the India of Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi. The United Nations (UN) must play its role otherwise it will become a very big problem in the future,” Duniya News quoted Khan as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-warns-of-new-refugee-crisis-in-pak-due-to-india-s-policies/story-XRXlkHvVmj88PMH87g1STI.html
17-02-2020||World||Storm Dennis: UK issues severe flood warnings; other European countries also suffer||Britain issued five severe flood alerts on Monday, warning of a danger to life after Storm Dennis dumped weeks worth of rain in some places. It gale-force winds also injured nine people in weather-related car accidents in Germany and caused flooding and power outages elsewhere in northern Europe.The severe flood warnings were for the central English counties of Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. The Met Office, Britain’s meteorological agency, issued another 221 flood warnings for England, along with 24 for Wales and 12 for Scotland.The weather system brought winds of more than 145 kph (90 mph) and up to 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain over the weekend.Forecasters said river levels in parts of northern England had yet to reach their peak. In the northern England city of York, authorities were piling up more than 4,000 sandbags as the Rover Ouse continued to rise. It’s expected to peak on Tuesday.Other residents in parts of Wales and western England were cleaning up Monday after the storm flooded roads, railways, homes and businesses and disrupted travel across Britain.The British environment secretary said climate change was making extreme weather events more common, but denied that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government was unprepared.“We’ll never be able to protect every single household just because of the nature of climate change and the fact that these weather events are becoming more extreme, but we’ve done everything that we can do with a significant sum of money, and there’s more to come,” Minister George Eustice said.In Germany, at least nine people were injured in weather-related car accidents.In Trippstadt near the French border, the driver of a van and his six passengers were injured, some of them severely, when their vehicle ran into a fallen tree on the road Monday morning. In Rostock in northeastern Germany, two people were injured when their car crashed Sunday into a broken tree on a road, the German news agency dpa reported.A commuter train with 67 passengers on board also crashed into a tree that had fallen on the tracks in the western German city of Dortmund, but nobody was injured. And in the German city of Hamburg, the city’s famous fish market was flooded for the second time this month.Further north, strong winds and heavy rain caused flooding, road closures and electricity outages across the Nordic and Baltic regions.In Norway, more than half a dozen roads and several passes were closed. The southwestern Denmark city of Kolding was flooded as gale force winds and heavy rains battered the area.Emergency services in the city on the eastern side of the Jutland peninsula were pumping out water from basements and using sand bags to try to contain the flooding.In Estonia, some 1,200 households were without electricity, the Baltic News Service reported.Several ferry crossings between Denmark and Norway were halted because of the storm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/storm-dennis-uk-issues-severe-flood-warnings-other-european-countries-also-suffer/story-yXwEY6VgZfPZH5jxgPbapL.html

17-02-2020||World||Russia orders woman back into coronavirus quarantine after escape||A Russian court on Monday ordered a woman to be returned to a quarantine facility as a precaution against coronavirus after she staged an elaborate escape and said she was being kept against her will.Alla Ilyina was quarantined at St. Petersburg’s Botkin Hospital for Infectious Diseases after she reported having a sore throat following a trip last month to China, where a coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 1,700 people.Ilyina described on Instagram how she had short-circuited an electronic lock on her door in order to escape and that she had not been allowed to leave despite doctors giving her a clean bill of health.The escape, which raised questions about the effectiveness and rigidity of Russia’s coronavirus quarantine measures, prompted St. Petersburg’s chief sanitary doctor to sue Ilyina for flouting quarantine rules and jeopardizing public health.“Ilyina is subject to forced hospitalization,” St. Petersburg’s Petrogradsky District Court said, adding that her hearing had taken place in a courtroom with a germicidal lamp.Her lawyer, Vitaly Cherkasov, said she would appeal the verdict. Cherkasov told Reuters that Ilyina would need three negative tests for the coronavirus before she could be released. He could not provide a timeline for the completion of these tests. He said Ilyina was in good spirits despite the ruling.“She has everything necessary in her room, even a television which she didn’t have last time,” he said. “She is satisfied with the conditions at the moment.” Rospotrebnadzor, the country’s consumer safety watchdog, said last week that more than 20,000 people had been quarantined in Russia upon their arrival from China.Russia has reported two cases of the illness - two Chinese nationals who have recovered and been released from hospital. A Russian citizen was infected with the virus aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked in Yokohama, the Russian embassy in Japan said earlier on Monday.

17-02-2020||World||China may postpone annual congress because of virus: Report||China said Monday it may postpone its annual congress in March, its biggest political meeting of the year, as the military dispatched hundreds more medical workers and extra supplies to the city hit hardest by a 2-month-old virus outbreak.Japanese officials, meanwhile, confirmed 99 more people were infected by the new virus aboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 454.The standing committee for the National People’s Congress said it believes it is necessary to postpone the gathering to give top priority to people’s lives, safety and health, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.It noted that one-third of the 3,000 delegates are provincial and municipal-level cadres with important leadership roles working on the front line of the battle against the epidemic.The standing committee said it would meet on Feb. 24 to further deliberate on a postponement. The meeting is due to start on March 5.Health authorities reported 2,048 new cases of the virus and 105 more deaths. Another 10,844 people have recovered from COVID-19, a disease caused by the new coronavirus, and have been discharged from hospitals, according to Monday’s figures. The death toll is 1,770.With fears of the virus spreading further, Chinese and residents of nearby countries and territories have begun hoarding supplies of everything from masks and other personal protective gear to instant noodles, cooking oil and toilet paper.In Hong Kong, local media reported that police had arrested two men and were seeking three others who allegedly stole a load of 60 packs of toilet paper at knifepoint early early Monday morning. Supplies of the commodity have become extremely scarce, with often only low-quality imports still available. Police were expected to discuss the matter later.Another 1,200 doctors and nurses from China’s military began arriving in Wuhan on Monday, the latest contingent sent to help shore up the city’s overwhelmed health care system with more than 32,000 additional personnel. The city has rapidly built two prefabricated hospitals and converted gymnasiums and other spaces into wards for those showing milder symptoms, but residents still say they are being wait-listed for beds and even ambulance rides.Wuhan has accounted for the vast majority of mainland China’s 70,548 cases. Some 60 million people in that area and other parts of China are under lockdown in a bid to prevent the virus from spreading further.At a daily news briefing, National Health Commission official Guo Yanhong said attempts to contain the virus appeared to be bearing fruit, with the number of new cases reported daily outside of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, falling for 13 days straight, and growing numbers of recovered people.“These are all extremely good signs that show our prevention work is very effective,” Guo said, citing early detection and treatment alongside quarantines and travel restrictions as largely responsible for the result.Japan’s Health Ministry has been carrying out tests on passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess, which is docked in Yokohama, a port city near Tokyo. Officials said they Monday they had confirmed 99 more cases on the ship, bringing the total to 454. The 14-day quarantine for those on the ship was due to end Wednesday.Outside China, the ship has the largest number of cases of COVID-19.The Health Ministry said it has now tested 1,723 people on the ship, which had about 3,700 passengers and crew aboard.Two chartered planes flew 340 Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess out of Japan late Sunday. About 380 Americans had been on the ship.The State Department announced later that 14 of the evacuees were confirmed to have the virus in tests given before they boarded their planes. They were taken to the U.S. because they did not have symptoms, and were being isolated from other passengers, it said.Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Italy were planning similar flights for their citizens.New cases in other countries are raising more concern about containment of the virus. Though only a few hundred cases have been confirmed outside mainland China, some recent cases lacked obvious connections to China.Taiwan on Sunday reported its first death from COVID-19, the fifth fatality outside of mainland China. Taiwan’s Central News Agency, citing health minister Chen Shih-chung, said the man who died was in his 60s and had not traveled overseas recently and had no known contact with virus patients.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an experts meeting to discuss containment measures in his country, where more than a dozen cases have emerged in the past few days without any obvious link to China.“The situation surrounding this virus is changing by the minute,” Abe said.Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the country was “entering into a phase that is different from before,” requiring new steps to stop the spread of the virus.Japan has 518 confirmed cases, including the 454 from the cruise ship, and one death from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-postpone-annual-congress-because-of-virus-report/story-cqjEbKF90fLC6XKkKX4csO.html
17-02-2020||World||Arab World’s first nuclear reactor cleared for startup||The United Arab Emirates took a final step toward switching on the Arab world’s first commercial nuclear power plant, even as the country prospers by producing and selling fossil fuels.The UAE’s regulatory watchdog gave long-awaited approval on Monday to the operator of the Barakah reactor, nudging the UAE to the brink of membership in an elite club of 30 countries that make power from smashing atoms.Built and run by a joint venture with Korea Electric Power Corp., the plant can now start loading fuel and ramp up to full commercial operation within several months. Other Arab countries, notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt, are also pushing into nuclear power in spite of questions about cost and safety.“Barakah was meant to be the showcase for the international nuclear industry,” said Mycle Schneider, an independent analyst. “Grid connection is at least three years late, and there is no doubt that it is way over budget.”Barakah is the first of four civilian reactors that the government plans to fire up by 2023. The plants, located on a sparsely populated strip of desert on the Persian Gulf coast, are estimated to cost $25 billion. The UAE expects them to produce as much as 5.6 gigawatts once they’re fully commissioned, or almost a fifth of the country’s current installed generating capacity.Earlier EffortsArab nations have tried, and failed, in years past to build nuclear capabilities. Iraq under Saddam Hussein had a well-developed program until Israel, an unacknowledged nuclear state, stifled his ambitions by destroying the Osiris research reactor in an air raid in 1981. Non-Arab Iran has operated the Bushehr facility since 2011, but Tehran faces crippling U.S. sanctions over its atomic program.Barakah marks a new milestone for the region. The UAE, third-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is trying to diversify its domestic energy supply and lessen its dependence on oil. Dubai, the country’s business hub, targets meeting 75% of its needs from solar energy and other renewables by 2050.Schneider questions the regional nuclear push. “Nuclear power is now clearly the most expensive form of electricity generation,” the analyst said. While the cost of solar photo-voltaic power on a utility scale has plunged 90% over the past decade, nuclear power costs have risen by 26%, Schneider said.And while advocates of nuclear energy argue that the technology is becoming safer, opponents point to catastrophic incidents, including the meltdowns of three reactors at the Fukushima plant in northern Japan in 2011.Nawah Energy Co. -- the venture between Kepco and state-run Emirates Nuclear Corp. that will operate all four of the UAE’s plants -- waited almost two years after the first one was completed before getting the green light from regulators to load it with fuel.Nawah Energy “can fulfill all the safety requirements of the UAE,” Christer Viktorsson, head of the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation, said Monday at a news conference in Abu Dhabi.Training StaffThe UAE’s deep pockets enabled it to build Barakah quickly, said Mark Hibbs, nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Nuclear Policy Program.“The UAE has to build up a domestic pool of experts in many areas to keep these plants running smoothly and efficiently,” Hibbs said. “That won’t be trivial because when this project got underway virtually all of the expertise was imported from outside.”A government-sponsored training program has produced 380 Emirati nuclear experts, and 60% of ENEC’s staff are UAE citizens, according to the company.As of 2017, the UAE had about 30.4 gigawatts in installed power-generating capacity. The vast bulk of it involves the burning of natural gas, making the country’s nuclear program a key component in the plan to diversify its energy supply and lessen its reliance on hydrocarbons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arab-world-s-first-nuclear-reactor-cleared-for-startup/story-2bJs8tzX9oSmrXJURUkfqM.html

17-02-2020||World||Oil prices steady as concern over Covid-19 related demand remains||Oil prices were little changed on Monday as concerns over falling fuel demand caused by the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak in China were offset by expectations that output cuts from major producers will tighten crude supply.Brent crude was at $57.29 a barrel, down 5 cents by 0946 GMT after rising 5.2% last week, the biggest weekly gain since September 2019.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 5 cents to $52.10 a barrel, after a 3.4% gain last week.Japan, the world’s fourth-largest oil consumer, reported an economic contraction of 6.3% for the October to December period and there is an expectation of a further contraction in the January to March quarter because of the contagion. Singapore, whose trade-dependent economy is a barometer for the region, also warned of the potential for a recession this quarter because of the outbreak.“Oil remains acutely vulnerable to both excess supply and the economic coronavirus-induced slowdown in China and other parts of Asia,” Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA in Singapore said.The International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week the virus is set to cause oil demand to fall by 435,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2020 from the same period a year ago, in what would be the first quarterly drop since the financial crisis in 2009.Oil did rise last week for the first time since early January on optimism that Chinese economic stimulus measures amid the outbreak could lead to a recovery in oil demand in the world’s largest importing country.There are some indications of prompt demand for oil as the front-month Brent futures market has shifted to a backwardation, when near-term prices are higher than later-dated prices, from a contango.Investors are also anticipating that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, will approve a proposal to deepen production cuts to tighten global supplies and support prices.The group, known as OPEC+, has an agreement to cut oil output by 1.7 million bpd until the end of March.A technical committee earlier this month recommended the group reduce production by another 600,000 bpd because of the impact from the coronavirus, though oil prices’ first weekly gain since early January on Friday may give the producers pause.“The more recent strength that we have seen in the market may also make OPEC+ complacent when it comes to taking action,” ING said in a note.“Already the group has failed to bring forward the meeting that was originally scheduled for early March.

It was the latest attack against a religious leader in the increasingly unstable West African nation.The mayor of Boundore commune, Sihanri Osangola Brigadie, said the attack occurred in the town of Pansy in Yagha province. The roughly 20 attackers separated men from women close to a Protestant church. At least 10 other people were injured.“It hurt me when I saw the people,” Brigadie said after visiting some of the victims in the hospital in Dori town, 180 kilometers (110 miles) from the attack. The gunmen looted oil and rice from shops and forced the three youth they kidnapped to help transport it on their motorbikes, he said.Both Christians and Muslims were killed before the church was set on fire, said a government security official in Dori who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.Attacks have targeted religious leaders in the area in the past. Last week, also in Yagha province, a retired pastor was killed and another pastor was abducted by gunmen, according to an internal security report for aid workers seen by The Associated Press.Extremist violence has dramatically escalated in once-peaceful Burkina Faso. Analysts are concerned that attacks against civilians, including against Christians, are increasing “at an alarming rate,” said Corinne Dufka, West Africa director for Human Rights Watch. “Perpetrators use victims’ links to government or their faith to justify the killings, while others appear to be reprisal killings for killings by the government security forces,” she said.More than 1,300 civilians were killed in targeted attacks last year in Burkina Faso, more than seven times the previous year, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, which collects and analyzes conflict information.The insecurity has created a humanitarian crisis. More than 760,000 people are internally displaced, according to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-kill-24-in-attack-near-church-in-burkina-faso/story-2R8gWKcjp7AKwNnzmiFRGJ.html

We want elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places,” he said.The birthday gathering on February 23 was cancelled as local media reported that the amateur section of the Tokyo Marathon, scheduled for March 1, would be cancelled.“We have no formal decision to announce yet. We are studying and once a decision is made we will announce it, by today,” a spokeswoman for the organisers told AFP.The birthday celebration for Emperor Naruhito was to be the first since he took the throne last year.

17-02-2020||World||‘We need peace, land to go home’: Afghan refugees tell UN||Hukam Khan isn’t sure how old he is, but his beard is long and white, and when he came to Pakistan 40 years ago fleeing an earlier war in Afghanistan, his children were small, stuffed onto the backs of donkeys and dragged across rugged mountains to the safety of northwestern Pakistan.Back then the war was against the former Soviet Union and Khan was among more than 5 million Afghans forced to become refugees in Pakistan, driven from their homes by a bombing campaign so brutal it was referred to as a “scorched earth” policy.After four decades of war and conflict, more than 1.5 million Afghans still live as refugees in Pakistan, feeling abandoned by their own government, increasingly unwelcome in their reluctant host country and ignored by the United Nations.Now, for the first time in years, there’s a faint possibility they might eventually return home. The United States and the Taliban appear to have inched closer to a peace deal, agreeing as a first step to a temporary “reduction in violence.”If that truce should hold, the next step could be a long-sought-after agreement between Washington and the Taliban to end Afghanistan’s current war, now in its 19th year. The agreement would return American troops home and start negotiations between the warring Afghans to bring peace to their shattered country.Against the backdrop of a possible peace deal, Pakistan is hosting a conference Monday attended by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to recognize 40 years of Afghans living as refugees. Also attending the conference in the capital, Islamabad, is the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, whose job would be to help the Afghans return home.It won’t be easy.Many refugees have already tried going back — lured by promises of help and hope from the international community and from Afghan President Ashraf Ghani — only to find there was neither food nor shelter for them. Many also discovered they were no longer welcome in the villages they had left decades earlier.Disillusioned, they returned to Pakistan and to Iran, while tens of thousands of other Afghans paid smugglers and risked their lives to escape to Europe. From there, many were later loaded on planes and returned to war-ravaged Afghanistan.Grandi called the forced return of refugees from Europe “shameful” in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday.“I do ... fervently hope that the countries like Iran and Pakistan, who have hosted so generously ... don’t take their example from much richer countries that are shutting borders, not only to Afghans, but to many other refugees,” he said.While the specter of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal raises hope that the refugees will eventually return home, Grandi said, “I think this time around, the people who are still left outside will be very cautious in their judgment. They would want to have guarantees that it can be sustainable.”Another challenge will be raising the vast sums of money needed to help return home not only refugees abroad, but also the millions of Afghans who are internally displaced inside their own country. The world has grown tired of sending money to a country with such endemic corruption, which has driven poverty levels up despite billions of dollars in aid since 2001.Just last month, a U.S. government watchdog said the Afghan government was more interested in ticking off boxes to demonstrate compliance than making real inroads to curb corruption.Poverty levels in Afghanistan are climbing. In 2012, 34% of Afghans were listed as below the poverty level, living on $1 a day. Today, that figure has risen to 55%.Khan, the Afghan refugee in Pakistan, now has grown children who have children of their own. He said he blames the overwhelming poverty in his homeland on a corrupt leadership.“To tell you the truth, lots of money came to Afghanistan and every influential person, even the mullahs, stole that money,” said Khan. ”The leaders are all traitors, they betrayed Afghans. The children of poor people got killed, while no leader lost his son.”Khan said he had a message for Guterres and for Grandi.“We don’t ask for much,” he said, looking out over the sunbaked mud and straw homes in the camp where he’s lived for 40 years. Located on the edge of Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan’s Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province, the refugee camp is only about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the border with Afghanistan.Among locals, the camp is known as Kabobayan Camp, named for the many kabob shops that sprung up around it, most of which have long since disappeared.“First we ask for peace,” said Khan, surrounded by dozens of children dressed in tattered clothes. None were wearing socks despite the chilly February morning, their feet and hands caked in mud.“When there is peace, we should be provided with land on which we can build our homes first. Then we need to have food, and then we need to be able to build our schools, our shops and our mosques,” he said.Indrika Ratwatte, the U.N. human rights organization’s regional director for Asia, told the AP in an interview last week that Afghan refugees have little faith in their government or international organizations.Khan’s request for land is reasonable, Ratwatte said, explaining how the U.N. wants to set up 20 zones throughout Afghanistan that would offer returning refugees land to start anew, as a kind of prototype.“We know how resilient Afghans are,” Ratwatte said. “If you give them that small opportunity, they will make it work. They will make it work. So we have to really ‘walk the talk’ on the land allocation.”Shah Wali, another elderly refugee, left his home in Surkhrud in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province almost 40 years ago. He tried returning, but found nothing left. What wasn’t destroyed by war had been taken by neighbors and thieves.But even the faint chance of peace has him hopeful.“Give us peace and then we will go back,” he said. “Who doesn’t want to back to their homeland?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-need-peace-land-to-go-home-afghan-refugees-tell-un/story-EzjLQYZbnWHcjHEJzhPBEJ.html

Our water police located her a short time ago,” a police spokeswoman told AFP.Local media reported police divers had joined the search for the Bond University student on Monday, after heavy rainfall had earlier forced authorities to suspend the search.The woman, who lives on the Gold Coast, was found near the waterfall where she first went missing.A Queensland Ambulance Service spokeswoman said she had been taken to a local hospital for medical treatment in a stable condition.Paramedic Gary Berkowitz said she “looked like she’d been through quite a trauma” but was in “surprisingly good spirits” and had walked to the ambulance.“We’re fortunate the weather has been quite warm and she had access to water,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-missing-for-five-days-in-flood-hit-australian-bushland-found-alive/story-uw1GqWAI5jyavfGEtrDwGO.html
17-02-2020||World||Armed gang steals toilet rolls in Hong Kong hit by shortages over coronavirus panic-buying||Armed robbers who stole hundreds of toilet rolls were being hunted by Hong Kong police on Monday, in a city wracked by shortages caused by coronavirus panic-buying.Toilet rolls have become hot property in the densely packed business hub, despite government assurances that supplies remain unaffected by the virus outbreak.Supermarkets have found themselves unable to restock quickly enough, leading to sometimes lengthy queues and shelves stripped bare within moments of opening.Alongside toilet rolls, there has been a run on staples like rice and pasta as well as hand sanitiser and other cleaning items. Police said a truck driver was held up early Monday by three men outside a supermarket in Mong Kok, a working class district with a history of “triad” organised crime gangs.“A delivery man was threatened by three knife-wielding men who took toilet paper worth more than HK$1,000 ($130),” a police spokesman told AFP.Footage from Now TV showed police investigators standing around multiple crates of toilet roll outside a Wellcome supermarket. One of the crates was only half stacked.The hysteria that has swept through Hong Kong since the coronavirus outbreak exploded on mainland China is partly fuelled by the city’s tragic recent history of confronting a deadly disease.In 2003, 299 Hong Kongers died of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an outbreak that began on the mainland but was initially covered up by Beijing, a decision that left a lasting legacy of distrust towards the authorities on public health issues.This year’s coronavirus outbreak also comes at a time when the city’s pro-Beijing leadership boasts historic low approval ratings after refusing to bow to months of angry pro-democracy protests last year.Authorities have blamed false online rumours for the panic-buying and say supplies of food and household goods remain stable.But the panic-buying has itself created shortages in one of the world’s most densely populated cities where supermarkets and pharmacies have limited floor space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-gang-steals-toilet-rolls-in-hong-kong-hit-by-shortages-over-coronavirus-panic-buying/story-m6AUC996cyYLsimHBr1YAM.html

17-02-2020||World||Man dies as Storm Dennis slams UK, power cuts hit France||A man died after falling into a river on Sunday as Storm Dennis swept across Britain with the army drafted in to help deal with heavy flooding and high winds.The man fell into the River Tawe, in south Wales, police said.The storm also battered much of France, with some 60,000 people suffering power cuts in the northwest of the country and rail traffic disrupted. Britain’s government weather agency issued a rare red warning for south Wales, saying there was a risk of “significant impacts from flooding” that included a “danger to life from fast flowing water, extensive flooding to property and road closures”. Police said in a tweet the man who fell into the river was later found dead “further along the river in the Tebanos area”.A record 594 flood warnings and alerts were in place on Sunday, extending from Scotland’s River Tweed to Cornwall in southwest England.Winds of over 90 miles (150 kilometres) per hour were recorded in Aberdaron, south Wales.Pictures circulated on social media showed the nearby River Taff bursting its banks, while rescue workers rushed to get people trapped in their homes in Powys to safety.“The forecast is for very significant levels of rain, especially in the eastern valleys of south Wales,” said Jeremy Parr, from government body Natural Resources Wales.“Impacts could be severe overnight, and everyone should take the warnings extremely seriously,” he added.Police declared major incidents in parts of Wales and England, with landslides also reported.“Some communities have been cut off... but emergency service workers are working tirelessly to put measures in place to ensure the safety of residents,” south Wales police said in a statement.Bodies pulled from seaRoads and railways were badly affected by the downpours and winds, having barely recovered from a similar storm last week.The defence ministry deployed troops in West Yorkshire, northern England, which suffered badly from flooding caused by last weekend’s Storm Ciara.“Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it,” said defence minister Ben Wallace.British Airways and easyJet confirmed they had grounded flights, with footage posted online showing a massive Airbus A380 jet being blown about as it attempted to land.Earlier, two bodies were pulled from rough seas off the south England coast on Saturday as the storm barrelled in.One of the men is assumed to have been the subject of a search triggered when an LPG tanker reported that one of its crew was unaccounted for.France was also affected by the storm, especially northwestern Brittany where the Finistere and Morbihan regions were temporarily placed on orange alert for rain and flooding, according to the national weather service, Meteo-France.Electricity provider Enedis said it had deployed 450 staff to restore power to 30,000 homes in Brittany. Power cuts also hit parts of northern and central France.The storm interrupted two high-speed TGV train services, one stopped by a fallen tree and the other by a power failure, the national rail company SNCF said.By Sunday evening, Meteo-France said the worst seemed to have passed as winds dropped to below 100 kph.Several neighbouring countries were also affected.“Winds will be increasing throughout the day on Sunday across Germany, Denmark and southern Sweden,” AccuWeather Meteorologist Maura Kelly said earlier Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-dies-as-storm-dennis-slams-uk-power-cuts-hit-france/story-MJ0BDTGghb4be9dnqoMGAN.html
17-02-2020||World||UK consumers face higher prices for EU goods, deal or not||UK consumers will face higher prices on goods coming from the European Union after Brexit, whether Boris Johnson signs a free trade agreement with the bloc or not, according to a major business group.Products imported from the EU after January 1, 2021 will require customs declarations, which cost between 16 pounds ($21) and 56 pounds per product line. They will also need documents like rules of origin paperwork, new red tape that is automatically triggered by Britain leaving the bloc’s single market and customs union.“These things will have to happen regardless of how good the deal is,” said William Bain, policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, which represents 5,000 businesses making 180 billion pounds of retail sales. “Any increase in cost in a low margin industry is ultimately going to be faced by the consumer.”Looming higher costs for companies dealing with the EU, which is Britain’s largest trading partner and a source of half its imports, is a result of Prime Minister Johnson’s approach to trade talks with the bloc. Johnson is seeking a more distant economic relationship with the EU -- akin to the bloc’s deal with Canada -- so that the UK does not have to align with EU rules and can independently sign trade agreements with other countries.Costs and delays for businesses will rise further if the UK and EU fail to be pragmatic on other customs processes, the BRC said. The most burdensome will be export health certificates (EHC), a form required to move products of animal origin into the EU, which cost about 100 pounds each and must be issued by a vet or other qualified professional. Such products include meats, fish, cheeses and yogurts.Switzerland has been able to remove the need for EHCs with the EU through a deal based on regulatory alignment, but Johnson has said the UK wants regulatory autonomy. Last week, cabinet office minister Michael Gove told businesses to prepare for animal health checks after Brexit.Boris Johnson runs up against his red wall in escape from EU“That’s going to be a significant bit of extra red tape,” Bain said, noting a recent example of a goods truck heading to Northern Ireland which was carrying 1,392 different product lines, 800 of which would’ve required EHCs after Brexit. “It’s a significant amount of money per truck,” he said.Another major concern for retailers is tariffs. Commerce between the UK and the EU will default to World Trade Organization terms if no accord is struck in 2020, and Britain is currently consulting on the levies it would apply. The EU has said a zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal with Britain is conditional on a satisfactory agreement on fishing rights and the UK respecting the bloc’s rules in areas like environmental protection, labor standards and state aid. Johnson has so far rejected the idea of being bound by the EU’s so-called ‘level playing field’ requirements.“Prices of goods are a commercial decision for businesses and depend on a variety of factors, but it’s in their interests too to make them competitive and affordable,” a government spokesperson said. “Leaving the EU’s single market and customs union gives us the opportunity to strike trade deals around the world, widen choices available for consumers, and set our own independent tariff strategy that is best for UK businesses and consumers.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-consumers-face-higher-prices-for-eu-goods-deal-or-not/story-89QIx6eMmLBkNPhIjy9rFO.html

Residents are restricted from going out of their communities and medicines and daily necessities would be collectively purchased and delivered to residents, the notice said. New traffic measures to be implemented from Monday include enforcing province-wide traffic restrictions on all non-emergency vehicles and closing all non-essential public venues, according to the circular issued by the provincial government.The measures were being taken in the province because it is at a “critical stage” to control the epidemic and the situation remains “grave”, said the circular.According to the circular, the health screening campaign should be strengthened and no one should be missed. Once any resident shows symptoms such as fever or coughing, the situation should be immediately reported to the local community or village.“Four categories of people,” namely patients confirmed or suspected to be infected with the virus, their close contacts and patients with fever, should be timely treated or placed in quarantine instead of self-isolation at home.Xiaogan, a city in Hubei, has banned all residents from going out except in case of necessity starting from Monday, and those who violate the regulation will be placed in detention for 10 days for violating public security rules, the tabloid Global Times reported.Entrances to residential complexes will be guarded to allow only residents to enter or exit.Meanwhile, two US government-chartered planes carrying hundreds of American citizens evacuated from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship quarantined in Japan, left Tokyo’s Haneda airport Monday morning, the Japanese Kyodo news agency reported.Evacuees left Yokohama Port around 1:40 a.m Monday aboard 10 coaches belonging to Japan’s self-defense Forces, with drivers in protective suits.Of some 400 US citizens who were aboard the Diamond Princess docked in Yokohama, 44 tested positive for coronavirus, The Washington Post said, quoting Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-china-s-hubei-with-60-million-people-under-lock-down-as-death-toll-mounts/story-KdvpATDurwSWhCv6mzZ1hI.html
17-02-2020||World||14 children among up to 22 dead in Cameroon massacre: UN||A massacre in an anglophone region of Cameroon left up to 22 villagers dead including 14 children, the UN said Sunday, with an opposition party blaming the killings on the army.Armed men carried out the bloodshed on Friday in the village of Ntumbo in the Northwest region, James Nunan, a local official of humanitarian coordination agency OCHA, told AFP.“Up to 22 civilians were killed, including a pregnant woman and several children,” Nunan said, adding that 14 children -- including nine under age five -- were among the dead.Eleven of the children were girls, said Nunan, head of OCHA’s office for the Northwest and Southwest regions, which are home to the West African country’s large English-speaking minority. Separatists in the regions have been fighting the central government for three years.The Movement for the Rebirth of Cameroon, one of the country’s two main opposition parties, issued a statement saying: “The dictatorial regime (and) the supreme head of the security and defence forces are chiefly responsible for these crimes.”A key figure in the separatist movement, lawyer Agbor Mballa, in a Facebook post also accused “state defence forces” of carrying out the killings.An army official contacted by AFP early Sunday denied the allegations, saying simply: “False”. No other official response was immediately available.The three-year conflict between anglophone forces seeking to break away from French-speaking Cameroon has claimed more than 3,000 lives and forced more than 700,000 people to flee their homes.Friday’s killings followed elections on February 9 that were marred by violence in the regions blamed both on separatists and security forces.Armed separatists prevented people from voting, threatening reprisals, while government soldiers were a heavy presence.Separatists kidnapped more than 100 people and torched property in the run-up to the elections, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Wednesday.The government has not yet announced the results of the elections or turnout figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-children-among-up-to-22-dead-in-cameroon-massacre-un/story-COlTV5pZBYXCL235cKPz5M.html
17-02-2020||World||40 US nationals infected with coronavirus on Japan ship as others fly home||Forty Americans are among hundreds infected with the new coronavirus on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan, a US official said on Sunday, after other Americans on board left for chartered flights home.The evacuation coincided with stepped-up warnings from Japanese authorities over the deadly outbreak, urging citizens to avoid crowds and “non-essential gatherings.”The Diamond Princess was placed in a 14-day quarantine in early February after a former passenger tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.But US authorities announced on the weekend they would offer American passengers the option to leave and fly home, where they will face another 14-day isolation period. Several other governments also have announced plans to remove their citizens from the ship.More than three dozen Americans are not going home, however, Anthony Fauci, a senior official at the National Institutes for Health, said on CBS.“Forty of them have gotten infected,” Fauci said. “They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan.”It was not immediately clear whether the 40 Americans were among the figure of 355 people from the ship which Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato earlier Sunday said were infected.He said that 1,219 people on the vessel had been tested.Late Sunday and into the early hours of Monday, Americans who opted to leave were brought off the ship in groups. They passed through a makeshift passport control but underwent no health checks, American passenger Sarah Arana told AFP.They boarded buses driven by personnel in head-to-toe protective suits and were told that the more than a dozen vehicles would travel in a convoy.“I am happy and ready to go,” Arana told AFP before leaving the ship. “We need a proper quarantine. This was not it.”The US government should have intervened “much sooner, at the beginning,” the 52-year-old medical social worker said.“This was too much for Japan, and they shouldn’t have had to bear the burden,” she added. “The people of Japan did not deserve this. I am full of gratitude.”The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Saturday that 400 Americans would be flown home.Declining to leave Other Americans on board declined the evacuation, despite being warned they will still have to wait two weeks and test negative for the virus before being allowed back to the United States.“My health is fine. And my two-week quarantine is almost over. Why would I want to be put on a bus and a plane with other people they think may be infected when I have spent nearly two weeks isolated from those people?” tweeted Matt Smith, an American lawyer on the ship with his wife.He described a fellow American passenger standing on her balcony chanting “USA, USA” as buses arrived to collect them.“Of course, in contravention of the rules of quarantine, she’s not wearing a face mask, and she’s talking with a passenger on the adjacent balcony... And you wanted me to get on a bus with her?”Japan has not been able to test all those on board the ship due to limited supplies of testing kits, facilities and manpower, which are also needed by authorities tracking the spread of the virus on land.‘A new phase’Hong Kong also said it plans to charter a flight for 330 city residents on the ship. Canada announced a similar decision, and on Sunday Italy said it wants to quickly get its roughly 35 citizens off the ship.“We will be next,” Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said, adding a meeting is to be held on Monday to decide how to bring them back.The death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected.In Japan, the number of new infections has continued to rise, with six new cases reported on Sunday. At least 59 cases have now been confirmed, including more than a dozen among the hundreds of Japanese nationals and their relatives repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the outbreak.Japan’s fifth chartered flight out of Wuhan, carrying 36 Japanese and 29 Chinese -- including spouses -- was due back in Tokyo shortly after 7:00 am (2200 GMT Sunday), public broadcaster NHK said. This is the last flight for now, NKH cited the government as saying.With the rise in local infections, Kato warned the country was “entering a new phase.”“We are seeing infection cases that we are unable to trace back their transmission routes,” he told reporters.“We want to ask the public to avoid non-urgent, non-essential gatherings,” Kato added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/40-us-nationals-infected-with-coronavirus-on-japan-ship-as-others-fly-home/story-eWqZqtoodv3wxP66IrRXZN.html
17-02-2020||World||Daytona 500 starts following Donald Trump’s parade lap, rain halts it again||The Daytona 500 is being delayed by rain for the second time, dampening NASCAR’s season opener that started with a visit from President Donald Trump.The first delay lasted 50 minutes and came moments after the presidential motorcade completed a ceremonial parade lap around the 2 1/2-mile track.Trump’s armored limousine nicknamed “The Beast” exited Daytona International Speedway, and the sky opened for a brief shower that forced drivers back to pit road.The start already had been pushed back 13 minutes to accommodate Trump’s trip. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. eventually led the field to the green flag and was out front for the first 20 laps before heavier rain soaked a racing surface that takes hours to dry.It choked some of the excitement out of an event that was a raucous celebration hours earlier, set off by Trump’s dramatic entrance. Thousands cheered as Air Force One performed a flyover and landed at Daytona International Airport a few hundred yards behind the track. Trump’s motorcade arrived a few minutes later, prompting another loud ovation. Both entrances were broadcast on giant video boards around the superspeedway.At least a dozen drivers were escorted from the pre-race meeting to a private introduction with Trump.“I got to meet the president! How cool is that?” driver Aric Almirola said.Trump served as the grand marshal for the Daytona 500 and gave the command for drivers to start their engines. He then got in the limousine and turned a lap.The president’s visit was widely welcomed by NASCAR fans. Trump 2020 flags flooded the infield, and some fans wore them as capes in the garage area.Trump’s presence also created huge lines at entrances, with many fans complaining while waiting hours to get through security.Former NASCAR chairman and CEO Brian France, who was replaced following his August 2018 arrest on DUI charges, was on Air Force One with the president and first lady. They traveled from West Palm Beach.Among those who met them at the airport: current NASCAR chairman Jim France and fellow top executives Lesa France Kennedy and Ben Kennedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daytona-500-starts-following-donald-trump-s-parade-lap-rain-halts-it-again/story-QrQcdYylwGYocTDtrYpGjL.html

There could be more than 30 injured,” Health Minister Eteni Longodo said after visiting the scene.“The government is here. We are taking care of the people. We shall ensure that everybody benefits from quality treatment,” Longodo added.Congolese often accuse the authorities of responding inadequately to such incidents.Interior Minister Gilbert Kankonde, who joined Longodo at the scene, said the government would seek to take “preventive measures” to crack down on speeding along a busy sloping stretch of road near the university.Witness Joseph Enenge told UN-run Okapi radio he estimated the death toll at around 30 while another witness, Yasmine Lutonadio, told AFP that “there were so many dead, I just can’t take it in.” Enenge and Lutonadio said the lorry had hit around eight vehicles.AFPTV saw half a dozen shattered vehicles at the scene, including two minibuses and three cars.Top Congo FM radio tweeted that the lorry was carrying a cargo of stones and hit “several vehicles and motorbikes”, without giving further details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-dead-over-24-injured-as-lorry-ploughs-into-vehicles-pedestrians-in-dr-congo/story-c5GJxj3XfOgj9LS6FiAI1K.html
