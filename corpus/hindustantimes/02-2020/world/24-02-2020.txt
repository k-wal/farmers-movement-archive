But a lawmaker from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, was quoted by the semi-official ILNA news agency as saying that the death toll was 50.Even with the lower toll of 12, the number of deaths compared to the number of confirmed infections from the virus is higher in Iran than in any other country, including China and South Korea, where the outbreak is far more widespread.The World Health Organization said last week that in 2% of infected cases, the virus has been fatal. In Iran, according to the Health Ministry’s figures, the death toll represents nearly 20 per cent of total infections.There are concerns that clusters of the new coronavirus in Iran, as well as in Italy and South Korea, could signal a serious new stage in its global spread.Authorities in Iraq and Afghanistan, which closed their borders with Iran, announced their first confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday. Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman also announced their first cases. In all five countries, the infected patients had links with Iran.Farahani, the lawmaker, said the 50 deaths in Qom date back to Feb. 13. Iran first officially reported cases of the virus and its first deaths on Feb. 19.He did not provide supporting evidence but said more than 250 people are quarantined in Qom, which is known for its Shiite seminaries that attract students from across Iran and other countries. Schools there have been closed.“I think the performance of the administration in controlling the virus has not been successful,” Farahani said, referring to the government of President Hassan Rouhani. His comments represent the most public criticism levied yet against the government for its handling of the virus, which originated in China in December.“None of the nurses have access to proper protective gear,” Farahani said, adding that some health care specialists had left the city. “So far, I have not seen any particular action to confront corona by the administration.” He spoke following a session in parliament in Tehran. His comments, first published by ILNA, were later carried by other news agencies in Iran.While such harsh criticism is rare in the country, it reflects deep-seated public mistrust of the government, particularly since a Ukrainian passenger jet was shot down by Iran on Jan. 8, killing 176 on board amid heightened tensions with the U.S. Iranian government officials at first tried to conceal the cause of the crash before acknowledging that Revolutionary Guard forces had shot it down, mistaking it for an enemy target.Health Ministry spokesman Iraj Harirchi rejected the lawmaker’s comments, but said about 900 other suspected cases are being tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-rejects-previously-inflated-covid-19-fatality-figures-says-12-dead-from-novel-coronavirus/story-Uj64QTOrLlQuEUVDBInGRK.html
24-02-2020||World||Israel fighting to stop as Islamic Jihad announces end of cease-fire||The Islamic Jihad militant group in the Gaza Strip announced a unilateral cease-fire Monday evening to end two days of heavy fighting with Israel.In a short statement, the Iranian-backed group said it had completed its “retaliation” for Israel’s killing of three members. But it said it would respond to any further Israeli “aggression.”There was no immediate Israeli comment.Earlier Monday, the Islamic jihad militants had resumed their intense bombardment of southern Israel, with some rockets slipping through Israel’s Iron Dome defense system and one landing in the yard of a kindergarten.There was no word of casualties, but the violence threatened to unleash a new round of hostilities just a week before Israel heads to elections. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Gaza’s Hamas rulers with a “war” if the new round of rocket fire continued, ramping up his rhetoric amid the final stretch of his campaign.The fighting erupted Sunday after Israel killed an Islamic Jihad militant it said was laying explosives along the border.Speaking to Israel’s Army Radio on Monday, Netanyahu said he’d conveyed a message to Hamas that if it did not stop Gaza militants behind the attacks, Israel would target Hamas directly.“If you don’t shoot them, we will shoot you. I’m talking about a war,” he said. “I only go to war as a last option but we have prepared something you can’t even imagine.”Netanyahu’s interview was interrupted with news of fresh air raid sirens warning of incoming rockets, as Palestinian militant fire resumed midday after a morning lull. The Israeli military said it identified 14 rockets fired in the hour-long spree, of which it intercepted 12. Shortly after, the military began striking sites linked to militants in Gaza.The United Nations’ Mideast envoy Nickolay Mladenov called on Twitter for “an IMMEDIATE stop to the firing of rockets that only risks dragging Gaza into another destructive round of hostilities with no end in sight!”The Islamic Jihad militant group fired at least 20 rockets on Sunday after Israeli forces killed a Palestinian militant who tried to place a bomb along the Israel-Gaza barrier fence, and then removed his body with a bulldozer. The image outraged Palestinians, leading to the rocket fire. Israel responded by striking targets linked to militants in Gaza and Syria. As a precaution, schools were closed in Israeli areas adjacent to Gaza and restrictions placed on outdoor public gatherings.Israel and Hamas have engaged in three wars between 2008 and 2014 and several intense rounds of violence after that. Israel and the Islamic Jihad group engaged in a heavy round of fighting last November after the Israeli military killed a top Islamic Jihad commander. Since then, Israel and Gaza’s more powerful Hamas group have been working through Egyptian mediators to cement an informal cease-fire. But Islamic Jihad has continued to try to carry out attacks.The sudden exchanges after months of relative calm put Israel’s tense security situation back on the agenda a week before the the country’s third election in less than a year. The campaign has thus far largely focused on domestic issues and Netanyahu’s precarious legal situation after he was indicted on corruption charges.Despite the tough talk and a typical preference to highlight his national security credentials, Netanyahu appears to have little appetite for a major confrontation as he fights for re-election.“Israel didn’t seek escalation in Gaza. On the contrary, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu entered the crucial stage of the battle for his political life, it seems the last thing he needed was a violent eruption in the strip,” wrote Amos Harel, the military affairs commentator for the Haaretz daily. “An uncontrolled upsurge at this time could actually hurt Netanyahu’s chances more than it would help him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-fighting-to-stop-as-islamic-jihad-announces-end-of-cease-fire/story-ghiQR9HiFd89mneGvrdZVK.html

One report indicated it was due to harsh sun beating down on that part of the stadium.Some reports questioned if the visit was high on hype and optics and low on substance, a reference to continuing uncertainty about whether or not a trade will be announced when the two sides hold meetings in New Delhi on Tuesday. But chances appeared bleak, as the president himself indicated in his remarks at the Motera rally, at which he highlighted, instead, the more than $3 billion in defense deals lined up for announcement.Politico noted President Trump’s protectionism under America First had found a match in India.The president’s arrival in Ahmedabad was way too late for print editions of major dailies because of the time differences, and so were the rest of schedule, the Sabarmati Ashram visit and the stop over in Agra to see the Taj. But their websites, kept up the reporting, and prominently on their home-page.“Inside the stadium, cheering crowds prepare Trump,” ran a headline on a Washington Post report on the wait before the big address, at around 2:30 am (US eastern, 1:00 pm in India). And the story was updated frequently: “Trump says Namaste (Hello) India”, “Trump visits the Taj Mahal: ‘Truly incredible’”.The size of the rally was also noted. The Wall Street Journal ran an updated comprehensive article under a headline that said it upfront: “Trump Kicks Off Two-Day India Visit With Massive Rally”. Breitbart went with “Donald Trump Addresses Roaring Crowd of over 100,000 People in India at ‘Namaste Trump’ Rally.Modi had been effusive in his praise of Trump, and Trump more than reciprocated. The relations between the two leaders was widely noted, as it has been since Modi embraced Trump, a renowned germophobe, at their first meeting in the White House in 2017. It was a hug in Ahmedabad as Trump arrived.US media also reported the president’s struggles with Hindi, local words and names — Sachin Tendulkar came out “Suchin”, for instance. The New York Times reported, disapprovingly, “But even as he name-checked famous cricket players and Bollywood stars, Mr. Trump betrayed unfamiliarity with the country — and even his immediate location — when he stumbled over several pronunciations, including those of Ahmedabad itself, as well as Gujarat, the state it anchors and Mr. Modi’s political home base.”But as Monday progressed, US media had moved on to the spread of the Coronavirus virus and its impact on stocks.President Trump had moved on himself, at least for the day. His last few posts on twitter were retweets of posts highlighting achievements of his administration, with an eye on his re-election bid in November. Tuesday, however, the visit will be back at the top of his agenda, with meetings and ceremonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/motera-event-sachin-s-name-how-us-media-covered-day-1-of-trump-s-india-visit/story-ZqyZcQVJeLh8nsMgKHfT5O.html

Our teams are at the scene and an assessment is underway,” a spokeswoman for the regional health agency told AFP.Low-cost operator FlixBus said the bus, destined for the central city of Clermont-Ferrand, had stopped off in the Italian city of Turin and Grenoble in France on the way to Lyon.A couple that boarded the bus in Lyon told AFP they were kept inside for over two hours before being allowed disembark after they were checked by doctors.They said they were told they would be contacted again if the driver, who was taken to hospital for tests, turned out to be carrying the virus.By around 1:00 pm (1200 GMT), all passengers -- who were issued with face masks -- had been allowed off the bus, an AFP reporter at the scene said.Milan is the capital of the Lombardy region at the centre of Europe’s biggest outbreak of the coronavirus that has killed nearly 2,600 people worldwide.Five people have died from the disease in Italy, where several northern villages are under lockdown.In a sign of the nervousness triggered by the global spread of the virus, a Paris police station was closed to the public for several hours Monday after a Chinese woman became unwell on the premises.The station in the 13th district, home to the French capital’s Asian quarter, reopened after the woman tested negative for the COVID-19 virus, a police source told AFP.In France, one person -- an elderly Chinese tourist -- has died from the virus.Eleven have been hospitalised, of whom 10 have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-italian-bus-passengers-blocked-in-france-over-covid-19-scare/story-28W00BrQg7gLr5CeAu6G2L.html
24-02-2020||World||WHO lauds China’s efforts to tackle covid-19, says global community unprepared to face threat||China’s bold actions in the coronavirus epidemic epicentre of Hubei and Wuhan have probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, Bruce Aylward, leader of the WHO delegation here said on Monday, adding, that the global community was not ready with either the mindset or material to act in the same way.Aylward’s statement at a press conference in Beijing comes in the backdrop of an increasing number of covid-19 cases and deaths in Italy, South Korea and Iran amid the fear that the epidemic could escalate into a pandemic.First infections were also reported from Kuwait, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Iraq and Oman on Monday.The virus is new but it is capable of causing great impact on public health, the economy, and society, Alyward said, adding it is neither SARS nor the influenza.Explaining the global impact context, he said the fundamentals of what China did in Hubei and Guangdong in south China could be applied elsewhere.“This is a dangerous virus and we have to work with experience we have. And this (China) country has demonstrated its measures can work,” he said.Praising China for being the first line of defence, the WHO expert said other countries should consider similar action to be a second line of defense to prevent spread to low income countries with lower ability to fight itThe WHO expert sidestepped a question on the initial information on the outbreak in Wuhan being covered up.“Our purpose was to find what works. Awareness is a common problem in many outbreaks…We didn’t look at that factor. There were other factors we looked at as well. The most important is speed. What worries me is have other countries learned lessons from China’s experience. There is one other point. President Xi (Jinping) himself said mistakes were made. We need to address; there is a recognition that the human cost is unacceptable. We all have to look at our systems because none of them as fast enough,” he said.“This virus is sneaky and tricky. We needed to fight while we learned, while we improved. This is what we lacked in the early stages,” China’s national health commission’s (NHC) Liang Wanning said.Liang and Alyward were heading a 25-member joint WHO-China team that visited Wuhan, Beijing, Sichuan and Guangdong over the past week and submitted a 45-page report to the government on their findings on the outbreak.Liang said the rapid rise in covid-19 cases had been halted but the situation was still grim.“The situation in Wuhan is still severe. We are in a critical moment whether we can win this war. Severe and critical cases/confirmed cases, if they continue to drop, that would be good news,” Liang said.Outside Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the NHC started to publish nationwide daily figures on January 20.The coronavirus has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,500 in China, most of them in Hubei.Meanwhile, China on Monday – in a rare decision --- officially delayed the Two Sessions, the country’s annual Parliament and biggest political event, because of the outbreak and further restricted the trading and consumption of wild animal meat.New dates for the Parliament session will be announced later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-lauds-china-s-efforts-to-tackle-covid-19-says-global-community-unprepared-to-face-coronavirus-threat/story-zzOQaBAEKo9MI0Na2p5HbM.html

Several cities in western Germany canceled their traditional Carnival parades at short notice on Sunday because of inclement weather.Volkmarsen, which has a population of 7,000, is east of Duesseldorf, near Kassel.Police shut down the area to allow emergency crews to deal with the crash. Police said they couldn’t immediately provide further details and urged people not to spread “unconfirmed reports” about the crash.Police say they haven’t received any reports of any deaths, and don’t have a specific number of injuries yet. They say it is too early to say what caused the car to crash into the crowd.The regional Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported that witnesses said the driver drove around a barrier blocking off traffic from the parade, but that it wasn’t yet clear whether he intentionally headed toward the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-injured-as-car-drives-into-crowd-at-german-carnival/story-s5TSUD9rmfIa7ETmZWGnxJ.html

24-02-2020||World||US sets out case for extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange||The U.S. government began outlining its extradition case against Julian Assange in a London court on Monday, arguing that the WikiLeaks founder is not a free-speech champion but an “ordinary” criminal who put many lives at risk with his secret-spilling.U.S. authorities want to try Assange on espionage charges that carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison over the 2010 publication of hundreds of thousands of secret military documents and diplomatic cables.Lawyer James Lewis, representing the U.S. government, called it “one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States.”Dozens of Assange supporters protested noisily outside the high-security courthouse as District Judge Vanessa Baraitser began hearing the case.Assange, 48, watched from the dock at Woolwich Crown Court’s court number 2 —brought there from Belmarsh Prison next door, where he has been imprisoned for 10 months. He spoke to confirm his name and date ofbirth. He nodded towards reporters before taking his seat.The extradition hearing follows years of subterfuge, diplomatic dispute and legal drama that have led the 48-year-old Australian from fame as an international secret-spiller through self-imposed exile inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to incarceration in a maximum-security British prison.Assange has been indicted in the U.S. on 18 charges over the publication of classified documents. Prosecutors say he conspired with U.S. army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Lewis said U.S. authorities argue that WikiLeaks’ activities created a “grave and imminent risk” to U.S. intelligence sources and other people who were named in the documents.He said it was not the role of the British court to determine whether Assange was guilty.“This is an extradition hearing, not a trial,” he said. “The guilt or innocence of Mr. Assange will be determined at trial in the United States, not in this court.”Assange argues he was acting as a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection, and says the leaked documents exposed U.S. military wrongdoing. Among the files published by WikiLeaks was video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.But Lewis said Assange was guilty of “straightforward” criminal activity.“What Mr. Assange seeks to defend by free speech is not the publication of the classified materials, but he seeks to defend the publication of sources — the names of people who put themselves at risk to assist the U.S. and its allies,” the lawyer said.“Reporting or journalism is not an excuse for criminal activities or a license to break ordinary criminal laws.”Journalism organizations and civil liberties groups including Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders say the charges against Assange set a chilling precedent for freedom of the press.Assange’s legal saga began in 2010, when he was arrested in London at the request of Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. He refused to go to Stockholm, saying he feared extradition or illegal rendition to the United States or the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In 2012, Assange sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he was beyond the reach of U.K. and Swedish authorities.For seven years Assange led an isolated and increasingly surreal existence in the tiny embassy, which occupies an apartment in an upscale block near the ritzy Harrod’s department store. The relationship between Assange and his hosts eventually soured, and he was evicted in April 2019. British police immediately arrested him for jumping bail in 2012.Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November because so much time had elapsed, but Assange remains in London’s Belmarsh Prison as he awaits a decision on the U.S. extradition request.For his supporters around the world, Assange remains a hero. But many others are critical of the way WikiLeaks has published classified documents without redacting details that could endanger individuals. WikiLeaks has also been accused of serving as a conduit for Russian misinformation, and Assange has alienated some supporters by dallying with populist politicians including Brexit-promoter Nigel Farage.An end to the saga could still be years away. After a week of opening arguments, the extradition case is due to break until May, when the two sides will lay out their evidence. The judge is not expected to rule until several months after that, with the losing side likely to appeal.If the courts approve extradition, the British government will have the final say.The case comes at delicate time for transatlantic relations. The U.K. has left the European Union and is keen to strike a trade deal with the U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-out-case-for-extradition-of-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange/story-tMom8UMySv5aXFe8Z8n5eN.html

24-02-2020||World||German Carnival floats feature satirical commentary on racism in wake of recent attacks||Biting commentary on racism in Germany featured prominently Monday among Carnival floats in western cities, hastily put together in the aftermath of a deadly far-right attack last week near Frankfurt.The floats for parades in Cologne, Duesseldorf, Mainz and elsewhere are notorious for their no-holds-barred satire, and also took aim at Brexit, the potential candidates to take over leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party, and U.S. President Donald Trump. One even featured a clown-like figure labeled “Carnival-Virus” thumbing its nose at an evil looking “Corona-Virus” creature.Last Wednesday, a 43-year-old German man who had posted a racist screed online advocating genocide gunned down nine people of foreign background in the Frankfurt suburb of Hanau, before apparently killing himself and his mother.It was the latest in a string of far-right attacks in Germany and many have pointed the finger at the Alternative for Germany party, suggesting its nationalist anti-migrant rhetoric has helped create the climate for violence.One Duesseldorf float depicted a red-faced man yelling in rage, a pistol protruding from his mouth with the word “racism” on the barrel. On the side was the slogan “from words come deeds” and a list of the attacks, including Hanau.In Cologne, a somber float depicted a weeping Carnival jester holding a heart with the slogan “our heart beats for Hanau.”Another Duesseldorf float featured Alternative for Germany regional leader Bjoern Hoecke, who called Berlin’s memorial to the victims of the Nazi Holocaust a “monument of shame,” giving a Nazi salute, with his outstretched arm being held up by figures from Merkel’s CDU party and the pro-business FDP.Festivities in several cities were called off Sunday due to high winds but the Monday parades were expected to go ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-carnival-floats-feature-satirical-commentary-on-racism-in-wake-of-recent-attacks/story-APF67yQoVJFmOSgn0w52RI.html

Iran, however, first officially reported cases of the virus and its first deaths on Feb. 19.The new coronavirus originated in China sometime around December. There are concerns that clusters in Iran, as well as in Italy and South Korea, could signal a serious new stage in its global spread.A top World Health Official expressed concerns Monday over the virus’ spread. “We are worried about the situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in Italy,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Stockholm via a video link.Authorities in Iran have closed schools across much of the country for a second day and as neighbouring countries reported infections from travellers from Iran, prompting several to shut their borders to Iranian citizens.The number of deaths compared to the number of confirmed infections from the virus is higher in Iran than in any other country, including China and South Korea, where the outbreak is far more widespread.Iranian health officials have not said whether health workers in Qom who first came in contact with infected people had taken precautionary measures in treating those who died of the virus. Iran also has not said how many people are in quarantine across the country overall.Kuwait announced on Monday its first cases of the virus, saying that three travellers returning from the northeastern city of Mashhad, Iran were confirmed infected with the coronavirus.Iran, however, has not yet reported any confirmed cases of the virus in Mashhad, raising questions about how the government is carrying out tests and quarantines.Iran has confirmed cases so far in five cities, including the capital, Tehran. A local mayor in Tehran is among those infected and in quarantine.Kuwait has been evacuating some 750 citizens from Iran and testing them as they enter the country after saying that Iran had barred its medical workers from testing travelers at an exit terminal in Iran, despite an agreement to do so.The three returning from Iran to Kuwait who were infected with the virus are being treated in Kuwait and were identified as a Kuwaiti male, 53, a Saudi male, 61, and the third was not identified except as a 21-year-old. The news was reported by the Kuwait News Agency quoting the Kuwait Health Ministry.Iranian travellers with the virus have also been confirmed in Canada, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.The outbreak in Iran has centered mostly on the city of Qom, but spread rapidly over the past few days as Iranians went to the polls on Friday for nationwide parliamentary elections, with many voters wearing masks and stocking up on hand sanitizer.Iran is already facing diplomatic and economic isolation under U.S. pressure. The virus threatens to isolate Iran even further as countries shut their borders to Iranians.Soccer fans across the country will not be allowed to attend matches, and shows in movie theatres and other venues were suspended until Friday. Authorities have begun daily sanitization of Tehran’s metro, which is used by some 3 million people, and public transportation cars in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-from-coronavirus-in-qom-is-at-50-says-iran-news-agency/story-rsmlV3lqTu1pmi53YKYuHO.html
24-02-2020||World||World shares smacked as new coronavirus cases surge outside China||Shares skidded, oil prices sank and the price of gold surged on Monday as the number of people infected or killed by the viral outbreak that began in China surged, heaping more uncertainty on the economic outlook.The decline followed a sell-off Friday on Wall Street and a weekend meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, of finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the Group of 20 major industrial economies where officials warned the outbreak that began in China is threatening to derail world growth.Britain’s FTSE 100 sank 2.7% to 7,203.77, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 3% to 5,850.92. Germany’s DAX fell 2.9% to 13,188.98. New York markets looked set for a downbeat start, with the future for the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.9% while the S&P 500 future lost 2.1%.The price of gold, viewed as a safe haven in times of peril, jumped $33.70 to $1,682.40 per ounce.Uncertainties are weighing on energy prices as well. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.64, or 3.1%, to $51.74 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 50 cents to $53.38 per barrel on Friday.Brent crude, the international standard, gave up $1.87, or 3.3%, to $56.08 per barrel.South Korea reported another large leap in new cases on Monday, a day after the president called for “unprecedented, powerful” steps to combat the outbreak that is increasingly confounding attempts to stop the spread.The 70 latest new cases raised South Korea’s total to 833, and two more deaths raised its toll to seven. The latest updates sparked selling of shares, pulling the benchmark Kospi 3.9% lower to 2,079.04,The viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 79,000 people globally and killed more than 2,600 people. China has reported 2,592 deaths among 77,150 cases on the mainland.Meanwhile, China cancelled its annual legislative session, usually held in early March, as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus.Travel restrictions, business closures and other efforts in China aimed at containing the spread of the virus have begun to disrupt supply chains and sales prospects for Apple and other big companies.Earlier Monday, officials in Beijing promised more help for companies and the economy, saying they expect their growth targets can still be reached despite the outbreak.At a news conference Monday, finance and planning officials said they are looking at how to channel aid to businesses after President Xi Jinping publicly promised over the past week to ensure farming and other industries recover quickly.The government is looking at “targeted tax reduction,” interest rate cuts and payments to poor and virus-hit areas, said an assistant finance minister, Ou Wenhan. “We will do a good job of implementing large-scale interest rate reduction and tax deferral and ensure effective implementation as soon as possible,” he said.The latest measures failed to lift the Shanghai Composite, which lost 0.3% to 3,031.23, though the smaller Shenzhen A-share market jumped 1.4%.Elsewhere in the region, the S&P ASX/200 in Sydney lost 2.3% to 6,978.30. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.8% to 26,820.88 and Thailand’s SET index lost 2.5%. India’s Sensex lost 1.2% to 40,689.12. Benchmarks in Jakarta, Taiwan and Singapore fell by more than 1%.Japan’s markets were closed for a holiday.Hopes that the outbreak had been contained were premature, Mizuho Bank said in a commentary, “And indeed, fears of secondary infections proliferating outside of China have come home to roost, sending risk assets in a tail-spin and a wave of refuge-seeking into safe-haven.”The yield on the 30-year Treasury has dipped to record lows as investors sought the safety of U.S. government bonds. It fell to a record low of 1.886%, according to Tradeweb, from 1.98% late Thursday.The yield on the more closely followed 10-year Treasury was at 1.38%. That yield, which is a benchmark for mortgages and other kinds of loans, was close to 1.90% at the start of this year.Expectations have been building among traders that the Federal Reserve will need to cut interest rates this year to help the economy. They’re pricing in a 90% probability of at least one cut this year, up from an 85% probability a day ago and a 58% probability a month ago.In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 111.36 Japanese yen from 111.57 yen on Friday. The euro weakened to $1.0825 from $1.0847.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-shares-smacked-as-new-coronavirus-cases-surge-outside-china/story-TsaS2SDL89zUhAXy0KiM0K.html
24-02-2020||World||Covid-19 death toll rises to 50 in Qom, Iran||A staggering 50 people have died in the Iranian city of Qom from the new coronavirus this month, Iran’s semiofficial ILNA news agency reported on Monday.The new death toll is significantly higher than the latest number of confirmed cases of infections that Iranian officials had reported just a few hours earlier and which stood at just 12 deaths out of 47 cases, according to state TV.A lawmaker from Qom, Ahmad Amiriabadi Farahani, was quoted in ILNA saying that more than 250 people are in quarantined in the city, which is a popular place of religious study for Shiites from across Iran and other countries.He said the 50 deaths date as far back as Feb. 13. Iran, however, first officially reported cases of the virus and its first deaths on Feb. 19.Speaking to ILNA, Farahani said the situation in Qom is “not good”.“I think performance of the administration in controlling the virus has not been successful,” he said, referring to the government of President Hassan Rouhani.“None of the nurses have access to proper protective gears,” Farahani said, adding that some health care specialists had left the city. “So far, I have seen any particular action to confront corona by the administration.”The new coronavirus originated in China sometime around December. There are concerns that clusters in Iran, as well as in Italy and South Korea, could signal a serious new stage in its global spread.Authorities in Iran have closed schools across much of the country for a second day and as neighboring countries reported infections from travelers from Iran, prompting several to shut their borders to Iranian citizens.The number of deaths compared to the number of confirmed infections from the virus is higher in Iran than in any other country as compared to the ratios in China and South Korea, where the outbreak is far more widespread.Iranian health officials have not whether health workers in Qom who first came in contact with infected people had taken precautionary measures in treating those who died of the virus.

24-02-2020||World||Turmoil in Malaysia as PM Mahathir Mohamad submits resignation||Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, at 94 the world’s oldest leader, submitted his resignation to the king Monday after a bid by his allies to bring down the government and block the succession of leader-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim.The shock move followed 24 hours of political drama which saw an attempt by Anwar Ibrahim’s rivals within his own “Pact of Hope” coalition, which stormed to a historic election victory in 2018, and opposition politicians to form a new government.The coalition would reportedly have excluded Anwar, Mahathir’s presumptive successor, and most of the lawmakers from his party, which would have stopped him becoming premier any time soon.Anwar and Mahathir have a notoriously stormy relationship but they reconciled ahead of the 2018 polls, and Mahathir has repeatedly promised to hand over power to his former foe.The bid appeared to have fizzled out by early Monday, however -- before Mahathir’s office announced he had “sent a resignation letter as prime minister of Malaysia” to the king at 1:00 pm.What would happen next was far from clear, however.Anwar was due to meet the king Monday afternoon. While the monarch’s role is largely ceremonial, he confirms the appointment of the country’s prime minister and Anwar could be hoping to persuade him that he has enough support from MPs to form a government, observers said.However, Mahathir’s party Bersatu also announced it was leaving the “Pact of Hope” coalition -- suggesting they could be making their own attempt to form a government.Earlier, two of Anwar’s rivals from his People’s Justice Party, Mohamed Azmin Ali and Zuraida Kamaruddin -- seen as key figures in leading the bid to form a new government and block his ascent -- were sacked, the party announced.Ethnic tensionsAnwar had teamed up with former nemesis Mahathir ahead of the 2018 elections to oust the government of Najib Razak, who had become embroiled in the massive 1MDB graft scandal.They led an alliance to an unexpected victory against a coalition that had ruled Malaysia uninterrupted for over six decades, and Mahathir agreed to eventually hand power to Anwar.But Mahathir, in his second stint as premier after first holding the role from 1981 to 2003, has repeatedly refused to say when he will transfer power, stoking tensions within the four-party coalition.The alliance’s popularity had plummeted as it was accused of failing to raise living standards and protect the rights of the ethnic Malay Muslim majority, and it lost a string of local polls.According to reports, the proposed new government aimed at blocking Anwar would have included Mahathir’s party, the United Malays National Organisation -- the party of scandal-tainted ex-leader Najib -- and a hardline Islamist group.Many were angry, however, that the democratically elected government, which came to power partly on a pledge to push through much-needed reforms, could be replaced without an election.The people “will not agree to or cooperate with any ‘backdoor’ government formed out of the selfish, self-preservation agenda of certain MPs”, said a statement from a group of leading activists and academics.Some called for a snap poll, although politicians appeared to be trying to form a new government without holding an election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turmoil-in-malaysia-as-pm-mahathir-mohamad-submits-resignation/story-7kssTabmxx4dkfySTDdUGO.html
24-02-2020||World||South Korea, the biggest coronavirus hotspot outside China||The deadly coronavirus epidemic spread further outside China on Monday as a surge of infections in South Korea made it the biggest hotspot abroad, while authorities in Europe and the Middle East battled to curb outbreaks.The number of fatalities in China also continued to soar, with 150 more confirmed deaths taking the official death toll to nearly 2,600.Chinese authorities insist they are making progress in containing the virus, citing slowing infection rates thanks to unprecedented travel lockdowns and quarantines in or near the outbreak’s epicentre. But a rising number of new cases and deaths in other parts of the world have deepened fears about a potential pandemic, with South Korea, Italy and Iran emerging over the past week on the frontlines.South Korea has seen a rapid surge in infections since a cluster emerged from a religious sect in the southern city of Daegu last week.Another 161 infections and two more deaths were reported in South Korea on Monday, bringing the total cases to more than 700 people -- the most outside China.South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Sunday raised the country’s virus alert to the highest “red” level, to strengthen the government response to the spiralling outbreak. The government has extended kindergarten and school holidays by one week nationwide and plans to enforce tighter two-week monitoring of arrivals from China.- Football, fashion curbed -In Italy, several Serie A football games were postponed, the Venice Carnival was cut short and some runway shows were cancelled at Milan Fashion Week as new cases erupted in the country.Most cases are confined to the northern town of Codogno, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) southeast of Milan. An elderly cancer patient became the third person known to be infected with the coronavirus to die in Italy, where more than 150 people have contracted the COVID-19 illness.More than 50,000 people in about a dozen northern Italian towns have been told to stay home, and police set up checkpoints to enforce a blockade.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged people “not to give in to panic and follow the advice of health authorities”.In Iran, authorities ordered the closure of schools, universities and cultural centres across 14 provinces following eight deaths -- the most outside East Asia.The outbreak in the Islamic Republic surfaced on Wednesday last week and quickly grew to 43 confirmed infections, prompting neighbouring countries to close their borders.In total outside China, nearly 30 people have been confirmed killed with more than 1,500 infections in at least two dozen countries.In China, the confirmed death toll stood at 2,592 on Monday after 150 more people died of the virus.The number of confirmed new cases fell compared with the previous day to 409, taking the country’s total infections over 77,000.- Economic toll -The virus is taking an increasingly heavy toll on the global economy, with many factories in China closed or subdued due to quarantines, and global travel choked.Stock markets in Asia fell on Monday following the surge in infections in South Korea and weekend developments across Europe and the Middle East.“While the coronavirus is probably slowing in China, it is speeding up elsewhere,” said Charles Gillams, at RJMG Asset Management. The International Monetary Fund warned Sunday that the epidemic was putting a “fragile” global economic recovery at risk.G20 financial chiefs also voiced concern about its ripple effects around the world.Chinese President Xi Jinping acknowledged Sunday that it the virus had become the country’s “largest public health emergency” since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949.“This is a crisis for us and it is a big test,” Xi said in comments reported by state television.Officials are expected to decide Monday whether to postpone China’s annual parliament meeting for the first time since the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-the-biggest-coronavirus-hotspot-outside-china/story-ZpVXLxBDMFmeDLXlDs31PJ.html
24-02-2020||World||China may postpone parliament for the first time amid coronavirus outbreak||China is expected to decide Monday whether to postpone its annual parliament session for the first time since the Cultural Revolution as the country battles the coronavirus outbreak.Top Communist Party leaders including President Xi Jinping attend each year’s gathering of the National People’s Congress, which rubber-stamps bills, budgets and personnel moves already decided by the party.But much of China has ground to a halt in the battle against an outbreak that has infected nearly 80,000 people and claimed more than 2,500 lives.Many top officials who would normally attend the meeting are consumed with tackling the virus in their home regions.And Beijing has imposed quarantine measures on those arriving from other parts of China, a practical challenge for a gathering of nearly 3,000 delegates.Then there are the bad optics of China’s leaders arriving in face masks for a meeting that is highly stage-managed to present the image of a Communist Party in perfect control of the country. The NPC’s Standing Committee meets on Monday to discuss whether to delay the session, which was due to start on March 5.Ling Li, a lecturer on Chinese politics at the University of Vienna, said postponement was “very likely”.“If the situation is not significantly improved by Monday, then a decision not to postpone the NPC conference would be unreasonable and signal a desperate effort of the authorities to keep up the appearance of political normality, which is not there,” she said.- Rubber stamp -The gathering is used to portray the government as answerable to the people’s representatives, but its deliberations are predetermined well in advance and the whole event is tightly choreographed by the Communist Party.Nevertheless, it generates global interest as a glimpse into China’s political and economic policy priorities for the coming year.Despite its highly choreographed nature, the NPC meeting can still herald important changes.The 2018 session approved the removal of presidential term limits -- handing Xi a potentially lifelong tenure.With Mao Zedong as the meeting’s chair, the NPC first convened in September 1954 in Beijing, where delegates passed the new constitution of the People’s Republic of China, five years after its founding.The legislature met almost every year after that for the next decade, but paused during the decade of political turmoil ushered in by Mao’s Cultural Revolution.It reconvened in 1978, two years after Mao’s death.Since 1985, it has been held each March -- and on March 5 specifically for the last two decades.But everyday life has been paralysed by the virus and unprecedented measures to contain it, including the lockdown of tens of millions of people at the epicentre in central Hubei province.Zang Tiewei, a spokesman for the legislative affairs commission of the NPC Standing Committee, told state-controlled news agency Xinhua that delaying the yearly political event was “necessary” to ensure “attention is focused on the prevention and control of the epidemic.”Dorothy Solinger, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of California at Irvine, said it would be a “smart move to postpone.”“Look at the message that sends,” she said. “We (the government) are putting all our effort into combatting the virus. We don’t have the time to hold these meetings now.”The virus also deeply impacts some of the session’s most hallowed rituals, she said.“How could they present the mandatory NPC upbeat accounts of the progress and positive prognosis of the economy and other achievements in the midst of such uncertainty as they’re facing now?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-postpone-parliament-for-the-first-time-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/story-52wJsyK4Qq8IJSXUUFg6KN.html
24-02-2020||World||Air Force One: US President Donald Trump’s flying Oval Office||US President Donald Trump arrived in India on Monday on a two-day official visit. The President’s delegation, including wife Melania, daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner and several senior members of the US cabinet, reached Ahmedabad airport on the Air Force One, the highly customised Boeing 747-200B series aircraft which symbolises the US presidency.The presidential plane - it goes by the radio call sign of Air Force One when the president is on board - was once a Boeing 707 that had orange above and below the nose and “United States of America” painted on the sides in blocky, all-caps lettering.According to Boeing history, first lady Jacqueline Kennedy picked new colours for the plane used by her husband, President John F Kennedy. A swath of baby blue covers the nose and sweeps back along each side of the fuselage. The lettering was changed to a font inspired by the heading of the Declaration of Independence.Since the middle of the 20th century, it has been standard practice to refer to specific planes that are equipped to transport the US President, according to the White House. The Air Force designation for the aircraft is VC-25A and carries the tail codes 28,000 and 29,000.These planes are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war, and are modified with military avionics, advanced communications and a self-defence system.The plane is capable of refueling mid-air and has unlimited range so that it can carry the President wherever he needs to travel. The White House says that the onboard electronics are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and Air Force One is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre in the event of an attack on the United States.It also gives the US President and his entourage a floor space of 4,000 square feet spread over three floor, including an “Oval Office” for the President, a presidential suite and conference room. The plane also includes a medical suite and a doctor is permanently onboard.Air Force One is maintained and operated by the Presidential Airlift Group, part of the White House Military Office.Trump reached an agreement with the Boeing Co in 2018 to provide two Air Force One planes for $3.9 billion. He later told CBS in an interview that the new model Air Force One would be updated on the inside and have a different exterior colour scheme from the current white and two shades of blue dating back to President Kennedy’s administration.“Red, white and blue,” Trump said. “Air Force One is going to be incredible. It’s going to be the top of the line, the top in the world. And it’s going to be red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-visit-all-you-need-to-know-about-air-force-one-us-president-s-flying-white-house/story-XHrAdmpQ540SHw15hXpqcK.html
