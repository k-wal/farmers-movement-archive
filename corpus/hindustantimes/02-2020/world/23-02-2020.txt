The woman had been in hospital in Crema, located in Lombardy, where most cases of infections have been reported. “She had been hospitalised for a few days,” Giulio Gallera, Lombardy’s health chief, said during a news conference. “She’d been tested and they already knew she had the coronavirus.”The head of Italy’s civil protection department, Angelo Borrelli, said 152 people had now tested positive for the virus, including the three deceased. Italy became the first country in Europe to announce a death from coronavirus on Friday, when a 78-year-old man died in the region of Veneto. A 77-year-old woman died in Lombardy on Saturday, prompting new security measures by Italy’s government to contain the spread of infection. Eleven towns -- 10 in Lombardy and 1 in Veneto -- are now under lockdown, with residents prohibited from leaving. Regional authorities have cancelled public events such as sporting matches, and instructed schools to remain shuttered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-third-covid-19-related-death-reported-in-italy-official/story-vVNW273ZPebB5KhodrO1eN.html
23-02-2020||World||Sanders wins Nevada, consolidates position at top of Democratic White House race||Senator Bernie Sanders posted an emphatic win in Nevada state Saturday consolidating his status as the front runner in Democratic nominating contests, with former Vice-President Joe Biden finishing a distant second.The win in Nevada was crucial as it is racially and ethnically more diverse than the predominantly white Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the nominating context that he tied and narrowly won. It demonstrated Sander’s expanding base and appeal, which will severely tested in coming races.“We are bringing our people together,” Sanders said in a victory speech. “In Nevada we have just brought together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition which is not only going to win in Nevada, it’s going to sweep this country.”Next up is South Carolina, a state that is predominantly African American, and which has been nursed by Biden as his firewall. The former vice-president has polled very well among the community in the state and outside and is expecting to win here to turn around his fortunes. Loyally serving President Barack Obama as his vice-president for two terms has a lot to do with it, and Biden has built on it by embracing his former boss’s legacy; minus the warts, critics have pointed out.But the big prize for the candidates is the Super Tuesday primaries of March, when 14 states hold their primaries and caucuses, with the largest trove of delegates up for grabs. The race for delegates, every state sends a certain number of delegates who will elect the nominee at the party’s presidential convention in the summer, more than the popular votes, which none of the candidates appear in a position to win, according to experts and pundits.And billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who has been surging in polls based on an estimated $400 million he has spent on ads, is waiting to make an impact. He has skipped all other nominating contests until then, as part of an unorthodox poll strategy, and focussed on the Super Tuesday states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanders-wins-nevada-consolidates-position-at-top-of-democratic-white-house-race/story-7DBIFEkRyw2krlWADrHYUK.html
23-02-2020||World||20 Palestinian rockets fired towards Israel after Gaza border clash||Palestinian militants fired some 20 rockets toward southern Israel on Sunday, hours after Israel said it killed a Palestinian militant who tried to place a bomb along the Israel-Gaza barrier fence.There was no immediate claim for the rocket fire, but it appeared to be meant to avenge the death of the militant. Palestinians were furious over the image of the man’s lifeless body dangling off the front of an Israeli bulldozer that had crossed into Gaza to retrieve it. It also drew criticism for the territory’s Hamas rulers for not responding. Israel said another Palestinian militant was shot and wounded in the clash.The Israeli military reported air raid sirens throughout southern Israel, and said at least 20 rockets had been fired. There were no reports of damage or injuries on the Israeli side, but it was the heaviest barrage of rocket fire in several months.Israel and the Islamic Jihad group engaged in a heavy round of fighting last November after the Israeli military killed a top Islamic Jihad commander.Since then, Israel and the more powerful Hamas group have been working through Egyptian mediators to cement an informal cease-fire. But Islamic Jihad has continued to try to carry out attacks.Islamic Jihad said a man killed in boundary fence clashes was a militant.Shortly afterward, amateur video on Palestinian social media showed an Israeli bulldozer crossing into Gaza and then lifting up the body of the militant.Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the Hamas militant group, accused the Israeli military of abusing the corpse, saying that it “bears the consequences of the ugly crime.”The military said it was removing the body in a way that prevented further danger to those around.But the images generated widespread anger in Gaza, where it was seen as a provocation and violation of Islamic principles that call for respect for the dead.It also sparked criticism of Hamas on social media, with people accusing the group of appearing weak and allowing Israel to operate with impunity inside Gaza’s territory. One image on social media showed a picture of Jesus draped with a Palestinian flag hanging off the front of a bulldozer.Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett rejected the criticism, noting that Hamas has been holding the bodies of two Israeli soldiers since they were killed in the 2014 Gaza war.“I back the military, which killed the terrorists and collected the body,” he said. “That’s what should be done and that is what was done.”The incident comes amid a relative lull along the security fence separating Israel from Gaza. Last week, Israel announced it would provide hundreds of additional work permits for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in a new step aimed at solidifying an informal cease-fire with the Hamas.Tens of thousands of Gazans used to work in Israel. But Israel virtually sealed the border when it joined Egypt in imposing a crippling blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. The blockade, along with three wars between Hamas and Israel, has devastated the economy in Gaza, where unemployment is over 50%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-palestinian-rockets-fired-towards-israel-after-gaza-border-clash/story-HBxIapldP2l8f2mM0P2XPJ.html
23-02-2020||World||Some Democrats worry after Bernie Sander’s big win in Nevada||Bernie Sanders’ landslide victory in Nevada’s Democratic nominating contest has scattered his moderate challengers and injected his White House campaign with a fresh burst of momentum as he drives into the next crucial battlegrounds.With his strong result Saturday, the Vermont senator demonstrated an ability to broaden a coalition beyond the narrow limits of leftist voters, undercutting the argument from several moderates that he would not be able to bridge the divide between progressives and centrists.“He showed last night that he can energize our core base,” Howard Dean, a former presidential aspirant himself and former head of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN.By early Sunday, Sanders was comfortably ahead in Nevada with 60 percent of precincts reporting.The 78-year-old senator was leading the Democratic pack with 46 percent of the vote, followed far behind by former vice president Joe Biden at 19.6 percent and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at 15.3 percent.Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar trailed at, respectively, 10.1 percent and 4.8 percent.- ‘Incredibly impressive’ -Sanders was quick to claim victory, saying his “multi-generational, multi-racial coalition” was “going to sweep this country.”Dean said the senator’s result in a state far more typical of America’s demographic variety than the two earlier-voting states was “incredibly impressive.”But he quickly added that a more definitive result will come only after voters in 14 states cast ballots on March 3, or “Super Tuesday.”Before that comes South Carolina, which votes on February 29.Biden’s once-strong prospects had faded sharply for weeks, but he said Saturday that he felt “really good” about his second-place showing in Nevada and shouldn’t be counted out. His team is banking on a strong showing in South Carolina, where Biden has enjoyed support among a majority-black Democratic electorate. But after Sanders came in virtually tied for first in Iowa and then won last week in New Hampshire, his undeniable victory in Nevada places him squarely in the driver’s seat, at least for now.He leads national polls by an 11 point margin over Biden and by 13 points over Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who skipped the early voting states to focus on Super Tuesday. - Some Democrats worry -Sanders’s progressive policies, including universal health care, higher taxes on the wealthy and an increase in the minimum wage, have struck a chord with millions of Americans.But they have raised alarm among some Democrats that he will make an easy target for President Donald Trump as a radical leftist, and that if he heads the Democratic ticket in November the party could face sweeping losses.Trump on Saturday issued a sarcastic-sounding congratulations on Twitter to the man he calls “Crazy Bernie.” Asked if the Democrats’ majority in the House of Representatives might be threatened if Sanders turned out to be Trump’s rival in November, one powerful South Carolina Democrat said that it might.It “would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in,” said James Clyburn, the House Democratic whip.“In those districts, it’s going to be tough to hold onto these jobs if you have to make the case for accepting a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist.”Buttigieg, while congratulating Sanders on his Nevada victory, offered a stern warning against picking someone who he said sees “capitalism as the root of all evil” to go up against the populist president.Pressure seems certain to grow on some of the lower-polling Democratic moderates to withdraw to allow others to coalesce around a centrist who might fare better against Trump.Republican campaign advisor Mark McKinnon, speaking on CNN, predicted that the lower polling candidates will be flushed out of the race after Super Tuesday.But the centrist alternatives face steep challenges, he added: Bloomberg performed notably poorly in Wednesday’s Democratic debate, and “Biden does not have the resources.”Progressive candidate Elizabeth Warren, speaking late Saturday in Washington state, which votes March 10, vowed to stay in the race despite a third straight mediocre showing.She renewed her attacks on Bloomberg, accusing him of trying to “buy this election.”Bloomberg, co-founder of the Bloomberg LP media company, has plowed a record $438 million of personal funds into his campaign.McKinnon said, meantime, that if Sanders compiled a large enough lead after Super Tuesday it would make it hard for other Democrats to oppose his nomination at the national convention in July, even if he has not won a clear majority of delegates.“There’s something going on here that defies the conventional wisdom,” he said: a 78-year-old man attracting highly energized young voters.Sanders, he said, “is creating a passion among voters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-democrats-worry-after-bernie-sander-s-big-win-in-nevada/story-JYyNfla0nFVBMKCdm2s0NK.html
23-02-2020||World||Time for US troops to ‘come home’ from Afghanistan, says US President Trump||The Taliban in Afghanistan are tired of fighting and want to make a peace deal with the US, President Donald Trump said on Sunday as he left for his maiden visit to India during which the two countries will significantly ramp up the defence and strategic ties.Just before his departure for India, Trump told reporters at the White House that the time had come for the US troops to “come home”.The President said he would sign a peace deal with the Taliban if it worked out over the next week.“I want to see how this period of a week works out. If it works out over the next less-than-a-week, I would put my name on it,” he said.“Time to come home. The Taliban want to make a deal too. They’re tired of fighting,” he said.Trump’s remarks came a day after the US and the Afghan Taliban started a seven-day partial truce ahead of a possible peace deal to end more than 18-year-long war, raising hopes for a resolution to America’s longest war.The agreement struck during negotiations between the US and the Taliban, if maintained, may secure a peace deal that would lead to a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.In November, Trump announced the resumption of peace talks with the Taliban, but refused to give a timeline for the drawdown of the US troops from Afghanistan, as he made an unannounced visit to American soldiers stationed in the war-torn country.After nine rounds of negotiations with the Taliban, Trump announced in September that he was calling the peace talks off after a US service member was killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul.The US currently has less than 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, but military officials would not confirm the exact number.Trump is accompanied by First Lady Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and the top brass of his administration on his maiden visit to India.During his visit, the two countries are expect to significantly ramp up bilateral defence and strategic ties.The nearly 36-hour-long visit by Trump is also set to send across a clear message of growing congruence of interests on major geopolitical developments in the region and beyond, particularly when China has been expanding its military might and economic clout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-us-troops-to-come-home-from-afghanistan-says-us-president-trump/story-nfsY1rqmNAsQbLvZsDlF3O.html
23-02-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak ‘largest public health crisis’ since founding of China: Xi Jinping||Chinese President Xi Jinping has called the ongoing coronavirus epidemic the “largest public health emergency” since the founding of the country under Communist rule in 1949.The coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak has killed over 2,400 people, infected more than 77,000 and slowed down the world’s second largest economy in barely weeks since its severity was acknowledged and containment measures were implemented by Beijing in the third week of January.Hundreds of millions in China are currently facing restrictions on their movement in some way or the other across the country – the epicentre Hubei province is sealed off and under a lockdown.“This is a crisis for us and it is a big test,” he said at a meeting on Sunday.“The Covid-19 outbreak is a major public health emergency that spreads fastest, causes the most extensive infection, and is the most difficult to contain in the country since the founding of the People’s Republic of China,” Xi was quoted as saying by the official news agency, Xinhua.“The epidemic situation remains grim and complex and it is now a most crucial moment to curb the spread,” Xi said.Xi gave the speech during, what the state media called, an “unprecedented” meeting of the ruling Communist Party of China’s (CPC) top leadership including all members of the powerful seven-member CPC politburo’s standing committee.Thousands more provincial and local leaders were connected to the meeting via video conferencing.Xi’s statement comes in the backdrop of mounting fears of the virulent virus spreading rapidly in countries geographically apart like South Korea, Italy and Iran, which recorded its eighth death from the pathogen.Xi said it was necessary to learn from “obvious shortcomings exposed” during China’s response to the outbreak, which is said to have spread outwards from the Chinese central city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, the province worst hit by the epidemic.Xi said that the epidemic will “inevitably deal a relatively big blow to China’s economic and social development”.“In general, the fundamentals of China’s long-term sound economic growth remain unchanged,” Xi said.China has seen a slow return to work since an extended – forced by the escalating outbreak from Hubei to all provinces and regions in China -- Chinese New Year (CNY) break, as officials urged the public to avoid gatherings and stay at home.Those living in “low-risk areas” should return to regular life as soon as possible, Xi said, calling for new fiscal measures to help smaller businesses that have been hit hard by the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-largest-public-health-crisis-since-founding-of-china-xi-jinping/story-dKqdkGRC8Hqh5CXMefITMI.html
23-02-2020||World||Turkey to ‘temporarily’ close Iran border over fears of highly contagious Covid-19||Turkey on Sunday announced it would “temporarily” close its border with neighboring Iran as alarm grows over a spike in new coronavirus infections there.“We have decided to shut the land border temporarily after an increase in the number of cases in our neighbor Iran,” Health Minister Fahrettin Koca told reporters. The land and railway borders will be closed from 1700 (1400 GMT) on Sunday, the minister said. He said air traffic from Iran into Turkey would also be halted from 2000 (1700 GMT) on Sunday but departures to Iran could continue.Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan said exports from Turkey to Iran and transactions continued “in a controlled way”, in comments published by the official Anadolu news agency. Iran confirmed eight deaths from the novel coronavirus on Sunday, the highest toll of any country outside China. Koca said Turkey was “alarmed” by the growing number of cases and forced to take the measures after speaking with the Iranian authorities. There is not yet any confirmed incident in Turkey, with Koca saying that five suspicious cases treated in the Van province on the Iran border were negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-turkey-to-temporarily-close-iran-border-over-fears-of-highly-contagious-covid-19/story-jdog2DvhHNj7fTb9RC4tmN.html
23-02-2020||World||Mobile phone services restored in parts of Afghanistan on second day of partial truce||Mobile phone services were restored across swathes of Taliban-contested areas of Afghanistan over the weekend as a partial truce with the militants held for a second day.The Taliban, US and Afghan forces are currently overseeing a week-long “reduction in violence” that kicked off on Saturday. The commitment has seen fighting drop dramatically and is set to pave the way for an American withdrawal deal to be signed later this week. There have been reports of small clashes in rural areas, but no major attacks that have long defined the conflict have erupted. “In general we do see (a reduction in violence),” acting interior minister Masood Andrabi told AFP.The lull in violence allowed telecom operators to begin restoring networks across the country that have long been hampered by fighting. “Around 730 cell towers have restarted,” said Naqeebullah Sailab, vice chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Afghanistan.“There are towers which started operating after almost five years.”Two separate officials with knowledge of the country’s telecoms industry in northern Afghanistan also confirmed that mobile networks were being restored in insurgent-hit areas. The Taliban have long targeted Afghanistan’s private telecom firms, kidnapping engineers, destroying transmission masts and forcing regular coverage blackouts in volatile areas to avoid detection of their fighters.Afghanistan boasts millions of mobile users in a population of 30 million, with the fast-growing industry employing around 200,000 people and earning strong revenue in an otherwise moribund economy.Thousands of telecommunication towers, however, are in insurgency-hit areas and vulnerable to attacks.The partial truce is expected to set the conditions for Washington and the insurgents to sign a deal in Doha on February 29 that could, ultimately, pull US troops out after more than 18 years and launch war-weary Afghanistan into an uncertain future.A successful week would demonstrate that the Taliban have command and control of their forces, and it would also be a show of good faith before signing any deal.The partial truce has also given a much-needed respite to civilians who have borne the brunt of the gruesome war. The UN’s Afghanistan mission reported Saturday that more than 10,000 people had been killed or wounded in 2019 alone.As fighting eased across the country, Afghans took to the streets to enjoy the relative calm. In their southern stronghold of Helmand, Taliban fighters mingled with locals, small “peace” demonstrations took place across the country, and a bicycle race was held in the eastern city of Jalalabad. Washington has been in talks with the Taliban for more than a year to secure a deal which would see it would pull about half of the 12,000-13,000 troops currently in Afghanistan out.In return, the Taliban would give security guarantees and a promise to hold peace talks with the government in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mobile-phone-services-restored-in-parts-of-afghanistan-on-second-day-of-partial-truce/story-60OJNM3BQBrSUrQkHKMYDN.html
23-02-2020||World||People queue for food as Covid-19 related quarantine ensues in Italian towns||Tens of thousands of Italians prepared for a weeks-long quarantine in the country’s north on Sunday as nerves began to fray among the locals faced with new lockdown measures.Two people have died from the virus since Friday and more than a hundred cases have now been reported in Italy, most of them centred around the small town of Codogno, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) southeast of Milan. Over 50,000 residents in eleven towns -- 10 in Lombardy and one in the neighbouring region of Veneto -- now face what Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Saturday could be weeks of lockdown.Locals wearing face masks were already lined up outside a supermarket in the town of Casalpusterlengo, a 10 minute drive from Codogno, on Sunday morning.Shoppers were made to wait, then allowed to enter in groups of 40 inside the store to stock up on provisions.Although one woman in the crowd downplayed the virus, telling other shoppers it was “not fatal” if properly treated, others were less sanguine. “It’s inhuman,” said one man who gave his name as Sante. “Fighting over four sandwiches is just disgusting.” Another woman, Emanuela, told AFP-TV that residents including her were nervous. “I’m really scared, we’re going through a really tough situation,” said the woman, a nurse who works in the area. - Rising infections -Blockades were not yet erected, and cars could be seen driving in and around the area of Codogno and Casalpusterlengo, although police cars patrolled the area. It was not clear how authorities would impose the travel restrictions and whether residents would still be allowed to travel from town to town within the affected zones, without surpassing an outer limit.“We’re preparing to set up the checkpoints for the containment zone,” a policewoman told AFP, saying that initially the perimeter would be narrow but could widen over time. “We’re about ten criminal police teams here, so nothing related to this kind of situation, but we’ve been called in from Bologna, Turin and Genoa to give a hand,” she added. For now, the quarantine appears to be largely dependent on individuals to respect the system but the government said those found in violation could face fines and even three months in jail.The government has also said the army was prepared to step in if needed to enforce the perimeter. On Sunday, the head of the civil protection department, Angelo Borrelli, said during a press conference that thousands of beds were at the ready in military barracks or hotels to house quarantined or sick individuals, if needed. The number of those infected with the virus had now grown to 132, including the two people who died, Borrelli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-people-queue-for-food-as-covid-19-related-quarantine-ensues-in-italian-towns/story-MxsbH5HZ7L2kaSoAFmcpzJ.html
23-02-2020||World||Covid-19 death toll rises to 8 in Iran, infections to 43||Iran’s health ministry raised Sunday the death toll from the new virus to 8 people in the country, amid concerns that clusters there, as well as in Italy and South Korea, could signal a serious new stage in its global spread.There were now 43 confirmed cases of the illness in Iran, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told state TV.The outbreak in Iran has centered mostly on the city of Qom, but spread rapidly over the past few days to people in fourother cities, including the capital, Tehran.Across the country in 10 provinces, authorities shuttered schools for at least two days starting on Sunday, and Tehran University suspended classes and shuttered its dormitories for several days. Those who live in student dorms were asked to return to their home towns and continue classes through the internet where possible.Iran reported its first cases of the virus on Wednesday, announcing that same day that two people had died from the virus in Qom.Jahanpour said the 15 newly confirmed cases included 7 in Qom, four in Tehran, two in the northern Gilan province, one in the central Markazi province, and one from town of Tonekabon in the northern Mazandaran province, who died of the illness.Iran’s Health Minister Saeed Namaki told state TV that officials were nearly certain the virus came from China to Qom in central Iran. He also said that among those who’ve died from the virus was a merchant who regularly shuttled between the two countries using indirect flights in recent weeks, after Iran stopped direct passenger flights to China.He did not say when the merchant had returned from China to Iran nor what steps health officials had taken to quarantine and check on those he’d come into contact with.Namaki, however, defended the government’s handling of the outbreak, saying it was being “transparent.” He said it would help make face-masks and sanitizers available for Iranians, amid concerns that stocks were running low in the capital’s pharmacies.Iran is also producing kits for diagnosis of the infection, he added.Namaki urged people not to visit Qom, which is a major destination for Shiite pilgrims from inside Iran and abroad.“We obviously do not recommend traveling to Qom and other pilgrimage cities,” Namaki said.The government has closed down schools and religious seminaries in Qom, where the virus first killed two elderly patients last week. Schools and some universities in Tehran and six other cities were also closed for two days starting Sunday. Football matches and shows in movie theaters were further suspended, and authorities have begun sanitizing Tehran’s metro, which is used by some 3 million people, and public transportation cars in the city on a daily basis.Iran has also set up 36 screening stations at different ports of entry to the country to check for possibly infected travellers, he added.Iraq and Pakistan, which share borders with Iran, have already taken preventive measures to limit the spread of the virus from Iranian travellers.Officials in the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, which shares a long frontier with Iran, have declared an emergency as they seek to stop the spread of the virus. They have suspended almost all traffic across the Taftan border crossing with Iran there.Infected travellers from Iran already have been discovered in Lebanon and Canada.Lebanon’s first case of the new virus was discovered on a flight from the Iranian city of Qom this week.Saudi Arabia has ordered anyone traveling from Iran to wait at least 14 days before entering the kingdom as it seeks to prevent the spread of the virus to the Muslim pilgrimage sites of Mecca and Medina. It has also barred its residents and citizens from travelling to Iran and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-covid-19-death-toll-rises-to-8-in-iran-infections-to-43/story-EThacIvLqBcLlqxqgpjdFJ.html

23-02-2020||World||South Korea on ‘high’ alert, Italy and Iran take drastic steps against Covid-19||South Korea went on high alert Sunday following a sharp jump in coronavirus cases, and Italy and Iran took their own drastic containment steps as an epidemic that has killed nearly 2,500 people in China continued a relentless global expansion.The World Health Organisation (WHO) also warned that Africa’s poor health systems left it vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease, which spilled out of China to more than 25 countries.South Korea is raising the nation’s alert to its “highest” level, President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday after the number of infections nearly tripled over the weekend to 556.Led by an outbreak cluster in a religious sect in the southern city of Daegu, South Korea now has the most infections outside of China apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, which has seen more than 600.“The next few days will be crucial,” Moon said following a government meeting on the virus.“The government will raise the alert level to the highest level according to experts’ recommendations.” Moon did not specify what those measures may include.South Korea reported 123 new cases and two deaths on Sunday, taking the countrywide toll of fatalities to four.More than 300 cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect in Daegu -- whose founder claims the mantle of Jesus Christ and vows to take 144,000 people with him to heaven on judgement day.Some 9,300 Shincheonji members have either been quarantined or asked to stay at home, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.More than 1,240 have reported symptoms.Elsewhere, Italy and Iran began introducing the sort of containment measures previously seen only in China, which has put tens of millions of people under quarantine lockdown in the epicentre province of Hubei.More than 50,000 people in about a dozen northern Italian towns near the business hub of Milan were urged by authorities to stay home, while shops and schools were shuttered.With dozens of cases, Italy on Friday became the first European country to report one of its nationals had died from the virus, followed by a second death on Saturday.Both were elderly.The government was weighing “extraordinary measures” to halt further infections, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.China reported another 97 deaths in its daily update Sunday, taking its total to 2,442, plus 648 new infections. Nearly 80,000 people have been infected worldwide, the vast majority in China.China’s outbreak remains concentrated in the locked-down city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have emanated from a live animal market in December.The city was locked down exactly one month ago as of Sunday, followed by surrounding areas.China’s infection rate has slowed from early in the epidemic, but Chinese flip-flopping over counting methods has sowed confusion over its data.There also was growing concern over the difficulty of detecting the virus.Japan on Sunday confirmed that a woman who tested negative and disembarked from the Diamond Princess later tested positive. Similar instances have been reported elsewhere.Japan has been criticised over its handling of the cruise ship.Many passengers were allowed to disembark without being properly tested or despite having close contact with infected people.More than 1,000 crew remain on board and are expected to serve a 14-day quarantine.Iran ordered the closure of schools, universities and cultural centres across 14 provinces from Sunday following five deaths in the Islamic Republic -- the most outside East Asia and the first in the Middle East.Iran’s outbreak surfaced Wednesday and quickly grew to 28 confirmed infections.“The concern is ... that we have seen ... a very rapid increase (in Iran) in a matter of a few days,” said Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO’s global infectious hazard preparedness department.Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from Iran, and flag carrier Kuwait Airways has suspended flights to the country.Although Egypt is the only African country with a confirmed case, the WHO warned that the continent was vulnerable, urging more African Union cooperation.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said necessary treatment tools such as respiratory support machines were “in short supply in many African countries and that’s a cause for concern”.The US State Department said anxiety was being stoked by a coordinated effort by thousands of Russia-linked social media accounts spreading conspiracy theories that the outbreak was a US-orchestrated ploy to damage China, officials said.Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the allegation as “deliberately false”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-south-korea-on-high-alert-italy-and-iran-take-drastic-steps-against-covid-19/story-Q3if0HociKcR5hPiQvWaXL.html

He later said another person had died.Some of the wounded remain trapped under the debris of fallen buildings, he added.Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said at least 21 people had been injured, including eight who are in a critical condition.Emergency teams have been sent to the remote mountainous region.Iran’s official IRNA news agency said the earthquake affected 43 villages in the mountainous Qotour area. It reported some residents were injured but didn’t say any were in critical condition.According to the European Mediterranean Seismological Center (EMSC), the quake, which happened at 9:22am local time (0552GMT), had a depth of 5 kilometers (3 miles).The region has a history of powerful earthquakes. Last month a quake centered on the eastern Turkish city of Elazig killed more than 40 people.Turkish broadcaster NTV showed images of locals and soldiers digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings as families fearing further tremors sat in snowy streets. The EMSC reported several further quakes that measured up to magnitude 3.9.The effects of the quake hit four villages in Van. Six of the fatalities occurred in Ozpinar village, where Soylu said search and rescue teams had arrived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earthquake-of-5-7-magnitude-strikes-western-iran-kills-eight-in-turkey/story-oTA8PQUXvT64SuEYIhGDRL.html
23-02-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak: Nearly another 100 die in China, death toll now 2,442 amid falling infections||At least 97 more people had died in China of the coronavirus until Saturday midnight, pushing the country-wide death toll to 2442, health officials said Sunday, adding the number of new infections outside the worst-hit central Chinese province of Hubei continued to fall.The number of new cases of covid-19 rose to 648 as of Saturday, an increase from 397 on Friday, the national health commission (NHC) said.That brought the total number of confirmed cases in China to 76,936.Among the 40,127 hospitalised patients in Hubei, 8,583 were still in severe condition and another 1,845 in critical condition. The number of new cases outside of Hubei stood at 18, the lowest since the commission started publishing nationwide data a month ago.The nationwide death toll rose by 97 to 2,442, but only one new death was outside of Hubei, the officials added.As many as 22,888 patients infected with the novel coronavirus had been discharged from hospital after recovery by the end of Saturday.Globally, there’s been worrying spike in cases especially in South Korea and Italy; Iran has reported six deaths.The number of deaths from the novel coronavirus has risen to 2,461 worldwide: there are over 79,930 cases globally, and at least 19 deaths outside mainland China.Members of the China-World Health Organisation (WHO) joint expert team traveled to Wuhan Saturday to investigate the COVID-19 outbreak, the NHC said.The experts had discussions with Wuhan’s health authorities and visited medical and health institutions, the commission said.Details and findings from the visit are awaited.In related developments, Wuhan authorities have said all discharged covid-19 patients will undergo another 14-day mandatory quarantine at a designated location under medical observation.China, state media reported Sunday has directed all its companies to stop using biometric identification systems amid the coronavirus outbreak.“The systems use fingerprints to verify who is clocking in and clocking out of work, and may increase the risk of virus transmission,” the state media report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-nearly-another-100-die-in-china-death-toll-now-2-442-amid-falling-infections/story-iwODXiVSajvzQy4PJwEkGL.html
23-02-2020||World||US could deny Green Cards to immigrants for availing public benefits||The United States on Monday will begin enforcing a regulation that could deny green cards or legal permanent residency to legal immigrants who seek public benefits like food stamps.The move might affect a number of Indians who are on H-1B visas and are in long ques to get permanent legal residency.The decision follows the Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday which lifted the final remaining injunction on the ‘public charge’ regulation.“As a result, the Department of Homeland Security will be able to implement its regulation on Monday,” said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham.“This final rule will protect hardworking American taxpayers, safeguard welfare programs for truly needy Americans, reduce the Federal deficit, and re-establish the fundamental legal principle that newcomers to our society should be financially self-reliant and not dependent on the largesse of United States taxpayers,” Grisham said.The final rule published on August 14, 2019 was originally scheduled to come into effect on October 15, 2019, but could not be implemented due to various court rulings.The ruling prescribes how the Department of Homeland Security will determine whether an alien is inadmissible, and ineligible to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident in the United States because the alien is likely at any time in the future to become a public charge.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the new rule includes a requirement that individuals seeking an extension, stay or change of status demonstrate that they have not received public benefits over the allowed amount since obtaining the non-immigrant status that they are seeking to extend or change.According to a 2018 Migration Policy Institute Report, 61 per cent of non-citizen Bangladeshi families, 48 per cent of non-citizen Pakistani and 11 per cent of non-citizen Indian families receive public benefits that would be scrutinised under the rule.As per SAALT (Strengthening South Asian Communities in America) organisation, the impact of the rule would be felt across the South Asian American community, as over 10 per cent of green card recipients in financial year 2016 were from South Asian countries.Nearly 472,000 or 1 per cent of the approximately 5 million South Asians in the United States live in poverty, according to a Pew Research Center study.In 2015, eight of 19 Asian American groups had poverty rates higher than the US average.Among those, Pakistani Americans (15.8 per cent), Nepali Americans (23.9 per cent), Bangladeshi Americans (24.2 per cent), and Bhutanese Americans (33.3 per cent) had the highest poverty rates among South Asian American groups, the SAALT said.The White House had said last year that this action will help ensure that if aliens want to enter or remain in the United States they must support themselves, and not rely on public benefits.An alien who receives public benefits above a certain threshold is known as a “public charge.” Foreign nationals will be barred from entering the United States if they are found likely to become public charges.Those migrants in the United States who are found likely to become public charges will also be barred from adjusting their immigration status, the White House.“President Trump is enforcing this longstanding law to prevent aliens from depending on public benefit programs,” the White House said, adding that the Immigration and Nationality Act makes clear that those seeking to come to the United States cannot be a public charge.For many years, this clear legal requirement went largely unenforced, imposing vast burdens on American taxpayers.The new rule would “have the long-term benefit of protecting taxpayers by ensuring people who are immigrating to this country don’t become public burdens, that they can stand on their own two feet, as immigrants in years past have done,” Ken Cuccinelli, Acting Director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, had then told Fox News.In a fact sheet last year, the White House said the Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed two bipartisan bills in 1996 to help stop aliens from exploiting public benefits.This included the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.As Congress made clear at the time, it is our national policy that aliens should “not depend on public resources to meet their needs.” Americans widely agree that individuals coming to our country should be self-sufficient, with 73 per cent in favour of requiring immigrants to be able to support themselves financially, it said.“We must ensure that non-citizens do not abuse our public benefit programs and jeopardise the social safety net needed by vulnerable Americans,” the White House said.Large numbers of non-citizens and their families have taken advantage of its generous public benefits, limited resources that could otherwise go to vulnerable Americans, it said.As many as 78 per cent of households headed by a non-citizen with no more than a high school education use at least one welfare program.Fifty eight per cent of all households headed by a non-citizen use at least one welfare program.Half of all non-citizen-headed households include at least one person who uses the Medicaid health programme, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-could-deny-green-cards-to-immigrants-for-availing-public-benefits/story-YN3fL44NwxaQ1ny7AHd79K.html
23-02-2020||World||Bernie Sanders wins big in Nevada, stretching lead in Democratic race||Progressive firebrand Bernie Sanders earned a decisive victory Saturday in the Nevada caucuses, solidifying his frontrunner status in the race to choose the Democratic nominee who faces President Donald Trump in November’s election.His win is a substantial accomplishment in a state seen as an important bellwether because it is the first diverse electorate to weigh in on the 2020 presidential race.It also shows that Sanders has been able to broaden a coalition beyond the narrow limits of leftist voters, refuting the argument used by several moderates in the race that he would not be able to bridge the divide between progressives and centrists.By late Saturday with official results slowly trickling in, Sanders was comfortably ahead with some 22 percent of precincts reporting.The 78-year-old senator from Vermont was leading with about 46 percent, followed by former vice president Joe Biden at 23 percent.South Bend, Indiana’s former mayor Pete Buttigieg, who scored a shock narrow win in Iowa to start the race nearly three weeks ago, stood at a distant third a 13 percent.The two female US senators in the running, progressive Elizabeth Warren and pragmatist Amy Klobuchar, were well back, in single digits. Sanders was quick to claim victory, saying his “multi-generational, multi-racial coalition” that won Nevada is “going to sweep this country.”His progressive policies, including universal health care, higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and raising the minimum wage have struck a chord with millions of Americans.“The American people are sick and tired of a government which is based on greed, corruption, and lies. They want an administration which is based on the principles of justice,” he told a raucous rally, which responded with chants of “Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!”Sanders was speaking in El Paso, Texas, one of the 14 states that votes on “Super Tuesday” on March 3. Buttigieg congratulated Sanders on his Nevada victory. But the moderate, 38-year-old military veteran offered a stern warning against picking a self-described democratic socialist who sees “capitalism as the root of all evil” to go up against the populist Trump.“Senator Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,” Buttigieg said in remarks that took on a surprisingly coarse tone.With Sanders coming in virtually tied for first in Iowa and then winning New Hampshire last week, he is in the driver’s seat against his seven rivals as the race turns toward South Carolina and then Super Tuesday.“Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada,” Trump tweeted, maligning other candidates before adding: “Congratulations Bernie, & don’t let them take it away from you!”With the race soon taking on a national dynamic, several candidates like Klobuchar, Warren or congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard will be under pressure to decide whether they fight on or throw in the towel. ‘Coming back’The centrist Biden, desperate to right a listing ship after miserable showings in the first two states, told supporters he feels “really good” about his Nevada finish and shouldn’t be counted out.“We’re alive and we’re coming back,” the onetime frontrunner insisted. “We’re going on to South Carolina to win and then we’re going to take this back!”South Carolina has a majority black Democratic electorate, and Biden leads polling there, riding his popularity among African Americans due in part to his eight years as popular president Barack Obama’s deputy.Sanders leads national polls with an average of 28 percent support.That is 11 points ahead of Biden and 13 points clear of billionaire media tycoon Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who skipped campaigning in the four early states, including Nevada, in order to focus on Super Tuesday.Sanders has been largely unchecked by opponents who have focused more on blunting the advance of Bloomberg, who has poured a staggering $438 million of his personal fortune, an all-time record, into campaign advertising.Warren, speaking late Saturday at a large rally in Washington state which votes on March 10, pledged to stay in the fight despite a third straight mediocre showing.She repeated her attacks on Bloomberg, accusing him of seeking to “buy this election.”In Las Vegas, caucuses were held in several of the city’s world-famous casinos and hotels, as well as dusty desert towns.Keen to avoid the drawn-out embarrassment of the Iowa caucus, which relied on flawed technology to relay results, Nevada officials pivoted to a low-tech system that involved phoning in results to hotlines and backing them up with photographs of the tabulations.The process was considerably slower than four years ago, but appeared to be relatively smooth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernie-sanders-wins-big-in-nevada-stretching-lead-in-democratic-race/story-AzakRX6ujhCFYfwkaeUlnK.html

23-02-2020||World||Bernie Sanders takes the lead in Nevada Democratic caucuses||Bernie Sanders led Nevada’s presidential caucuses based on early returns Saturday as the fiery progressive pushed for a second straight victory in the Democrats’ 2020 nomination fight.Sanders has emerged as the front-runner in the party’s national race, even as establishment-minded Democrats raise concerns about the self-described democratic socialist’s ability to defeat President Donald Trump this fall. A half-dozen more-moderate candidates are fighting to become the preferred Sanders’ alternative, yet all were trailing Sanders based on the early returns.In a show of confidence, Sanders left Nevada early to rally supporters in Texas, which offers one of the biggest delegate troves in just 10 days on Super Tuesday. The progressive senator told cheering supporters in El Paso that Trump is “a pathological liar running a corrupt administration.” He also called Trump “a religious bigot.”The Nevada verdict represents the third in a primary season that will span all 50 states and several U.S. territories, ending only at the party’s national convention in July. But with two more rounds of voting scheduled over the next 10 days -- including Super Tuesday’s massive delegate haul -- the party may identify a consensus candidate long before the convention.Sanders and his allies were increasingly confident. In Nevada, he had strong support from Latinos and rank-and-file union workers who have warmed to his calls to transform the nation’s economy and political system to help the working class.There was skepticism about Pete Buttigieg’s ability to win over a more diverse set of voters after strong finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. Joe Biden, who struggled in those early states, looked to Nevada’s voters of color to prove he still had a viable path to the nomination.Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar also were fighting for survival, hoping to benefit from outside money from newly created super PACs.New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who dominated the political conversation this week after a poor debate-stage debut, wasn’t on the ballot. He’s betting everything on a series of delegate-rich states that begin voting next month.Billionaire Tom Steyer spent more than $12 million of his own money on television advertising in Nevada, according to data obtained by The Associated Press.There were still questions about when final results from Saturday’s voting might be released under the complicated new caucus reporting process.“Our goal is to get results as soon as possible,” said Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez. “But also, first and foremost, to get it right.”Meanwhile, Nevada’s Republican party formally awarded all 25 of its delegates to Trump.The state GOP had already canceled its caucuses, but the state committee voted by acclimation to give the Republican president all of its delegates as Democrats were tallying caucus votes, according to party executive director Will Sexauer.On the Democratic side, hundreds of uniformed housekeepers and casino workers at noon streamed into the Bellagio, one of seven casino-resorts on the Las Vegas Strip among 200 locations statewide hosting caucuses.Nevada is the third contest on a 2020 election calendar marked by chaos and uncertainty after the opening votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, overwhelmingly white, rural states. The first presidential contest in the West is testing the candidates’ strength with black and Latino voters for the first time in 2020.“Nevada represents an opportunity for these candidates to demonstrate their appeal to a larger swath of our country,” said state Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat who is not endorsing a candidate.Nevada’s population aligns more with the U.S. as a whole, compared with Iowa and New Hampshire: 29% Latino, 10% black and 9% Asian American and Pacific Islander.The caucuses were the first since technical glitches and human errors plagued Iowa’s caucuses. Nearly three weeks later, state Democratic officials have yet to post final results.Party Chairman Perez said a number of factors, including early voting and potentially high turnout, could affect the tabulation and timing of results. In addition, Nevada, like Iowa, reports three sets of data from the multistage caucus process.On Friday, party leaders issued a memo clarifying that, while caucus leaders could still use an online form to submit results from individual precincts, they should use a dedicated hotline to call and text in results as their primary form of reporting.In Iowa, overwhelmed phone lines caused caucus leaders to wait on hold for hours, contributing to the delay in reporting the results. Nevada Democrats brought in extra help from other state parties to help handle the reporting Saturday night.Early voting was likely to pose another challenge.State party officials said that 74,611 ballots were cast during the four-day early voting period, and a majority were first-time caucus-goers. In 2016, a total of 84,000 Nevada voters participated in the Democratic caucuses.At the Bellagio caucus site, 41-year-old Christian Nielsen, a scuba diver for the Cirque du Soleil show “O,” said he was backing Sanders because he believes the country needs a “major change in the White House.”“We need somebody in the White House who has been on the right side of history for their entire career, somebody who stands with the working class, and will make things more fair for everybody,” Nielsen said.He said he tried to vote early but the line was three hours long. He said the sign-in process at the Bellagio was quick and painless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernie-sanders-takes-the-lead-in-nevada-democratic-caucuses/story-uigrm18g7FEanUgBsSBOjJ.html
23-02-2020||World||Italy towns close down amid coronavirus case clusters, 2 deaths||A dozen towns in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown Saturday after the deaths of two people infected with the new virus from China and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad.The secondary contagions prompted authorities in some Lombardy and Veneto towns to close schools, businesses and restaurants and to cancel sporting events and Masses. The mayor of Milan, Italy’s business capital and the regional capital of Lombardy, shuttered public offices.A 78-year-old man infected with the virus died in Veneto. A post-mortem test performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy came back positive, though it wasn’t clear if illness from the virus caused her death.Hundreds of residents and workers who came into contact with 79people who tested positive were put into isolation pending results of their tests. Civil protection crews set up a tent camp outside a closed hospital in Veneto to screen medical staff for the virus.In the town of Codogno, where the first patient identified in the northern cluster was in critical condition, closed supermarkets, restaurants and shops made main street practically a ghost town. The few people out wore face masks, which were coveted items after selling out at pharmacies.Late Saturday, civil protection officials said 79 people had contracted the virus, including the two who died and one who was cured. Of the remaining 76, 54 were in Lombardy, 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia Romagna, two in Lazio — a Chinese couple from Wuhan — and one in Piemonte.Lombardy government authorities said the region’s cases were traceable to a 38-year-old Italian who hadn’t traveled to China, but it remained unclear how he was infected. Ten towns in Lombardy received orders to suspend nonessential activities and services.Veneto regional president Luca Zaia said Saturday that the contagion showed that the virus is transmitted like any flu and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to China no longer were effective containment measures.“You can get it from anyone,” he told reporters. “We can expect to have cases of patients who had no contact” with suspected carriers. While the virus isn’t particularly lethal, it can be for the elderly or people with existing conditions, he said.The man who died in Veneto, for example, did not meet the main risk factors for the virus when he was diagnosed with pneumonia two weeks ago: he hadn’t traveled to China or come into contact with anyone who did. Therefore, the ill man wasn’t originally tested for the virus.He was only tested after he didn’t respond to conventional pneumonia treatment, and by then it was too late, according to Francesca Russo, the head of healthcare for the Veneto region.Along with eight other infected people, the man who died formed a cluster in his hometown of Vo’Euganeo, population 3,300. Russo expressed relief that to date, none of the hospital personnel who treated him has tested positive.Lombardy health and welfare ministry chief Giulio Gallera said that region’s cases also comprised a traceable cluster,but officials were still stumped about where it originated.The first person to fall ill had met with a man who returned from China on Jan. 21, but he testednegative for the virus and has been ruled out as the source.Other people acquired their infections from the 38-year-old sick patient either through contact with him or the hospital in Codogno where he first received treatment Feb. 18.More than 250 tests were completed in Lombardy, though hundreds more were being processed, including among the man’s colleagues at a Unilever plant near Codogno where he worked, Gallera said.“Given how contagious it is, it’s possible the numbers will increase,” he said.National and regional officials approved an ordinance that put 10 Lombardy towns in effective lockdown around Lodi, southeast of Milan, after the region reported a quadrupling of cases Friday. But individual cities outside the area covered by the ordinance, such as Cremona, issued their own restrictions after confirming there were local cases.In Milan itself, however, life was largely continuing on as usual: Inter Milan was still scheduled to play Sampdoria on Sunday night in Italy’s Serie A soccer league, and Milan Fashion Week was wrapping up, even though chatter about the rising numbers accompanied the runway shows.‘’It doesn’t seem to me in this moment for what regards our sector, our fashion week, that there are signs of danger,’’ Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian National Fashion Chamber, told The Associated Press. ‘’We are tranquil and prudent.”However, the world’s largest eyewear trade fair, MIDO, announced it was putting off its Milan show until June because of the outbreak.Despite the alarm, authorities urged calm and tried to balance precautionary closures with the economic reality of regions highly dependent on tourism and commerce. Hotel reservations in Venice were down one-third during the first weekend of Carnival, though floods in the lagoon city late last year likely scared off visitors.“This is not an Italian ‘Wuhan,’‘“ insisted Ivana Jlenic, president of the federation of Italian tourism and travel agencies, Fiavet. “Avoiding all travel at this time would just be alarmist.”In Rome, doctors at the Spallanzani infectious disease hospital treating the first three people in Italy found to be infected with the virus - a Chinese couple from Wuhan and an Italian who contracted the virus in China - reported encouraging news in the otherwise bleak day.The Italian patient, who tested positive for the virus two weeks ago, was cleared to leave the hospital, while one of the Chinese visitors tested negative for the first time.Separately Saturday, 19 Italians who spent more than two weeks quarantined on a virus-stricken cruise liner in Japan landed at Rome’s military Pratica di Mare airport. They had been stranded on the Diamond Princess since Feb. 5.Following the first health checks and decontamination process, the passengers were transferred to the military campus of Cecchignola where they will spend a 14-day isolation period.Britain also welcomed home passengers from the Diamond Princess: 32 British and other European passengers landed at a British military base in southwest England. They will be quarantined for 14 days at Arrowe Park hospital in northwest England, where more than 80 other Britons evacuated from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak, have already spent time in isolation.Four U.K. nationals from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus are being treated at hospitals in Japan.Britain has nine confirmed cases of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-towns-close-down-amid-coronavirus-case-clusters-2-deaths/story-IVLVjYuSABYpPGiboFQirN.html

23-02-2020||World||India seeks return of 15th century Tamil statue in Oxford||India has asked the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford to return a 15th century bronze statue of Tamil poet Tirumankai Alvar, which was reportedly stolen from a temple in Kumbakonam in the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu in the 1960s.The museum, which bought the statue in a London auction in 1967, informed the Indian high commission in December that new research questioned its provenance. Indian officials thanked the museum for alerting the mission.According to Rahul Nagare, first secretary, the mission had received a report from the Tamil Nadu police that “unambiguously shows that the original idol has been stolen and replaced with a fake one, and that the stolen idol is the same one that is presently with the Ashmolean”.“Therefore, we have conveyed our formal request to them for restitution of the idol to India. The idol wing is now further investigating the matter about the original theft and subsequent smuggling out of the idol.”A spokeswoman for the museum said: “The museum acquired the statue in good faith. According to the Sotheby’s catalogue the bronze was sold from the collection of Dr JR Belmont (1886-1981)”.“We currently have no indication of how the bronze entered his collection and we are continuing to investigate with the support of the Indian high commission.”Similar ancient Indian artefacts recovered in the UK have recently been returned to India.On August 15, 2019, two items stolen from India were repatriated following a joint US-UK investigation: a limestone carved relief sculpture, originating from Andhra Pradesh, estimated to be dated between 1st century BC and 1st century AD; and a Navaneetha Krishna bronze sculpture, from Tamil Nadu, dated around 17th century AD.On August 15, 2018, Scotland Yard returned to the mission a 12th century Buddha statue stolen from the Archaeological Survey of India’s museum in Nalanda, Bihar, in August 1961, and recovered in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-seeks-return-of-15th-century-tamil-statue-in-oxford/story-gbaqnn0owIZiJk10ggdMcN.html
23-02-2020||World||German far right under pressure after recent attacks||The extreme political right in Germany is on the defensive and stands accused of inciting last week’s racist attacks in Hanau and others with its anti-migrant diatribes. Some have even asked that the hard right be subjected to police surveillance. “We have known for a long time that words can be followed by action and the elected representatives of the people cannot shirk this responsibility,” said the chairman of the chamber of deputies, Wolfgang Schauble, in an interview with the daily Handelsblatt on Saturday.In his sights is the hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which since 2017 has become the main opposition force in the Bundestag with 89 elected officials. It has played on stoking fear in the population following the arrival of more than a million asylum-seekers in 2015 and 2016.“The problem is that the AfD knows no bounds,” added Schauble, a member of Angela Merkel’s conservative party. He goes so far as to call Bjorn Hocke, the leader of the most radical wing, a “fascist”.- ‘Political arm’ -The general secretary of the social democratic party SPD, coalition partner of the conservatives in Berlin, Lars Klingbeil, described the AfD as the “political arm” of the perpetrators of racist and anti-Semitic attacks.Such attacks have been on the increase and were again in the news this week with the murder of nine people in Hanau.According to political scientist Carsten Koschmieder, there is no question of criminal liability. “But it is clear that what the AfD and some of its politicians say contributes to such acts,” he told public broadcaster ARD.Obsessed with racist theories, the Hanau attacker spoke in a “manifesto” he left behind about the dilution of the Germanic race by the naturalisation of foreigners. “This is exactly the speech of the AfD,” says Koschmieder. The party claims to be the victim of a slander campaign with its leader Alexander Gauland accusing critics of “instrumentalising” an act that had no link to his party.The AfD quickly ascribed the Hanau attack to an unbalanced individual who should never have had access to a gun. In a poll published on Saturday by the Forsa Institute, the AfD has dropped two percentage points since Wednesday’s attack, giving them no more than nine percent support across the country.- Surveillance -The pressure is mounting, however. The left is demanding that the entire AfD be subject to surveillance by the Interior Intelligence Service, a treatment reserved in Germany for organisations representing a danger to the state.Already, the most radical fringe of the AfD is in the crosshairs.On Saturday, officials from the two government parties also demanded that AfD activists be banned from the civil service.“We clearly expect public service to have a clear attachment to our democracy,” said Chancellor Patrick Sensburg, an elected member of the CDU’s Christian Democrat party. “Membership of the AfD cannot, in my opinion, be compatible.” Klingbeil has demanded that Hocke, the leader of the most extreme section of the movement, lose his civil servant status. “He is an enemy of democracy who cannot serve the state,” Klingbeil said on Twitter.There have already been consequences.The election of a liberal politician as state premier in Thurungia on Friday was shrouded in controversy after he received the backing of both the centre and the far right. Liberal Thomas Kemmerich then stepped down, leaving Thuringia rudderless, pending a fresh election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-far-right-under-pressure-after-recent-attacks/story-4ptPNVn4UBxqs6jAfkPJGI.html

The kind of preparations going on from taxpayers’ money for the arrival of Trump is similar to it. This reflects the slave mentality of Indians,” it said.The Sena also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) move to build wall on a plot to “hide the slums” on the route through which Trump’s convoy would pass.“Former prime minister Indira Gandhi had once given the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’, which was ridiculed for a long time. It seems now Modi’s plan is ‘Garibi chupao’ (hide poverty),” the Marathi publication said.Is there any financial allocation for such a wall being built in Ahmedabad? Is the US going to offer loan to India to build such walls across the country? it wondered.“We have heard Trump is going to be in Ahmedabad for only three hours but the wall construction is costing almost Rs 100 crore to the state exchequer,” it said.It is basically a political arrangement between Prime Minister Modi and US President Trump, the Sena claimed.Last year, ‘Howdy, Modi!’ (a mega event jointly addressed by the Indian prime minister and Trump) was organised in the US, it noted.A similar programme, “Kem Chho Trump” (Gujarati expression for how are you Trump), has been now organised (in Ahmedabad) ahead of the US elections, chiefly because of a sizable number of Gujarati people living in America, the Shiv Sena claimed.“But this visit of President Trump is neither going to stop further fall of rupee in the forex market nor offer betterment to those behind the wall (being built in front of slums in Ahmedabad),” it said.The Sena said Trump is “not someone very wise or a statesman or someone who cares for the whole world”, but he has to be treated with respect as he represents the mighty US.“Sometimes you have to treat someone with respect to get your things done,” it quipped.The AMC on Friday said the construction of the wall, around four feet in height, was approved much before Trump’s Gujarat visit was finalised.Trump is scheduled to visit Modi’s home state Gujarat on February 24.He will visit the famous Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad and take part in a roadshow with Modi. After that, the two leaders will inaugurate a new cricket stadium in Motera and address a gathering there, with an expected audience of over a lakh people.While it was earlier speculated that the programme would be called ‘Kem Chho Trump’, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation on Sunday tweeted a series of posters confirming that the event is now christened as ‘Namaste Trump’, apparently to give it a pan-India appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/preparations-for-donald-trump-s-visit-show-slave-mentality-of-indians-says-shiv-sena/story-WqmBiD38JdzRnxwDCNh2GM.html
