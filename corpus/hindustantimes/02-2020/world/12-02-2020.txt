He thinks we will have 5-7 million people just from the airport to the new stadium”. The stadium in question is the Motera cricket stadium. It is under construction, will be the venue of the rally and, once finished, will be the largest cricket stadium in the world. Trump called Modi a “friend of mine” and a “great gentleman”, and marvelled at the size of crowd he was expecting to see. He likes to talk about the size of his rallies and was impressed by the 50,000 that showed up for the Howdy Modi event the two leaders addressed in Houston last September.The US president has kept a close watch on the stadium and knew it was under construction.Prime Minister Modi followed up shortly on Twitter, assuring the president that a “memorable welcome” awaits him and the first lady. “Extremely delighted that @POTUS, @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS will visit India on 24th and 25th February. India will accord a memorable welcome to our esteemed guests.”“This visit is a very special one and it will go a long way in further cementing India-USA friendship,” he added. In another post, he said that the two countries “share a common commitment to democracy and pluralism. Our nations are cooperating extensively on a wide range of issues. Robust friendship between our nations augurs well not only for our citizens but also for the entire world.”The two leaders have struck up a personal rapport, according to officials from both sides, over frequent meetings and phone calls. They may have met at least four times since Modi’s re-election last summer. They spoke last weekend, the White House said in a statement Monday announcing the visit.President Trump and the first lady will visit Ahmedabad and New Delhi and stop over briefly in Agra on the way home, according to people familiar with the discussions. The precise itinerary of the visit will be announced closer to the date, with more details about the rally and meetings.President Trump appears keenest about the rally, which he asked for, according to the people cited earlier, impressed by the turnout at Howdy Modi . He possibly has the upcoming November election in mind when he will need every voting group large and small to win a second term.Indian Americans are a tiny but extremely wealthy and increasingly influential minority. They have voted Democratic traditionally, but have been moving towards the Republican party in recent years, and Trump might be hastening the process with his efforts to reach out to them, starting in October 2016, when he became the first presidential nominee of a major party to address a rally exclusively of Indian Americans. And the rally in Gujarat would be another, much bigger, pitch to Indian Americans, a large number of whom come from Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-looks-forward-to-seeing-millions-at-his-gujarat-rally/story-8Z6z1UXDbLTs9D27AROidP.html
12-02-2020||World||US cruise ship rejected by ports over coronavirus fears finally gets permission to berth||Aboard a US cruise ship that was rejected at Asian ports over coronavirus fears, stoic passengers kept their spirits up with poolside yoga, spin classes, comedy shows and a few drinks.But the 1,455 passengers and 802 crew members of the Westerdam really rejoiced on Wednesday after learning Cambodia had given permission for the cruise liner to dock at Sihanoukville, on its southern coast. The scheduled arrival Thursday will bring an end to what was meant to be a dream 14-day cruise across Asia -- beginning from Hong Kong on February 1, and disembarking on Saturday in Yokohama, Japan. Japan, Guam, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand all refused to allow the ship to dock, despite Holland America insisting there were no cases of the deadly disease -- which has killed over 1,100 -- on board.Several other cruise ships have been refused entry at ports across the Asia-Pacific region -- from Singapore to Tonga -- as fears over the virus spike.Cambodia’s decision to receive the Westerdam comes as its strongman leader has voiced vocal support for China -- with premier Hun Sen going so far as to travel to Beijing last week in a show of solidarity.The Southeast Asian nation -- with just one confirmed case of the SARS-like virus -- has been the recipient of billions of dollars in soft loans, infrastructure and investment from its superpower ally. “Guests will be able to go ashore,” operator Holland America said in a statement. “We are extremely grateful to the Cambodian authorities for their support.”Even with their holiday plans in tatters, passengers made the most of the extraordinary circumstances -- some taking to social media to share amusing asides on life unwanted and at sea.“Not a bad place to be captive. I’m in the salon having my hair done right now and getting ready to hit the buffet,” Christina Kerby said on Twitter, where her photos of yoga or posts on morning spin classes have bounced around. Speaking to AFP after hearing of their final destination, her reaction was one of elation -- “Thrilled! Thank you, Cambodia!” she said, adding a heart emoji. The mood on board was “relieved and upbeat”. “At this point we’re just happy to have a destination,” she told AFP. Barred from docking The atmosphere is in stark contrast to the gloom aboard the Diamond Princess, a quarantined Japanese cruise ship riddled with the virus which has forced passengers into a depressing lockdown in cabins.“We’re all good. The mood is positive... there’s no tension on aboard” said Lorraine Oliveira, from Ireland, on the ship with her husband and two children.Before it was barred from docking, boat operator Holland America Line initially said the cruise will disembark on Thursday at Thailand’s Laem Chabang port, a few hours east of Bangkok. With no idea of where they would make land or when, passengers cancelled onward flights, travel plans scrambled by events -- and governments -- beyond their control.Holland America said Wednesday that all onward travel from Sihanoukville will be arranged and paid for, and full refunds will be given to guests. “All guests on board are healthy and, despite erroneous reports, there are no known or suspected cases of coronavirus on board,” it added. Passenger Stephen Hansen confirmed to AFP that there was “no sickness on board”. He also believes Thailand’s refusal to let Westerdam dock was “a political situation, not a health one”.Health authorities in Tonga have refused entry to three cruise liners -- CMV Astor, CMV Columbus and Crystal Serenity -- due to dock in the Pacific island nation on Wednesday.A fourth passenger ship Wind Spirit, which had been set to arrive on Saturday, was also told to stay away.The diversion notice did not say where the ships were headed but online trackers suggested the Astor was steaming towards Auckland, Columbus and Serenity were Fiji-bound and Wind Spirit was still near Tahiti.Meanwhile Cunard’s Queen Mary 2 luxury liner, currently off the coast of Malaysia, has been diverted to Freemantle in Western Australia, cancelling stops in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cruise-ship-rejected-by-ports-over-coronavirus-fears-finally-gets-permission-to-berth/story-vkKFcR1vojQUWmlZmnVT3J.html
12-02-2020||World||LeT founder Hafiz Saeed jailed for 5 years for terror financing, can challenge verdict||Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed was on Wednesday convicted by a court in Lahore and given a five-and-a-half year prison term in two terror financing cases – the first time the US-designated terrorist has been held guilty by the Pakistani judiciary.The verdict came four days before the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) plenary meeting in Paris to assess action taken by Pakistan to counter terror financing and money laundering. Saeed, who was detained last July, can appeal against the ruling in higher courts.Anti-terrorism court judge Arshad Hussain Bhatta ruled that the five-and-a-half year prison terms given to Saeed in both cases would run concurrently and also fined him Rs 15,000 in the two cases.In both cases, Saeed was convicted under Section 11-F(2) of the Anti-Terrorism Act for being a member of a proscribed organisation, which entails a maximum prison term of six months, and Section 11-N for facilitating fund-raising by terror groups, for which he was given five years in jail.The judge directed authorities to keep Saeed in custody until further orders.Saeed, 69, for whom the US has offered a bounty of $10 million, has been detained without charge several times since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, but has never been formally charged or prosecuted in Pakistani courts. US and Indian officials have accused him of a key role in masterminding the Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 people.Earlier this month, the anti-terrorism court had deferring its verdict in the cases against Saeed. The court was to announce its verdict against the Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief on Saturday but postponed it.Saeed recorded his statement in court and pleaded “not guilty”. The terror financing cases were registered against him in several cities by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab province.He had claimed the Pakistan government was being pressured by India and the US to file “false” cases against him, and had asked the court to quash the First Information Report (FIR) against him.Pakistani authorities have refrained from acting against the LeT and JuD for years but they finally banned all groups headed by Saeed last year because of mounting pressure from the FATF and Western powers.The FATF placed Pakistan in its “grey list” in 2018 and several reports by the multilateral watchdog have highlighted the country’s repeated failure to stop fund-raising by groups such as LeT, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Taliban, Haqqani Network and al-Qaeda.Saeed was arrested by the CTD last July after 23 cases were registered against him and 12 aides, including his brother-in-law Abdul Rehman Makki, in Lahore, Gujranwala, Multan, Faisalabad and Sargodha. They were accused of using a network of trusts and non-profit organisations to collect funds for terrorism. This was the first time Saeed was directly named in a case registered against the LeT and its front organisations for involvement in terrorism. The cases named trusts and organisations such as Dawat ul Irshad Trust, Muaz Bin Jabal Trust, Al-Anfaal Trust, Al Hamd Trust, and Al Madina Foundation Trust.The CTD said the accused had gathered “assets from funds of terrorism financing (and) held and used these assets to raise more funds for further terrorism financing”. The assets and organisations of the LeT and JuD were also taken over by the government in compliance with UN sanctions.The last review conducted by the FATF in October 2019 concluded that Pakistan will have to take “extra measures” to stop terror financing and money laundering. The FATF meetings beginning in Paris on February 16 will assess Pakistan’s implementation of a 27-point action plan.Western diplomats expect Pakistan to be retained in the FATF’s grey list as it has fully or partially complied with only 14 of the points in the action plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/let-founder-hafiz-saeed-jailed-for-5-years-for-terror-financing-will-challenge-verdict/story-Nk5tyMH7nsMJoLoTqKPKFJ.html
12-02-2020||World||China’s coronavirus death toll tops 1,100 as new cases fall||The death toll from China’s coronavirus epidemic climbed past 1,100 on Wednesday but the number of new cases fell for a second straight day, raising hope the outbreak could peak later this month.As Beijing scrambles to contain the outbreak, the number of people infected on a cruise ship off Japan’s coast rose to 174 -- the biggest cluster outside the Chinese mainland.Another 97 people died in China, raising the national toll to 1,113, while more than 44,600 people have now been infected by newly named COVID-19 virus.The World Health Organization warned the virus posed a “very grave threat”, but that there a “realistic chance” of curbing the outbreak.Most of the deaths and majority of cases have been in central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicentre of the outbreak. Some 56 million have been placed under lockdown in the province.The epidemic has threatened to harm the world’s second-largest economy, with ANZ bank warning that China’s first-quarter GPD growth would slow to 3.2-4.0 percent, down from a previous projection of 5.0 percent.But in a positive development, the number of new cases has fallen in Hubei for two straight days, according to figures from the National Health Commission.Outside the province, the number of new patients has declined for the past week.“In general, the number of new cases is now slowly decreasing,” Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China’s National Health Commission, said in a video conference with medical staff in Wuhan on Tuesday. ‘Very grave threat’ “When does the turning point occur? I can’t say. But I think it’s at its peak in mid- to late-February,” he said.Australia’s chief medical officer was more circumspect, however.“I think we’ve just got to watch the data very closely over the coming weeks before we make any predictions,” Brendan Murphy told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.In Geneva, the WHO is hosting a two-day international conference on combatting the virus during which it decided to name it COVID-19 -- in keeping with guidelines aimed at avoiding linking disease to an animal or a geographic location.Warning it posed a “very grave threat” to the world, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there was a “window of opportunity to hit hard and stand in unison to fight this virus in every corner”.“We are not defenceless,” Tedros said, adding: “If we invest now... we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.”In addition to locking down Hubei, authorities have restricted movements in several other cities far from the epicentre in its unprecedented effort to contain the virus.Authorities have found a cluster in the northern port city of Tianjin, where 39 people were infected in one department store, according to the official Xinhua news agency. The first case was a salesperson who was diagnosed on January 31.Cruise ship infections rise Several countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have halted flights to and from the country, as hundreds of people have now been infected in some two-dozen countries.The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan’s coast.An additional 39 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for COVID-19, raising the total of cases to 174, while thousands of passengers and crew face a second week in quarantine.The case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people -- without having been in China -- has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad.The 53-year-old man caught the virus while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in Britain.Given China’s economic heft and position at the nexus of global supply chains, the virus is affecting companies far and wide and across multiple sectors across the world.International conferences are also being affected, with this week’s Singapore Air Show -- Asia’s biggest -- badly hit by exhibitors withdrawing and low attendance.US chip giant Intel, Facebook, Chinese phone maker Vivo, and Cisco, meanwhile, have all withdrawn from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona over coronavirus fears, joining other industry heavyweights pulling out of the world’s top mobile fair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-in-china-tops-1-100-as-new-cases-fall/story-zApcrB51EuTheOq17Rfg2K.html
12-02-2020||World||LeT founder Hafiz Saeed jailed for 5 years for terror financing, will challenge verdict||Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) emir Hafiz Saeed has been convicted in a terror financing case by a Pakistan court and sentenced to five years jail, news agency ANI reported on Wednesday. This is the first time that Hafiz Saeed, who was arrested last year, has been convicted in a terror case.Reports of Hafiz Saeed’s conviction comes right ahead of a crucial meeting of the anti-terror financing body, Financial Action Task Force, that will decide Pakistan’s listing colour code. Islamabad, which has been trying to get off FATF’s grey list, has been trying to persuade the international community that it was serious about curbing terror financing.The “grey list” acknowledges that Pakistan is a country where terrorist groups can carry out activities and raise funds, a label that makes foreign investment and loans from global financial institutions difficult.Saeed-led JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) that carried out 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that killed more than 160 people. He has not been charged for the terror attack.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had last year ordered action against Hafiz Saeed in the face of intense international pressure and the FATF grey listing. Saeed’s arrest in July last year over charges of terror financing was timed right ahead of Imran Khan’s three-day visit to the US.US President Donald Trump had then rushed to take credit for the arrest: “After a ten year search, the so-called ‘mastermind’ of the Mumbai Terror attacks has been arrested in Pakistan. Great pressure has been exerted over the last two years to find him,” he had tweeted.In December, Saeed was eventually charged with collecting funds for his banned organisations, which the U.N. and the United States have designated as terrorist groups. He pleaded not guilty.“Hafiz Saeed and another of his close aides have been sentenced in two cases of terrorism financing,” prosecutor Abdul Rauf Watto told Reuters.“The total punishment in both the cases was 11 years but he will serve five and a half years in jail as the two punishments will run concurrently,” Saeed’s lawyer Imran Gill said, adding that Hafiz Saeed would appeal against the verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-convicts-let-chief-hafiz-saeed-in-terror-financing-case/story-BLzUngqZ3lJpE1RMOdMpjI.html
12-02-2020||World||Coronavirus cases on quarantined Japan cruise ship climb to 174||Another 39 people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, authorities said Wednesday, as thousands more steel themselves for a second week in quarantine.With 174 confirmed cases, the ship that arrived with over 3,700 passengers and crew has become the largest single cluster of the newly named COVID-19 virus outside its origin in China, where it has killed more than 1,100.Passengers and crew are now halfway through a 14-day quarantine that is due to end on February 19 and have been mostly confined to their quarters, aside from being allowed brief periods on deck while wearing face masks.“You sit out on the balcony and you hear people coughing all the way along,” British passenger Sally Abel said in a video streamed on Facebook. “It is nothing like a holiday, but it is complete relaxation,” she added.Fellow passenger Yardley Wong tweeted: “Anxiety uprisen” on news of the new cases, saying she didn’t know whether she or her family might be next.On board the ship, the captain told passengers the situation was changing all the time.“We are following the latest and best public health guidelines from the authorities,” he said in a broadcast that passengers relayed on social media.He apologised for the “periodic service disruptions” to the internet, adding: “Diamond Princess has more bandwidth than any ship in the world, and at the same time, more mobile devices than ever before connected on a ship.”Passengers have been active on social media throughout their quarantine and have been trying to stave off boredom and anxiety with on-demand movies, quizzes and games of Sudoku.- ‘Captain’s leadership’ -Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters early Wednesday that the 39 new positive cases came from 53 additional test results.He said a quarantine officer was among those diagnosed, with the Yomiuri Shimbun daily reporting he had not been wearing a full protective suit while carrying out tests before the quarantine period began on February 5.Kato also revealed there were four people in hospital in serious condition, either on a ventilator or in intensive care.The Diamond Princess has been in quarantine since arriving off the Japanese coast early last week after the virus was detected in a former passenger who got off the ship in Hong Kong.Passengers have been asked to keep a distance from each other when out of their cabins, and given thermometers to regularly monitor their own temperatures.When the boat arrived off Japan, authorities initially tested nearly 300 people of the 3,711 aboard for the virus, gradually evacuating dozens who were infected to local medical facilities.In recent days, testing has expanded to 492 people, mostly those showing symptoms or who have had close contact with a confirmed positive case.“Currently we have the capacity to conduct up to 300 tests per day, but we are working... so that by the last day of the incubation period, February 18, we will be able to test up to 1,000,” government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters at a regular briefing.The ship is expected to remain in quarantine until February 19 -- two weeks days after the isolation period began. Officials do not expect new cases to affect this schedule.Aside from the cruise ship, Japan has identified 28 cases -- including at least nine from evacuation flights that brought Japanese citizens out of the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus originated.Some of the passengers evacuated from Wuhan are expected to be released from quarantine soon -- possibly by Wednesday evening.Separately, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that Japan was expanding its ban on travellers to Zhejiang province. Previously, a ban was imposed only on passengers from Hubei region, the disease’s epicentre.Despite the anxiety on board, one passenger praised the Italian captain for keeping stress levels manageable aboard the ship.“One reason why a panic has not occurred among passengers is the captain’s leadership. Regular announcements of information, answering passengers’ requests by consulting quarantine officers, walking on the deck, apologising for delayed medicine distribution,” the passenger tweeted.“I want this kind of man to be our country’s leader.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-on-quarantined-japan-cruise-ship-climb-to-174/story-IvWDQoUcTfJtDHIvVRUw1M.html
12-02-2020||World||Nepal suspends license of resort where 8 Indian tourists died||Nepal has suspended the licence of a mountainous resort for three months due to poor security management and managerial weakness at the hotel where eight Indian tourists, including four minors, died of possible asphyxiation, according to media reports.Tragedy struck a group of 15 tourists from Kerala when eight of them died on January 21 due to possible asphyxiation after they fell unconscious probably due to a gas leak from a heater in their room at a mountainous resort in Makwanpur district. The tourists were airlifted to HAMS hospital here where they were pronounced dead on arrival. Makwanpur police said the victims might have fallen unconscious due to asphyxiation. The Department of Tourism on Sunday imposed a ban on the operation of Daman-based Everest Panorama Resort for three months based on the report submitted by a probe committee formed to investigate the death of the Indian tourists from Kerala, the Kathmandu Post reported on Tuesday. The department decided to shut down the resort as the report submitted by a probe committee pointed out poor security management and managerial weakness at the resort for the incident, it said. The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation had formed the probe committee under Surendra Thapa, the director of the Department of Tourism. After a field inspection, the committee had submitted its report a few days ago, pointing to the shortcomings of the resort. During the investigation, the committee found the resort had not been following the recommended safety measures and was providing substandard services to its guests, The Himalayan Times reported. Moreover, the committee discovered that the resort had not fulfilled the criteria set by DoT to be categorised a ‘resort’, it said. Mira Acharya, director of DoT was quoted as saying by the report that the resort’s operations have been halted as per Section 15 of Tourism Act-1979. “If the resort owner wishes to resume services after three months of suspension, the resort should be upgraded as per the Hotel, Lodge, Restaurant, Bar and Tourist Guide Rules-1981 and also meet the criteria mentioned in a notice published in the Nepal Gazette under the title ‘Hotel Classification and Criteria’,” Acharya said. She added that the resort would also have to undergo the Environment Impact Assessment to get the permission from DoT to resume operation. Meanwhile, the resort management has said that they will work towards meeting the standards fixed by the department and run the resort efficiently. “We will work towards meeting the standards fixed by the department and run the resort efficiently. We are saddened by the tragic incident. We will ensure that such incidents don’t occur in the future,” said Sudesh Gautam, the operator of the resort was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. The group, after travelling to Pokhara -- a popular mountainous tourist destination -- was on their way back home and stayed at Everest Panorama Resort in Daman. Those who were killed were Praveen Krishnan Nair, his wife Saranya Sasi and their three children and Ranjith Kumar Adatholath Punathil, his wife Indu Lakshmi Peethambaran Ragalatha and their son. Everest Panorama Resort was established 28 years ago in Daman Simbhajyang area, a tourist destination in Bagmati Province. The tourist numbers, according to Thaha Hotel Association, have plunged after the tragic accident of January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-suspends-license-of-resort-where-8-indian-tourists-died/story-muuHs5dSkj7FSaQZteuLYL.html
12-02-2020||World||Four survive 32 days adrift in Pacific by eating coconuts, drinking rainwater||Four people survived a month adrift in the Pacific by eating coconuts and drinking rainwater in an ordeal that claimed the lives of eight of their companions, including a baby, reports said Wednesday.The group, from Papua New Guinea’s Bougainville province, are believed to have spent 32 days at sea.The Solomon Star News reported the group set off from Bougainville on December 22, intending to celebrate Christmas in the Carteret Islands, about 100 kilometres (62 miles) away.But survivor Dominic Stally said their small boat capsized and a number of the group drowned.The rest managed to right the vessel but there were further fatalities as they floated in the remote waters at the mercy of powerful ocean currents.“We could do nothing with their dead bodies, we just have to let go of them at sea,” he told the newspaper.“A couple have died and left behind their baby and I am the one who held onto the baby and later the baby died as well.”Stally said a number of fishing vessels passed nearby without noticing them until they were finally picked up on January 23 off New Caledonia after drifting some 2,000 kilometres.The Star News said the survivors comprised two men, a woman and a girl aged about 12. They were dropped off in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, last Saturday and were discharged into the care of Papua New Guinea’s High Commissioner John Balavu after receiving treatment for dehydration.The High Commissioner and medics at the Honiara hospital were not immediately available for comment.Epic tales of survival are not uncommon in the Pacific, where tiny islands are separated by vast expanses of ocean. In January 2014, Salvadoran fisherman Jose Alvarenga washed up in the Marshalls, more than 13 months after he set off from Mexico’s west coast with a companion, who died during the voyage.He survived by eating raw fish and bird flesh while keeping hydrated by drinking rainwater, turtle blood and his own urine.His remarkable feat was initially greeted with scepticism, but he passed a polygraph test and an examination of ocean currents and boating records backed his claim.An Indonesian teenager survived seven weeks at sea in 2018 after his tiny fishing trap lost its moorings and ended up some 2,500 kilometres away off Guam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-survive-32-days-adrift-in-pacific-by-eating-coconuts-drinking-rainwater/story-kpIn3AFwgO3HRppQfHPGVK.html

They shall not seek medical treatment in other districts to curb the spread of the virus,” another notice, quoted by Chinese state media, said.The city, and much of Hubei province, has been under an unprecedented lockdown January 23 onwards to contain the outbreak.The Hubei housing authority has announced that all the residential areas in the province would restrict people from going in and out amid coronavirus outbreak, all people would have body temperature checked before entry, provincial media reported.“Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, is still at very difficult moment, although 2019 n-CoV has lower death rate compared to SARS and MERS, the city has not completely solved the problem of people-to-people transmission,” Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government top medical advisor on the epidemic said on Tuesday.The province reported 1,638 new cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia on February 11, with 94 new deaths and 417 cases of recovery. The total number of infections in the province climbed to 33,366, with 1,068 deaths and 2,639 cases of recovery.Hours earlier, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had given a new name to the illness that has triggered an international public health emergency, infecting nearly 400 more people in 24 countries.The name “COVID-19” does not make any reference to a place or animal to avoid stigmatisation.“We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said while announcing it.“Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks,” he added.The new name is taken from the words “corona”, “virus” and “disease”, with 2019 representing the year that it emerged.The outbreak emerged in Hubei’s capital city, Wuhan, in December and was reported to the WHO December 31.“COVID-19 (or Covid-19) stands for coronavirus disease in 2019,” Soumya Swaminathan, WHO’s chief scientist said in Geneva at a press briefing.“The virus itself is named by international group of virologists who will look into the taxonomy,” she said, adding: “But it is important to have a name for this disease that everybody uses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-climbs-to-1-114-in-china-as-who-names-it-covid-19/story-nWJtv1xdjXX4hmAUZ9doGP.html
