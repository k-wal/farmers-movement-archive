Wuhan, the provincial capital, recorded a total of 45,346 confirmed cases.Meanwhile, Beijing saw a sudden spike in the cases after the central city hospital reported 36 novel coronavirus infections as of Thursday, a sharp increase from nine cases two weeks earlier, leading many to fear a potential explosion of infection numbers in the capital, the Global Times reported.Among the infected at Fuxing Hospital in Xicheng district were eight medical workers, nine cleaning staff and 19 patients along with their families, the report said.“Considering 36 confirmed cases were found in Fuxing Hospital, it is more about one case of multiple infections rather than an epidemic of the whole area,” Wang Guangfa, director of the department of respiratory and critical care medicine at Peking University First Hospital, said.Beijing has so far reported 396 cases of novel coronavirus infection, with four deaths.Meanwhile, China has postponed the Boao Forum for Asia, its most prestigious annul meeting held in the picturesque Hainan province where it would invite top world leaders to discuss economy, trade and related issues.The forum was expected to take place from March 24-27.China hinted at postponing the annual parliament session to be held in the first week of March.Plans are also afoot to postpone the National People’s Congress -- the country’s parliament -- and Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) -- China’s top political advisory body, official media reported.China is the world’s second largest economy after the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-warns-coronavirus-yet-to-peak-amidst-its-spread-to-chinese-prisons-death-toll-over-2-200/story-iPEEXIDWHCBd59y1WTSR4O.html
21-02-2020||World||6 positive Covid-19 cases in Italian town cause shutdown of public spaces||Italian officials ordered schools, public buildings, restaurants and coffee shops closed in a tiny town in northern Italy Friday after six people tested positive for the new virus, including some who had not been to China or the source of the global health emergency.The new cases represented the first infections in Italy acquired through secondary contagion and tripled the country’s total to nine. The first to fall ill met with someone in early February who had returned from China on Jan. 21 without presenting any symptoms of the new virus, health authorities said.Authorities think that person passed the virus onto the 38-year-old Italian, who went to a hospital in the town of Codogno with flu-like symptoms on Feb. 18 but was sent home. He returned to the hospital after his conditions worsened and is now in intensive care, Lombardy region public welfare director Giulio Gallera said.The man’s wife and a friend who did sports with him have also tested positive for the virus. The Italian Health Ministry ordered anyone who came into direct contact with the three to be quarantined for 14 days. About 150 people, including medical personnel, were in isolation undergoing tests.Another three people in the Lombardy region also tested positive Friday, the health ministry said later.The mayor of Codogno issued a decree ordering the closure of all restaurants, coffee bars, schools and public gathering spots such as discos and gyms. The Health Ministry advised area residents to stay home as a precaution.Local officials in another town, Casalpusterlengo, ordered local schools closed through Tuesday. A third town, Castiglione d’Adda, said its libraries, public offices, gyms and garbage depots would be closed as a health precaution.“In other parts of the world, and also in China, it has been demonstrated that this system (of self-isolation) helps in a substantial way to block the spread,” Lombardy regional president Attilio Fontana said. “But we must not let ourselves be overcome by panic.”The Codogno hospital closed its emergency room, and staff were seen wearing masks as movers brought in new beds and furniture as the quarantine got under way. The manager who traveled to China remains asymptomatic but was put into isolation at another hospital, Gallera said.Rome’s infectious disease hospital is currently caring for three other people who were infected, including a Chinese couple from hard-hit Wuhan and an Italian who is now testing “persistently negative” for the virus after two weeks of anti-viral treatment.Despite the calls for safeguards, Italians were having a hard time finding protective face masks. A sampling of Milan pharmacies reported selling out out weeks ago, as did a pharmacist in Codogno.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-6-positive-covid-19-cases-in-italian-town-cause-shutdown-of-public-spaces/story-GgDKJaKClHcs8HADve6OIL.html
21-02-2020||World||US Air Force updates uniform standards to accommodate religious sentiment of various communities||The US Air Force has updated its dress code to accommodate the religious sentiments of various communities, including the Sikhs, making it easier for them to join the service.Finalised on February 7, the new Air Force policy establishes clear grooming and uniform standards for enlisted and officer airmen who are granted accommodations based on their sincerely held religious beliefs.The policy also clarifies that O-6 level commanders can approve an airman’s request for such an accommodation in no more than 30 days (or 60 days if the accommodation is requested outside of the US), and that an accommodation, once granted, will generally follow the airman throughout his or her career.While there are certain limited circumstances under which a religious accommodation may not be permissible due to safety considerations, the policy appears to be otherwise comprehensive, Sikh Coalition said in a statement.“No Sikh-American should have to choose between their religious beliefs and their career ambitions,” said Giselle Klapper, Sikh Coalition staff attorney.“Sikhs have served honourably and capably in the US Armed Forces and other militaries around the world, and while we are eager for a blanket proclamation that all observant Sikh-Americans can serve in every branch of the military without seeking accommodations, this policy clarification is a great step forward towards ensuring equality of opportunity and religious freedom in the Air Force,” Klapper said.The Air Force’s clarification closely resembles the US Army’s landmark 2017 policy adjustment, which similarly clarified the terms and process for soldiers requesting religious accommodations.“Both of these policy changes are the direct result of the years-long campaign, launched in 2009 by the Sikh Coalition and our pro bono co-counsel at McDermott Will and Emery, that has included extensive advocacy efforts and litigation to ensure that observant Sikhs and other religious minorities are able to serve without compromising their faith,” the Sikh Coalition said in a statement.According to the Sikh Coalition, Airman 1st Class Gurchetan Singh is the first Sikh-American to receive an accommodation to serve in the Air National Guard. Singh’s accommodation was approved in September 2019, and he will soon head to Basic and Technical Training with a specialty in Cyber Transport Systems.“The Sikh Coalition has helped me realize my career dream while ensuring that I stay true to myself and my faith.“Their legal assistance means that I won’t face discrimination as I step up to serve, and I’m proud to help clear the way for other Sikhs who may want to join the US Air Force by demonstrating that we can serve honourably while maintaining our articles of faith,” he said in a statement.To date, the Sikh Coalition has helped more than 20 Sikh-Americans secure accommodations to serve in the US military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-air-force-updates-uniform-standards-to-accommodate-religious-sentiment-of-various-communities/story-K8cgBms0eWsxHR9IfehrlI.html

They were taken by ambulances and will be put into quarantine after further medical checks, the health ministry said.More than 620 passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise liner have been infected with the coronavirus, the most outside mainland China.It has been quarantined in Yokohama port since Feb. 3 and initially had about 3,700 passengers and crew on board. Hundreds of international passengers from the ship have now left for chartered flights home including those from the United States, Hong Kong and Canada.“I’d like to thank all the government agencies and medical staff...We will accept Taiwan’s further quarantine,” Chen said in his post, which showed him wearing a mask, goggle and full protective suit while the plane taxied down the runway.Authorities said five Taiwanese nationals have tested positive for the virus on the ship and remained in Japan.Taiwan now has 26 confirmed cases. It has banned entry to Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China and suspended most flights to its neighbour.A taxi-driver died from the new coronavirus last week, the first such fatality in Taiwan.The government this week proposed a bill to penalize those who violated home quarantine orders, saying a violation would be fined up to T$2 million ($65,845) or two years in jail.In a response to panic buying of masks, the government is building several mask production lines and Premier Su Tseng-chang said Taiwan will more than double its daily mask production to 10 million by early March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/never-been-this-happy-evacuees-from-coronavirus-hit-japan-cruise-ship-reach-home-in-taiwan/story-8hsryJxlIAt2XUMwj8QHUL.html
21-02-2020||World||China praises Pak’s ‘enormous efforts’ as FATF retains Islamabad in grey list||China on Friday praised close-ally Pakistan’s “enormous efforts” in combating terror financing and played down reports that it backed India and other countries against Islamabad at the just- concluded FATF meeting in Paris that retained the country in the Grey List. Asked about reports that China has joined India and other countries in sending a strong message to Pakistan and urging it to fulfil its commitments to fight terror financing and money laundering, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told an online media briefing here that the Financial Action Task Force meeting has decided to give Pakistan more time to implement its action plan on money laundering and terrorist financing. “China’s position on the relevant issue remains unchanged. Pakistan has made enormous efforts in improving its counter-terror financing system, which has been recognised by the vast majority of the FATF members at its latest plenary meeting concluded on February 20 in Paris,” he said. “It was decided at the meeting that Pakistan will be allowed more time to continue implementing its action plan,” Geng said, a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping.During the telephonic conversation, the two leaders agreed to step up communication and exchanges at the highest level to strengthen Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership. China said it stands ready to work with relevant parties to offer more assistance to Pakistan in its efforts against terrorism. “China maintains that the purpose and aim of the FATF is to support countries’ efforts to strengthen institutions against money laundering and terror financing and safeguard international financing system,” the spokesman said. The Paris-based FATF, which supervises effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing, during the meeting decided continuation of Pakistan in the “Grey List”. The FATF decided to maintain Pakistan’s status on its ‘Grey List’ of countries with inadequate control over curbing money laundering and terrorism financing until June, when the next review will take place, Pakistani newspaper Dawn quoted a statement issued by the Finance Division as saying on Friday.The global terror financing watchdog also warned Pakistan that stern action will be taken against it if the country fails to check the flow of money to terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) among others, according to sources.The FATF in October last year decided to keep Pakistan on its Grey List for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups like LeT and JeM.If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.The plenary noted that Pakistan addressed only a few of the 27 tasks given to it in controlling funding to terror groups like LeT, JeM and the Hizbul Mujahideen, which are responsible for a series of attacks in India. The FATF said Pakistan has to swiftly complete its full action plan by June, the source said. India has been maintaining that Pakistan extends regular support to terror groups like LeT, JeM and the Hizbul Mujahideen, whose prime target is India, and has urged the FATF to take action against Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-praises-pakistan-s-enormous-efforts-as-fatf-retains-islamabad-in-grey-list/story-KODDVLOf724NOMvPVWEqcN.html
21-02-2020||World||WHO team to visit coronavirus-hit Wuhan on Saturday||A team of WHO experts would travel to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic, on Saturday to investigate the disease outbreak, the global health body announced on Friday. The 12-member team, which arrived in China on Monday, was initially designated to visit only Beijing, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces as the Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan was conspicuously absent from the list.However, the team was finally given the permission to visit Wuhan by the Chinese government.The death toll in China due to coronavirus has gone up to 2,236 while the overall confirmed infection cases have climbed to 75,567, the country’s health officials said.“The international experts currently in China to investigate the novel coronavirus outbreak will travel to Wuhan on Saturday,” state-run Xinhua quoted a World Health Organisation announcement made in Geneva.The experts team, which is joined by the Chinese health experts, talked to Hubei authorities during a teleconference and discussed the epidemic situation, control and prevention measures in communities and rural areas, wildlife management and drug and vaccine development, Xinhua reported. Besides controlling the spread of the virus, a major task of the WHO team along with their Chinese counterparts is to come up with a standard medicine to cure the disease.Chinese officials have said that more than half of the patients are being treated with Traditional Chinese Medicine in Wuhan that helped many of them to recover.Several antiviral drugs have been applied in clinical trials against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and some have shown fairly good clinical efficacy, a Chinese official said.Chinese researchers have narrowed down their focus to a few existing drugs, including Chloroquine Phosphate, Favipiravir and Remdesivir, after multiple rounds of screening, Zhang Xinmin, director of the China National Center for Biotechnology Development under the Ministry of Science and Technology, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-led-international-team-to-visit-coronavirus-hit-wuhan-on-saturday/story-m4ryUc9lIdaY1j13SDlx7K.html

Washington and the Taliban said they would sign the accord provided a week-long partial truce holds.The agreement would mark a major turning point in the conflict, setting the conditions for a deal that could ultimately see US troops pull out of Afghanistan after more than 18 years.Kabulov said Moscow hoped that nothing would stand in the way of the accord, urging all sides in Afghanistan to begin dialogue after the conclusion of the deal.“The real work will start afterwards,” he was quoted as saying.“This phase is important to us. That’s why the signing of the agreement between the United States and Taliban is necessary and important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taliban-deal-an-important-event-for-peace-hails-russia/story-IdfHoEQ2qF2fFN3NeLYIEI.html

Richard Grenell, the current US ambassador to Germany, has been named as the new acting DNI.Trump was most upset reportedly about the presence at the hearing of House intelligence chairman, Adam Schiff, the Democrat who headed the impeachment inquiry leading to the president’s impeachment in December, and then acted as the lead House manager to urge the Senate to dismiss the president from office.Shelby Preston, the intelligence official who briefed the lawmakers, is reported to have specifically said that Moscow has “developed a preference” for Trump.Russia denied it was interfering in the US elections. “These are new paranoid reports, which, to our deep regret, will continue to grow in number as the election day approaches,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “Naturally, they have nothing to do with the truth.”Russia has also denied it meddled in the 2016 elections, which was first alleged publicly by US intelligence agencies, and confirmed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller who pinned it on Russian military intelligence GRU and indicted several of its officials for it, who will never be tried probably.President Trump, who has bristled at any suggestion his election was helped by Russians, has been only too willing to accept their denials most famously, favoured President Vladimir Putin’s denial over his own intelligence agencies at a joint new conference in Helsinki, Finland in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intelligence-agencies-tell-lawmakers-russia-meddling-in-2020-polls/story-AFTkDgpXqp3x8vaSMrykrL.html
21-02-2020||World||Newsmaker: The significance of Christina Koch’s space journey||Everyone tosses and turns after getting into bed. Finding the perfect position for a good night’s sleep can be tricky. It is almost impossible for Christina Koch. She returned to Earth after spending 328 days on the international space station (ISS), setting the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman.“How will I sleep when I return to Earth? Will I sleep on my stomach, my back, my side? Will the firmness of the mattress matter more-so than it ever has before? And what about sleeping next to someone in a bed? I’ve been floating in a bag by myself for 327 nights. Hopefully, my husband doesn’t kick me to the couch!” she said.“Sleep in space has been some of the most restful I’ve ever had – no hotspots, no tossing, no turning, never too hot or too cold. I just float in my body’s natural position,” Koch told NASA from the ISS, anticipating her return.And it is not just the bed she had to get used to. She had to get used to watching just one sunrise and sunset a day instead of the 16 she experienced daily while zipping around the Earth every 90 minutes at 17,500 miles per hour.Once on Earth, she had to re-learn how to walk. “I think the most physically shocking readjustment was the balance. On Earth, we rely on our eyes and inner ear to maintain stability. On orbit, without gravity pulling down, the mind quickly stops listening to the inner ear. The eyes take over … we rely solely on visual cues.” She was part of the first all-woman spacewalk in October last year.In space, she missed a fork and knife; eating steak or pasta out of the packet with a spoon and sometimes injecting coconut oil into her coffee just to mix things up. Taking a real hot shower with the water running off her fingertips was a sensation she had forgotten. For eleven months she had been using a re-hydrated towel containing soap, a no-rinse shampoo, and a towel to “dry off” with. “When the water hits your skin in orbit, it just sits there.”Despite these challenges, when NASA extended Koch’s mission shortly after she was launched to space on March 14, 2019, she said it was “awesome”. The 41-year-old is outdoorsy and likes backpacking, rock climbing, paddling, surfing, running, and living in outer space. Had it not been for her parents, her husband, and her LBD or ‘Little Brown Dog’ called Sadie Lou, she would have liked to stay in space. “If my friends and loved ones could visit here, I would probably stay here forever,” Koch said in an #AskNasa segment from the ISS.Staying in orbit has its perks too. How many photography-enthusiasts can really say that they have captured the contrails and the halo created during the second stage burn of a rocket? Koch is an electrical engineer and started her career in NASAs lab for high energy astrophysics, where she contributed to scientific instruments for several of the US space agency’s missions. She has also worked in several remote scientific bases including in research stations at the South Pole, Greenland, Alaska and Samoa. She was selected to train as an astronaut in 2013.“Most kids probably dream of becoming an astronaut. I was just the one that never grew out of it,” Koch said in an interview from the ISS.While on ISS, she conducted several microgravity experiments. She did some botany studies to understand the role of gravity on plant biology and grew Mizuna mustard greens. She worked on a set of experiments to study the behaviour of fire in space. She also worked on kidney cells investigating innovative treatments for kidney stones, osteoporosis, and toxic chemical exposure.But the biggest science experiment was perhaps herself. With NASA planning to take another go at lunar landing and deep-space exploration missions to Mars, it becomes crucial to understand how the human body would react to prolonged stay in space.A study on twins done by NASA showed that when one of the brothers, astronaut Scott Kelly, returned from his 340-day mission in 2016 he was two inches taller, there were mutation in his DNA, and his gut microbiome had changed. An extended stay in space can also cause farsightedness and swelling of the optic nerve.Koch and her other colleagues who have stayed in ISS for extended periods will help broaden NASA’s understanding on the effect gravitation fields, space radiation, and distance from Earth on humans. It also answers questions about the effects of isolation, being in a confined space and consuming a diet high in freeze-dried food. Though many male astronauts have her beat when it comes to the time spent in space, she would provide an understanding of whether the effects on women are any different.Despite all this, when asked in an interview on CBS whether she saw herself as a trailblazer, she replied, “Sometimes I joke that having the longest record for time spent up there is not about defying the laws of physics. I didn’t necessarily have a ride back home I could have hopped on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/newsmaker-the-significance-of-christina-koch-s-space-journey/story-G1W2oXRDPicLmLoYCrtkoK.html
21-02-2020||World||Covid-19 outbreak leads to Hong Kongers making own masks amid shortages||With chronic face mask shortages in the midst of a virus outbreak, Hong Kongers have started making their own -- with a pop-up production line and seamstresses churning them out on sewing machines.In one of the most densely populated cities on earth, face masks have become hot property as people scramble for protection against the new deadly coronavirus.Long queues -- sometimes thousands strong -- routinely crop up outside pharmacies when supplies are in, and there is anger at the government’s failure to have stockpiled.Some are turning to DIY solutions -- albeit of questionable quality.Judy, a 73-year-old out shopping in the district of Wanchai, was spotted in a homemade mask.“I found the material -- my handkerchief, and some non-woven fabric -- and I combined them and used some wire for the top, and some elastic,” she told AFP, declining to give her surname.While Hong Kong’s economy reels, business has been brisk on one street in the working-class Sham Shui Po district that boasts many fabric and tailoring shops.A colourful array of cloth masks hangs outside many of the cramped storefronts as shoppers haggle over the din of whirring sewing machines.Elase Wong, a tailor, said she was giving away her face mask sewing design.“Some people couldn’t buy any masks... So if they can make them themselves, that would be great,” she told AFP.“I hope everyone can achieve self-sufficiency.” The cost of masks has skyrocketed with scarcity and the government resisting price controls or rationing, as in nearby Macau and Taiwan.A set of 50 simple surgical masks can sell for up to 300 Hong Kong dollar (USD 40), while the top of the range N95 variety is going for as high as 1,800 Hong Kong dollars a box.A film director surnamed Tong was this week putting the finishing touches to a face mask assembly line in an industrial building.“I was shocked by the price of face masks,” he told AFP.“I did some research and realised that masks are not that difficult to make. Why do people have to bear such a high cost? Because there is no production line in Hong Kong”.With the help of an investor he managed to import a machine from India, and plans to ship more.Currently in the testing phase, the device will produce 60-80 surgical masks per minute from Saturday in a dust-free room.Tong said the masks will be sold online for 1-2 Hong Dollars each, limited to one box per person.The administration of chief executive Carrie Lam says it is doing all it can to secure new supplies of face masks amid a global shortage.Output has been ramped up on a prison labour production line and there are plans to set aside 1.5 Hong Kong dollars billion to support the creation of domestic factories.The lack of stockpiles has sparked criticism of Lam, even from among her pro-Beijing political allies.Many have expressed surprise that a city which suffered 299 deaths during the 2003 SARS outbreak was not better prepared.Since SARS, which Beijing initially covered up, Hong Kongers have embraced higher communal hygiene standards and face masks have long been a common sight, especially during the winter flu season.Joseph Kwan, a public health expert from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said widespread mask use during SARS also lowered cases of the common cold that year.In a tightly packed city like Hong Kong, new viruses will “spread like wildfire if nobody wears a mask”, he said.“It would be a public health disaster”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-covid-19-outbreak-leads-to-hong-kongers-making-own-masks-amid-shortages/story-yKrzUhmilfyKtUezNQy7TK.html
21-02-2020||World||2 more Covid-19 related deaths in Iran, 13 new cases confirmed||Iranian health authorities on Friday reported two more deaths from the new virus that emerged in China and said the fatalities were from among 13 new confirmed cases of the virus in Iran.The report by the semiofficial Mehr news agency came as Iranians voted in nationwide parliamentary elections. After authorities reported two earlier deaths this week, the death toll from COVID-19, the illness caused by virus, stands at four in Iran.So far, 18 cases have been confirmed in Iran, including the four who died.The spokesman of the health ministry, Kianoush Jahanpour, said the newly detected cases are all linked with city of Qom where the first two elderly patients died on Wednesday.Jahanpour said the new cases were either from Qom or had visited the city recently. He said four of them have been hospitalized in the capital, Tehran, and two in northern province of Gilan.Minoo Mohraz, an Iranian health ministry official, said the virus “possibly came from Chinese workers who work in Qom and traveled to China.” She did not elaborate. A Chinese company has been building a solar power plant in Qom.Concerns over the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, prompted authorities in Iran this week to close all schools and Shiite seminaries in Qom, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) south of Tehran.Also, earlier news reports said Iran had recently evacuated 60 Iranian students from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the epidemic. The students were quarantined upon their return to Iran and were discharged after 14 days without any health problems.Qom is a popular religious destination and a center of learning and religious studies for Shiite Muslims from inside Iran, as well as Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan and Azerbaijan. It is also known for its cattle farms.Iran once relied heavily on China to buy its oil and some Chinese companies have continued doing business with Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions. Unlike other countries — such as Saudi Arabia, which barred its citizens and residents from traveling to China — Iran has not imposed such measures. But it has suspended all passenger flights with China for the past two weeks, allowing only cargo flights.Iran’s civil aviation spokesman Reza Jafarzadeh said on Thursday that the “cargo flights, if necessary, are under supervision, and controls imposed by the health ministry are carried out.”The new virus emerged in China in December. Since then, more than 76,000 people have been infected globally, in as many as 27 countries, with more than 2,200 deaths being reported, mostly in China.The new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal. The World Health Organization recently named the illness it causes COVID-19, referring to both coronavirus and its origin late last year.There have been few virus cases in the Middle East so far. Nine cases have been confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, which is a popular tourist destination, and one case in Egypt. Of the nine in the UAE, seven are Chinese nationals, one is a Filipino and another an Indian national.Iran’s neighbor Iraq, which has reported no cases of the virus, took measures to contain it by suspending visas on arrival for Iranian passport holders and direct flights between the two countries.Also Friday, one of 11 Israelis who were flown home after being quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan has tested positive for the virus, the first case to be reported inside Israel, the Health Ministry.The Israeli cruise ship passengers, who had all initially tested negative, arrived on a charter plane overnight. They were met by medics in protection suits and immediately taken to the Sheba Hospital near Tel Aviv, where they will be kept in quarantine.Another four Israelis were hospitalized in Japan after testing positive for the virus. Israel has cancelled all flights to and from China, and is requiring Israelis returning from China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore or Thailand to be quarantined at home for two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-2-more-covid-19-related-deaths-in-iran-13-new-cases-confirmed/story-OW21cc8ZSSXKhDyTiyk73M.html

21-02-2020||World||Iraq & Kuwait on alert as Covid-19 deaths rise in Iran||Iraqi and Kuwaiti authorities were on high alert Friday after banning travel the previous day to and from Iran, where authorities say the death toll from the new coronavirus has hit four.Iran’s health ministry Friday reported two more deaths among 13 new diagnosed cases of the COVID-19 virus, doubling the total number of deaths in the Islamic republic and taking the total number of diagnosed infections there to 18.Since December, the virus has killed more than 2,200 people in China, the epidemic’s epicentre.Elsewhere in the world, it has killed over a dozen people and spread across some 26 countries.In the Middle East, two elderly men in Iran were the first confirmed deaths from the virus, which has also spread to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel, which confirmed its first case on Friday.Both Iraq and Kuwait, which respectively share land and maritime borders with Iran, have not confirmed any cases of the virus internally.But the outbreak in the Islamic Republic has sparked alarm, especially since many of the coronavirus cases involved residents of the holy city of Qom, a popular destination for Kuwaiti and Iraqi Shiites.Shiite leader Moqtada Sadr, a major figure in Iraqi politics, himself studies in an Islamic seminary in Qom.Iraq is a popular destination for millions of Iranian Shiite pilgrims, including religious scholars from Qom, who visit holy sites in the southern provinces of Najaf and Karabala.Iran is also the second-largest exporter of goods to Iraq, sending products to the value of around nine billion dollars annually.Iraq’s top Shiite cleric on Friday called on authorities to be ready to stem any outbreak.“The scale of preparations should match that of the threat,” said Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani in his weekly sermon delivered by a representative.“We call on relevant authorities to be up to the level of responsibility”.A key player in Iraq, Iran supplies Baghdad with the energy it desperately needs to combat chronic power cuts and wields sizable influence over political and paramilitary factions in the country.American threats of sanctions and tit-for-tat bombings between US and Iranian forces on Iraq’s soil have done little to stem the movement of people and goods between Tehran and Baghdad.The COVID-19 virus, however, has triggered unprecedented measures.Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from the Islamic republic, with Iraq’s health ministry announcing people in Iran were barred from entering the country “until further notice”.“Iranians are prohibited from entering (Iraq),” a senior official told AFP, adding that border crossings with Iran had been closed, with only returning Iraqis allowed to pass through.Those Iraqis would be examined and, if necessary, placed in quarantine for 14 days, the health ministry said.Iraqi nationals are also not allowed to travel to Iran, according to the ministry.The border closure followed a backlash against a Wednesday announcement of visa waivers for Iranian nationals wishing to travel to Iraq.Iraqis took to social media using the hashtag “close the border” and local officials called for a ban on the entry of goods and people.Iraqi airports were already screening travellers for the virus and national carrier Iraqi Airways has suspended flights to Iran.Iraq had previously issued a ban on the entry of Chinese nationals.In Kuwait, national carrier Kuwait Airways announced Thursday it would suspend all flights to Iran, while its ports will also be closed to passengers travelling to and from the country.Kuwaitis were advised not to travel to Qom, and were warned anyone arriving from the city they would be quarantined.Social media networks have become fertile ground for fears among Iraqis who say the healthcare system -- battered by waves of conflict -- cannot accomodate a coronavirus outbreak.Hospitals are generally poorly equipped in terms of equipment and medicine, while some still require reconstruction and refurbishment.More than 20,000 doctors have left the country since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, according to health professionals.There are less than 10 doctors for every 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.Iraqis are circulating prayers on social media networks, while videos circulating online showed Iraqi and Iranian families lighting incense in their homes with the belief that it will prevent infection.Some said they were turning to herbalists for natural remedies, while others joked that alcohol consumption could combat the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-iraq-kuwait-on-alert-as-covid-19-deaths-rise-in-iran/story-SibtiFklpCxUtE6T73J9kO.html
21-02-2020||World||Germany to take swift action on far-right threat post deadly shootings||German ministers promised on Friday to ramp up security and put more police on the streets to quell public fears, two days after a racist gunman killed nine people.Thousands joined vigils on Thursday night to show solidarity with the victims of the right-wing extremist attack at a shisha bar and cafe in the city of Hanau, which sparked debates over gun laws and protection of migrants and minorities.Announcing an “increased police presence” at mosques, train stations, airports and borders, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said right-wing extremism was the “biggest security threat facing Germany”.He said it had left “a trail of blood” in recent months -- two died in an attack on a synagogue in the city of Halle in October and a pro-migrant politician was murdered at his home in June.Separately, 12 men were arrested across Germany a week ago on suspicion of planning attacks on mosques aimed at bringing about “a civil-war-like situation” in Germany.- ‘Time bombs’ -Seehofer insisted that “in this government... no-one is blind” to the threat from the extreme right.He and justice minister Christine Lambrecht highlighted that Germany has updated its law on firearms licensing in recent weeks and a new bill targeting online hate speech is being considered.In December, Seehofer also announced hundreds of new posts for federal police and security services to strengthen surveillance of the far-right scene.But he warned that “despite all our efforts, we cannot completely rule out such terrible crimes”.Federal police chief Holger Muench said “around half” of those who carry out attacks with extreme-right motivations were previously unknown to his officers.Suspects in both the Halle synagogue attack and the Hanau shootings appear to have been radicalised largely online, publishing racist screeds only shortly before their attacks.“The problem is perpetrators who act almost without any structure behind them, practically with only an internet connection... how can potential perpetrators be identified, that’s the big challenge,” Muench said.Such people were “time bombs”, justice minister Lambrecht said.King’s College London counter-terror expert Peter Neumann told Die Welt daily that “what is already happening regarding jihadism must happen regarding right-wing extremism”.“Security services should infiltrate and surveil forums” where people with far-right leanings gather, he said.- Questions for AfD -The Hanau shooter legally owned firearms, dragging Germany’s gun licensing laws into the focus of public debate.People demonstrating Thursday night at Berlin’s Brandenburg gate held signs calling to “disarm fascists”.There are thought to be around 5.4 million weapons in circulation in Germany, according to Bild newspaper.Increasing numbers of guns are being seized from radical-right suspects, mounting to 1,091 in 2018 compared with 676 the previous year.Even members of the Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party have argued for tougher controls, in a country where hunting and sport shooting remain popular pastimes.The role far-right political party AfD, in parliament since 2017, has also come under scrutiny -- some arguing that they provide the ideological foundations for extremists.The anti-immigrant outfit, whose leaders denounce Germany’s culture of remembrance for Nazi crimes, should be “placed under surveillance” by security services, Social Democratic Party (SPD) secretary general Lars Klingbeil said.“One man opened fire in Hanau, but there were many who provided him with ammunition,” Klingbeil told public broadcaster ARD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-take-swift-action-on-far-right-threat-post-deadly-shootings/story-CG34WlAMcuBfQY2E36ODjM.html

It is determined to prevent a fresh influx of displaced people adding to the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it already hosts.Erdogan also addressed the conflict in Libya with Merkel and Macron, saying they should work together. Libya has been mired in chaos since 2011 when a NATO-backed uprising led to the killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. Moscow backs military strongman Khalifa Haftar, who launched an offensive last April against the rival government in Tripoli, which Turkey supports. France has publicly denied taking sides in the conflict but analysts say it supports Haftar alongside Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.After a recent peace conference in Berlin, countries including Russia, Turkey, France and Egypt agreed to end foreign interference in Libya and respect a UN arms embargo, but violations have continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-president-erdogan-urges-concrete-action-over-idlib-in-call-with-german-chancellor-merkel-french-president-macron/story-uqueTW53heTkoMV9rDhm7I.html
21-02-2020||World||After poll loss, Indian-origin Leo Varadkar quits as Ireland PM||Leo Varadkar, who became the first Indian-origin prime minister of Ireland in 2017, resigned on Thursday night after his party failed to win a majority or emerge as the single largest party in the February 8 election that threw up a hung parliament.Varadkar, 41, will continue in the post until the next government takes over, an official announcement in Dublin said. Talks to form a coalition government are due to be held over three weeks, during which Varadkar will not be able to make major policy decisions.After the first sitting of the Ireland parliament after the election concluded on Thursday, Varadkar said: “The responsibility is now on all of us to provide good government and, indeed good opposition, because that’s what the people have every right to expect”.The majority mark in the 160-seat parliament (effectively 159, since the speaker does not vote) is 80. Varadkar’s Fine Gael party won 35 seats, Fianna Fail 38 and Sinn Fein 35. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail are against forming a coalition with Sinn Fein.With a base in both Ireland and Northern Ireland (part of UK), Sinn Fein emerged as a major factor, exploiting ennui in the country wracked by rising housing costs and the people not experiencing economic recovery in recent years.Sinn Fein was known as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army that was responsible for violence and terrorism for years in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, until peace returned with the Good Friday agreement of 1998.Sinn Fein seeks reunification of the island of Ireland, promising a referendum within five years. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have the same objective in the long-term, but do not favour the referendum soon enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-poll-loss-indian-origin-leo-varadkar-quits-as-ireland-pm/story-WoLSfidmaqrgZnASgl0VqK.html

Assange has said that his youngest child and the child’s mother are French.Assange’s lawyers noted the request for asylum was “not an ordinary demand” because Assange is not on French soil.Dupond-Moretti said the French asylum request would be based on humanitarian and health grounds, arguing that Assange was showing signs of “psychological torture”.“Article 53 of our constitution also allows for France to give refuge to a man who is being threatened on reasons of his freedom of expression,” he told Europe 1.The 48-year old Assange, who spent seven years holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy before he was dragged out last April, is wanted in the United States on 18 counts, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He could spend decades behind bars if convicted.Assange is currently in jail in London, and Judge Vanessa Baraitser will hear arguments next week as to why he should or should not be sent to the United States.Australian-born Assange made global headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.An earlier request made in 2015 by Assange to get asylum in France was rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-julian-assange-may-seek-asylum-in-france-says-lawyer/story-zdw0DIQ1FnISWtZboUX0NJ.html
21-02-2020||World||Scientist honour teen climate activist Greta Thunberg by naming a new snail species after her||Scientists have discovered a new species of land snail, and have named it Craspedotropis gretathunbergae in honour of the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg for her efforts to raise awareness about climate change. According to the study, published in the Biodiversity Data Journal, the newly discovered species belongs to the so-called caenogastropods -- a group of land snails known to be sensitive to drought, temperature extremes, and forest degradation.The scientists, including evolutionary ecologist Menno Schilthuizen from Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands, said the snails were found very close to the research field station at Kuala Belalong Field Studies Centre in Brunei. They added that the snails were discovered at the foot of a steep hill-slope, next to a river bank, foraging at night on the green leaves of understorey plants. The effort aided by amateur scientist J.P. Lim, who found the first individual of the snail said, “Naming this snail after Greta Thunberg is our way of acknowledging that her generation will be responsible for fixing problems that they did not create.” “And it’s a promise that people from all generations will join her to help,” Lim said. The researchers said they approached Thunberg who said that she would be “delighted” to have this species named after her. The study work including, fieldwork, morphological study, and classification of identified specimen was carried out in a field centre with basic equipment and no internet access, the scientists said. According to the study, the work was done by untrained ‘citizen scientists’ guided by experts, on a 10-day taxon expedition. “While we are aware that this way of working has its limitations in terms of the quality of the output (for example, we were unable to perform dissections or to do extensive literature searches), the benefits include rapid species discovery and on-site processing of materials,” the researchers wrote in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientist-honour-teen-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-by-naming-a-new-snail-species-after-her/story-E7nboUxIAeXF3uRl2bcYML.html

He was hospitalised on January 25 and transferred to the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital for treatment on January 30.“Peng Yinhua, a frontline doctor at Jiangxia First Hospital in virus epicenter #Wuhan, died of #COVID19 on Thursday night. He had earlier delayed his wedding as he wanted to treat patients with the disease at hospital,” state-run Global Times tweeted on Friday.He died from the virus despite doctors’ all-out efforts to save his life.Chinese health authorities have asked health agencies to apply for the honour of martyr for deceased medical staff to the veteran’s affairs authorities, comfort the families of the deceased and help solve their difficulties, as well as publicise stories of those who sacrificed their lives during the epidemic, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old Chinese doctor, who was one of the first people to sound the alarm about the new outbreak died on February 7.Li sent a message to his medical-school alumni group on December 30, warning that seven patients had been quarantined at Wuhan Central Hospital after coming down with a respiratory illness that seemed like the SARS coronavirus. But Wuhan police reprimanded and silenced Li.Earlier, Dr Liu Zhiming, head of the Wuchang Hospital died due to the virus. On the same day Liu Fan, senior nurse of the hospital, died along with her parents and brother due to the virus.China’s National Health Commission earlier said that a total of 1,716 medical workers had contracted the infection as of February 11.

21-02-2020||World||Week-long ‘reduction in violence’ in Afghanistan to start on Saturday||A week-long “reduction in violence” between the Taliban, the US, and Afghan security forces will commence shortly, an official said Friday, ahead of the signing of a possible deal between Washington and the insurgents.If the partial truce goes ahead, it would mark a historic step in more than 18 years of gruelling conflict in Afghanistan and would pave the way for a deal that could, ultimately, see the war end.“The reduction in violence will start from 22 February and will last for one week,” Javed Faisal, Afghanistan’s National Security Council spokesman, told AFP.US Forces-Afghanistan declined to comment. One Taliban source in Pakistan confirmed to AFP the partial truce would commence Saturday.The United States has been in talks with the Taliban for more than a year to secure a deal in which it would pull out thousands of troops in return for Taliban security guarantees and commitments. A reduction in violence would show the Taliban can control their forces and demonstrate good faith ahead of any signing, which would see the Pentagon withdraw about half of the 12,000-13,000 troops currently in Afghanistan. Afghan officials have said the US-Taliban deal could be finalised February 29 in Doha, assuming the reduction in violence proceeds to plan.The Taliban source in Pakistan said: “both sides have agreed to sign the agreement on February 29”, adding that talks between the Taliban and the government, needed to cement a broader peace deal, are slated to start March 10.A second Taliban official in Pakistan told AFP the reduction in violence might not start until Sunday.Whether it is “Saturday or Sunday does not matter. The Taliban leadership council has basically given a green light to start the reduction in violence and sign the deal,” the official said, adding, “it’s happening”.In Afghanistan’s southern province of Kandahar, which is seen as the Taliban’s heartland, one insurgent told AFP he had received orders to stand down.“We have got the orders from our leadership that reduction in violence period will start from Saturday, and we have been ordered to be ready for it,” the source said.The US and the Taliban have been tantalisingly close to a deal before, only to see President Donald Trump nix it in September at the 11th hour amid continued insurgent violence.Any truce comes fraught with danger, and analysts warn the attempt to stem Afghanistan’s bloodshed is laced with complications and could fail at any time.Or, worse still, they say warring parties could exploit a lull to reconfigure their forces and secure a battlefield advantage.On Thursday, the deputy leader of the Taliban said the insurgents are “fully committed” to a deal with Washington.“That we stuck with such turbulent talks with the enemy we have fought bitterly for two decades, even as death rained from the sky, testifies to our commitment to ending the hostilities and bringing peace to our country,” Sirajuddin Haqqani wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times.Haqqani is also head of the Haqqani network, a US-designated terror group that is one of the most dangerous factions fighting Afghan and US-led NATO forces in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/week-long-reduction-in-violence-in-afghanistan-to-start-on-saturday/story-ozAacF6UTdTQ5V7bzdDeCJ.html

Xu made the remarks during a press briefing. Zhou Qi, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also told reporters companies which have resumed operations should ensure proper ventilation and maintain a safe distance among workers. Uptick in coronavirus casesChina reported an uptick in new cases of coronavirus on Friday, boosted by more than 200 people testing positive for the disease in two prisons outside of Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.The epidemic is set to be a major focus of discussion at a meeting on the weekend of finance leaders from the Group of 20 major economies, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said, amid rising risks to global growth.Japan and Singapore are on the brink of recession and South Korea on Friday said its exports to China slumped in the first 20 days of February as the outbreak upends global supply chains.Mainland China had 889 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections as of Feb. 20, the National Health Commission said, up from 394 cases a day earlier. The death toll rose by 118 to 2,236, mostly in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, which remains under virtual lockdown.Infections found in two jails, in the northern province of Shandong and the eastern province of Zhejiang, made up most of the 258 newly confirmed cases outside Hubei.Top officials deemed responsible for the outbreaks have been fired, authorities said on Friday.South Korea - new coronavirus hotspotThere have been 11 deaths outside of mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements.South Korea’s fourth-largest city is the latest hotspot, with streets abandoned and residents holed up indoors after dozens of people caught the new coronavirus in what authorities described as a “super-spreading event” at a church.The deserted shopping malls and cinemas of Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, became one of the most striking images outside China of an outbreak that international authorities are trying to stop from becoming a global pandemic.Tokyo cancels indoor eventsThe Tokyo Metropolitan government said it would cancel or postpone major indoor events for the next three weeks, Jiji newswire reported, as the Japanese capital prepares to host the 2020 Olympic Games starting in July.In Hong Kong, which has confirmed 69 cases and two deaths from the disease, dozens of police officers were quarantined after an officer tested positive following a banquet with 59 other police on Tuesday.Iranian health officials urged all religious gatherings to be suspended in Qom, news agency ISNA said on Thursday, after two more people tested positive for the coronavirus in the holy city, where two died of it this week.Two Australians evacuated from a quarantined cruise ship in Japan had tested positive for the pathogen at a quarantine camp in the country’s far north and would be hospitalised near their homes, Australia’s health department said on Friday.Japan began allowing passengers who test negative to leave and hundreds disembarked this week, with hundreds more set to disembark on Friday.Impact on global growthAs G20 finance ministers prepare to meet over the weekend in Saudi Arabia, the IMF said it was too early to tell what impact the virus would have on global growth.“We are still hoping that the impact will be a V shaped curve” with a sharp decline in China and sharp rebound after the containment of the virus, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.“But we are not excluding that it might turn out to be a different scenario like a U curve where the impact is somewhat longer.”The earliest vaccine for the coronavirus would be submitted for clinical trials around late April, China’s Vice Science and Technology Minister Xu Nanping said.Asian shares dipped on Friday as fears over the creeping spread of the disease sent funds fleeing to the sheltered shores of U.S. assets, lifting the dollar to three-year highs.China’s commerce ministry said it is looking into new fiscal, tax, and financial measures to further support companies.Fears spreadFears of the contagion triggered violence in Ukraine, where residents of a central town clashed with police, burned tires and hurled projectiles at a convoy of buses carrying evacuees from Hubei to a quarantine centre.Hundreds of helmeted police, police vans and an armoured personnel carrier were dispatched to keep order as the town waited for the evacuees to arrive.Americans evacuated from China due to the coronavirus outbreak also faced discrimination.Amy Deng, who underwent home quarantine with her daughter Daisy, 8, said neighbours had called police over concerns they would spread the disease.“People were already panicked, then they made up this rumour and spread it, telling us not to even live in the community,” said Deng, 45, a Santa Rosa, California, acupuncturist.China’s Global Times newspaper reported growing fears of a “potential explosion of infection numbers in the capital”, after 36 new cases were found at a Beijing hospital.Japan reported the deaths of two elderly passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship on Thursday, the first fatalities from aboard the ship where more than 630 cases account for the biggest cluster of infection outside China.Amid criticism of the government’s handling of the situation, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said one of deceased former passengers had developed a fever on Feb. 5 but was not removed from the ship until the 12th.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-coronavirus-vaccine-to-be-ready-for-trials-by-april-says-minister/story-CYqj7yUbllxIMp4xY1i5dO.html
21-02-2020||World||Iran votes in parliament elections that favour conservatives||Iranians were voting for a new parliament Friday, with turnout seen as a key measure of support for Iran’s leadership as sanctions weigh on the economy and isolate the country diplomatically.The disqualification of more than 7,000 potential candidates, most of them reformists and moderates, raised the possibility of lower than usual turnout.Iran’s leadership and state media urged voter participation, with some framing it as a religious duty. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast his ballot at a mosque near his Tehran office shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. and urged Iranians to the polls.“Anyone who cares about Iran’s national interests should participate in the election,” he said. Earlier in the week, Khamenei said high voter turnout will thwart “plots and plans” by Americans and supporters of Israel against Iran.“Enemies want to see what the results of the U.S. maximum pressure are,” he said, referring to U.S. sanctions and pressure from Washington that have strangled Iran’s ability to sell its oil abroad, forcing its economy into recession.On the eve of the vote, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on two senior officials of the Guardian Council, including its chief, and three members of its elections supervisory committee. U.S. officials said those targeted were responsible for silencing the voice of the Iranian people by rejecting more than 7,000 candidates.Around 7,000 candidates left in the race after the disqualifications are running in 208 constituencies for the 290-seat chamber.Tensions with the United States could strengthen hard-liners by reinforcing long-held distrust of the West. The crisis with Washington spiked after a U.S. airstrike in January killed Iran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani. The strike led to a tense confrontation in which Iranian forces accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane after it took off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. Most of those killed were Iranian.The shoot-down, and attempts by officials to initially conceal the cause of the crash sparked public anger and protests in Iran.The election is being held at a time of growing economic hardship.Iranians have seen the price of basic goods skyrocket, inflation and unemployment rise and the local currency plummet since President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear agreement with world powers and imposed sanctions. The economic woes faced by ordinary Iranians fueled anti-government protests in November. International human rights groups say at least 300 people were killed in the protests.The parliament in Iran does not have power to dictate major policies, but it does debate the annual budget and the possible impeachment of ministers. Power in Iran ultimately rests with Khamenei, who has final say on all key matters.Also looming over the election is the threat of the new coronavirus, which has been confirmed in five people in Iran this week, including two elderly citizens who died in the city of Qom. Concerns over the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, prompted authorities in Iran to close all schools and Shiite seminaries in Qom.No images were immediately available from Qom on Friday, but the official IRNA news agency said people there were choosing their three representatives from among 88 candidates, Qom, located around 140 kilometers (86 miles) south of the capital, Tehran, is a popular religious destination and a centre of learning and religious studies for Shiite Muslims from inside Iran, as well as Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan and Azerbaijan.A parliament stacked with hard-liners could favour expanding the budget for the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has been sanctioned by the U.S. It could also tilt public policy debates toward hard-liners who are opposed to engagement with the U.S.Current parliament speaker Ali Larijani decided to step down after 11 years and is not running for re-election. Mohammad Baqher Qalibaf, the former mayor of Tehran who is also the former head of the Revolutionary Guard air force, is seen as one of the front-runners to succeed Larijani.The current parliament, elected in 2016, had more than 100 reformists and moderates, with the rest of the chamber split between independents and hard-liners. Some 90 current lawmakers were also barred from running in Friday’s election.Nearly 58 million Iranians, out of a population of more than 80 million, are eligible to vote. Every Iranian above the age of 18 can vote.Turnout has been over 50% in previous parliamentary elections. In 2016, it was nearly 62%.The polls close at 6 p.m., though polling stations have in the past stayed open late into the night to give people more time to cast their vote. Friday is a day of rest in Iran, as is the case across most Muslim countries.Initial results are expected to be announced on Saturday. Presidential elections are expected to take place in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-votes-in-parliament-elections-that-favour-conservatives/story-SIUid6yYY3WzeiFqbn8C6L.html
21-02-2020||World||Coronavirus reaches Chinese jails, sparks new fears of cluster cases||The novel coronavirus outbreak has reached Chinese prisons triggering fresh concerns of similar closed-area cluster cases breaking out in the other crowded prisons in China including in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).According to information made available by the government, nearly 450 prisoners and policemen have been infected in Chinese prisons including in the worst-hit Hubei province.National Health Commission (NHC) officials reported 220 cases of covid-19 cases in Hubei. The commission explained that the country-wide network on reporting of the infectious disease hadn’t been accounting for infections in the country’s prisons so far.The NHC didn’t share details about the prisons in Hubei where the infections were reported.The country-wide death toll from the outbreak has reached 2,239 by Thursday midnight with 120 deaths reported overnight. The number of infections stands at 75,500.The national health commission (NHC) has reported 889 new cases of covid-19 nationwide up from 394 cases reported 24 hours earlier.In the first cases of its kind to be reported since the deadly epidemic broke out in December, at least 207 prisoners and police personnel are infected with covid-19 in the city of Jining in eastern China’s Shandong province.Jie Weijun, a high-ranking politician in the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) who was a top justice department official in Shandong province was sacked after the cases were reported.In another prison in eastern China’s Zhejiang province, at least 27 cases have been reported.Shandong officials told local media that nearly 2,077 people at the Rencheng prison – prisoners, policemen and officials -- in Jining were tested for covid-19 in February.At least 207 cases of covid-19 were confirmed; 200 prisoners and seven police officers.The first confirmed case at the prison, a police officer, was diagnosed on February 13. Soon, after two more officers were diagnosed.The virus had then spread quickly through the prison.From February 14 onwards, all close contacts of police personnel and staff were isolated in designated hotels; on February 15, inmates were transferred to single cells, local media reported, quoting officialsMore than 22,300 police officers and other personnel across the province have been tested for the virus in the past week and no suspected or confirmed cases have been reported except in the Jining prison.But there are apprehensions that similar cluster cases could have already broken out elsewhere across China and information about such cases could have been restricted.In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, hundreds of thousands of Muslim minority community members are housed in high-security camps, which the government calls “vocational training instititutes”. These camps could be vulnerable.The numbers reported from Xinjiang aren’t alarming but exiled Uyghur groups have already spoken out about the possibility of outbreaks in the camps in Xinjiang.Meanwhile, the earliest vaccine for covid-19 will be put to clinical (human) trials around late April, China’s vice-science and technology minister Xu Nanping said on Friday at a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-reaches-chinese-jails-sparks-new-fears-of-cluster-cases/story-aYM3h37Mt9yjocp1oxxy8N.html
21-02-2020||World||Coronavirus death toll reaches 2,236; confirmed cases cross 75,400||The death toll in China’s novel coronavirus has gone up to 2,236 with 118 more deaths reported, mostly from the hard-hit Hubei province, while the overall confirmed infection cases have climbed to 75,465, Chinese health officials said on Friday.The number of deaths is higher than the previous day when 114 people died of the disease, but the country reported the lowest number of new infection cases in nearly a month, fuelling hopes that Beijing’s epidemic control efforts were working.By the end of Thursday, a total of 2,236 people had died of the disease and 75,465 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported from 31 provincial-level regions and in China, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Friday.In all 118 deaths and 889 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection were reported from all over the country, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Another 1,614 new suspected cases were reported on Thursday and 5,206 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus, the NHC said.Among the deaths, 115 were from the epicentre of the virus Hubei province and one in Zhejiang, Chongqing and Yunnan, respectively, it said.Also 18,264 patients infected with the novel coronavirus have been discharged from hospitals after recovery by the end of Thursday.Hubei Province, centre of the novel coronavirus outbreak, reported 411 new confirmed cases and 115 new deaths on Thursday, according to the provincial health commission Friday.The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in the hard-hit province to 62,442.

21-02-2020||World||US intel officials say Russia intruding into 2020 poll campaign for Donald Trump re-election:Report||United States intelligence officials told lawmakers last week that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election campaign by aiming to cast doubt on the integrity of the vote and boost President Donald Trump’s re-election, a person familiar with the briefing said on Thursday.The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity, said Trump’s Republican allies on the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee questioned the assessment presented by officials of the Office of National Intelligence last Thursday.“The Republicans responded as you would expect. They went nuts,” said the person. “They questioned the intelligence.”The briefers warned the committee in the classified briefing that Russia was working to cast doubt on the integrity of the Nov. 3 vote while at the same time boosting Trump’s election to a second four-year term.“They (the Russians) are favouring one candidate while they do it,” said the person, adding that the briefers identified that candidate as Trump. The source declined to elaborate.There was no immediate response to a request for comment from committee Republicans.The New York Times reported on Thursday that a day after the briefing, Trump rebuked acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire for allowing his staff to appear before the committee. It quoted five people familiar with the matter.Trump said on Wednesday he was replacing Maguire on an acting basis with Richard Grenell, a strong Trump loyalist who has served as ambassador to Germany since 2018.The Times said that in reprimanding Maguire, Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, the intelligence panel chairman. He led the House impeachment proceedings against Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from the president’s dealings with Ukraine.The Republican-controlled Senate acquitted Trump of the charges last month.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Washington Post reported that Trump rebuked Maguire in an Oval Office meeting after a Republican ally informed the president of the election security briefing.Shelby Pierson, a Maguire lieutenant who oversees election security, led last week’s briefing for the House committee, according to the Times.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. U.S. officials have long warned that Russia and other countries would try to interfere in the 2020 US presidential election campaign.The U.S. intelligence community concluded that Russia used fake news, cyber attacks and other methods in an operation designed to swing the 2016 presidential election to Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Russia denies the allegation.Trump has repeatedly questioned the finding. At a 2018 summit, he said he found Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denials of Russian meddling “extremely strong and powerful.”Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded in a report last year that there was no conclusive evidence of coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. Mueller was unable, however, to clear Trump of obstructing his investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intel-officials-say-russia-intruding-into-2020-poll-campaign-for-donald-trump-re-election-report/story-iYOziNRiJUUCB21PL9lydN.html
21-02-2020||World||New Zealand Man strangles Tinder date to death on her birthday eve, jailed for life||A New Zealand man was jailed for life Friday over the “depraved” murder of a British backpacker he met through the online dating app Tinder.The 28-year-old was given a non-parole period of 17 years for strangling Grace Millane in December 2018 in a case that shocked New Zealand, which is usually regarded as a safe place to travel.Millane disappeared on the eve of her 22nd birthday, a few days after arriving in Auckland while on a year-long round-the-world trip after graduating from university.She met her killer for the first time on the evening of her death after matching with him on Tinder and the pair went back to his city-centre apartment after visiting several bars.The man, initially denied any involvement in her death, then told police she had accidentally choked during a sex game gone wrong.A jury unanimously rejected the defence at a trial last November after just five hours of deliberation.In a highly unusual move, judge Simon Moore has ruled that the man’s name cannot be published and also suppressed the reasons why he continued to enjoy anonymity, despite his murder conviction.Moore told Auckland High Court on Friday that the killer showed no empathy for his victim, who had placed her trust in a stranger as she travelled in an unfamiliar city. “You are a large and powerful man, she was diminutive,” he said. “You were in a position of total physical dominance.”The judge described as depraved the man’s actions after Millane’s death -- when he took pictures of her body, watched pornography, and arranged another Tinder date for the following night.A life sentence in New Zealand carries a minimum 10-year prison term but Moore imposed 17 years, saying he saw no factors that would justify reducing the penalty.‘Brutal’ defence Members of Millane’s family gave victim impact statements to the court via videolink from Britain before the sentence was handed down.Brother Declan said his sister was “a beautiful soul”.“You’ve ripped our family apart and for what? There is no reason behind this unspeakable act,” he told the killer.Her mother Gillian, clutching a photograph of her daughter, said she had lost her best friend.The case had led to calls to reform New Zealand’s court system after defence lawyers detailed Millane’s sexual preferences and history when making their case.Anti-violence campaigner Louise Nicholas said the defence should not be allowed to put victims on trial.“They have to challenge the evidence, I get that, it’s their job, but they don’t have to do it in such a brutal way,” she told TV3 Friday.The lead investigator on the case, detective inspector Scott Beard, said he did not agree with what he termed the “rough sex defence” employed by the killer’s legal team.“Strangling someone for five to 10 minutes until they die is not rough sex -- if people are going to use that type of defence, all it actually does is repeatedly re-victimise the victim and their family,” he told reporters outside the court.“In this case, the Millanes had to sit through the trial for a number of weeks and their daughter’s background, rightly or wrongly, was out in the public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-man-strangles-tinder-date-to-death-on-her-birthday-eve-jailed-for-life/story-KEOjZnKAmW8aeBdXJScCLK.html
21-02-2020||World||How bad was Academy Awards this year? Trump scoffs at ‘Parasite’s’ Oscar win||President Donald Trump on Thursday scorned the best picture Oscar for South Korean film “Parasite,” asking how a foreign movie could get the honor.“How bad was the Academy Awards this year?” Trump asked the crowd at a packed reelection campaign rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado.“We got enough problems with South Korea, with trade. On top of it, they give them the best movie of the year?” Trump asked in disbelief.“Parasite,” a dark comedy exploring class divides, made history by becoming the first non-English-language film to win Hollywood’s biggest annual prize.Saying “was it good? I don’t know,” Trump seemed to indicate he had not watched the film.Trump, whose presidency has been built on a nationalist “America first” slogan, said it was time to bring back classics from Hollywood’s golden age.“Let’s get ‘Gone With the Wind.’ Can we get ‘Gone With the Wind’ back please? ‘Sunset Boulevard?’“ he said.Trump also took a crack at Best Supporting Actor winner Brad Pitt, calling him “a little wiseguy.” Pitt used his award acceptance speech to support the impeachment of Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-bad-was-academy-awards-this-year-donald-trump-scoffs-at-parasite-s-oscar-win/story-saPwpxfd7vTxzjn7rgmj3L.html

21-02-2020||World||Popularity of Trump on rise in India but some of his policies not-so-welcome: Pew survey||The popularity of US President Donald Trump in India is on the rise but some of his policies and trade attitudes do not garner the same warm reception, a latest Pew Research survey said on Thursday ahead of his maiden presidential trip to the country.President Trump will pay a state visit to India on February 24 and 25 at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He would be accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump.Based on face-to-face interviews, 2019 Global Attitudes Survey of 2,476 respondents conducted from June 24-October 2, 2019 in India, Pew said that the majority of Indians have confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to the world affairs.“And while Trump himself receives positive marks from the Indian populace, Indian public opinion toward some of his specific policies and trade attitudes in general do not garner the same warm reception,” Pew Research said in a survey report released on Thursday.According to the report, Trump’s image in India has gained favour since his candidacy in 2016, jumping from 14 per cent confidence to 56 per cent over three years. Much of this movement is accompanied by more people now offering an opinion about the US president, it added.“These latest numbers resemble those of Trump’s predecessor: Before Barack Obama left office, 58 per cent of Indians had confidence in him in world affairs, while nine per cent had no confidence and 33 per cent did not offer an opinion,” Pew said.Those who associate more with the BJP are more likely than supporters of the Indian National Congress opposition party to voice confidence in Trump, it said.However, when asked about their views of Trump’s policy on increasing tariffs or fees on imported goods from other countries, about half of Indians (48 per cent) say they disapprove. A quarter approve, and roughly another quarter do not offer an opinion.Those who most identify with the BJP are just as likely as the Congress supporters to disapprove of this measure and less likely to provide an answer, Pew said.The Pew Research Center is a non-partisan American think-tank based in Washington. It provides information on social issues, public opinion, and demographic trends shaping the US and the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/popularity-of-trump-on-rise-in-india-but-some-of-his-policies-not-so-welcome-pew-survey/story-3RJCuaeRwT4BG9oaWidiXP.html
