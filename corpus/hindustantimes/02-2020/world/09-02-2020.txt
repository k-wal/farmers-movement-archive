09-02-2020||World||Amid tension with US, Iran plans satellite launch and unveils new missile||Iran will launch a satellite into orbit on Sunday, an Iranian minister said, as part of a fledgling programme which the United States says is a cover for ballistic missile development.State television said Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is in charge of the missile programme, had also unveiled a new short-range missile. The announcements come at a time of high tension with the United States, which killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to carry out a missile attack on a U.S. military base in Iraq. Iranian Minister of Information and Communications Technology Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi was quoted by state television as saying the Zafar (Victory) satellite would be launched from Iran’s Semnan space centre. The first picture it will transmit will be of Soleimani, he added. Tehran launched the first Iranian-made satellite in 2009, another in 2011 and a third in 2012, but at least two satellite launches last year failed. The United States says it is concerned that long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used to launch nuclear warheads.Tehran says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons, and denies that its aerospace programme is a cover for missile development. Iran’s clerical rulers have said Tehran’s missile programme is solely defensive.New missileIn a separate report, state television said the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, in charge of the country’s missile programme, had unveiled a short-range missile that was made by Iran.It said the Raad-500, or thunder in Farsi, was half the weight of a similar missile, the Fateh-110, but its range was about 200 km (120 miles) more and it could be powered by a new generation of engines designed to put satellites into orbit.There was no immediate U.S. comment on the announcements.Washington reimposed sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump in 2018 pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers.Under that deal, Tehran curbed its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions on Iran. But the United States said the agreement was flawed because it was not permanent, did not address Iran’s missile programme and did not involve what Washington considers Iran’s meddling in regional countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-tension-with-us-iran-plans-satellite-launch-and-unveils-new-missile/story-UHluw7vjTAm7EQBkliVhJI.html

One passenger sought medical assistance.“Thanks to the crew’s quick and highly-professional actions it was possible to keep the plane on the landing strip until it came to a full stop,” Utair said.It praised its “experienced” crew, saying the chief pilot has more than 6,900 hours of flight time.A spokeswoman for the local branch of the emergencies ministry told AFP that “the plane landed on its tail”.The passengers and crew evacuated via emergency slides, she said.“What’s happened at Usinsk airport today is unacceptable,” the head of the Komi region Sergei Gaplikov said in a statement. “Thank God no one has been seriously hurt.”Utair said it had grounded Monday’s scheduled flight from Usinsk to Moscow because of the landing strip’s “unsatisfactory condition”.Russia, with poor aircraft maintenance and lax safety standards, has one of the worst air safety records in the world, critics say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-plane-crash-lands-on-belly-after-gear-malfunction-all-100-on-board-safe/story-kTnyOneT87fyeJHQ5rOJMP.html
09-02-2020||World||Ireland poll: PM Leo Varadkar on the back-foot; coalition likely||Buffeted by growing ennui over rising house prices, particularly among young voters, Leo Varadkar, the Indian-origin prime minister of Ireland and his party Fine Gael were facing a stiff challenge as counting of votes began on Sunday after the February 8 election.An exit poll commissioned by Irish national broadcasters RTÉ and TG4, The Irish Times and University College Dublin, suggested that Fine Gael was on track to secure 22.4% of first preference votes, closely followed by Sinn Féin (22.3%) and Fianna Fáil (22.2%).An exit poll in Ireland comes with more than usual caution, because its elections are held under the proportional representation voting system, in which voters write ‘1’ opposite their first choice candidate, ‘2’ against their second, ‘3’ for their third choice, and so on.The exit poll was released after voting was confined to the first preference votes. Final results will be known later in the week, when talks between contending parties are expected to last days or weeks, before a coalition government is formed.However, indications from counting booths suggest a remarkable performance by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republic Army during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. It has attracted many young voters, who have little memory of the violence and terrorism.Sinn Fein is likely to emerge as the king-maker, if not the single largest party, since it fielded only 42 candidates. There are 515 candidates in 39 constituencies and 160 members of parliament. The outgoing speaker, Seán Ó Fearghaíl, has been automatically re-elected, which means the majority mark for the 159-member parliament is 80.Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have committed themselves not to enter into a coalition with Sinn Fein, but there are already reports of Sinn fein being contacted by rival parties.Sinn Féin is the second largest party in Northern Ireland, but it has never posed a challenge to the two main parties in Ireland: Fine Gael and Fiana Fail. To that extent, the expected tied result is seen as a major shift in Ireland’s electoral politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-poll-pm-leo-varadkar-on-the-back-foot-coalition-likely/story-sdS2c6aUQTTUlG24YtPmqN.html

09-02-2020||World||Trains, flights, ferries cancelled as Storm Ciara with hurricane-level winds batter UK||Trains, flights and ferries have been cancelled and weather warnings issued across the United Kingdom and elsewhere in northern Europe on Sunday as a storm with hurricane-level winds battered the region.Storm Ciara, named by the Met Office national weather agency, was expected to bring winds up to 90 mph (145 kph) as well as heavy rains. The agency has issued 123 emergency flood warnings and 159 flood watch alerts. Gusts of 86 mph (138 kph) were already recorded at Capel Curig in Wales.At least 10 rail companies in Britain sent out “do not travel” warnings, and nearly 20 others told passengers to expect delays. The strong winds damaged electrical wires and littered train tracks with broken tree limbs and other debris, including a family trampoline.London’s Heathrow Airport and several airlines consolidated flights Sunday to reduce the number cancelled by heavy winds. British Airways offered to re-book customers for domestic and European flights out of Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports. Virgin Airlines cancelled some flights.The Humber Bridge near Hull in northern England restricted traffic due to the high winds, banning high-sided trucks and camper vehicles. High waves in the Irish Sea and the English Channel forced ferry companies to cancel trips, and the key English port of Dover suspended services.Cultural and sports events across the region were cancelled, including a 10-k run in London expected to draw 25,000 runners and the opening ceremony of Galway’s year of Culture reign.Breaking with her usual Sunday routine, Queen Elizabeth II did not attend church in Sandringham due to high winds.A cow was spotted on the A29 highway after high winds blew down fences.In Ireland, power was knocked to an estimated 10,000 homes, farms and businesses. National weather agency Met Eireann warned that a combination of spring high tides, high seas and stormy conditions had created a significant risk of coastal flooding, particularly along the west and northwest.Across the Channel, Germany’s national railway operator, Deutsche Bahn, said it was cancelling long-distance trains to destinations most at risk from the storm, including Emden and Norddeich in Germany’s northwestern corner, the northern city of Kiel and the North Sea island of Sylt.A German soccer league match between title challenger Borussia Moenchengladbach and Cologne, set for Sunday afternoon, was called off because of concerns that fans could have trouble getting home. The storm is known as “Sabine” in Germany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trains-flights-ferries-cancelled-as-storm-ciara-with-hurricane-level-winds-batter-uk/story-uSsawR2aj2sZqFYm8rW12J.html
09-02-2020||World||US envoy warns Israel against ‘unilateral’ West Bank moves without Washington’s consent||A US envoy warned Israel on Sunday not to declare sovereignty over West Bank land without Washington’s consent, pushing back against calls for immediate action by ultra-nationalists within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition.U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan, unveiled on Jan 28, envisages Israel keeping key swathes of the occupied territory where Palestinians seek statehood. But the question of timing has opened up a rare rift between the allies.Netanyahu initially pledged a speedy “application of Israeli law” - de facto annexation - to Jewish settlement blocs and the Jordan Valley, delighting his religious-rightist base ahead of Israel’s March 2 election, where he hopes to win a fifth term.But he was forced to backpedal after the White House made clear it wanted a U.S.-Israeli mapping process - likely to take weeks or more - completed first. The Palestinians, for their part, have rejected the Trump plan as a non-starter.With Defence Minister Naftali Bennett and other Israeli ultra-nationalists urging an immediate cabinet vote on sovereignty in the West Bank, the U.S. ambassador intervened.“Israel is subject to the completion (of) a mapping process by a joint Israeli-American committee. Any unilateral action in advance of the completion of the committee process endangers the Plan & American recognition,” envoy David Friedman tweeted.In a separate speech, Friedman elaborated that his message was “a little bit of patience, to go through a process, to do it right, is not something which we think is too much to ask for”.‘Potentially adverse’“With the news out that the (Israeli) cabinet was about to be pushed in a direction that was potentially adverse to our view of the process, we just let people know where we stand,” he told the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) think-tank.“It was not a threat.”In parallel, Netanyahu invoked the White House position.“The (U.S.) recognition is the main thing and we don’t want to endanger that,” the premier told his cabinet on Sunday.At the JCPA, Friedman said the mapping process was unlikely to be completed before March 2. But he held out the possibility of implementation even if the election does not produce a clear winner, as was the case twice in the last year.Asked if Washington first wanted a permanent Israeli government - as opposed to a caretaker government of the kind Netanyahu has headed by default for months - in place, Friedman said: “We have not made that demand.”Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war to be a violation of international law. Trump has changed U.S. policy to withdraw such objections and the prospect of Israeli annexations have drawn widespread condemnation. Palestinians say the settlements make a future state unviable. Israel cites security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land on which they are built.“Any unilateral step is rejected whether it is taken before or after the election,” said Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. “Facts can’t be created on the ground and they will never become a reality.”“The only thing we can accept is the Palestinian map on the 1967 borders,” Abu Rdainah added. On Saturday, Netanyahu told an election rally that the mapping process with the Americans was already under way. “We’ve been waiting since 1967 and some people are making a big deal out of a few weeks,” he said, alluding to rightist rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-warns-israel-against-unilateral-west-bank-moves-without-washington-s-consent/story-62f27K5KY6RhThyYC6iiwN.html
09-02-2020||World||Joe Biden, a US presidential front-runner in trouble||After suffering a drubbing in Iowa and bizarrely conceding he will likely lose New Hampshire’s Democratic primary next Tuesday, Joe Biden is under immense pressure to turn his floundering US presidential campaign around.The popular former US vice president has been the national frontrunner for more than a year, but his enviable position is increasingly under threat, and rivals -- including a socialist-leaning senator and a small-city mayor -- smell blood in the water.The 77-year-old moderate is being eclipsed on the campaign trail by mostly younger candidates with sharper stump speeches, more hustle, and telegenic debate performances.An average of polling in New Hampshire, which votes Tuesday in the first-in-the-nation primary (following Iowa’s troubled caucuses this past week), shows Biden plunging from first place to third, behind Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.“To not be concerned I think would be foolish,” acknowledged Biden-backer Will Johnson, a 23-year-old law student from northern Pittsburgh, said in one of several conversations voters had with AFP about the candidate.“Hopefully a more concerted effort is made by the campaign to really push out the vote and get people to support Biden,” he said, adding Biden was “the best shot we have” at defeating President Donald Trump in November.The big crowds, however, are going to Buttigieg, 38, and Sanders, 78, the two candidates who won the most votes in Iowa and are leading in New Hampshire.Biden took a day off the trail Thursday, five days before the primary, to huddle with top advisors about the path forward.But instead of coming out swinging at the start of the next day’s debate, Biden committed a glaring unforced error.“I took a hit in Iowa, and I’ll probably take one here,” Biden said onstage, startling Johnson and other supporters who are looking for him to grab the reins, not admit defeat.Biden, who passed a 2016 presidential run after his son Beau’s death, has seen his path to this year’s nomination transform into a rocky road.He and his other son Hunter were drawn into the Trump impeachment saga, with the president pressuring Ukraine to investigate them over Hunter’s involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm while his father was vice president.No evidence of wrongdoing has emerged. But Trump has blasted the Bidens as corrupt, and some Republicans have repeatedly labeled the younger Biden’s board position as a conflict of interest. ‘Uphill battle’ Biden’s unsteady performance has put some in the Democratic establishment on edge.Is the situation alarming? “Yeah,” former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who held a senior position in the Obama administration, told AFP.“If certain candidates repeatedly come in third or fourth, the reason -- the logic -- for staying in the race is very hard.”After the debate, Biden’s senior advisor Symone Sanders went into damage control.“We know it might be an uphill battle but the reality is we are still in this race,” she told reporters, noting how the demographics of the states that vote next are more representative of America’s diversity than overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire.On Saturday Biden intensified his attacks on Buttigieg with a withering ad belittling his experience as a small-city mayor while touting his successes as vice president.And he used his appearance at a Manchester theater to go after Sanders’ political persuasion.If the senator wins the nomination, Biden said, every Democrat seeking election “will have to carry the label that Senator Sanders has chose for himself... ‘Democratic socialist,’”.Reading his attack lines off a teleprompter, the event lacked spontaneity and grassroots appeal -- leaving some unconvinced.“I’ve always loved Joe Biden, but he has to prove himself to me,” said Mary Aarons, a 61-year-old publishing executive and undecided voter.“I feel like he’s running so much on his past record... more than what he’s going to do in the future,” added Nicole Clegg, 45, a local schoolteacher who said she too was undecided.Senator Chris Coons, who has endorsed Biden, recalled that Bill Clinton “lost 10 out of the first 11 primaries” in 1992 before eventually winning the White House.“This is not over,” Coons said. Biden “is going to have to work harder and fight tougher and draw sharper distinctions, but he’s ready and able to do that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-a-us-presidential-front-runner-in-trouble/story-mY1McltGaHCVvWiDHEfK5N.html

09-02-2020||World||Soldier kills 26 in Thailand’s bloodiest shooting spree, shot dead after 16 hrs||A soldier with a grudge gunned down 26 people and wounded 57 in Thailand’s worst shooting spree before he was fatally shot inside a mall in the country’s northeast on Sunday, officials said.Officials said the soldier was angry over a financial dispute, first killing two people on a military base and then went on a far bloodier rampage Saturday, shooting as he drove to the mall where shoppers fled in terror.It took police sharpshooters 16 hours to end the crisis.Authorities said Sgt. Maj. Jakrapanth Thomma was behind the attack in Nakhon Ratchasima, a hub for Thailand’s relatively poorer and rural northeastern region. Much of the shooting took place at Terminal 21 Korat, an airport-themed mall filled with colorful Lego sculptures, a merry-go-round and huge replicas of landmarks from around the world.“This incident was unprecedented in Thailand,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters as he gave the final tally Sunday morning after visiting the wounded in hospitals.“I hope this is the only one and the last incident, and that it never happens again. No one wants this to happen. It could be because of this person’s mental health in this particular moment,” he said.Prayuth said he was worried that people inside the mall could be accidentally hit by bullets fired by police, but added, “I have checked, that didn’t happen.”Video taken outside the mall showed people diving for cover as shots rang out mid-afternoon Saturday. Many were killed outside the mall, some in cars, others while walking.Nattaya Nganiem and her family had just finished eating and were driving away when she heard gunfire.“First I saw a woman run out from the mall hysterically,” said Nattaya, who shot video of the scene on her phone. “Then a motorcycle rider in front of her just ran and left his motorcycle there.”Hundreds of people were evacuated from the mall in small batches by police while they searched for the gunman.“We were scared and ran to hide in toilets,” said Sumana Jeerawattanasuk, one of those rescued by police. She said seven or eight people hid in the same room as her.“I am so glad. I was so scared of getting hurt,” she said.Shortly before midnight, police announced they had secured the above-ground portion of the mall, but were still searching for the shooter. About 16 hours later, officials held a news conference outside the mall to announce the gunman was fatally shot.Defense Ministry spokesman Kongcheep told Thai media that the first person killed was the commanding officer of the 22nd Ammunition Battalion, in which the suspect also served. He said the gunman had fired at others at his base and took guns and ammunition before fleeing in an army Humvee.City and neighborhood police officers, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to release information, said the man fired shots as he drove to the mall. Thai Rath television aired mall security camera footage showing a man with what appeared to be an assault rifle.The man also posted updates to his Facebook page during the rampage.“No one can escape death,” read one post. Another asked, “Should I give up?” In a later post, he wrote, “I have stopped already.”A photo circulated on social media that appeared to be taken from the Facebook page shows a man wearing a green camouflaged military helmet while a fireball and black smoke rage behind him. Jakrapanth’s profile picture shows him in a mask and dressed in military-style fatigues and armed with a pistol. The background image is of a handgun and bullets. The Facebook page was made inaccessible after the shooting began.Terminal 21 Korat, a multi-level glass and steel mall, is designed to resemble an airport terminal, complete with a mock control tower and departure gates. A large model passenger jet dangles from wires beside one of the main escalators.Each of its seven retail floors is decorated to represent a different country. A giant replica of Paris’ Eiffel Tower soars to the ceiling, while a model of London’s Big Ben dominates another area, and a massive model of California’s Golden Gate Bridge spans an open courtyard. A two-story golden Oscar statue towers over a food court.Many malls in Thailand, including Terminal 21’s namesake in Bangkok, have metal detectors and security cameras at entrances manned by uniformed but unarmed security guards. Checks on those entering are often cursory at best.In Bangkok, the original Terminal 21 in the bustling heart of the city was filled with shoppers as usual Sunday morning. There were no signs of increased security or commemoration of the tragedy that unfolded a few hours’ drive away.Gun violence is not unheard of in Thailand. Firearms can be obtained legally, and many Thais own guns. Mass shootings are rare, though there are occasional gun battles in the far south of the country, where authorities have for years battled a long-running separatist insurgency.The incident in Korat comes just a month after another high-profile mall shooting, in the central Thai city of Lopburi. In that case, a masked gunman carrying a handgun with a silencer killed three people, including a 2-year-old boy, and wounded four others as he robbed a jewelry store. A suspect, a school director, was arrested less than two weeks later and reportedly confessed, saying he did not mean to shoot anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unprecedented-soldier-kills-26-in-bloodiest-shooting-spree-in-thailand-shot-dead-after-16-hours/story-mSuwnVlCbZS2pZMkZrMs4N.html

When news broke about the fast-spreading coronavirus, he volunteered to return to Beijing.“I’m not a reckless person,” he told Reuters, as he loaded his electric bicycle with groceries and checked the list of addresses in Beijing he was supposed to deliver them to. “But how can I say it. It’s for my work, for my life, and I want to contribute to the society to realise a little self-value.”Guo, who delivers goods for Dada-JD Daojia, an online grocery and delivery arm of JD.com, is one of thousands of workers that are keeping Chinese residents supplied as they isolate themselves at home. The authorities have ordered people to stay indoors and away from crowded, public areas.The coronavirus, which started in Wuhan city in central Hebei province in December, has killed more than 800 people and infected over 37,000 in China.Many migrant workers like Guo had already made the long trek home to see their families, but companies recalled workers, urging them to serve their communities and offering to triple their salaries. To assuage the anxieties felt by customers, firms such as Yum China’s fried chicken chain KFC, Alibaba Holdings’ Ele.me, Meituan Dianping and JD.com have rolled out no-touching “contactless delivery,” and some meal deliveries come with notes detailing the temperature readings of the workers who prepared and delivered the food.“I have to say I’m indeed worried,” said Guo, when asked about how he felt about his own safety.“Sometimes I’m nervous even if I have a little cough. That’s why I have a thermometer at home and, sometimes when I come back, I’ll check my body temperature.”While the coronavirus outbreak has hit sectors such as hospitality and tourism hard, it has shored up demand for mobile and online firms, such as short video apps and games as well as for meal and grocery delivery firms.Most of those staying at home have been focused on buying the essentials. JD.com said the sales of vegetables, eggs and rice by its supermarket chain 7Fresh each surged on average by about 300% during this period compared with last year’s Spring Festival. China will sputter towards normal on Monday after holiday extensions authorities made to the Lunar New Year holiday end, but many shops are expected to still remain shut with workers being asked to work from home. Huge Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, currently look like ghost towns.Guo says that he feels the echoes of the city’s empty streets on his long drives. “It really feels like a deserted city. It is completely different from the look of a usual Beijing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-m-not-reckless-china-courier-braves-coronavirus-to-keep-city-supplied/story-vfcZglhHpLpOOA3LCh2CYL.html

No crew member agrees to go there either. So, we’ve told them [stranded Bangladeshis] to wait,” Bangladesh Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen was quoted as saying by bdnews24.com.The government has said that the number of Bangladeshis who wanted to return but could not be brought back is 171.Momen also denied reports that some of the stuck Bangladeshi nationals have complained of shortage of food and drinking water due to the lockdown, saying that the Chinese authorities were providing food and water to the 23 places where the Bangladeshis stay.He said that the Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing was maintaining regular contact with the stranded Bangladeshis. According to a report in the Dhaka Tribune, the minister said that the government has spent a lot of time for those intending to return. “However, it is still not possible (to bring them back). The Biman crew members who brought back some 312 Bangladeshis from China are now in effect barred from flying to other countries,” he said.He said that only a Chinese chartered flight could bring the Bangladeshi nationals back, the report said.“Earlier, Chinese authorities agreed to do so, but later declined. We are not able to send any flights there,” he said.According to the report, Momen made the comments days after Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam said that around 171 Bangladeshis would be flown out of Wuhan upon clearance from Chinese authorities.The virus emerged in early December and has been traced to a market in Wuhan that sold wild animals.The World Health Organisation has declared the outbreak a global emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-can-t-bring-back-171-nationals-from-coronavirus-hit-china-report/story-y6E3zYB6F9jWH7AzRaGGpJ.html

09-02-2020||World||US presidency gains more power with Donald Trump’s acquittal||US President Donald Trump’s impeachment acquittal has delivered the White House a fresh coat of power, sparking worries over the rise of an “imperial presidency.” His victory in the Senate trial on Wednesday accelerated a decades-long shift in the US government in which Congress has steadily ceded authority to the Oval Office.The presidency hit a low in the 1970s, after Congress wrested authority away following Richard Nixon’s Watergate abuses.Since then, each successive US leader has sought to further dominate the legislature.Trump, though, has sparked anxiety: he flaunts his power, and has an attorney general who favors a strong presidency and a Republican Party unwilling to restrain him.One of his impeachment lawyers claimed Trump is free to do whatever he wants -- even cheat in elections -- if he believes it is in the national interest.Trump himself says, citing the US Constitution: “I have the right to do whatever I want as president.” “It is now arguable... that Donald Trump may well have become the most powerful president in American history,” historian Jon Meacham said after Trump’s trial closed.“President Trump is functionally a monarch at this point. If the king does it, it’s okay.” After suffering under the British king, the architects of the US system of government crafted a constitution in 1789 that gave the legislature strong checks on the powers of the new nation’s chief executive.Lawmakers held the upper hand mostly through the early 20th century, until, faced by existential emergencies -- the Great Depression and then World war II -- president Franklin Roosevelt rode roughshod over Congress to take action.Since then, “we have seen a steady increase over time in the independent powers of the presidency,” said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University.“Presidents are encouraged, I think, to grab as much power and make as much of a difference during their one or two terms as they can.” “This is not just a Republican thing. It’s presidents of both parties,” said Rozell.Executive power got a considerable boost with the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.Republican George W. Bush went far beyond his statutory authorities to order actions like secret surveillance of Americans and abduction and torture of foreign fighters, claiming he had the right to do so to protect the country.Congress did require him to obtain approval to make war on Al-Qaeda and Iraq. But they gave him broad authority, allowing the “War on Terror” to extend to Syria, Yemen and Africa under Bush and his successors.Nearly two decades later, Congress worries that Trump could use the same powers to go to war with Iran. But the lawmakers are too at odds to do anything about it.Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009 pledging not to abuse his powers like Bush and to respect Congress’s equal authority.But within a couple years, faced by Congressional Republicans determined to stymie anything Obama wanted, he declared his “We Can’t Wait” initiative and began leading by executive order.Obama used his executive powers for environmental rules, protection for undocumented immigrants, gun control and a higher minimum wage.Having criticized Bush for abusing his war powers, Obama personally signed off on scores of secret drone attacks on terror targets, until even he admitted that there was need for a formal review process.He created a number of administrative bodies led by powerful “czars” that could institute regulations without going through Congress, and made top-level appointments when Congress was in recess to avoid a contentious approval process.When in 2014 the Republican House leader threatened a court challenge, Obama quipped: “So sue me.” Trump branded Obama’s use of executive orders as “power grabs.” But he now taps that authority far more brashly.He skips Congress to appoint senior officials by designating them “acting”; he declared a “national emergency” to divert billions of dollars of Pentagon money to build a border wall; and he cited national security to effectively ban Muslims from entering the country.He has lost numerous court challenges but has also prevailed -- most notably in defying subpoenas from Congress during his impeachment. Experts say that success shows the legislature forfeiting one of its key powers to check the executive.If Trump’s claims of near-unlimited authority go unaddressed, it “will permanently and dangerously alter the balance of power” in the government, said Democrat Adam Schiff, who led the impeachment probe.Others say Trump merely uses his powers more cockily, and that impeachment drew a line for the imperial presidency.New York University law professor Richard Pildes says who wins the November 2020 election -- Trump and his Republicans or the Democrats -- will be indicative.“How these events become absorbed politically in the next election will significantly shape what future presidents and members of Congress come to think about the exercise of their powers,” Pildes said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidency-gains-more-power-with-donald-trump-s-acquittal/story-xAuc9lDR877bj7Z2p18ERN.html
09-02-2020||World||Scientists race to develop vaccine for new coronavirus||Scientists from the United States to Australia are using new technology in an ambitious, multi-million-dollar drive to develop a vaccine in record time to tackle China’s coronavirus outbreak.The new virus has spread rapidly since emerging late last year in China, killing more than 800 people in the mainland and infecting over 37,000. Cases have been reported in two dozen other countries.Coming up with any vaccine typically takes years, and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans and regulatory approvals.But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international coalition that aims to combat emerging diseases, and Australian scientists hope their’s could be ready in six months.“It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,” said senior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia’s University of Queensland.But the scientist added he took “some solace” knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission.“The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,” he said.But even a timeframe of six months looks agonisingly slow with the virus, believed to have emerged from a market selling wild animals, killing close to 100 people every day in mainland China.Efforts are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.With a mission to speed up the development of vaccines, CEPI is pouring millions of dollars into four projects around the world and has put out a call for more proposals.The projects hope to use new technology to develop vaccines that can be tested in the near future.The body’s CEO, Richard Hatchett, said the aim was to start clinical testing in just 16 weeks.German biopharmaceutical company CureVac and US-based Moderna Therapeutics are developing vaccines based on “messenger RNA” -- instructions that tell the body to produce proteins -- while Inovio, another American firm, is using DNA-based technology.DNA- and RNA-based vaccines use the genetic coding of the virus to trick the body’s cells into producing proteins identical to those on the surface of the pathogen, explained Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.The immune system learns to recognise the proteins so that it is ready to find and attack the virus when it enters the body.The Australian researchers are using “molecular clamp” technology invented by the university’s scientists that allows them to rapidly develop new vaccines based solely on a virus DNA sequence.French scientists at the Pasteur Institute are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus, but do not expect it to be ready for about 20 months.Meanwhile, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also started developing vaccines, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.Health authorities weigh the risks and benefits in vaccine approvals and if there is a public health emergency, the process could be shortened, said Ooi of the Duke-NUS Medical School.But he added that “paradoxically, if the situation improves, then actually the pathway for vaccines would be longer”.“If there’s a lot of these new coronavirus cases around, then you accept some risk, because of the tremendous amount of benefit you can derive, whereas if there are not many cases, the tolerance for risk would be very low.” While there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, some doctors are trying out a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs to treat those infected, but the science is inconclusive as to whether they are effective.Ultimately, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -- it died out before a vaccine could be fully developed.A close cousin of the new coronavirus, SARS spread around the world and killed nearly 800.But Ong Siew Hwa, the director of Acumen Research Laboratories, a biotech company in Singapore, said efforts to develop a vaccine for the new virus should continue even if the outbreak ends.“I think a vaccine will definitely be important,” she said. “If it’s not in time for this round, it is important for the next time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-race-to-develop-vaccine-for-new-coronavirus/story-g3Db6AhBM1uQgX5KQUAN7L.html
09-02-2020||World||Novel coronavirus can stay infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days||The novel coronavirus which has led to the death of over 800 people in China may stay infectious for up to nine days, researchers have warned.On average, they survive between four and five days, according to the study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection.“Low temperature and high air humidity further increase their lifespan,” explained Professor Gunter Kampf from the Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine at the Greifswald University Hospital in Germany.Together with Professor Eike Steinmann, Head of the Department for Molecular and Medical Virology at Ruhr-Universitat Bochum (RUB) in Germany, Kampf has compiled findings from 22 studies on coronaviruses and their inactivation for a future textbook. The evaluated studies focus on the pathogens Sars coronavirus and Mers coronavirus. But the researchers said that the findings should be transferable to the novel coronavirus.“Different coronaviruses were analysed, and the results were all similar,” Steinmann said.“Under the circumstances, the best approach was to publish these verified scientific facts in advance, in order to make all information available at a glance,” Steinmann added.Since there is no specific therapy against the novel coronavirus, the prevention of infection is of particular importance in order to stem the epidemic. Like all droplet infections, the virus can spread via hands and surfaces that are frequently touched. “In hospitals, these can be door handles, for example, but also call buttons, bedside tables, bed frames and other objects in the direct vicinity of patients, which are often made of metal or plastic,” Kampf said.Tests with various disinfection solutions showed that agents based on ethanol, hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite are effective against coronaviruses. If these agents are applied in appropriate concentrations, they reduce the number of infectious coronaviruses by four so-called log steps within one minute: this means, for example, from one million to only 100 pathogenic particles. If preparations based on other active ingredients are used, the product should be proven to be at least effective against enveloped viruses, said the study.“As a rule, this is sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of infection,” Kampf said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-can-stay-infectious-on-surfaces-for-up-to-9-days/story-FADRxPLqVSeFieosZwVa3M.html
09-02-2020||World||Two US troops killed by Afghan soldier in Nangarhar attack: Official||Two U.S. service members were killed and six others injured when an individual in an Afghan uniform opened fire on them with a machine gun in eastern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said on Saturday.The incident, which took place in Nangarhar province, occurred after a combined U.S. and Afghan force completed a “key-leader engagement,” Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement.“We are still collecting information and the cause or motive behind the attack is unknown at this time,” Leggett added.Mubariz Khadem, a senior security official in Nangarhar province, told Reuters earlier on Saturday that clashes took place between U.S. and Afghan forces and casualties were feared.Insider attacks, often known as “green-on-blue” attacks, have been a regular feature of the conflict in Afghanistan, although their frequency has diminished in recent years.Nangarhar, which shares a long and porous border with neighboring Pakistan, had long served as the main stronghold of Islamic State, from where militants planned and staged bombings around the country, especially the capital Kabul.The Taliban has also controlled parts of Nangarhar province.About 13,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Afghanistan as part of the U.S.-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces and to carry out counter-terrorism operations.The incident comes at a delicate time, as U.S. diplomats have been talking with the Taliban for months to agree a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees.Despite talks between the United States and the Taliban to end the war, violence in the country has not ebbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-us-troops-killed-by-afghan-soldier-in-nangarhar-attack-official/story-iaCmIAdaoQAjnoGvaAM08M.html

India has categorically told the international community that its move to scrap Article 370 was an internal matter and has also advised Pakistan to accept the reality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kashmir-to-remain-cornerstone-of-pak-s-foreign-policy-shah-mahmood-qureshi/story-vDUm7qmPPpKabi006CJIBO.html
09-02-2020||World||Thai mall gunman who killed at least 21 shot dead after rampage: Officials||Thai officials said a soldier who went on a shooting rampage and killed at least 21 people and injured 42 others has been shot dead inside a mall in northeastern Thailand.Officials said the soldier angry over a financial dispute first killed two people and then went on a far bloodier rampage Saturday, shooting as he drove to a busy mall where shoppers fled in terror.Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Kongcheep Tantrawanich said Sgt. Maj. Jakrapanth Thomma was behind the attack in Nakhon Ratchasima, a hub for Thailand’s relatively poorer and rural northeastern region. Much of the shooting took place at Terminal 21 Korat, an airport-themed mall filled with colorful Lego sculptures, a merry-go-round and huge replicas of landmarks from around the world.Video taken outside the mall showed people diving for cover as shots rang out mid-afternoon Saturday. Many were killed outside the mall, some in cars, others while walking.Nattaya Nganiem and her family had just finished eating and were driving away when she heard gunfire.“First I saw a woman run out from the mall hysterically,” said Nattaya, who shot video of the scene on her phone. “Then a motorcycle rider in front of her just ran and left his motorcycle there.”Hundreds of people were evacuated from the mall in small batches by police while they searched for the gunman.“We were scared and ran to hide in toilets,” said Sumana Jeerawattanasuk, one of those rescued by police. She said seven or eight people hid in the same room as her.“I am so glad. I was so scared of getting hurt,” she said.Shortly before midnight, police announced they had secured the above-ground portion of the mall, but were still searching for the shooter. About 16 hours later, officials held a news conference outside the mall to announce the gunman was fatally shot.The officials did not release any details.Defense Ministry spokesman Kongcheep told Thai media that the first person killed was the commanding officer of the 22nd Ammunition Battalion, in which the suspect also served. He said the gunman had fired at others at his base and took guns and ammunition before fleeing in an army Humvee.City and neighborhood police officers, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to release information, said the man fired shots as he drove to the mall. Thai Rath television aired mall security camera footage showing a man with what appeared to be an assault rifle.The man also posted updates to his Facebook page during the rampage.“No one can escape death,” read one post. Another asked, “Should I give up?” In a later post, he wrote, “I have stopped already.”A photo circulated on social media that appeared to be taken from the Facebook page shows a man wearing a green camouflaged military helmet while a fireball and black smoke rage behind him. Jakrapanth’s profile picture shows him in a mask and dressed in military-style fatigues and armed with a pistol. The background image is of a handgun and bullets. The Facebook page was made inaccessible after the shooting began.Terminal 21 Korat, a multi-level glass and steel mall is designed to resemble an airport terminal, complete with a mock control tower and departure gates. A large model passenger jet dangles from wires beside one of the main escalators.Each of its seven retail floors is decorated to represent a different country. A giant replica of Paris’ Eiffel Tower soars to the ceiling, while a model of London’s Big Ben dominates another area, and a massive model of California’s Golden Gate Bridge spans an open courtyard. A two-story golden Oscar statue towers over a food court.Many malls in Thailand, including Terminal 21’s namesake in Bangkok, have metal detectors and security cameras at entrances manned by uniformed but unarmed security guards. Checks on those entering are often cursory at best.Gun violence is not unheard of in Thailand. Firearms can be obtained legally, and many Thais own guns. Mass shootings are rare, though there are occasional gun battles in the far south of the country, where authorities have for years battled a long-running separatist insurgency.The incident in Korat comes just a month after another high-profile mall shooting, in the central Thai city of Lopburi. In that case, a masked gunman carrying a handgun with a silencer killed three people, including a 2-year-old boy, and wounded four others as he robbed a jewelry store. A suspect, a school director, was arrested less than two weeks later and reportedly confessed, saying he did not mean to shoot anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-mall-gunman-who-killed-at-least-21-shot-dead-after-rampage-officials/story-onrahMiVbxLbq7kZnyyT1J.html
