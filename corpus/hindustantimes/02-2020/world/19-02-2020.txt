19-02-2020||World||Three cabinet members, Jared Kushner likely on Donald Trump’s team to India||President Donald Trump will be accompanied on the India visit by at least three members of his cabinet and son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who has emerged as the president’s right-hand man on some of the administration’s key foreign policy priorities and engagements.The three secretaries will be Steve Mnuchin of treasury, Wilbur Ross of commerce and Secretary Dan Brouillette of energy, according to people familiar with the planning of the visit, who also pointed out that these lists could change with additions and eliminations. There was was no word if Robert Lighthizer, the trade representative and top negotiator, will join the delegation. He cancelled a visit to New Delhi scheduled for last week to wrap up discussion on a trade deal, putting a question mark on what was once expected to be the defining achievement of Trump’s visit.The delegation will also include officials from the president’s National Security Council. The state department will be represented by the US ambassador to India Ken Juster, as all other officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, are staying back in Washington DC for a conference of heads of US missions from all over the world, according to people familiar these developments.Secretary of defense Mark Esper will also not be on the president’s delegation because he is scheduled to make a separate, and his first, visit to India later, perhaps in March.The president, who will be accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, will begin his two-day India tour in Ahmedabad with a visit to Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram and a public rally at a stadium that the president has spoke about enthusiastically, specially the “millions” of people he is expecting to see.The presence of the president’s son-in-law Kushner in the visiting delegation is being seen as significant, given how close he is to Trump and how many of the administration’s key initiatives he has spearheaded including the recently announced West Asia peace plan.This will probably be Kushner’s second trip to India after Trump’s election. His first was in November 2018 when he went to Jaisalmer to attend the wedding of a friend from Harvard; they were also roommates later. But that was said to be a strictly private visit and it could not be ascertained if he also had official meetings at the time.Earlier last year, in July, Kushner appeared for the first time at an Indian-related event, a discussion hosted by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum. “When we look at India we see a country with such amazing potential and we see the relationship between America and India as one with boundless potential,” Kushner had said, and added, in a nod to ongoing trade discussions, “We still have some issues we have to work through.” Those issues are still on the table, and could, or not, find resolution in the form of a trade deal the two sides are hoping to finalize, with diminishing prospects, to be announced during President Trump’s visit.It could not be ascertained if the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump will also be on the delegation. She has been to India before, in her capacity as an adviser to her father, and has been seen taking active interest in the bilateral relationship. She led the US delegation to the global Entrepreneurship Summit to Hyderabad in 2017, and also cut a video summary of President Trump’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Osaka G 20 in July, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-cabinet-members-jared-kushner-likely-on-donald-tump-s-team-to-india/story-pWJRRpeD14mogMbqkRenLP.html

Mehak Kumari, a class IXth student, was allegedly abducted from Jacobabad district on January 15 by Ali Raza Solangi who later married her.Her father filed an FIR, claiming that Solangi had abducted and married her forcibly. He also said that her daughter was 15-year-old when she was abducted. Additional Session Judge Ghulam Ali Kanasro ruled that Mehak, who took the Muslim name of Aliza to marry Solangi, was underage. The couple, however, claimed that Mehak embraced Islam at a shrine after which they contracted a free-will marriage.The Judge citing evidence and documents ruled that Mehak was underage and was not fit for marriage under section 3 and 4 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act.He directed Larkana’s senior police officials to take action against all those involved in conducting, facilitating and abetting the child marriage.Kumari was brought to the court from a women’s shelter home from Larkana where she was sent on court orders soon after the couple was taken into custody.Heavy security was witnessed in and around the court for the hearing to quell any unrest as local Hindu and Muslim leaders were present in town. Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan. Abduction and conversion of Hindu women has been a major issue in Sindh province where the majority of Pakistani Hindus live.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-court-nullifies-converted-minor-hindu-girl-s-marriage/story-cTtdjFX1TXBdqw0yU7xScN.html
19-02-2020||World||Passengers depart coronavirus cruise ship at last; Japan’s effort under fire||Hundreds of people began disembarking a cruise ship in Japan on Wednesday after being held on board for more than two weeks under quarantine, as criticism mounted of Japan’s handling of the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside China.Even as patients trundled off the Diamond Princess cruise liner with their suitcases, Japanese authorities announced 79 new cases had been discovered on board, bringing the total above 620, well over half the known cases outside mainland China.In China itself, the death toll from the coronavirus climbed above 2,000, but the tally of newly reported cases fell for a second day to the lowest since January, offering hope and helping Asian shares and U.S. stock futures rise.China is struggling to get its economy back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year.Beyond mainland China, six people have died from the disease, and governments around the world are trying to prevent it from spreading into a global epidemic. The Diamond Princess has been quarantined at a dock at Yokohama near Tokyo since Feb. 3, initially with 3,700 people aboard.From Wednesday, passengers who tested negative and showed no symptoms were free to leave. Around 500 were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with the rest of those eligible departing over the next two days. Confirmed cases were to be sent to hospital, while those who shared cabins with infected passengers may still be kept on board.Around half of the passengers and crew are Japanese, and are free to go home once cleared to leave. Other countries have said they will fly passengers home and quarantine them on arrival. The United States flew more than 300 passengers to air bases in California and Texas this week.“I am very keen to get off this ship,” Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters over a social-media link. She was among a group of Australians getting off to catch an evacuation flight back to 14 days of quarantine in the city of Darwin.Matthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on board after declining the U.S. evacuation earlier this week, tweeted video of passengers departing with their suitcases.“Captain wishes ‘Arrivederci’ to the guests departing the ship today but omits his usual ‘Buon Appetito’ to those of us who are still awaiting our fates. Hey, what are we - chopped liver?!” he wrote.“Completely inadequate”The rapid spread of the disease aboard the ship has drawn strong criticism of the Japanese authorities, just months before Japan is due to host the Olympics. Infectious disease specialist Kentaro Iwata of Japan’s Kobe University Hospital, who volunteered to help aboard the ship, described the infection control effort on board as “completely inadequate”, and said basic protocols had not been followed.“There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship and there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as a professional. The bureaucrats were in charge of everything,” he said in a YouTube video.Health Minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan’s efforts: “Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases,” Kato said in a report by state broadcaster NHK.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan’s efforts “may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship.”From the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers were not confined to their rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as passengers were being screened, onboard events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class, one passenger said.Better day in ChinaThe promising sign out of China came from the National Health Commission, which reported 1,749 new confirmed cases, the lowest tally since Jan. 29. Hubei - the epicentre of the outbreak - reported the lowest number of new infections since Feb. 11, while outside of Hubei there were just 56 new cases, down from a peak of 890 on Feb. 3. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to more than 74,000 and the death toll to 2,004, three-quarters of which have occurred in Wuhan, Hubei’s provincial capital.On top of tough steps taken to isolate Hubei, where the flu-like virus originated in a market illegally selling wildlife, state media reported the province would track down anyone who visited doctors with fever since Jan. 20 or bought over-the-counter cough and fever medication. Chinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence that the strict measures are working. Epidemiologists outside China have said in recent days that the reports from there are encouraging but it is still too early to predict whether the epidemic will be contained.Chinese officials have been putting on a brave face, saying the economic impact of the virus would be limited and short-term. President Xi Jinping said China could meet its 2020 economic targets, media reported.Big manufacturing hubs on the coast are starting to loosen curbs on the movement of people and traffic while authorities prod factories to get back to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/passengers-depart-coronavirus-cruise-ship-at-last-japan-s-effort-under-fire/story-4L4k9hyt0o1DFyNtgmaPDI.html

Prince Harry and Meghan face possible loss of ‘royal’ brand||The British royal family is in discussions with Prince Harry and Meghan over the use of the word “royal” in their branding after the couple abruptly gave up royal duties to start a new life in Canada.Harry, Queen Elizabeth grandson, and Meghan, duchess of Sussex, agreed with the queen last month that they would no longer work as royals after their surprise announcement that they wanted to carve out “a progressive new role” which they hope to finance themselves.“As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are stepping back as senior members of the royal family and will work towards financial independence, use of the word ‘royal’, in this context, needed to be reviewed,” a royal source said.“Discussions are still ongoing,” the source said.Harry and Meghan use the “Sussex Royal” brand extensively.Their website is named sussexroyal.com and they applied to trademark the phrases Sussex Royal and Sussex Royal Foundation for use on books, stationery, clothing such as pyjamas and socks, charity campaigns and the provision of training, sport and social care. “As part of the process to transition the Duke and Duchess of Sussex into their new chapter -  planning has been well under way around the launch of their new non-profit organisation. Details will be shared in due course,” the royal source said.Harry has spoken of his sadness at being forced to give up his royal duties in a deal with the queen, saying there was no other option if he his wife Meghan were to seek an independent future away from stifling media intrusion.Under the arrangement, Harry will remain a prince and the couple will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they begin a new life split between Britain and North America, where they will spend the majority of their time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/royal-no-more-prince-harry-and-meghan-face-possible-loss-of-royal-brand/story-ygkQvLPay1sGBSCvO43m8M.html

19-02-2020||World||British TV presenter Caroline Flack died by hanging, reveals probe||British television presenter Caroline Flack, a former host of the hit show “Love Island”, was found hanged in her London home and paramedics were unable to revive her, an inquest heard on Wednesday.News of her death on Saturday has revived a debate about the conduct of tabloid media, which had published an avalanche of stories about her troubled private life.Flack, 40, had been awaiting trial on a charge of domestic assault which she denied. She had been subjected to online abuse by trolls and some newspapers had reported on the case in graphic detail.Earlier on Wednesday, her family released a message the presenter wrote days before she died. In the previously unpublished Instagram post, she said that her “whole world and future was swept from under my feet” when she was arrested for the alleged assault on her boyfriend.“I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night. Even on the night. But the truth is ... It was an accident,” she wrote. “I’ve been having some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time.”At the inquest, Coroner’s Officer Sandra Polson said police had been flagged down on a street in northeast London on Saturday by a person who had led them to a nearby address where a woman was lying on her back.“She had apparently been found hanging,” Polson told Poplar Coroner’s Court, without naming or identifying the person who had found her.An ambulance arrived and paramedics tried to revive her but were unsuccessful. She was pronounced dead at 1436 GMT on Saturday and was later formally identified by her twin sister Jody.An autopsy determined that the cause of death was suspension by ligature, Polson said. Assistant Coroner Sarah Bourke adjourned the inquest until Aug. 5.The daughter of a sales representative, Flack began as a pizza waitress but became one of the most prominent faces of Britain’s boom in reality television.After presenting a children’s morning show, she moved on to some of Britain’s biggest shows from the last decade, including “The X Factor” and the dating show Love Island, which draws millions of viewers and is a constant subject of media coverage and discussion on social media.In 2014, Flack won the glitzy dance competition show “Strictly Come Dancing”, which has some of the highest ratings in British TV.She stood down as the Love Island presenter after the assault charge in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-tv-presenter-caroline-flack-died-by-hanging-reveals-probe/story-QRBQawQKTObbIuxZTmfFtM.html
19-02-2020||World||Malaysia suspected MH370 downed in murder-suicide: Ex- Australian PM||Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has claimed “very top” level Malaysian officials believed vanished Flight MH370 was deliberately downed by the captain in a mass murder-suicide.The Malaysia Airlines jet vanished on March 8, 2014 carrying 239 people -- mostly from China -- en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.No sign of the plane was found in a 120,000-square kilometre (46,000-square mile) Indian Ocean search zone and the Australian- ed search, the largest in aviation history, was suspended in January 2017.A US exploration firm launched a private hunt in 2018 but it ended after several months of scouring the seabed without success.The disappearance of the plane has long been the subject of a host of theories -- ranging from the credible to outlandish -- including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.In an excerpt from a Sky News documentary airing Wednesday, Abbott claims he was told within a week of it vanishing that Malaysia believed the captain had intentionally downed the jet.“My very clear understanding from the very top levels of the Malaysian government is that from very, very early on here, they thought it was murder-suicide by the pilot,” he said.“I’m not going to say who said what to whom but let me reiterate, I want to be absolutely crystal clear, it was understood at the highest levels that this was almost certainly murder-suicide by the pilot --mass murder-suicide by the pilot.” Zaharie’s family and friends have long strongly rejected such claims as baseless.Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the former head of Malaysia’s civil aviation regulator, criticised Abbott’s remarks and said there was not sufficient proof to support the idea.“It is only a theory,” Azharuddin, who led the regulator when Flight MH370 disappeared, told AFP.“You do this speculation and it will hurt the next of kin. The family of the pilot will also feel very bad because you are making an accusation without any proof.” In 2016, Malaysian officials revealed the pilot had plotted a path over the Indian Ocean on a home flight simulator but stressed this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.But they failed to come up with any firm conclusions, leaving relatives angry and disappointed.Six passengers were Australian, including four from Queensland state, where Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk this week suggested authorities may pursue an inquest into their deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-suspected-mh370-downed-in-murder-suicide-ex-australian-pm/story-c9WlS9LobHWkoNHqDAnOGI.html
19-02-2020||World||China expels 3 WSJ journalists for ‘racial’ opinion piece they didn’t write||China on Wednesday revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal (WSJ) journalists in a rare decision to expel multiple journalists in one sweep as a response to what Beijing called a “racial” opinion piece published in the newspaper earlier this month.The three expelled Beijing-based reporters, two of them US nationals and one an Australian citizen, are not known to have contributed to the piece titled “China is the Real Sick Man of Asia”, written by US-based professor, Walter Russel Mead.Deputy bureau chief Josh Chin, reporter Chao Deng as well as reporter Philip Wen, have been ordered to leave the country in five days, according to a WSJ report.The decision comes a day after Washington designating five Chinese state media outlets as “foreign missions”, requiring them to comply with rules meant for diplomatic missions and consulates.On the journalists’ expulsion, the Chinese foreign ministry said it had asked WSJ to apologise for publishing the article but took action after the newspaper didn’t comply with Beijing’s demand.Announcing the decision to revoke the press credentials of the three journalists, the Chinese foreign ministry said the piece “smears” the efforts of the Chinese to fight the coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak.“On February 3, the WSJ published an article titled “China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia” by Professor Walter Russell Mead of the Bard College, which smears the efforts of the Chinese government and people on fighting the epidemic,” ministry spokesperson, Geng Shuang, said at the online ministry briefing on Wednesday.“The editors used such a racially discriminatory title, triggering indignation and condemnation among the Chinese people and the international community,” Geng said.“The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with WSJ and made our solemn position clear. China demands the WSJ recognise the severity of its mistake, make an official apology and hold the persons involved accountable,” Geng said.“Meanwhile, we reserve the right to take further actions,” it was conveyed to WSJ as a warning from Beijing.“However, regrettably, what the WSJ has done so far is nothing but parrying and dodging its responsibility. It has neither issued an official apology nor informed us of what it plans to do with the persons involved.”“The Chinese side handles affairs related to foreign journalists in accordance with laws and regulations. The Chinese people do not welcome those media that speak racially discriminatory languages and maliciously slander and attack China. As such, it is decided that from today, the Press Cards of three WSJ journalists will be revoked,” Geng added.Earlier, Geng criticised the US’s decision to designate five Chinese state media outlets (Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio International, China Daily and People’s Daily) as “foreign missions,” requiring them to comply with rules governing foreign embassies and consulates.US officials had said these outlets are owned and effectively controlled by the Chinese government and that each meets the definition of a foreign mission. “We deplore and reject the wrong decision of the US,” Geng said.“Media play an important role like a bridge or bond facilitating communication and understanding between people of different countries. Chinese media’s resident offices in the US have long been covering news following the principle of objectivity, impartiality, truth and accuracy,” he said.“They have helped promote mutual understanding, communication and cultural exchange between our two countries”.Geng said the US was “wantonly” restricting the press freedom of the Chinese outlets.“The US takes great pride in its press freedom. However, it is wantonly restricting and thwarting Chinese media outlets’ normal operation there. This is unjustified and unacceptable,” he said.“We urge the US to discard its ideological prejudice and Cold War zero-sum game mentality, and stop ill-advised measures that undermine bilateral trust and cooperation. We reserve the right to take further measures in response.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expels-3-wsj-journalists-for-racial-opinion-piece-they-didn-t-write/story-A7kdk7Yb8wFNPCOOr8iYcL.html
19-02-2020||World||1986 murder of former Swedish PM Palme may be close to being solved||The unsolved murder of former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was shot dead 34 years ago in downtown Stockholm, may be a step closer being solved.The case’s chief prosecutor, Krister Petersson, says he is “positive about being able to present what happened and who is responsible for it.”“My goal is to present (a charge in the case) in the first half of 2020,” Petersson told Swedish broadcaster SVT on Tuesday. “I am optimistic. We have worked hard, and we have leads in which we believe a lot.”Asked whether the investigation had gotten closer to solving the case, Petersson replied “in my opinion, yes.”Petersson who didn’t name any suspect or give any date for announcing a charge, said the case otherwise would be closed.Palme was gunned down Feb. 28, 1986, after he and his wife Lisbeth Palme left a movie theater in Stockholm.She was injured in the attack and later identified the shooter as criminal Christer Pettersson, who was convicted of Palme’s murder. The sentence was later overturned, leaving the murder an unsolved mystery.It is a coincidence that the names of the chief prosecutor and the main suspect who later died, are similar.The murder shocked the nation and is shook the Scandinavian county’s image as a nation so safe and peaceful that politicians could wander around in public without protection.Immediately after he was killed 30 years ago, thousands of shocked Swedes flooded the scene of his death with red roses, a symbol of Palme’s Social Democratic Party, building a meter-high wall of flowers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1986-murder-of-former-swedish-pm-palme-may-be-close-to-being-solved/story-cNWNiocCvBrNAhh2XWgmTL.html
19-02-2020||World||Passengers leave Japan coronavirus ship as China toll tops 2,000||Hundreds of relieved passengers finally disembarked a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan Wednesday after testing negative for the disease that has now claimed more than 2,000 lives in China and spread panic worldwide.With 542 positive cases, the Diamond Princess is easily the biggest cluster outside China, and Japan has faced mounting criticism for its quarantine arrangements as the passengers disperse into the wider world.“I’m relieved... I want to take a good rest,” said a 77-year-old Japanese passenger, who declined to give his name. He said he would be boarding Japan’s famously crowded railway system home.A fleet of yellow-dotted city buses, plus a dozen or so taxis, whisked away the passengers, many of whom dragged their luggage behind them and waved to former ship-mates on balconies as they disembarked.Fresh figures from China showed the death toll surging beyond 2,000 with more than 74,000 infected, although the rate of new cases continued to slow. Hundreds more cases have been reported in two dozen countries, including 15 in South Korea -- a 50-percent rise -- with a cluster of at least 11 around the southern city of Daegu.Hong Kong also reported its second death from the virus, which has proved extremely infectious.For the 500 passengers disembarking the Diamond Princess after testing negative, a difficult 14-day quarantine period has come to an end after their dream cruise turned into a nightmare of fear and boredom confined in many cases to small windowless cabins.“Our last deep gratitude to the crews and captain for such an amazing care... during the epic crisis... we can’t wait to see you again soon on board again,” tweeted passenger Yardley Wong, who left after 14 days cooped in a small cabin with her six-year-old son.Also read | India counts economic cost of corona outbreak‘Major failure’Many were left onboard with an anxious wait for test results that would allow them to disembark.Asked how he felt seeing others disembark while remaining on the ship, American lawyer Matt Smith told AFP: “I need an emoji for envy.”Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said the outbreak was “very serious” and could grow, but stressed that outside China’s Hubei, it was “affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people.”But in Japan, some have raised concerns about allowing people from the cruise ship to board flights home or spread out into the notoriously busy Japanese capital.Kentaro Iwata, a professor at the infectious diseases division of Kobe University, blasted the on-ship quarantine as a “major failure, a mistake”.“It is highly likely secondary infections occurred,” Iwata told AFP, saying scepticism from abroad of the quarantine was “only natural”.He later said in a video published online that he was self-quarantining after a brief visit to the ship where he raised major concerns about the procedures on board.“It was completely chaotic,” he said.Opinion | How coronavirus is stalling China’s military modernisation plans‘Hugs and flowers’Elated passengers also began disembarking from a second cruise ship that has been at the centre of coronavirus fear, the Westerdam, which made shore in Sihanoukville in Cambodia.Hundreds were departing after receiving a clean bill of health, as Prime Minister Hun Sen greeted the first passengers with hugs and flowers.American Christina Kirby, fretted about the stigma some Westerdam passengers could face once they return home. “I want people to remember that... there’s a human behind each of these stories and those who are ill deserve compassion,” she told AFP. Several countries appear to have lost patience with the quarantine on board the Diamond Princess and chartered planes to repatriate citizens.In the first such evacuation Monday, more than 300 Americans flew home even though 14 had tested positive. Britain, Hong Kong and Australia are among other countries that have vowed to repatriate people from the ship but will insist on a further 14-day quarantine on home soil.Nathalie MacDermott, a medical expert at King’s College London, recommended a further 14-day self quarantine for those leaving. “Given the circumstances on board the Diamond Princess, those passengers leaving the boat should be managed in a similar manner to those individuals departing a highly affected city or region,” said MacDermott.South Korea vowed to block foreigners who have been on board the Diamond Princess from entering the country.Disembarkation is expected to take around three days as more test results become available. The crew will begin a new quarantine when the last passenger has left.People in Yokohama appeared supportive of the decision to allow the passengers out despite the virus fears.“I am sure those people on board must be really worried. I hope they can go back to their normal life soon,” said 51-year-old Isamu Habiro.“As a Yokohama resident, I don’t want them to be treated unfairly. I want to cheer for them,” Habiro told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/passengers-leave-japan-coronavirus-ship-as-china-toll-tops-2-000/story-jBU7JPeeH4lRWg06RUtpwJ.html

19-02-2020||World||China turns to internet for food supplies amid virus fears||Wang Feng, house-bound by China’s virus outbreak, counts on the parka-clad delivery drivers of e-commerce giant JD.com to keep her kitchen stocked.Demand for online food vendors has surged since China’s government told the public to stay home as part of the most sweeping anti-disease controls ever imposed.On Tuesday, Wang’s phone buzzed with a text message that a delivery had arrived. The retiree bundled up against the winter cold, put on a face mask and emerged from her apartment complex to collect walnut milk and other goods from shelves on the sidewalk — an anti-virus measure to limit contact with drivers who normally go door to door.“They work really hard, and it’s dangerous,” said Wang. “Without their services, we would not be able to survive at all.”JD.com Inc. and rivals including Pinduoduo, Missfresh Inc. and Alibaba Group’s Hema are scrambling to fill a boom in orders while trying to protect their employees.E-commerce is one of the few industries to thrive after anti-virus controls starting in late January closed factories, restaurants, cinemas, offices and shops nationwide and extinguished auto and real estate sales.The government is trying to revive economic activity but has told anyone who can work from home to stay there. Some cities have imposed controls that allow only one member of a family out each day. That creates a ready market for online entertainment and shopping.“I can’t go out and can’t go to work,” said one of Wang’s neighbors, Chen Guang, who was picking up a box of vegetables from the sidewalk shelves under a sign that said, “Contactless Distribution Point.”Chen, who wore an entry pass for his apartment complex around his neck, said he shops online two to three times a week to replenish kitchen supplies.JD says over the past month, its drivers delivered 71,500 tons of rice, flour and other grains — 20 times more than the same period last year, — 27 million liters of cooking oil and 50,000 tons of meat, eggs, vegetables and other fresh products.Pinduoduo said orders for apples, strawberries and other fresh fruit from its 586,000 sellers of agricultural products were up 120% in January.Disease fears in other Asian markets also have propelled e-commerce demand for food and hygiene supplies. The Korea Economic Daily said online mask sales in South Korea rose 37,000% in January over a year earlier.Chinese e-commerce companies emerged in a market that lacked credit cards, reliable delivery and other features their counterparts in the United States and Europe take for granted. That required JD, Alibaba and some other competitors to create their own online payments systems or networks of warehouses and delivery drivers.JD has a 180,000-strong workforce of drivers and warehouse workers and says it is hiring 20,000 more to meet demand. The company said Dada Group, a delivery service in which JD is an investor, is adding 15,000 to its workforce.At a JD distribution center on Beijing’s southeast side, employees in red parkas, masks and gloves sorted packages and sprayed them with disinfectant.Goods from oranges and toilet paper to 32-packs of beer and cat litter came off trucks on one side of the building and passed down a conveyor belt to be sorted for individual drivers. Padded blue boxes held fresh fruit and vegetables.On the other side of the building, drivers loaded battery-powered three-wheeled delivery vans emblazoned with JD’s logo, a cartoon dog called Joy.The average driver delivers 150 to 190 packages a day, according to Sun Lansong, the facility’s manager.“Customers used to buy a lot of electronics,” Sun said. “Now they are buying rice, noodles, grain, oil, disinfectant, masks and so on.”Sun said distribution center employees and drivers spray packages, vehicles and their work stations with disinfectant and wash their hands repeatedly during the day. All are issued masks and gloves.“Before, it might have been rude to talk to people while wearing a mask. But now it feels much better,” said Sun.Other companies say they impose similar safety measures.Yanxuan, an online consumer products vendor owned by NetEase Inc., said it is giving away masks, hand sanitizer and other anti-disease products in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak.Pinduoduo Inc. announced the launch of a “Help the Farmers” channel this week to allow customers to buy directly from producers in poor areas.It said that was intended to support suppliers that are having trouble getting shipments to traditional markets due to anti-virus measures. The company promised 500 million yuan ($70 million) to subsidize purchases.Traditional grocery stores are open and heavily stocked as the government tries to reassure the public that food supplies are ample following a bout of panic buying after most access to the central city of Wuhan was suspended on Jan. 23. But many households are avoiding going out at all.“Now everyone pays more attention to it, for their own and everyone’s safety, to try to go out as little as possible, responding to the nation’s call,” Wang said.E-commerce companies also have been squeezed by the anti-disease controls. Employees were stranded in their hometowns following the Lunar New Year holiday after bus and train services in some areas were suspended to contain the outbreak.Sun said one of his facility’s employees from Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, and two from neighboring Henan province had yet to return.“I’m not afraid. Still the same. It feels like coming to work is making a contribution to society,” said Sun. “It sounds like this virus is terrible. In fact, the virus can be prevented.”The volume of goods being delivered has risen 30% since the outbreak, said a JD driver, Li Hu. He said the effort required is partly offset by only being allowed to take packages to a sidewalk collection point.“Customers are very supportive,” Li said. “They all understand the volume is bigger. They are short of daily necessities,” he said. “As soon as we arrive and call, customers come down immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-turns-to-internet-for-food-supplies-amid-virus-fears/story-UReR9F6751qh5D7gR8E8gJ.html

19-02-2020||World||SpaceX announces partnership to send four tourists into deep orbit||SpaceX announced a new partnership Monday to send four tourists deeper into orbit than any private citizen before them, in a mission that could take place by 2022 and easily cost more than $100 million.The company signed the deal with Space Adventures, which is based in Washington and served as an intermediary to send eight space tourists to the International Space Station (ISS) via Russian Soyuz rockets.The first of these was Dennis Tito, who paid $20 million for an eight hour stay on the ISS back in 2001. The last to go was Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, in 2009.The new tourists would be carried on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, which was developed to transport NASA astronauts and is due to make its first crewed flight in the coming months.“Our goal is to try to get to about two to three times the height of the space station,” Space Adventure’s president Tom Shelley told AFP.The ISS orbits at 400 kilometers (250 miles) above Earth’s surface, but the exact altitude of the Space Adventures mission would be determined by SpaceX, added Shelley.At its earliest, it could take place by late 2021, though “probably more likely is sometime in 2022,” he said.The capsule was designed to take astronauts from the surface to the ISS. Just nine square meters in volume, there are no private areas to sleep wash or use the bathroom.Mission duration will depend on what the customers want, said Shelley.- Weeks of training -Asked about the cost, Shelley replied: “It’s not cheap.”The cost of launching a Falcon 9 rocket is $62 million, according to publicly available figures, then there will be the cost of building a fresh Dragon capsule. Could it exceed $100 million?“Your assessment is correct, I can’t comment specifically on the numbers, but yeah those are the cost components,” he said.“We have a pretty good network of high net worth individuals around the world, many of whom we know are interested in spaceflight,” he added. Unlike space tourism to the ISS, which required six months of training in Moscow, the next mission will need four weeks of participation in the US.After a gap of 12 years, Space Adventures also wants to send two more tourists to the ISS on board a Russian rocket in 2021.Back in 2005, the company announced, amid great fanfare, that it planned to send two tourists around the Moon -- but that mission has now been abandoned, confirmed Shelley.Other companies involved in space tourism are Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin.The two are developing vessels to send tourists just beyond the border of space (80 kilometers or 100 kilometers, depending on the definitions chosen by both). Tickets for Virgin started at $250,000 when they first went on sale in the mid 2000s.SpaceX’s offering is far more ambitious and powered by the same reusable Falcon 9 rocket that puts satellites into space and send astronauts to the ISS.At the same time, Boeing is also developing a crew capsule called Starliner, also with the intention of transporting US astronauts to the ISS. Like SpaceX, Boeing also envisages sending tourists into space, but the program’s development is hampered by major glitches that resulted in the early termination of an uncrewed test flight in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-announces-partnership-to-send-four-tourists-into-deep-orbit/story-8cCBCqCbzoAtpTJJI9rkGK.html
19-02-2020||World||India-US agreements have history of last-minute dash||Indian officials working on a trade deal for announcement during US President Donald Trump’s India visit on February 24 and 25 shouldn’t despair at the lack of progress lately because Indo-US deals, agreements and announcements have tended to go down to the wire historically. Something to do with how democracies work?The 2010 US support for India’s claim to permanent membership of the UN Security Council was not irreversibly final till 10-15 minutes before President Barack Obama and his delegation set out for Parliament in New Delhi where he announced it, overturning a long-running US policy.Similarly, the foundation of the historic 2006 Indo-US civil nuclear agreement was laid a year before in a joint statement cleared just minutes before President George W Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced it in a joint press briefing in the Rose Garden at the White House.There are still seven days left to undo the damage done to the negotiations by top US trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer’s last-minute cancellation of his Delhi trip for end-stage discussions to finalise the deal in time for Trump’s visit starting February 24. Though a deal appears unlikely at this time, with a view understood to be gaining ground among certain US officials that it should be pushed to later this year, New Delhi is still trying and hoping to settle it one way or the other soon.Anish Goel, who was a senior director for India at the National Security Council in the Obama administration and travelled with the president to India on his 2010 trip, recalled that Obama, who had been buffeted by supporters and opponents of US support for permanent membership of the UNSC for India for weeks and months leading up to the moment, had “wanted to be reassured” one final time before committing himself to it in a November 8 address to a joint session of India’s parliament. Previous administrations had toyed with the idea of supporting India’s claim as a reflection of its growing global importance but they had pulled back, unwilling to overturn a decades-old US policy. So Obama, who cared deeply about his legacy, had been characteristically deliberative.Obama and his advisers met on November 8, 2010, at ITC Maurya, where they were staying, for a final review of what had been a “provisional decision” taken before they left for India. And with just minutes left for the delegation to leave for Parliament, President Obama sealed it. Goel said in an interview that the president himself wrote the paragraphs announcing his administration and the US’s support for India’s claims to a permanent seat at the UNSC.“As two global leaders, the United States and India can partner for global security —- especially as India serves on the Security Council over the next two years,” Obama said, reading the paragraphs he had written himself, referring to India’s upcoming two-year term on the council as a temporary member. “Indeed, the just and sustainable international order that America seeks includes a United Nations that is efficient, effective, credible and legitimate. That is why I can say today, in the years ahead, I look forward to a reformed United Nations Security Council that includes India as a permanent member.”Nothing has changed even a decade on. India is still not a permanent member of the UNSC, despite having secured the support of three other permanent members — four in all — with the exception of China. Another historic development in Indo-US relations that was reached in a last-minute dash was the framework of the civil nuclear deal of 2006. It was signed in Delhi, but its foundation was laid in a series of meetings and exchanges that took place a year before in Washington DC.Here is a reconstruction of those late night and early morning negotiations based on recollections of key players involved at the 10th anniversary of the announcement of the framework of the agreement between President Bush and Prime Minister Singh on the morning of July 18, 2005. The deal ensured that India would allow international regulators to inspect its nuclear facilities for civilian use, which, essentially, refers to power generation.Under pressure from some members of his delegation, PM Manmohan Singh had asked Natwar Singh, his foreign minister, to tell the Americans to call off the deal, the officials recalled. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wouldn’t settle for a no as an answer, and demanded a meeting with Singh, but the PM was reluctant as he didn’t want to rebuff her. It was the night of July 17, 2005; when Singh and Bush were slated to announce a deal the next morning from the Rose Garden at the White House.At 12:05 am, Singh is supposed to have said, “If the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commissioner and the national security adviser (MK Narayanan) are not going along with the figure, let’s call it off.” Rice finally got to meet Singh, but just minutes before his Rose Garden appearance. And then, all parties were all good to go. The historic Indo-US civilian nuclear deal was announced on July 18, 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-agreements-have-history-of-last-minute-dash/story-oEznTM241QqIxEhlQAdcyL.html
