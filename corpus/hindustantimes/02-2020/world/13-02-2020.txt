Most carried roses, Iraqi flags or signs defending their role in the regime change demonstrations. They marched through a tunnel and spilled out into Tahrir Square, the epicentre of the youth-dominated movement in a country where vast regions remain socially conservative.“We want to protect women’s role in the protests as we’re just like the men. There are efforts to kick us out of Tahrir but we’ll only come back stronger,” said Zainab Ahmad, a pharmacy student. “Some people were inciting against us a few days ago, seeking to keep women at home or keep them quiet. But we turned out today in large numbers to prove to those people that their efforts will end in failure,” she said. Ahmad appeared to be referring to controversial cleric Moqtada Sadr, a powerful figure who first backed the rallies when they erupted in October but who has since sought to discredit them.On Saturday, the militiaman-turned-politician had alleged drug and alcohol use among the protesters and said it was immoral for men and women to mix there. And a few moments before Thursday’s women’s march began, Sadr once again took to Twitter to slam the protests as being rife with “nudity, promiscuity, drunkenness, immorality, debauchery ... and non-believers”.In a strange turn, he said Iraq must not “turn into Chicago,” which he said was full of “moral looseness” including homosexuality, a claim that was immediately mocked online.‘Freedom, revolution, feminism’ While the numbers in Tahrir have dwindled in recent weeks, many Iraqi youth say the past four months of rallies have helped break down widespread conservative social norms. Men and women were seen holding hands in Tahrir and even camping out in the square together. On Thursday, men linked arms to form a protective ring around the women as they marched for over an hour. “Revolution is my name, male silence is the real shame!” they chanted, then adding “Freedom, revolution, feminism!” Some of their chants were snide remarks at Sadr himself.“Where are the millions?” some said, referring to the cleric’s call for a million-strong march several weeks ago that saw much smaller numbers hit the streets. The rallies have slammed Iraqi authorities for being corrupt, incompetent and beholden to neighbouring Iran. “They want us to be a second Iran, but Iraqi women weren’t born to let men dictate to them what to do,” protester Raya Assi told AFP on Thursday.“They have to accept us the way we are.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/accept-us-the-way-we-are-iraqi-women-defy-cleric-to-protest-authorities/story-v5x4qowF0UdZh49NCQ9AbJ.html
13-02-2020||World||‘God is Brazilian’: Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro lashes out at pope’s Amazon text||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right climate-change skeptic, lashed out at Pope Francis Thursday after the pontiff pleaded for the protection of the Amazon rainforest, and attacked the environmental group Greenpeace as “rubbish.”“Pope Francis said yesterday the Amazon is his, the world’s, everyone’s,” said Bolsonaro, who has often railed against international criticism of his environmental policies as an attack on Brazilian sovereignty.“Well, the pope may be Argentine, but God is Brazilian.”The quip came a day after Francis published a text urging Catholics to “feel outrage” over the exploitation of indigenous people and devastation caused by mining and deforestation in the Amazon.Since taking office in January 2019, Bolsonaro has faced condemnation from environmentalists and the international community over his policies on the world’s largest rainforest, which was devastated by record fires last year.Last week, he again drew criticism for proposing a bill that would allow mining, farming and hydroelectric power projects on formerly protected Amazon land, calling it a “dream.”Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon increased 85.3 percent in Bolsonaro’s first year in office, to more than 9,000 square kilometers (3,500 square miles).Speaking to journalists outside the presidential residence in Brasilia, Bolsonaro questioned why there had not been, in his view, a similar world reaction to the recent wildfires in Australia, which burned more than 100,000 square kilometers (around 39,000 square miles).“All Australia caught fire and nobody’s talking about Australia. Where is the zealotry for Australia?” he said.Bolsonaro also attacked Greenpeace, his latest tiff with the environmental group.“What is this crap called Greenpeace? Nothing but rubbish,” he said when asked about his moves to promote what he calls “sustainable development” by opening protected areas of the Amazon to mining and farming.Greenpeace has been an outspoken critic of Bolsonaro’s policies, accusing him of a “racist, anti-environmental agenda” that harms Brazil’s environment and its indigenous peoples.The Brazilian leader, who has been called a “Tropical Trump,” often answers his critics with vitriolic attacks.In October, he tried, without evidence, to link Greenpeace to a massive oil spill off Brazil’s northeast coast, calling it a “terrorist act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/god-is-brazilian-brazil-s-jair-bolsonaro-lashes-out-at-pope-s-amazon-text/story-XJlLu4JHAhLePSx3VTDpRJ.html
13-02-2020||World||No major change in ‘trajectory’ of coronavirus outbreak: WHO||The World Health Organization on Thursday said a sharp rise in reported COVID-19 cases in China, due to a change in counting methods, did not represent a big shift in the epidemic.China’s official death toll from the new coronavirus and the number of cases reported soared dramatically on Thursday after authorities altered the way they tally infections.“This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said at a press conference.“We’re not dealing, from what we understand, with a spike in cases of 14,000 on one day,” he said.“This increase that you’ve all seen in the last 24 hours is largely, in part, down to a change in how the cases are being reported.” Ryan also said he expected members of a WHO-led international mission to China to arrive over the weekend.In Hubei and its capital Wuhan, where tens of millions of people are trapped as part of an unprecedented quarantine effort, 242 new deaths were reported on Thursday.Another 14,840 people were confirmed to be infected in Hubei alone, with the new cases and deaths by far the biggest one-day increases since the crisis began.Outside Hubei, there were 12 more deaths but the number of new cases fell for a ninth day in a row, with 312 extra patients.Hubei authorities said the increases were because they had broadened their definition for infection to include people “clinically diagnosed” via lung imaging.Up until now, they had solely confirmed cases with a more sophisticated laboratory test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-major-change-in-trajectory-of-coronavirus-outbreak-who/story-TdAzi2nnPMbPsz6g2tKDmN.html
13-02-2020||World||Russia fines Twitter, Facebook for keeping data abroad||A Moscow court on Thursday fined social networking giants Twitter and Facebook for ignoring a Russian law requiring them to store Russian citizens’ user data inside the country.A court slapped the US-based companies with fines of four million rubles each (about $63,000) for failing to move their servers containing data of Russian users into Russia, Russian news agencies reported.They have 10 days to appeal.Contacted by AFP, Twitter said the company did not comment on court decisions.Both companies have been in a long-running dispute with Russia’s internet watchdog Roskomnadzor since a 2014 law passed requiring messaging services, search engines and social networking sites to store Russian data inside Russia.Russia has already blocked the Telegram messaging app and LinkedIn professional network, although the former remains widely accessible in the country.Twitter and Facebook are widely used by the political opposition in Russia and activists have expressed concern that locating data inside Russia will make them vulnerable to prosecution.Russia has launched many cases over extremism and incitement to unrest after users on the country’s popular VK social media network reposted messages on political protests or pictures judged as xenophobic.In some cases internet users have been jailed.A recent report by rights groups Agora and Roskomsvoboda said that in 2019 there were 200 prosecutions for “internet activity”, and the courts handed down 38 jail sentences after criminal convictions.Another new law passed in December allows Russia to cut internet traffic from international servers, to achieve what Vladimir Putin has called a “sovereign internet”.State internet watchdog Roskomnadzor said Thursday the new ruling against Twitter and Facebook was the first step in enforcing that law, adding that the companies still had to move their servers, Russian agencies reported.If they refuse to cooperate over the course of the next year, they will be liable to a second fine of 18 million rubles, the regulator said, TASS agency reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-fines-twitter-facebook-for-keeping-data-abroad/story-x4gMafsNhpR073qHI2D85J.html
13-02-2020||World||Sale of integrated air-defence system to India by US ‘disturbing’: Pakistan||Pakistan on Thursday termed the sale of integrated air-defence system to India by the US as “disturbing”, saying it would further destabilise the “already volatile region”.The US has approved the sale of an Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS) to India for an estimated cost of USD 1.9 billion to modernise its armed forces and to expand its existing air defence architecture to counter threats posed by air attacks.Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui told reporters during her weekly media briefing here that Pakistan saw the advance notice issued by US Defence Security Cooperation Agency, notifying the State Department’s approval of Foreign Military Sale to India of IADWS.“Sale of such sophisticated weapons system to India at this time is particularly disturbing as it would further destabilise the already volatile region. The US decision would disturb the strategic balance in South Asia with serious security implications for Pakistan and the region,” she said.“The International community is fully aware of India’s aggressive policy designs against Pakistan and threatening statements of Indian political and military leaders. South Asia cannot afford an arms race and conflict. It is therefore incumbent upon international community to prevent further destabilization of the region,” she added.Commenting on US President Donald Trump’s maiden visit to India later this month, she said he offered mediation on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute on several occasions and “now was time to fulfill the promise”.“We hope to see those offers being translated into practical actions. We hope that the dispute of Jammu and Kashmir will be raised during President Trump’s visit to India,” she said.She alleged that India committed 272 ceasefire violations along the Line of Control this year, killing three civilians and wounding 25 others.She also warned that Pakistan would respond most effectively and immediately to any Indian provocation.To a question about the upcoming meeting of the Financial Action Task Force in Paris where Pakistan will present its case to escape from being blacklisted, she said that Islamabad’s efforts were widely acknowledged. “We are certainly hopeful and working closely with our partners in the international community in this regard,” she said. The FATF in October last decided to keep Pakistan on its ‘Grey List’ for its failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad.If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.Since Pakistan continues to be in the FATF ‘Grey List’ , it would be very difficult for the cash-strapped country to get financial aid from the IMF, the World Bank, ADB and the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sale-of-integrated-air-defence-system-to-india-by-us-disturbing-pakistan/story-HdP9cEKKN7sYfGoO7KpgKN.html

13-02-2020||World||Coronavirus update: Cambodia praised for showing ‘international solidarity’||Passengers on a cruise ship that spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by five countries over coronavirus fears cheered and clapped as the vessel finally arrived at a port in Cambodia on Thursday.The MS Westerdam, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, docked in Sihanoukville in the evening after anchoring offshore early in the morning to allow Cambodian officials to board and collect samples from passengers with any signs of ill health or flu-like symptoms.None of the fluid samples taken from 20 people and transported by helicopter to the capital Phnom Penh for tests came back positive for coronavirus, Cambodia’s health ministry said.Prime Minister Hun Sen said he would travel to Sihanoukville on Friday to personally welcome the passengers.“We’ve had so many near moments we thought we were going home only to be turned away,” Angela Jones, an American tourist on board, told Reuters in a text message. “This morning, just seeing land was such a breathtaking moment.”Jones and her fellow passengers have spent almost two weeks at sea as several countries refused to let their ship dock.The timing of their final journeys home was still uncertain, however, as the ship faces health checks by authorities and passengers need to be taken to Phnom Penh to catch flights.The ship’s captain, Vincent Smit, initially told passengers in a letter that some could leave Cambodia as early as Friday, But in a later announcement, he said there could be delays because of the “number of organisations and authorities” supporting the operation to disembark, as well as the short notice given to Cambodia requesting permission to dock.Local officials in Sihanoukville told reporters that chartered planes to take people from the port town to Phnom Penh were not ready yet and the Westerdam had asked to delay disembarkation until Friday.Passengers have had regular health checks throughout the journey, said Holland America Line, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp. Nobody has fallen ill aboard, but the ship was turned away by Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that someone on board could have the new flu-like virus. The disease has killed more than 1,300 people and infected about 60,000 people, with the vast majority of deaths and cases in China.In a video address shown on board the Westerdam, Orlando Ashford, the president of Holland America Line, thanked passengers for their understanding in “incredibly unusual and challenging circumstances”.“I’m sure you’ll have some good stories to tell when you reach your final destination home,” Ashford said in the video.‘INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY’The sound of cheering inside the ship could be easily heard from Sihanoukville port when the Westerdam finally docked.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Cambodia for its example of “international solidarity” that the WHO has been calling for.Stoking authorities’ fears in countries on the ship’s route has been the quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. Of the 3,700 passengers and crew on that vessel, 175 have tested positive for the virus.On Tuesday, the Westerdam tried to dock in Bangkok but was denied permission by Thai authorities. On Wednesday, a Thai Navy warship escorted it out of the Gulf of Thailand, and it set course for Cambodia, the Marine Traffic website showed.In a video message, the U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, Patrick Murphy, said he had sent a team to help U.S. citizens with disembarking and continuing their journeys, and was coordinating with embassies of other nations.Jones was still puzzled how she ended up on a fortnight-long cruise to nowhere.“Thousands of travellers by air interacting with hundreds of people can land no problem but a cruise ship that made a one-day stop in Hong Kong almost two weeks ago is rejected by so many countries,” she said.“Still makes no sense”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-cambodia-praised-for-showing-international-solidarity/story-7R66HENV13ByeHSUTblH6I.html
13-02-2020||World||Indian-origin Alok Sharma appointed UK business minister||Indian-origin Alok Sharma was on Thursday named the new UK minister in charge of the crunch UN climate talks to be hosted by Britain this November. Agra-born Sharma, promoted to the post of Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Cabinet reshuffle, will take charge of the crucial summit ‘COP26’ as its former president was removed amid controversy just weeks ago.Claire Perry O’Neill, a former energy minister, had openly criticised Johnson soon after her sacking, saying the UK prime minister “doesn’t really get” climate change.Sharma, 52, has a tough role ahead of him as the man in charge of the UK’s climate strategy and also bringing about global consensus on some contentious issue around greenhouse gas emissions at the summit in Glasgow. The conference plans also have been hit by tensions between London and the devolved Scottish government in Edinburgh, led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, a vocal Johnson critic who is demanding a new independence referendum.“The Scottish government needs to work with us to make sure it is a successful summit,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.Sturgeon has insisted the two governments are working well together on COP but Sharma will undoubtedly face some political push and pull in this new complex post.He steps into a role previously turned down by former Prime Minister David Cameron, who said he believed a member of the Cabinet should take on the role. Sharma’s previous Cabinet position as Secretary of State for International Development, in charge of the Department for International Development (DfID), is seen as good grounding for the COP26 charge. Previous COP summits have all tended to be led by the host government’s most prominent minister with a relevant portfolio, usually the environment minister.Brought up in south-east England, the trained accountant and former banker has served in a number of junior ministerial roles since his entry into politics in 2010, including as fire minister. The MP for Reading West was elevated to the Cabinet level as DfID minister by Johnson in July last year and has reportedly been promoted further as business minister because the government plans to modify DfID to work closer with the trade department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-minister-alok-sharma-appointed-uk-business-minister/story-XVdIMKdavnm3Cps1VWwpnL.html
13-02-2020||World||Wuhan-400, ARDS: Fictional doomsday viruses that mirror the real ones||Amid the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak in China, Twitter users are scratching their heads to make sense of a fictional coincidence bordering on the bizarre.American novelist Dean Koontz wrote the novel, a thriller, “The Eyes of the Darkness” in 1981 – it is about a virus called “Wuhan-400” developed by Chinese scientists at bio laboratory in, well, Wuhan.The city of Wuhan, the capital of the central Chinese province of Hubei, is the epicentre of the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak that has so far killed 1,371 people and infected nearly 60, 000 globally.“The scientist leading the Wuhan-400 research is called Li Chen, who defects to the US with information about China’s most dangerous chemical weapons. Wuhan-400 affects people rather than animals and cannot survive outside the human body or in environments colder than 30 degrees Celsius,” Taiwan News said in a report on Thursday.“Wuhan-400 is a perfect weapon. It afflicts only human beings. No other living creature,” the book says.The similarities between the made-up virus and the Wuhan virus has got Twitter users struggling to comprehend the improbable coincidence, the report said.Some readers have pointed out that earlier editions of the book refer to the virus as Gorki-400, and made in erstwhile Soviet Union.“In response, several netizens have posted pictures of the book’s newer editions to explain the name of the virus was indeed altered, possibly due to the end of the Cold War in 1991,” the report said.In Koontz’s own description, it is a “…a modest little thriller about a woman, Tina Evans, who lost her child, Danny, when he was in an accident on a trip with his scouting troop.”She later finds out her son was accidentally infected with the virus.It’s, of course, not the first time that uncanny similarities between fiction and fact have emerged about virus outbreaks.A novel jointly written by Robert Ludlum and Gayle Lynds in 2000 mentioned a disease called the “acute respiratory distress syndrome” (ARDS) in the book called the Hades Factor – a good three years before the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic broke out in China first, and then spread globally.“A homeless man in Boston, an army major in California and a teenage girl in Atlanta all die suddenly and painfully, each a victim of an unknown doomsday virus. For three days, a team of scientists in a US government laboratory has been frantically trying to unlock the virus’ secret…” read the back cover blurb of the novel.Eerily, the symptoms of ARDS and SARS – and also actually true for Covid-19 – were similar: Cold, cough, fever and respiratory problems.In 2006, the novel was adapted for a made-for-television thriller starring Stephen Dorff and Mira Sorvino, titled “Covert 1- The Hades Factor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-400-ards-fictional-doomsday-viruses-that-mirror-the-real-ones/story-dSEzbi1fCtucyfcDz8TuSO.html

He was first elected in 2015 from Richmond, Yorkshire.Also promoted is Alok Sharma, who is the new business secretary. Priti Patel, another Indian origin cabinet minister, stays as the home secretary, which is another top role in the UK government. The appointments mean that three of the top cabinet jobs in the Johnson government are held by Indian origin ministers.Suella Braverman (nee Fernandes) of Goa origin is the fourth person of Indian origin to hold a top post in the Johnson government. Suella Braverman was appointed attorney general and will attend cabinet meetings.Rishi Sunak will be in-charge of steering the UK’s finances as it seeks to forge a new path in the post-Brexit world. His immediate is to present the next budget in March.The new appointments mark a new record for the 1.5 million strong Indian community’s participation in British politics since the late 19th century, when Dadabhai Naoroji became the first Indian to be elected to the House of Commons.As James Cleverly, chairman of the Conservative party said at a recent Republic Day event, Johnson is leading the “most desi government” in British history.Sunak, who is married to Narayana Murthy’s daughter Akshata, soon came under fire from the opposition Labour, which called him Johnson’s “stooge” in the Treasury department. He succeeded Javid, who became a victim of politics linked to Johnson’s close aide, Dominic Cummings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-uk-job-for-rishi-sunak/story-XT6JvhCF00Oe4iHPxAmLDN.html

In July he was appointed chief secretary to the Treasury -- the second most important job in the finance ministry.He’s frequently been sent out by the government to do the morning round of TV and radio interviews, a clear sign that he’s seen by Number 10 as a solid performer. Notably, he deputized for Johnson in televised leadership debates during the election campaign.Sunak entered Parliament in 2015, elected to represent Richmond in Yorkshire, the constituency previously held by William Hague, a former foreign secretary and party Leader. Theresa May appointed him as a junior minister for local government in January 2018, Sunak backed Johnson in last year’s leadership campaign in a joint piece in The Times with fellow moderates Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden. That earned him a promotion to the cabinet when Johnson won the leadership.Sunak is a more pro-Brexit chancellor than Javid, who campaigned for Remain back in 2016 (Sunak was a Leaver). In 2017, he co-authored an article highlighting five benefits of Brexit, including striking new trade deals, improving regulation and being free of EU state aid rules.“It’s time to shout about that idealistic and hopeful vision for post-Brexit Britain,” he wrote. “Opportunities like these are what Brexit means to us.”The Hindu son of a doctor and a pharmacist, Sunak attended Winchester College, one of the country’s most prestigious private schools, before studying at Oxford and Stanford Universities.

Her positive test result was confirmed after her death,” he said.The case comes as Japan deals with more than 200 confirmed infections from a quarantined cruise ship that has been moored off the coast since early February.Those who test positive on the boat have been taken to hospitals, with five people in serious condition.Authorities said Thursday they would allow elderly passengers on board to move from the ship to government-designated lodgings for the rest of their quarantine if they test negative for the virus.So far, 218 people on board have tested positive for the newly named COVID-19, along with one quarantine officer.The ship is scheduled to stay in quarantine until February 19 -- some 14 days after the isolation period began.Japan has separately reported at least 28 cases of the virus, including among citizens it evacuated from Hubei, the Chinese province at the epicentre of the deadly outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-health-minister-confirms-nation-s-first-coronavirus-death/story-twlir1vsPxr8aUtFJ8l1BP.html

Chinese officials said the surge in numbers is because they have started including ‘clinically-diagnosed’ cases in the total number, which has added 13,332 new cases in a single day, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases to 48,206. The death toll in Hubei also soared by a record 254 on Thursday, taking the total to around 1,360.The diagnosis criterion has been widened to include suspected cases with CT scans showing indications of the disease so that more people with symptoms may receive the same treatment as a laboratory-confirmed cases, according to Chinese officials. An online release cited a national-level virus response plan issued last week, but it is unclear why Hubei suddenly started implementing the new methodology this week.Despite the surge in numbers, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that the Covid-19 behaviour doesn’t seem to be as aggressive or accelerating outside of Hubei province.The sudden change and surge in numbers, however, has revived suspicion of China underplaying the extent of the epidemic, which has led in the world’s largest ever lockdown that has placed millions in virtual house arrest in a desperate attempt to contain the spread of the virus that has triggered public anger against the government bungled management. China responded to public anger by sacking Jiang Chaoliang, the party chief of Hubei province, even as a district of the Chinese city of Shiyan in central Hubei province as implemented “war time measures” to combat the virus.Cambodia came to the rescue of passengers marooned aboard Holland America’s MS West liner and granted it permission to disembark at Sihanoukville after the ship spent two weeks at sea because no other country would allow it to dock because of fears of infection. The virus continued to play havoc on sea, with Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan reporting another 44 Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of cases aboard to 218.In India, no new cases have been reported after the diagnosis of three students who came back home to Kerala from Wuhan, where they were studying medicine. To date, only three students in Kerala are confirmed laboratory positive for Covid-19 two last week. Two of them are already free of infection, but all three continue to be quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-spike-in-coronavirus-cases-in-china-which-blames-new-diagnosis-criterion/story-LN0iFREG8jq1nCGxP7xnIJ.html
13-02-2020||World||China sacks party chiefs at coronavirus-stricken epicentre||China has sacked the top political leaders of virus-stricken Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, the highest-profile figures to be removed so far in a crisis that has killed 1,355.The removals are the latest in a purge that saw Hubei’s two most senior health officials fired earlier this week as criticism grows over the way the outbreak has been handled, with claims of under-reporting.The province reported a dramatic spike in virus cases Thursday, raising the total number of nationwide infections to nearly 60,000 after Hubei authorities changed the way they count infections -- fuelling fears over a lack of transparency.Jiang Chaoliang, Hubei’s party secretary, will be replaced by Shanghai mayor Ying Yong, while Wuhan party chief Ma Guoqiang will be replaced by an official from Shandong, Xinhua news agency reported. Thursday’s spike came as Hubei officials said they were correcting previous diagnoses to include people “clinically diagnosed” with the virus, adding 14,840 new cases to its total.The new system means doctors can use lung imaging, rather than solely laboratory tests.The virus is believed to have originated late last year at a seafood market in Hubei province’s capital Wuhan.Pressure on local officials for their perceived incompetence has mounted particularly after the death last week of a Chinese doctor who was punished by Wuhan authorities for raising the alarm about the new virus.Wuhan authorities also faced criticism in January for going ahead with an annual public banquet for 40,000 families just days before the city was placed on lockdown.Other changes have been taking place in the province, including the sacking of a top Red Cross official in Wuhan for dereliction of duty and the removal of health officials in other cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sacks-party-chiefs-at-coronavirus-stricken-epicentre/story-NITThp2oVIHBZKg3dHDSlJ.html
13-02-2020||World||Stranded by coronavirus blockade, Chinese man fights to get back to work||Tian Bing has spent six straight nights curled up in the back of his white sedan, stranded at an expressway service station in eastern Jiangsu province in China because of a blockade aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.On Sunday, the 35-year-old completed a near-2,000 km (1,243 mile) drive from his hometown to Taixing, a city of about 1 million people in Jiangsu, to return to work. But policemen guarding the highway exit to the city, where he runs a home appliances repair business, told him to turn back.The reason: Tian is not considered a local resident under China’s Byzantine hukou system, barring him from entry due to the city’s recent decision to keep out outsiders.“I think I’ve done everything I can do,” he said. Before setting off on the near two-day drive, Tian got a health certificate showing he was virus-free and called ahead to the city officials, who assured Tian he would face no problems.Tian subsists on biscuits and instant noodles, with most restaurants at the service station shut down. He sleeps with a seat cushion as his pillow, huddled in the back with the engine shut off on fear that the exhaust might poison him in his sleep.He is not the only one stuck in such a rest stop limbo. Posts on China’s social media platforms show several people trapped in unfamiliar places, under quarantine or abandoned in no man’s land amid travel and entry restrictions that sprang up throughout the country.The police guarding the expressway exit to Taixing have said Tian can come in if officers in the compound of his rented home agree to pick him up. But Tian said the community officers refused because they don’t want to be responsible for anything that goes wrong.“They (the officials) don’t care if you die on the highway because you have nowhere to stay,” Tian said at the service station near another city about 90km from Taixing.Tian is not ready to give up, however. He calls the city government every day, even though his wife is pleading with him to go someplace else that will accept him, even if under quarantine.“I want to get off this expressway to deal with my business as soon as possible,” Tian said. “My seven employees need to eat and pay their rent too; that’s absolutely my responsibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stranded-by-coronavirus-blockade-chinese-man-fights-to-get-back-to-work/story-bdAIAO4oAuGxiX67FQexFN.html

13-02-2020||World||Jeff Bezos sets record with $165 million Beverly Hills home purchase||Jeff Bezos is on a shopping spree befitting the world’s richest man.The Amazon.com Inc. founder agreed to pay $165 million for a Beverly Hills mansion on nine acres, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, setting a record for a Los Angeles-area home.The property designed for Hollywood film titan Jack Warner in the 1930s was described by Architectural Digest in 1992 as the “archetypal studio mogul’s estate,” built in Georgian style with expansive terraces and its own nine-hole golf course.It’s emerging just days after regulatory filings showed Bezos cashed out $4.1 billion of Amazon shares and comes amid reports that he’s also entered the art market. He reportedly set a record for artist Ed Ruscha at a Christie’s auction with a $52.5 million purchase of “Hurting the Word Radio #2” in November and also bought “Vignette 19” by Kerry James Marshall for $18.5 million.The purchase of the Warner estate, described by the person on condition they not be named, was reported earlier Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal. The property has belonged to David Geffen since 1990, when he paid $47.5 million. Bezos was seen socializing on the entertainment mogul’s mega-yacht last summer, visible in an Instagram post with girlfriend Lauren Sanchez and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s former chief, Lloyd Blankfein.It’s something of a style makeover for Bezos, 56, whose once-low-key personal life has been a source of frequent headlines since he and MacKenzie Bezos divorced in 2019. He’s been walking red carpets with Sanchez and has even been drawn into geopolitical controversies over allegations that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was involved in hacking his phone.Bezos had been shopping for an estate for months, according to agents who were contacted during the search. In a January interview, realtor Josh Flagg said he’d get a call “at least once a month from different agents asking if I have something.”The purchase adds to a string of mega-deals for high-end residential properties since the start of 2019. Citadel founder Ken Griffin plunked down record $238 million for a New York penthouse at 220 Central Park South. Lachlan Murdoch, the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, paid a then-California record of about $150 million for a Bel-Air estate that had been featured about a half century ago on “The Beverly Hillbillies” TV show. Hedge fund billionaire Steven Schonfeld and his wife Brooke closed on a mega-mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, for $111 million.Bezos’s real-estate empire already features homes on both U.S. coasts, such as a Washington, D.C., mansion where he recently hosted a party for capital elite including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. He also owns 170,000 hectares (420,000 acres) of desert scrub in Texas.Regardless, he can afford it. Even after his marital split, he’s worth $131.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-sets-record-with-165-million-beverly-hills-home-purchase/story-vnweLOXwHaWHEDkILSvQFL.html
