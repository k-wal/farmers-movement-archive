28-02-2020||World||British passenger from novel coronavirus affected ship in Japan dies||A British man who was on board a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo has died, Japan’s health ministry said Friday.The unidentified man’s death is the latest linked to infections on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where more than 700 other people tested positive for the illness.The ministry confirmed the man’s nationality and death on Friday without giving further details. He is the first Briton to die from the illness and joins five Japanese nationals who also succumbed to the pathogen.The death comes as the governor of Japan’s rural northern island of Hokkaido urged people to stay at home this weekend in a desperate effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak.Governor Naomichi Suzuki issued an unprecedented call in a televised meeting of government executives asking locals to “refrain from going out during the weekend” to prevent further spread of the virus.The region has seen at least 63 cases, including two deaths, accounting for more than a quarter of all infections in Japan excluding those on the Diamond Princess.Suzuki’s plea came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe defended his call for schools across the country to close, saying the coming weeks are “crucial” in containing infections.Abe has also asked organisers to consider cancelling or postponing major gatherings, with a range of events from football matches to concerts already cancelled or rescheduled in recent days.“We have to prevent emergence of a new cluster of patients among children,” he told parliament.“We made this decision because we regard it as our political responsibility.”The government cannot order schools to shut -- a power that belongs to local education boards -- and regional leaders voiced their surprise and mixed reactions at the abrupt announcement.“This is shocking news,” Chiba city mayor Toshihito Kumagai posted on Twitter, saying a blanket schools closure could put pressure on working parents including medical and emergency professionals.But some experts have recommended closures, with a key member of a government panel saying earlier that smaller-scale school closures had helped contain a flu outbreak in 2009.The steady spread of the virus in Japan has also fuelled speculation about whether Tokyo will be able to safely host the summer Olympics from July as planned.The virus has so far infected at least 210 people across the country.- ‘Really angry’ -Abe’s call for school closures affects primary schools, high schools and junior high, but nurseries and after-school clubs that also cater to children during holidays will stay open, raising questions about the effectiveness of the policy.“I’m really angry about this decision, which won’t do anything to protect children,” one mother of two told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.“My company doesn’t offer teleworking, so I’m going to have to take days off,” added another mother. “Financially, it’s very hard.”Others were more understanding, with Miho Matsuno, a mother currently on maternity leave, saying measures to contain the infection were needed.“I think that we have to do the maximum possible, even if it seems excessive,” she told AFP.- Disney closes parks -The operator of Tokyo’s Disneyland and DisneySea said the two parks -- which attract more than 30 million visitors a year -- will be closed from Saturday until March 15.Universal Studios Japan also said it would close the park for two weeks.But a state visit by China President Xi Jinping planned this spring will still go ahead, Japan’s foreign minister said.He said the two countries were coordinating to ensure the “once-in-a-decade event” would be a success.Japan’s government has also fielded criticism over its handling of the quarantined cruise ship.Hundreds of passengers who tested negative were allowed to depart the vessel after the 14-day quarantine on board, but several have since been diagnosed with the virus.The Diamond Princess’s operator confirmed all passengers have now left the ship, while crew are still disembarking to enter a new quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-passenger-from-novel-coronavirus-affected-ship-in-japan-dies/story-wHEcv60U009deWKuhv5znJ.html

Foreign policy experts, inside and outside the government, are to be consulted to constructively challenge traditional assumptions.The review, billed as the largest such exercise since the Cold War, is expected to “cover all aspects of the UK’s place in the world”, officials said. It will include the diplomatic service, besides approach to defence, security and international development.One of the UK’s largest diplomatic networks is based in India.Johnson said: “I am determined to lead a Government that delivers for our people - both at home and abroad. The UK’s institutions, expertise, leadership and values are renowned around the world”.“But we cannot rest on our laurels. We must do more to adapt. We will be judged by how we respond to the opportunities ahead”.The Johnson government believes that Brexit presents new opportunities to define and strengthen Britain’s place in the world at a time when the global landscape is changing dramatically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-looks-to-review-foreign-policy-to-redefine-place-in-the-world-post-brexit/story-2kfPNCnbke9zbOnpYwHZMN.html
28-02-2020||World||Russia and Turkey hold crisis talks after deadly air strike in Syria’s Idlib||The leaders of Russia and Turkey held crisis talks on Friday to try to scale down tensions after 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in a regime air strike in Syria.The international community voiced fears of a rapidly-rising risk of escalation after the attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of Idlib, where President Bashar al-Assad is waging a bloody campaign to oust rebels from their last holdout.Hours after the strike, Turkey warned it was opening the gates for refugees to flee to Europe, a move that could have major repercussions for its western neighbours and prompted Greece to double its border patrols.The deadly bombardment added to weeks of mounting tensions between rebel supporter and NATO member Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow, and stoked international concerns about the plight of people living in the battleground province.- ‘Room for dialogue’ -It was the highest single death toll since the Turkish army first intervened in Syria in 2016, and brought the total number of Turkish troops killed in Idlib this month to 53.Turkey said it retaliated to Thursday’s deaths by hitting more than 200 regime targets in drone and artillery bombardments.The reprisals killed 16 Syrian soldiers, according to a monitoring group, but there was no immediate confirmation from Damascus.Adding to the tensions, Moscow announced that two of its warships were transitting through the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul in plain sight of the city.But in a move to try to defuse the crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone on Friday.“There is always room for dialogue,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. “The conversation was detailed and devoted to the necessity to do everything” to implement a ceasefire deal agreed in 2018 between the two countries to try to bring calm to Idlib.Lavrov said Russia was ready to help improve the security of Turkish troops in Syria after the defence ministry said the slain soldiers had been among “terrorist groups” in Idlib.The UN has repeatedly warned that the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.But Russian vetoes, often backed by China, have chronically crippled UN action.NATO held urgent talks on the crisis on Friday, and joined the UN and the US in calling for urgent de-escalation.“There is a risk of sliding into a major open international military confrontation,” said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, echoing international alarm about the violence.“It is also causing unbearable humanitarian suffering and putting civilians in danger.” - Growing discontent -Hours after the strike, Turkey threatened to go back on a deal with the EU and said it would open the way for refugees to go to Europe.“We will no longer keep the doors closed for refugees who want to go to Europe,” an official told AFP on condition of anonymity.Turkey, which is already home to around four million Syrian refugees, fears more people arriving in the country where there is growing popular discontent against their presence.In response, Greece said it was tightening its border security “to the maximum level possible” and doubling border patrols.The EU called on Ankara to uphold its side of the migrant pact which was aimed at stemming the flow of refugees and migrants towards Europe.Turkey also Friday called on the international community to establish a no-fly zone over Idlib, where regime forces have since December clawed back chunks of the region, forcing close to one million people to flee their homes and shelters amid bitter cold.In a series of tweets, Erdogan’s communications director Fahrettin Altun accused Assad of “conducting ethnic cleansing” and seeking to drive millions of Syrians out of Idlib. Groups of migrants have already moved towards western Turkey seeking to reach Greece, Turkey’s private DHA news agency reported.“Without urgent action, the risk of even greater escalation grows by the hour,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, reiterating Secretary General Antonio Guterres’s call for an immediate ceasefire.The US State Department said Washington stood by Turkey and continues to call “for an immediate end to this despicable offensive by the Assad regime, Russia and Iranian-backed forces”.Elsewhere, jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government’s devastating offensive.An AFP correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings.The counter-offensive could, however, be short-lived as the Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities.On Friday, four members of a single family, two of them children, were killed in air strikes, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December.State news agency SANA acknowledged there were “fierce clashes” between the army and “terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-and-turkey-hold-crisis-talks-after-deadly-air-strike-in-syria-s-idlib/story-14LCICkEzPEJ10v2AvcX9J.html

28-02-2020||World||Coronavirus death toll in China now 2788, 9 new cases outside epicentre Hubei||The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 2788 in China with 44 new deaths reported until early Friday, authorities said, adding that the total number of infected persons was nearly 79000.Among the deaths, 41 were in the worst-hit central Chinese Hubei province, two in Beijing and one in the remote Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), the national health commission (NHC) said Friday morning.Continuing the trend of the covid-19 outbreak slowing down across the country, the Chinese mainland reported nine new confirmed cases on Thursday outside Hubei.Globally, the epidemic has killed more than 2,800 people and infected about 83,000.The chief of WHO has said that the world is at a “decisive point” to tackle the coronavirus outbreak as new cases outside China has outnumbered that inside the country.“We are at a decisive point,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“For the past two days, the number of new cases reported in the rest of the world has exceeded the number of new cases in China,” he said.In China, the NHC said 2,308 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.A total of 36,117 people had been discharged from hospitals after recovery.The condition of nearly 8000 people continues to be severe, officials added.More than 65000 others, mostly family and contacts of the infected, are still under medical observation.Meanwhile, in the first case of its kind, the pet dog of an infected patient in Hong Kong tested weak positive for the virus, the Hong Kong authorities said, adding that further tests are needed to confirm an infection.While the dog does not have any relevant symptoms, its nasal and oral cavity samples were tested weak positive to the virus, a spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government said on Friday.Zhong Nanshan, a renowned respiratory disease expert who is heading China’s covid-19 containment efforts has said that the country’s epidemic situation will likely be “under control” by the end of April.Speaking at a press conference Thursday, Zhong said his team had added two influencing factors — China’s intervention methods and the elimination of peak travel after the Chinese New Year to their forecast model to determine possible outcome scenarios to the epidemic.Chinese authorities, meanwhile, have launched a probe after a former prisoner at a disease-hit prison in the locked-down city of Wuhan in Hubei travelled to Beijing, where she tested positive for covid-19.The patient, an elderly woman surnamed Huang, arrived in Beijing last week following her release from the Wuhan Women’s Prison where several cases of the infection have been reported.The authorities are investigating how Huang managed to get out of Wuhan despite showing symptoms of the disease and was able navigate the transportation restrictions in place to contain the spread of the disease.Beijing has so far reported more seven deaths and over 400 cases in ongoing outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-in-china-now-2788-9-new-cases-outside-epicentre-hubei/story-opjGvFeZPfdikmoSyEpYTN.html

The ban comes into immediate effect and will apply at least until 15 March,” the government said in a statement after the country registered 15 cases.“In the case of public or private events at which fewer than 1,000 people would gather, event organisers must carry out a risk assessment in conjunction with the competent cantonal authorities to decide whether or not the event can be held”.The government said it was “aware that this measure will have a significant impact on public life in Switzerland” but added that “it should prevent or delay the spread of the disease, thus reducing its momentum”.The federal government said that the scale of the outbreak allowed it to take special powers to order measures that are normally the responsibility of Switzerland’s cantons.“The cantons are responsible for enforcing the ban,” the statement said.Health Minister Alain Berset said that similar measures had proved “effective” in other countries.He told reporters that the number of cases in Switzerland was “not a surprise for us”, adding: “We have to expect an increase in cases in the next few days”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-suspends-all-major-events-until-march-15-to-combat-coronavirus/story-R06cLMZWIc15ljqzhiwDjJ.html
28-02-2020||World||Iran coronavirus deaths jump to 26, Vice President Ebtekar tests positive||The coronavirus epidemic in Iran has cost 26 lives, the health ministry announced Thursday, with a vice president becoming the latest top official to be infected as the spread appeared to accelerate.Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference that the tally of infections had risen to 245 with 106 more cases confirmed -- the highest number for a single day since Iran announced its first infections on February 19.The Islamic republic has the highest death toll from the virus outside China, where COVID-19 first emerged.Among the latest coronavirus sufferers is one of Iran’s seven vice presidents, Masoumeh Ebtekar, who oversees women’s affairs.Ebtekar, a former spokeswoman for students who took 52 Americans hostage at the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, is being treated at home and members of her team have been tested, state news agency IRNA reported. Mojtaba Zolnour, head of parliament’s national security and foreign affairs committee, also contracted the virus, appearing in a video posted by Fars news agency saying he was in self-quarantine.The cleric is a deputy for the Shiite holy city of Qom in central Iran where the country’s first cases were detected.According to media reports, among the deceased in Qom on Thursday was theologian Hadi Khroroshahi, who in 1981 was named Iran’s first ambassador to the Vatican.The announcement by Zolnour comes two days after another top official, deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi, head of the government’s coronavirus task force, said he too had contracted the virus.- Must ‘not gather’ -On Wednesday, Iranian authorities announced domestic travel restrictions for people with confirmed or suspected infections.They also placed curbs on access to major Shiite pilgrimage sites, including the Imam Reza shrine in second city Mashhad and the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom.Visitors to the shrines will be allowed to visit on condition they are provided “with hand-washing liquids, proper (health) information, masks”, Health Minister Saeed Namaki said.They must “not gather together in groups but just pray and leave”, he said.In a rare move, authorities announced the cancellation of the main Friday weekly prayers in Tehran, Qom and Mashhad as well as in the capitals of 22 of Iran’s 31 provinces and other infected areas.School closures have been extended in affected areas and universities are to remain closed for another week starting from Saturday.“All of these decisions are temporary and if the situation changes, we might intensify or ease them,” Namaki said.In a message of thanks to doctors and nurses, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he hoped their efforts would help “eradicate this sinister virus soon”.International health experts have expressed concern about Iran’s handling of the outbreak. But Tehran insists the situation has been “improving”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-coronavirus-deaths-jump-to-26-vice-president-ebtekar-tests-positive/story-1mYJYRFUkVlWj8VVk4dOoO.html
28-02-2020||World||Astronomers detect biggest explosion in universe after Big Bang||The biggest explosion in the universe after the Big Bang has been discovered by scientists studying a distant galaxy cluster.The blast took place as a result of a supermassive black hole at the Centre of a galaxy hundreds of millions of light-years away.The explosion released five times more energy than the previous record holder.Professor Melanie Johnston-Hollitt, from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, said that the event was extraordinarily energetic.“We have seen outbursts in the Centres of galaxies before but this one is really, really massive,” said Johnston-Hollitt.“And we do not know why it is so big. But it happened very slowly -- like an explosion in slow motion that took place over hundreds of millions of years,” added Johnston-Hollitt.The explosion occurred in the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster, about 390 million light-years from Earth.It was so powerful it punched a cavity in the cluster plasma -- the super-hot gas surrounding the black hole.Lead author of the study, Dr Simona Giacintucci, from the Naval Research Laboratory in the United States, said that the blast was similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which ripped the top off the mountain.“The difference is that you could fit 15 Milky Way galaxies in a row into the crater this eruption punched into the cluster’s hot gas,” said Giacintucci.Professor Johnston-Hollitt said that the cavity in the cluster plasma had been seen previously with X-ray telescopes.But scientists initially dismissed the idea that it could have been caused by an energetic outburst, because it would have been too big.“People were skeptical because of the size of the outburst. But it really is that. The Universe is a weird place,” she said.The researchers only realised what they had discovered when they looked at the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster with radio telescopes.“The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove,” said co-author Dr Maxim Markevitch, from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.“This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here,” Markevitch said.The discovery was made using four telescopes -- NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, ESA’s XMM-Newton, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Western Australia and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India.Professor Johnston-Hollitt, who is the director of the MWA and an expert in galaxy clusters, likened the finding to discovering the first dinosaur bones.“It is a bit like archaeology. We have been given the tools to dig deeper with low-frequency radio telescopes so we should be able to find more outbursts like this now,” she said.The finding underscores the importance of studying the Universe at different wavelengths, Professor Johnston-Hollitt said.“Going back and doing a multi-wavelength study has really made the difference here,” she said.Professor Johnston-Hollitt said that the finding is likely to be the first of many.“We made this discovery with Phase 1 of the MWA, when the telescope had 2048 antennas pointed towards the sky,” she said.“We are soon going to be gathering observations with 4096 antennas, which should be ten times more sensitive. I think that is pretty exciting,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astronomers-detect-biggest-explosion-in-universe-after-big-bang/story-M7rImvWYSqrQDkqi6KWcSM.html

28-02-2020||World||US spy agencies monitor coronavirus spread, concerned about how India would cope: Sources||US intelligence agencies are monitoring the global spread of coronavirus and the ability of governments to respond, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, warning that there were concerns about how India would cope with a widespread outbreak.While there are only a few known cases in India, one source said the country’s available countermeasures and the potential for the virus to spread given India’s dense population was a focus of serious concern. US intelligence agencies are also focusing on Iran, where the country’s deputy health minister has fallen ill during a worsening outbreak. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday the United States was “deeply concerned” Tehran may have covered up details about the spread of coronavirus.A US government source said Iran’s response was considered ineffective because the government only has minimal capabilities to respond to the outbreak. Another source said US agencies were also concerned about the weak ability of governments in some developing countries to respond to an outbreak. The US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee has received a briefing on the virus from the spy agencies.“The Committee has received a briefing from the IC (intelligence community) on coronavirus, and continues to receive updates on the outbreak on a daily basis,” an official of the House Intelligence Committee told Reuters.“Addressing the threat has both national security and economic dimensions, requiring a concerted government-wide effort and the IC is playing an important role in monitoring the spread of the outbreak, and the worldwide response,” the official added.A source familiar with the activities of the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Republican Senator Richard Burr and Democratic Senator Mark Warner, said the panel was receiving daily updates.The role of US intelligence agencies in responding to the coronavirus epidemic at this point principally involves monitoring the spread of the illness around the world and assessing the responses of governments. They are working closely with health agencies, such as the US Center for Disease Control, in sharing information they collect and targeting further intelligence gathering. One source said US agencies would use a wide range of intelligence tools, ranging from undercover informants to electronic eavesdropping tools, to track the virus’ impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-spy-agencies-monitor-coronavirus-spread-concerned-about-how-india-would-cope-sources/story-wVFv0VDfgD7kCTsjOce6sI.html
28-02-2020||World||Texas man sentenced to death for killing police officer, friend ‘unintentionally’||A North Texas man was sentenced to death late Thursday for the 2018 killings of a Dallas-area police officer and another man.The Collin County jury deliberated for about eight hours before returning the death sentence for Brandon McCall, 28, for shooting his friend, Rene Gamez II, and Richardson police officer David Sherrard in what police described as an ambush. Defense attorneys acknowledged that McCall shot the men but said the killings were unintentional.Jurors had deliberated for about two hours Feb. 19 before convicting McCall of capital murder. The jury had the option of sentencing McCall to life imprisonment without parole.McCall was accused of shooting Gamez, 30, in an apartment complex in the suburb north of Dallas and then shooting Sherrard in the chest as he entered the apartment after responding to reports of gunfire. The 37-year-old officer was a married father of two daughters and later died at a hospital.McCall barricaded himself in the apartment after the shooting and fired at random during an hours-long standoff before officers arrested him.During the trial, jurors were shown police body camera video of the moment Sherrard was shot and a video in which McCall admitted to opening fire on officers.The latter video shows an officer reading McCall his Miranda rights as he lies in a hospital bed after the shootings. The officer then asks McCall why he shot at police.McCall replies: “Cause I wanted to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-man-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-police-officer-friend-unintentionally/story-nHSSpgmPrQFVr8x5KtqqSL.html

We have various financial instruments that could be used,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said at a press conference.As the epidemic has spread beyond China, shuttering production and closing schools in Japan, economists are increasingly worried about a slowdown in the global economy.“We have various financial instruments that could be used to support countries with balance of payment problems that arise from epidemics or natural disasters,” Rice said, noting that the lenders rapidly deployed funds during the Ebola epidemic.He singled out China, saying the IMF remains “very supportive” of the country where the coronavirus outbreak started with efforts to tackle its spread. The fund and the World Bank expect to make a decision soon on whether to hold their spring meetings in Washington.Thousands of people attend the twice-yearly gatherings, which attract activists, economists and investors as well as officials and reporters.The planning for the April meeting is “under active review,” Rice said, but he added, “We are confident that, whatever the format of the spring meetings will be, that we will have effective meetings... and dialogue with our membership.”The US Centers for Disease Control warned this week that the epidemic will reach American shores, and urged organizations to cancel mass gatherings.Health officials on Wednesday announced they’d found the first case of the virus of unknown origin in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-world-bank-ready-to-supply-funds-to-fight-coronavirus-says-spokesperson/story-ti49Wl6HLyTOwMgiWg9u4M.html
28-02-2020||World||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s UK extradition hearing paused until May||A British judge on Thursday paused Julian Assange’s extradition hearing following four days of intense legal wrangling over Washington’s request for the WikiLeaks founder to stand trial there on espionage charges. Judge Vanessa Baraitser, who will ultimately rule on the controversial case, ordered the legal teams for the 48-year-old Australian and the US government to reconvene for brief case management hearings in March and April.The full extradition hearing is then set to resume for three weeks in mid-May, when witnesses will be called and cross-examined, with an eventual ruling expected by August at the latest.The judge refused a request Thursday by Assange’s lawyers to let him sit with his defence team, and not in the secure glass-walled dock area of the courtroom, when the hearing resumes.The one-time hacker has repeatedly stood up and interrupted this week’s proceedings to complain about being unable to hear the arguments or confer confidentially with his lawyers.“I’m not able to guide them,” Assange said Thursday, in his latest courtroom outburst -- which Baraitser has repeatedly advised him against making.Arguing the current set-up could impinge on Assange’s right to a fair hearing, defence lawyer Mark Summers invited the judge to “permit him confidential, discreet access to his lawyers” by letting him sit alongside them.“Someone can be in custody in this room without being in that glass cabin,” he said.But Baraitser refused the application, arguing various “sensible, proportionate measures” -- such as Assange passing notes to his team and requesting regular breaks -- would ensure he could participate.“It’s quite apparent to me... that you’ve had no difficulty at all attracting the attention of your legal team,” she said. ‘Lies and more lies’ Assange faces charges under the US Espionage Act for the 2010 release of a trove of secret files detailing aspects of US military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as a single computer hacking charge.He spent much of the past decade holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault -- since dropped -- that he and his supporters argue were politically motivated.His extradition hearing inside Woolwich Crown Court, next to the high-security Belmarsh prison where Assange is being held, began on Monday. Making the US government case, lawyer James Lewis accused the WikiLeaks founder of risking the lives of intelligence sources by publishing the classified US government documents.He also detailed the US claims that Assange helped US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to steal the documents before recklessly releasing them. In response, lawyers for Assange argued the charges were “political”, and that his extradition would violate international law and numerous treaties.They also accused the United States of “boldly and blatantly” misstating facts about his conduct, calling some of their claims “lies, lies and more lies”.A ruling against Assange could see him jailed for 175 years if convicted on all 17 US Espionage Act charges and the hacking count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-s-uk-extradition-hearing-paused-until-may/story-hA8U9b9YX1GZbPMUKoYngI.html

province after an air strike blamed on Damascus, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemning “indiscriminate” attacks by the Assad regime and Russia.Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay -- bordering Syria -- said Friday.The heavy losses in northwestern Idlib come after weeks of growing tensions between rebel supporter Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow.Stoltenberg “urged all parties to de-escalate this dangerous situation and avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region”, his spokesman said Friday.In a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the NATO secretary general “condemned the continued indiscriminate air strikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia in Idlib province”, according to the spokesman.Turkey has urged the Syrian regime to withdraw from Turkish observation posts in Idlib, while Moscow has accused Ankara of aiding “terrorists” in Syria.Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in the region -- but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hastily convened an emergency meeting in Ankara after the Idlib attack.Erdogan’s top press aide, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey’s military retaliated against all known positions of the regime after the air strike.In a statement, Altun called on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to end the violence in Idlib and the regime’s “crimes against humanity”.The latest attack means 53 Turkish security personnel have been killed in the province this month.There was a flurry of diplomatic activity as Turkey’s presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin spoke with US national security advisor, Robert O’Brien, state news agency Anadolu reported without giving detail.Jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government’s devastating offensive.The counteroffensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities.Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December.The UN Security Council, where Moscow has systematically vetoed truce initiatives, met again Thursday amid growing concern Idlib is witnessing the nine-year-old war’s worst humanitarian emergency.State news agency SANA acknowledged there were “fierce clashes” between the army and “terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front”.An AFP correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings.The counterattack temporarily reverses one of the key gains of the government since its offensive against the country’s last rebel enclave in December.The cash-strapped government had been keen to fully secure the M5, a highway that connects Syria’s four main cities and passes through Saraqeb.The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes were carried out by Assad government ally Russia, heavily criticised by the West for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign.State media accused the “terrorists” of launching car bombings and other suicide attacks against government forces attempting to retake the town.It said the army had inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, despite the military support it said they had received from Turkey.Some 950,0000 civilians have fled the government offensive, raising fears in Ankara of a new influx of refugees.Turkey already hosts the world’s largest number of Syrian refugees -- around 3.6 million people -- placing an increasingly unpopular burden on public services.The country’s ruling party spokesman Omer Celik told CNN Turk broadcaster Friday Ankara was not in a position to “hold” refugees any longer and called on the European Union to do more.More than half a million of those displaced since December are children, tens of thousands of whom are sleeping rough in northern Syria’s harsh winter.The Turkish president vowed Wednesday Ankara would not take the “smallest step back” in the standoff with Damascus and Moscow over Idlib.Erdogan warned the Syrian government to “stop its attacks as soon as possible” and to pull back by the end of the month.The UN has repeatedly warned the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the civil war’s start in 2011.Nine out of 15 members of the Security Council on Wednesday urged Secretary General Antonio Guterres to step up his involvement in efforts to restore peace in Idlib.Russian vetoes, often backed by China, have chronically crippled UN action in Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/33-turkish-soldiers-killed-in-syria-s-idlib-as-tensions-between-damascus-and-ankara-escalate/story-d0DKbQciUick0Ds9weE3fP.html

Lagos is the biggest city in Africa’s most populous country, with a population of about 20 million. “The case...is the first case to be reported in Nigeria since the beginning of the outbreak in China in January,” the health ministry said in its post, adding that the infection was confirmed on Thursday. A presidency spokesman did not immediately respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment.Hopes that the virus would be contained to China vanished on Friday as infections spread, with countries beginning to stockpile medical equipment and investors taking flight in expectation of a global recession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-confirms-first-case-of-coronavirus/story-igAKNRWIkZbfuVGF1fcbyO.html

The wire fraud charges bring up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 each; the false statement counts each bring a maximum five years in prison.The case was brought by the national security division of the Justice Department, which has taken aim over the past year at a number of Chinese nationals for allegedly stealing industrial and other secrets to boost China’s economy and defense sectors.“This is just the latest case involving professors or researchers concealing their affiliations with China from their American employers and the US government. We will not tolerate it,” said John Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security.Washington says Beijing both pressures and incentivizes its nationals to bring back proprietary technology from the United States.Among those arrested for allegedly supporting Beijing’s illicit technology acquisition efforts is the chairman of Harvard University’s chemistry and chemical biology department.Charles Lieber allegedly hid from Harvard and US authorities payments of $50,000 a month for his personal needs and $1.5 million in lab funding from a Chinese university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-professor-charged-with-hiding-link-to-china-amid-efforts-to-halt-unauthorised-technology-transfer/story-KIKil1Wj1nGWR596IPvvrO.html

On Tuesday she visited the University of Oxford, where she met Malala Yousafzai, the 22-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and campaigner for girls’ education, who is studying there.The pair shared photos of themselves with their arms around each other. Thunberg called Yousafzai her role model, while Yousafzai said on Twitter: “She’s the only friend I’d skip school for.”Thunberg starting missing lessons two years ago to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. She has since sparked a global movement calling for sustainability and awareness of climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-police-issue-safety-warning-over-greta-thunberg-rally/story-iAS5meG6LLMkFDTgLxC5AM.html

Officials will carry out further tests to confirm whether the dog has really been infected with the disease, or if it was a result of environmental contamination of its mouth and nose.Much is still not known about the virus that is spreading around the world after emerging in central China late last year. It is thought to have transferred to humans from bats and has been shown to spread in a number of ways, but the Hong Kong agricultural department said it doesn’t have evidence that pet animals can be infected, or be a source of infection to people.Coronavirus likely began with bats, an omen for next epidemicIf confirmed, the dog would be the first case of a pet catching the coronavirus amid a global outbreak that’s now infected more than 82,000 people and claimed more than 2,800 lives.The dog is being quarantined at an animal facility, the Hong Kong government said. The department strongly advised that pets of confirmed virus patients also be put under quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dog-found-to-have-low-level-of-coronavirus-in-hong-kong/story-szxfXOnswEtGyBMI5ru7iL.html
28-02-2020||World||Facebook to publicly track political sponsored content after Bloomberg’s paid memes||Facebook Inc will provide a way for people to track political sponsored content on Facebook and Instagram ahead of the US presidential election, it said on Thursday.The move comes after US Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg’s campaign started paying popular meme accounts on Facebook-owned Instagram to post content as part of its social media offensive ahead of the 2020 election.In tweets sent by Facebook director of product management Rob Leathern, the company said it had added a new column https://apps.crowdtangle.com/pgpublicldsfb/boards/2020uspresidentialcandidates to its free social media tracking tool CrowdTangle to show sponsored content for the presidential candidates.Earlier this month, Facebook said it would allow US -based political candidates to run sponsored content on its social networking platforms, but that the content would not be cataloged in its overall public ad library.Bloomberg’s campaign, which is running a highly-funded digital offensive to try and beat Republican President Donald Trump in November, has been working with a collective of influential meme-makers called Meme 2020 to post sponsored content on Instagram accounts over recent weeks.In order to be shown in the new CrowdTangle column, influencers will have to use Facebook’s branded content tool, which allows them to more clearly tag in an official sub-header that the post is a paid partnership.Facebook said it had reached out to the Bloomberg campaign asking them to use this tool to properly disclose the posts. “We don’t have visibility into financial relationships taking place off our platforms, which is why we’ve asked campaigns and creators to use our disclosure tools. On the broader topic of political branded content, we welcome clearer guidelines from regulators,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. The US Federal Election Commission’s rules do not explicitly address social media influencers, but it does say that public online communications advocating for the election or defeat of a candidate for a fee must include a disclaimer to inform who paid for the content. The Federal Trade Commission requires social media influencers and content creators to clearly label sponsored posts.“We push for maximum possible transparency across all of our content, and require that creators adhere to FTC disclosure requirements on sponsored content,” said Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for the Bloomberg campaign.“Whenever possible, we push creators to use platform-specific branded content disclosure tools. However, basic business account tools are not made uniformly available to all Facebook and Instagram creators, so in those cases we require the FTC recommended copy disclosure.”Facebook’s Leathern confirmed in a tweet that creators who have previously violated the company’s community standards may not be eligible to use the branded disclosure tool. Facebook also said it was looking at how to increase transparency for branded content run from private accounts. Facebook requires accounts to be public to run branded content, but said it knows some accounts then switch to private.The tactic of paying influencers - people with large numbers of engaged social media followers - to spread political messages or make content is also gathering momentum among groups such as political action committees.Other controversial online tactics by the Bloomberg campaign include hiring hundreds of digital organizers to send content on their own social media accounts, a practice that came under scrutiny last week when Twitter suspended a group of pro-Bloomberg accounts for violating its platform manipulation and spam policy.The billionaire’s team also recently posted an invitation on influencer marketplace Tribe, offering Bloomberg supporters a fixed fee of $150 to provide videos or images to the campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-publicly-track-political-sponsored-content-after-bloomberg-s-paid-memes/story-wfChTluCnbziTGAkaaVhhP.html
28-02-2020||World||Putin reveals plan to use body double to make public appearances for him||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday revealed there was a secret plan to use a double to make public appearances for him, while insisting he vetoed it -- and that he is the real Putin.Putin’s comments showed that a conspiracy theory widespread on the internet that the Russian strongman has been impersonated over the years or even replaced by a lookalike is not entirely without basis.TASS state news agency showed Putin a list of popular Russian-language Internet searches including “Putin double proof”.“Are you real?” the interviewer asked. “Yes,” said Putin.He said he has never had a double but when asked if the idea had ever been discussed, he confirmed it had. “I refused to have doubles,” Putin said. “It was during the hardest times of the fight against terrorism.”Putin as prime minister and then president oversaw the second war against separatists in Chechnya from 1999 to 2000. After Russian armed forces claimed victory, Islamist insurgent attacks became frequent in the North Caucasus while suicide bombers targeted Russia’s main cities. “Was that in the early 2000s?” asked Andrei Vandenko, who is doing a series of interviews with Putin to mark 20 years since he became president. “Yes,” said Putin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-vladimir-putin-reveals-plan-to-use-body-double/story-aapT1O5Fqz0wad92UftI6H.html

28-02-2020||World||5 coronavirus cases spark new fears||‘NO CONTACT’A new case reported near San Francisco in California could be the first in the US that has no known connection to travel abroad or another known case. Health officials described one of the more serious cases of infection seen so far in the US. This case is similar to the many reported, particularly in Italy, where the virus has spread to local communities through people who have not been to affected region, or been in close contact with people who have returned from these regions.What this means: People who have not travelled to China or any of the affected regions are in danger of picking up the virus as well.‘SUPER SPREADER’A Korean Air flight attendant on duty on return flights between Seoul and Los Angeles between Feb 19-20 tested positive. She stayed in Los Angeles overnight between the flights. She picked up the virus on a flight from Tel Aviv to Seoul on Feb 15-16. She had served hundreds on the 3 flights that she travelled on before showing symptoms.What this means: Patients who come in contact with a high number of people, or super spreaders’, pose a huge threat to hundreds.ASYMPTOMATICA 20-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan travelled nearly 700km and infected five relatives without ever showing signs of infection herself. While the five relatives displayed clear symptoms, it took nearly a week for scientists to identify the woman as the source of the infection as she remained asymptomatic.What this means: The virus can be spread asymptomatically. Other sporadic accounts of similar cases have emerged since, scientists say.SECOND POSITIVEA woman in her 40s working as a tour bus guide in Osaka tested positive for a second time on Wednesday. She first tested positive on January 29, but was released from hospital after she recovered by February 1. The is the first time a patient cleared of the virus has subsequently tested positive for it again outside of China.What this means: The virus may remain dormant, and then can exacerbate days later when patients are released.CLOSED COMMUNITYThe Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a group the government describes as a cult, has been at the centre of the virus’ spread in South Korea. Scientists estimate that nearly half of the country’s cases can be traced directly to the cult. Around 1,300 churchgoers have so far exhibited symptoms. The cult has 212,000 members.What this means: Close-knit communities or religious orders that gather in large numbers can multiply cases overnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-coronavirus-cases-spark-new-fears/story-B8szq92oA3EmgUGyDmSV4L.html
