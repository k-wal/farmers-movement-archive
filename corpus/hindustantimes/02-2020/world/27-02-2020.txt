Trump responds by saying, ‘That’s up to India.’ This is a failure of leadership on human rights.”Asked about his position on the Citizenship Amendment Act at a news conference in New Delhi on Tuesday, President Trump had said, “I don’t want to discuss that. I want to leave that to India, and hopefully they’re going to make the right decision for the people. That’s really up to India.”Asked specially about the violence and casualties, the president had taken much the same line. “That’s up to India,” he said.On Thursday, the state department called for peace and respect for the right of peaceful assembly. “Our hearts go out to the families of the deceased and injured in New Delhi,” Alice G Wells, the top diplomat for South and Central Asia, wrote on Twitter. “We echo PM @NarendraModi’s call for calm and normalcy and urge all parties to maintain peace, refrain from violence, and respect the right of peaceful assembly.”Trump did raise the issue of religious freedom with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and came away satisfied with what he heard. “I will say that the Prime Minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom, and very strongly. And he said that in India they have -- they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom.”Critics had expected Trump to be more forceful, perhaps along the same lines as President Barack Obama during his 2015 visit. There is a need to reaffirm, he had said in a speech at Siri Fort, “that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination”.He had added, “India will succeed so long as it is not splintered along the lines of religious faith -- so long as it’s not splintered along any lines -- and is unified as one nation.”The Wednesday tweet was the third time Sanders had taken aim at India while running for president this time (he ran in 2016 also). In August, the senator had criticized the restrictions imposed in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370, and demanded they be lifted and “the United States government must speak out boldly in support of international humanitarian law and its support of a UN-backed peaceful resolution that respects the will of the Kashmiri people.”Pramila Jayapal, an Indian American member of the House of Representatives and a close associate of Sanders, has introduced a resolution in the House seeking the removal of those restrictions and the protection of religious freedom in India. It has been supported thus far by 62 other members, including five Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernie-sanders-slams-trump-for-not-pressing-india-on-anti-caa-protests/story-2cTRgIaX7tZArDGI2zhkeL.html
27-02-2020||World||US ready for novel coronavirus threat despite new infections, says President Trump||President Donald Trump declared that a widespread U.S. outbreak of the new respiratory virus sweeping the globe isn’t inevitable even as top health authorities at his side warned Americans that more infections are coming.Shortly after Trump spoke Wednesday, the government announced a worrisome development: Another person in the U.S. is infected — someone in California who doesn’t appear to have the usual risk factors of having travelled abroad or being exposed to another patient.At a White House news conference, Trump sought to minimize fears as he insisted the U.S. is “very, very ready” for whatever the COVID-19 outbreak brings. Under fire about the government’s response, he put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of coordinating the efforts.“This will end,” Trump said of the outbreak. “You don’t want to see panic because there’s no reason to be panicked.”But standing next to him, the very health officials Trump praised for fighting the new coronavirus stressed that schools, businesses and individuals need to get ready.“We do expect more cases,” said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.If the CDC confirms that the latest U.S. case doesn’t involve travel or contact with an infected person, it would be a first in this country and a sign that efforts to contain the virus’ spread haven’t been enough.“It’s possible this could be an instance of community spread of COVID-19,” the CDC said in a statement.More than 81,000 cases of COVID-19, an illness characterized by fever and coughing and in serious cases shortness of breath or pneumonia, have occurred since the new virus emerged in China.The newest case from California brings the total number infected in the U.S. to 60, most of them evacuated from outbreak zones.Trump credited border restrictions that have blocked people coming into the U.S. from China for keeping infections low. But now countries around the world — from South Korea and Japan to Italy and Iran — are experiencing growing numbers of cases. Asked if it was time to either lift the China restrictions or take steps for travelers from elsewhere, he said: “At a right time we may do that. Right now it’s not the time.”Trump spent close to an hour discussing the virus threat, after a week of sharp stock market losses over the health crisis and concern within the administration that a growing outbreak could affect his reelection. He blamed the Democrats for the stock market slide, saying, “I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves.” And he shifted to defend his overall record and predict a win in November.A key question is whether the Trump administration is spending enough money to get the country prepared — especially as the CDC has struggled to expand the number of states that can test people for the virus. Other key concerns are stockpiling masks and other protective equipment for health workers, and developing a vaccine or treatment.Health officials have exhausted an initial $105 million in emergency funding and have been looking elsewhere for dollars. Earlier this week, Trump requested $2.5 billion from Congress to fight the virus. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York countered with a proposal for $8.5 billion.Trump told reporters he was open to spending “whatever’s appropriate.”Trump compared the new virus repeatedly to the flu, which kills tens of thousands of people each year. The new coronavirus has killed more than 2,700 people — most in China and none in the U.S. — but scientists still don’t understand who’s most at risk or what the death rate is.Without a vaccine, the CDC’s Schuchat advised people to follow “tried and true, not very exciting” but important precautions: Wash your hands, cover your coughs and stay home when you’re sick.A day earlier, another CDC official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, was even more blunt, telling Americans to get ready for some of the same steps as occurred during the 2009 flu pandemic, such as school closings. “It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen — and how many people in this country will have severe illness,” she said.The National Institutes of Health’s top infectious disease chief cautioned a vaccine won’t be ready for widespread use for a year or more. But Dr. Anthony Fauci said even if the virus wanes soon, it’s “quite conceivable” that it might “come back and recycle next year.” By then, he said, “we hope to have a vaccine.”Democrats were quick to condemn Trump’s response to the outbreak. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it “opaque and chaotic.”“Instead of listening to public health and medical experts, the president has been downplaying the potential impact of the virus for over a month,” said Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.Thompson added that putting Pence, “someone with no public health expertise, in charge of the response will not instill confidence with the American people and raises questions about the administration’s ability to coordinate an effective response to a complex public health threat.”During his time as Indiana’s governor, Pence faced criticism for his response to a public health crisis in the southern part of the state.In 2015, Scott County saw the number of people infected with HIV skyrocket, with nearly 200 people testing positive for the virus in a span of months. Indiana law at the time prohibited needle exchanges, exacerbating the outbreak, which primarily infected intravenous users of the painkiller Opana.Pence had long opposed needle exchanges but was eventually persuaded to issue an executive order allowing one in Scott County. Despite his own misgivings — Pence said he didn’t support the exchanges as an “anti-drug policy” — he signed a law allowing the state government to approve them on a case-by-case basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ready-for-novel-coronavirus-threat-despite-new-infections-says-president-trump/story-dqgpkpM15VUXmx8gVphRFO.html
27-02-2020||World||President Emmanuel Macron says France facing coronavirus ‘epidemic’||President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that France was preparing for a jump in the number of coronavirus cases, adding “we are going to have to deal with it as best we can.” “We are facing a crisis, an epidemic that is coming,” Macron said while visiting staff at the La Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris, where the first French person carrying the new coronavirus died Tuesday.“We know that we’re only at the beginning... we’re going to try with all our caretakers to make the right decisions,” Macron said alongside Health Minister Olivier Veran.“You had a case here... I know this affected many of your teams,” he said, pledging to address the crisis “truthfully” so that measures can be taken “calmly”.France has reported 18 cases so far and two deaths, including an 80-year-old Chinese tourist who was the first casualty of the virus reported outside Asia.The second was a 60-year-old teacher, a case that has worried officials because he had not travelled to an outbreak hotspot.A 55-year-old man from the same region as the teacher, who also had not travelled to an outbreak zone, was also hospitalised with the virus, and investigations are under way to try to find the source of the infections on French soil.More than 2,700 people worldwide have died of COVID-19 so far, and almost 80,000 have been infected, mainly in China.The French government has asked citizens returning from Italy’s Lombardy and Veneto regions to avoid “all non-essential outings” and keep their children home from school.The same recommendations have been issued for people returning from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-emmanuel-macron-says-france-facing-coronavirus-epidemic/story-doJuApvEhvyPIwjSSJiylM.html
27-02-2020||World||Earth captures new ‘mini moon’, say astronomers||Earth has acquired a second “mini-moon” about the size of a car, according to astronomers who spotted the object circling our planet.The mass -- roughly 1.9-3.5 meters (6-11 feet) in diameter -- was observed by researchers Kacper Wierzchos and Teddy Pruyne at the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona on the night of February 15.“BIG NEWS. Earth has a new temporarily captured object/Possible mini-moon called 2020 CD3,” likely to be a C-type asteroid, Wierzchos tweeted on Wednesday.The astronomer said it was a “big deal” as “this is just the second asteroid known to orbit Earth (after 2006 RH120, which was also discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey).”Its route suggests it entered Earth’s orbit three years ago, he said.The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s Minor Planet Center, which collects data on minor planets and asteroids, in an announcement said “no link to a known artificial object has been found,” implying it was likely an asteroid captured by Earth’s gravity.“Orbit integrations indicate that this object is temporarily bound to the Earth.”Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk said the car-sized object was not the Telsa Roadster he launched into space in 2018, which is now orbiting the Sun.“It’s not mine,” he tweeted.Earth’s new neighbour is not in a stable orbit around the planet and is unlikely to be around for very long.“It is heading away from the Earth-moon system as we speak,” Grigori Fedorets, research fellow at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, told New Scientist magazine, and was likely to escape in April.The only other asteroid known to orbit Earth, 2006 RH120, rotated the planet from September 2006 to June 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earth-captures-new-mini-moon-say-astronomers/story-5sk8f5pjkOVO2ha0CBIT1M.html

27-02-2020||World||Pakistan screens those arriving from Iran for novel coronavirus||Pakistani authorities were scrambling Thursday to screen hundreds of people who had recently arrived from Iran, a major new hotspot for coronavirus, after Islamabad confirmed its first two infections.Officials in the teeming port city of Karachi, where one of the two cases was detected, said they are also working to ensure a supply of face masks, as prices shot up with concern growing over Pakistan’s ability to handle an outbreak.At least one of the two cases announced Wednesday, a 22-year-old man in Karachi, appeared to have contracted the virus in Iran, authorities have said.The government has now collected the data for 1,500 people in Sindh province who have arrived in Pakistan from Iran recently, Murad Ali Shah, the chief minister for the southern province, of which Karachi is the capital, told a press conference.“They would be screened diligently until they are cleared,” Shah said, adding authorities are contacting each to gauge their level of exposure and asking them all to remain at home for 15 days as a precaution.It was unclear how many more people were being screened throughout the country. Federal health minister Zafar Mirza was set to hold a press conference later on Thursday.Shah also said the provincial government was working with local surgical mask importers and manufacturers to ensure a supply for the province.Doctors at Islamabad’s largest public hospital -- where the second case was detected -- said they have not been given masks to treat patients.“We have been requesting that they provide us masks and other protective equipment for four days, but no one cares,” Dr Fazl-i-Rabbi, president of the Young Doctors Association at the hospital, told AFP.With porous borders, creaking hospitals and large illiterate populations, Pakistan faces a potentially devastating health crisis from the new coronavirus.The virus has spread to more than 30 countries, killing over 2,700 and infecting 80,000, mostly in China.But new outbreaks in Europe, the Middle East and in Asia have fanned fears of the contagion taking hold in poor nations that lack the healthcare infrastructure to cope.There are growing fears in Pakistan -- sandwiched between China and Iran, both hotspots for the disease -- over how the country would deal with the outbreak. Islamabad has a history of failing to contain infectious diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and hepatitis.“Our preparation is zero,” Dr Tipu Sultan, a medical practitioner and well-known activist for better healthcare in Pakistan, told AFP.He cited ignorance by both authorities and civilians over hygiene and how viruses can spread.Schools were closed in Sindh and in neighbouring Balochistan province, bordering Iran, on Thursday.The cost of surgical masks had already risen nearly tenfold in Karachi, from 180 rupees ($1.16) to 1,400 rupees, ($9.09) per box of 50 masks.“A lot of buyers are coming to us... but the stocks are gone,” said Noman Qureshi, a shop owner in a medical market in downtown Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-screens-those-arriving-from-iran-for-novel-coronavirus/story-B0euOTGZQtoTZlNutmAzlN.html
27-02-2020||World||Cambridge team finds potentially habitable exoplanet twice Earth size||A Cambridge-based Indian-origin astronomer has led the discovery of an exoplanet more than twice the size of Earth considered potentially habitable, opening the search for life on planets significantly larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, the university said on Thursday.The research team led by Nikku Madhusudhan at the university’s Institute of Astronomy used the mass, radius, and atmospheric data of the exoplanet K2-18b, and determined that it is possible for the planet to host liquid water at habitable conditions beneath its hydrogen-rich atmosphere.The results, reported in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, show that the exoplanet is 124 light-years away, and is 2.6 times the radius and 8.6 times the mass of Earth. It orbits its star within the habitable zone, where temperatures could allow liquid water to exist.Madhusudhan said: “Water vapour has been detected in the atmospheres of a number of exoplanets but, even if the planet is in the habitable zone, that doesn’t necessarily mean there are habitable conditions on the surface.”“To establish the prospects for habitability, it is important to obtain a unified understanding of the interior and atmospheric conditions on the planet – in particular, whether liquid water can exist beneath the atmosphere.”Given the large size of K2-18b, it has been suggested that it would be more like a smaller version of Neptune than a larger version of Earth, the university said.A ‘mini-Neptune’ is expected to have a significant hydrogen ‘envelope’ surrounding a layer of high-pressure water, with an inner core of rock and iron. If the hydrogen envelope is too thick, the temperature and pressure at the surface of the water layer beneath would be far too great to support life.Madhusudhan and his team have shown that despite the size of K2-18b, its hydrogen envelope is not necessarily too thick and the water layer could have the right conditions to support life.Co-author Matthew Nixon said: “We wanted to know the thickness of the hydrogen envelope – how deep the hydrogen goes. While this is a question with multiple solutions, we’ve shown that you don’t need much hydrogen to explain all the observations together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cambridge-team-led-by-indian-origin-astronomer-finds-exoplanet-twice-earth-size/story-RQE8MC66lYBWk1ueUbj6gP.html
27-02-2020||World||Pakistan’s new bid to combat terror allows widening of trade ties: US Commerce Secy||Pakistan’s fresh efforts to fight terrorism and promote security is “affording” the US to expand trade between the two countries and in the region, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said after meeting the country’s top leadership here. Ross was in Islamabad on Wednesday, a day after US President Donald Trump concluded his high-profile maiden visit to India, and called on Prime Minister Imran Khan, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Minister of Energy Omar Ayub Khan and others. Building on the productive discussions between President Donald Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, “I met with Prime Minister Khan and his economic team today in Islamabad to explore ways to grow the US-Pakistan trade and investment relationship, including in the energy and digital sectors,” Ross said in a statement.“Deepening our economic ties will provide measurable benefits for our two nations,” Ross said while thanking the Pakistani leaders’ willingness to engage in frank conversations. The US Commerce Secretary recalled President Trump’s statement in New Delhi when he said, “Our relationship with Pakistan is a very good one.” Ross noted that the US was Pakistan’s largest export destination and American companies have a long history of doing business in Pakistan, contributing to its economic development and providing high-value jobs. “The work Pakistan has begun to do to fight terrorism and promote security is affording the US and Pakistan the opportunity to strengthen and expand trade in the region and between our countries,” Ross said.In a stern message to Pakistan, India and the US on Tuesday asked Islamabad to ensure that no territory under its control is used to launch terror attacks and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms.A joint statement said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks.The two leaders also called for concerted action against all terrorist groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen, the Haqqani Network, D-Company, Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.At a press conference, the US president also said that ways to deal with terrorism figured prominently in his talks with Prime Minister Modi who, Trump stressed, is determined to check the menace.In his statement, Ross said the Department of Commerce will continue to facilitate private sector engagement between the US and Pakistan through organising Pakistani business delegations to America and regional trade shows. It will also support technical exchanges on trade facilitation, energy, intellectual property rights, and good regulatory practices.“Our conversations provided opportunities to reinforce the critical importance of improving Pakistan’s business environment, including through developing a consistent tax framework, promoting regulatory transparency, and strengthening the intellectual property ecosystem,” he said. This includes ensuring the free flow of data, which is crucial to businesses in all sectors of the economy and essential to helping Pakistan integrate into the global digital ecosystem, Ross said.According to the American embassy in Islamabad, the US exported USD 2.6 billion worth of goods to Pakistan in 2019. American companies made more than USD 1.4 billion in direct investments in Pakistan since 2016, the embassy tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-new-bid-to-combat-terror-allows-widening-of-trade-ties-us-commerce-secy/story-TVmCVD0zfQAxyLtXeCrwZK.html

The person was tested after returning from one of the areas in China affected by the outbreak, the institute said in a separate statement on its website.The institute considers the risk of infection from the individual as very unlikely, it said. The person has been placed under home quarantine, and possible contacts are being traced to ensure no transmission has occurred.“Analysis of the test performed today show a weak positive result, while a previous analysis was negative,” Vold said in the statement. “The analyses of the sample shows traces of coronavirus. The method of analysis is sensitive enough to detect inactive viruses.”About 50 tests have been taken in Oslo over the past 48 hours and the individuals have been asked to keep themselves isolated until the results are ready, local newspaper VG reported on Thursday, citing an Oslo Health Authority spokesman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-confirms-first-coronavirus-case-patient-under-home-quarantine/story-1C8yXNZk1jLIRAvRcJqhaJ.html

To escape to anywhere that is fun that doesn’t remind him of his day to day challenges,” she was quoted as saying.“But my sister said ‘you know what, let’s get back to the real issue’. This little fella has been bullied. How many suicides, black or white, in our society have happened due to bullying.”“We want the money to go to community organisations that really need it.

Japan’s spring holidays typically begin around late March and run until the start of the new school year in April.The request comes after a surge in cases of the virus in Japan in recent days, including 13 new infections in the northern island of Hokkaido alone today. The Health Ministry has said the steps won’t apply to day care facilities, Kyodo reported.After taking criticism for a slow response to the spread of the infection in Japan, the government is this week moving to take more urgent steps as the outbreak threatens Japan’s economy and even raises question marks over the Tokyo 2020 Olympics set to be held in July. The closure of the schools follows a call Wednesday to cancel, postpone or scale down all major sporting and cultural events for the next two weeks, which has led to a flurry of cancellations of concerts and professional sports games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shinzo-abe-calls-for-all-japan-schools-to-be-closed-to-fight-coronavirus/story-pW3ZbNaEt5kERB4sb7273I.html
27-02-2020||World||Saudi Arabia halts pilgrimages over coronavirus; Iran cases spike||Saudi Arabia on Thursday banned foreign pilgrims from entering the kingdom to visit Islam’s holiest sites over the new coronavirus, potentially disrupting the plans of millions of faithful ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and as the annual hajj pilgrimage looms.The decision showed the growing worry across the Mideast about the virus as Iran’s confirmed that infected cases spiked by over 100, to 254 now. A total of 26 people have died so far, it said. That pushes the region’s overall cases to above 350. Iran’s death toll is highest outside of China where the outbreak began.Saudi Arabia’s barring of pilgrims from Mecca, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims pray toward five times a day, and Medina appeared unprecedented in modern history. The kingdom’s Al Saud ruling family stakes their legitimacy in overseeing and protecting the sites. Authorities also suspended entry to travelers from nations affected by the new virus who hold tourist visas for the kingdom.It appeared Saudi officials worried about the risk of pilgrims spreading the virus as they had in Iran. The virus’ epicenter in the Islamic Republic is the holy Shiite city of Qom, where the faithful in reverence reach out to kiss and touch a famous shrine. That shrine and others have remained open, despite Iran’s civilian government calling for them to be closed.The tiny, oil-rich nation of Kuwait announced a sudden jump to 43 cases from 26 on Thursday as well, all linked to travelers who recently came from Iran. There have been no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Saudi Arabia amid the outbreak.“Saudi Arabia renews its support for all international measures to limit the spread of this virus, and urges its citizens to exercise caution before traveling to countries experiencing coronavirus outbreaks,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement announcing the decision. “We ask God Almighty to spare all humanity from all harm.”News of the cancellation shocked the Muslim world, as many save their entire lives for a chance to see the Kaaba and walk along the path of the Prophet Muhammad and visit his tomb in Medina.Hundreds of faithful deplaned in Pakistan as the ban came into effect, while Indonesia and Turkey had to turn away over thousands of pilgrims set to fly. Authorities at Cairo’s international airport said the Saudi decision created “intense confusion” and “extreme anger” among thousands of passengers waiting for flights. Security officials needed to call in reinforcements to control the crowd as news of the ban broke, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren’t allowed to speak to journalists.Disease outbreaks always have been a concern surrounding the hajj, required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their life, especially as pilgrims come from all over the world. The earliest recorded outbreak came in 632 as pilgrims fought off malaria. A cholera outbreak in 1821 for instance killed an estimated 20,000 pilgrims. Another cholera outbreak in 1865 killed 15,000 pilgrims and then spread worldwide.More recently, Saudi Arabia faced the danger from another coronavirus, one that caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which jumped from ill camels to humans. The kingdom increased its public health measures during the hajj in 2012 and 2013 and urged the ill and elderly not to take part in the pilgrimage.Since September 2012, there have been nearly 2,500 cases of MERS reported, with 858 deaths attributed to the virus, according to the World Health Organization. However, the hajj itself saw no MERS outbreak. Saudi officials also instituted bans on pilgrims coming from countries affected by the Ebola virus in recent years as well.Since the new coronavirus emerged in December in central China, it has sickened 82,000 people globally, with more than 2,700 deaths.While millions attend the hajj, which is this year set for late July into early August, millions more come during the rest of the year to the holy sites in the kingdom. Those other pilgrimages are referred to as the umrah. One of the biggest times for the umrah is the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, which is set to begin at the end of April.“It is unprecedented, at least in recent times, but given the worldwide spread of the virus and the global nature of the umrah, it makes sense from a public health and safety point of view,” said Kristian Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. “Especially since the Iranian example illustrates how a religious crossroads can so quickly amplify the spread and reach of the virus.”By leaving the suspension of travel to the holy sites open-ended, Saudi Arabia has opened the possibility of this year’s hajj potentially being disrupted as well.The hardest-hit nation in the Mideast is Iran, where Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour on Thursday reported 26 deaths out of 245 confirmed cases of the illness, named COVID-19. Experts are concerned Iran may be underreporting cases and deaths, given the illness’ rapid spread from Iran across the Persian Gulf.Jahanpour seemed to address that, saying new labs in Iran were conducting tests and the number of confirmed cases could continue to spike in coming days. Thursday’s number represented a jump in over 100 new cases from the previous day.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday praised medical staffers, calling their work “very invaluable.” But the virus has struck the official in charge of Iran’s response to the outbreak, as well as a reformist lawmaker. On Thursday, a hard-line cleric from Qom who also serves in parliament posted a video online acknowledging he had been infected.“Yes, my corona test is positive, too and I am in quarantine,” Mojtaba Zonnouri said in the video. “God willing, our nation will overcome in fight against corona.”In Bahrain, which confirmed 33 cases as of Thursday morning, authorities halted all flights to Iraq and Lebanon. It separately extended a 48-hour ban over flights from Dubai and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, through which infected travelers reached the island kingdom off the coast of Saudi Arabia.Meanwhile, Iraq’s Health Ministry on Thursday announced the first coronavirus case in the capital, Baghdad, bringing the overall number of cases reported in the country to six. All have been linked to Iran.Iraq has taken drastic measures to stem the spread, including ordering schools and universities closed for 10 days, starting Thursday. The government also banned public gatherings and ordered the closures of cinemas, cafes, clubs and other social forums for the same period. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the ban of public gatherings would include anti-government protest sites such as Baghdad’s landmark Tahrir Square, where demonstrators have been staging a sit-in for months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-halts-pilgrimages-over-coronavirus-iran-says-22-dead/story-lgdTMvWagvirZyDQqVv0cP.html

27-02-2020||World||938 new coronavirus cases in worst-affected South Korea and China||As the worst-hit areas of Asia continued to struggle with a viral epidemic, with hundreds more cases reported Thursday in South Korea and China, worries about infection and containment spread across the globe.For the first time, the coronavirus has caused more new cases outside China, the epicenter of the outbreak, than inside the country. With Brazil on Wednesday confirming Latin America’s first case, the virus has reached every continent but Antarctica.The United States, which has 60 cases, hasn’t been spared the fear that has swept Asia, Europe and the Mideast. President Donald Trump declared that the U.S. was “very, very ready” for whatever threat the coronavirus brings, and he put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of overseeing the country’s response.As the epidemic expanded geographically, worries about the COVID-19 illness multiplied.“The sudden increases of cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.Though the virus has pushed into countries both rich and poor, its arrival in places with little ability to detect, respond and contain it brought worry that it could run rampant there and spread easily elsewhere.Major gatherings have been eyed warily, with schools closing, churches moving services online, food deliveries booming and many business conferences and sporting events canceled. The Summer Olympics begin July 24 in Tokyo, and Japan’s top government spokesman said Olympics preparations would proceed and the games would go on as planned.South Korea reported 505 more cases Thursday, bringing its total to 1,766. Most of the new cases were in the country’s fourth-biggest city, Daegu, where the outbreak has hit hardest and the national government has mobilized public health tools to help the region’s overwhelmed medical system.The South Korean and U.S. militaries postponed their annual joint drills out of concerns over a viral outbreak that has infected soldiers in both countries’ armed forces, put many troops in quarantine and closed base facilities. Twenty South Korean soldiers and one American service member in South Korea have tested positive for the new coronavirus. South Korea has already suspended some unilateral field training, and the U.S. military was urging its personnel to avoid handshakes and large gatherings if possible.But there are signs the virus is spreading further in South Korea, with 55 cases reported so far in the capital, Seoul, and 58 in the second-largest city, Busan. The country on Thursday also confirmed its 13th death; most of them are still in and near Daegu.China reported 433 new cases along with 29 additional deaths. Thursday’s updates bring mainland China’s totals to 78,497 cases, and 2,744 deaths.Of the new cases, 383 were in the epicenter of the city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December. Wuhan also accounted for 19 of the new deaths.South Korea followed China in expressing dismay at travel restrictions imposed by other countries.About 40 nations and regions so far have prohibited or restricted South Korean visitors, according to Lee Tae-ho, Seoul’s second vice minister of foreign affairs, who described such moves as excessive and said his government has been effectively utilizing its “world-best quarantine capabilities.”But calls have grown inside South Korea for expanding its own entry ban, which currently covers only visitors from China’s Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital.China has put Wuhan and nearby cities on lock down, many airlines have reduced Chinese flights, and many places have increased monitoring of arrivals from China, all resulting in far few Chinese arrivals around the globe. Lee said the inflow of Chinese into South Korea has been reduced by more than 80%.In Europe, an expanding cluster of more than 440 cases in northern Italy was eyed as a source for transmissions. In the Middle East, blame was directed at Iran, which had 19 deaths, the highest toll outside China. Saudi Arabia said early Thursday it would ban tourists from places with confirmed outbreaks, including pilgrims coming for the Umrah or to visit the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina.Shortly after Trump spoke about U.S. efforts on the virus, health officials identified what could be the first community spread U.S. case. The patient in California was not known to have traveled to a country with an outbreak or had ties to a known patient. Most of the previously confirmed U.S. cases had traveled to China, were evacuated from the virus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship, or were family members of those cases.In South Korea, the largest cluster of infections was connected to a Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Health workers have finished testing 1,300 churchgoers who have exhibited symptoms, said Kim Gang-lip, South Korea’s vice health minister.The church gave a list of its 212,000 members nationwide to government authorities, who plan to widen screening.After many countries restricted travel from China to try to prevent the illness from spreading, China itself is now heavily regulating arrivals from abroad. State broadcaster CCTV reported South Koreans were being monitored after Chinese authorities detected fevers in five arrivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-938-new-cases-in-worst-affected-south-korea-and-china/story-b3pETGRrjtnadW58Y3m5qJ.html
27-02-2020||World||UN chief ‘very saddened’ by casualties in Delhi violence||UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is “very saddened” by the casualties in the communal clashes in northeast Delhi over the amended citizenship law and calls for maximum restraint for violence to be avoided, his spokesperson said. Communal violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in northeast Delhi killed at least 34 people and left over 200 injured till Thursday as police struggled to check the rioters who ran amok on streets, burning and looting shops, pelting stones and thrashing people. Guterres’ spokesman Stephane Dujarric during a daily briefing here on Wednesday said, “He’s very saddened by the reports of casualties following the protests in Delhi, and as he has done in similar circumstances, he calls for maximum restraint and for violence to be avoided.” Dujarric was responding to a question on whether the Secretary General has any comment on the riots in parts of New Delhi over the new citizenship law and if he has communicated with the Indian Government. Earlier Dujarric had said that Guterres is closely following the situation in New Delhi and stressed that demonstrators should be allowed to demonstrate peacefully and security forces should show restraint. Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar on Thursday said law enforcement agencies are working on the ground to prevent violence and ensure restoration of confidence and normalcy. “Senior representatives of the government have been involved in that process. The prime minister has publicly appealed for peace and brotherhood. We would urge that irresponsible comments are not made at this sensitive time,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-very-saddened-by-casualties-in-delhi-violence/story-OlSGsuJS8BZ5mQcjSLNAeL.html
27-02-2020||World||For friend Pakistan, China to send 1,00,000 ducks to stave off locust swarm||China will send 1,00,000 specially-bred ducks to Pakistan to aid its “iron friend’s” fight against the locust plague, described by Prime Minister Imran Khan as the worst such attack in decades.Newly hatched ducklings from eastern China’s Zhejiang province will be the frontline weapons in this assault on the insects, billions of which have spread from east Africa to several parts of Pakistan, laying to waste thousands of hectares of farmland.It could not be immediately verified if these would be the same 1,00,000 ducks stationed as of now, according to the state broadcaster, CGTN, in Xinjiang in northwest China along its border with Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir.ALSO WATCH | Coronavirus: Will India evacuate Pakistani students from China? Govt answersChina has already dispatched a team of experts from the Chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs, which is visiting the worst-affected Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab provinces to coordinate control measures, state media reported.The “disciplined” duck army from China is ready, Ningbo news from Zhejiang reported Thursday.Lu Lizhi, a researcher at Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, explained why ducks are a dangerous foe to rampant locusts compared to, say, chickens.“Ducks like to live in groups and are more convenient to manage than chickens. They have stronger vitality, foraging ability, and resistance to cold, which is suitable for survival in the wild,” Lu said.As it turns out, deploying one duck is equivalent to destroying a family of locusts. “A chicken can eat 70 locusts a day, and a duck can eat more than 200, which has three times the combat capability. Moreover, ducks eat locusts in a carpet-like manner,” Lu said.Also, ducks are more disciplined than frogs and birds, which are also natural enemies of locusts, a type of a grasshopper.The duck “Guo Shao No. 1” from Shaoxing region of Zhejiang will be leading the fight.Among the Shaoxing ducks, the “mallard duck of ‘ma duck’ is large in size and has strong predation ability, making it the first choice for locust control,” Lu said.The ‘ma duck’ has an illustrious fighting record.In 2000, when locusts swarmed Xinjiang, these “duck soldiers” were transported by air from Zhejiang; they were shipped more than 10 times in batches, totaling more than 1,00,000.Locusts can either be controlled biologically or through pesticides.From the context of environmental protection, the benefits of biological control are more.“The former has high killing costs and pesticide residues, and the latter not only has no environmental pollution, but also can repair the biological chain,” Lu added.After fighting the locusts, the ducks could become food too, the news report said.“In addition, after the ducklings are grown, the meat is tender, and after the locust eradication ‘retires’, it can become a delicious dish on the table of local residents, bringing economic income,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-disciplined-duck-army-to-help-pak-stave-off-locust-swarm/story-v3SfdQINQPuicdhBld4lTL.html
27-02-2020||World||Pak’s inclusion on ‘grey list’ is credit negative for banks, says Moody’s||Pakistan’s banking system faces a credit risk from the country’s continued inclusion on an international “grey list” of nations falling short of global money laundering rules, rating agency Moody’s said on Thursday.Global watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said last week that Pakistan would remain on the list, expressing concern it had not completed an agreed-upon action plan, and giving it until June to do so.“The announcement is credit negative for Pakistani banks because it raises questions about potential additional restrictions relating to banks’ foreign-currency clearing services, as well as their foreign operations,” Moody’s said, adding that increased compliance costs would also hamper banks’ profitability. Though Pakistan’s compliance with global rules had improved, Moody’s said, its weakness risked banks losing access to foreign currency-clearing services, crucial for cross-border payments used to fund imports and exports.“This risk has so far not crystallised in the jurisdictions that have been placed on the increased monitoring list,” the agency said.If Pakistan does not meet FATF’s requirements to curb any chances of the financial system to be used for terror financing or money laundering, it could join Iran and North Korea on the global watchdog’s blacklist.That would lead to Pakistan being shunned by international financial institutions.The UAE’s central bank announced this month that it was investigating whether Pakistan’s largest lender Habib Bank had violated laws against money laundering and terrorism financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-s-inclusion-on-grey-list-is-credit-negative-for-banks-says-moody-s/story-zBGfROhWoFRQItGurYGciN.html
27-02-2020||World||Saudi Arabia halts travel to Islam’s holiest site over coronavirus outbreak||Saudi Arabia on Thursday halted travel to the holiest sites in Islam over fears about a viral epidemic just months ahead of the annual hajj pilgrimage, a move that came as the Mideast has over 220 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus.The extraordinary decision by Saudi Arabia stops foreigners from reaching the holy city of Mecca and the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims pray toward five times a day. The decision also affected travel to Prophet Muhammad’s mosque in Medina. Authorities also suspended entry to the kingdom to those with tourist visas from nations affected by the new virus.The decision showed the worry about the outbreak potentially spreading into Saudi Arabia, whose oil-rich monarchy stakes its legitimacy on protecting Islam’s holy sites.The epicentre in the Mideast’s most-affected country, Iran, appears to be in the holy Shiite city of Qom, where the faithful in reverence reach out to kiss and touch a famous shrine. Iran now has the highest death toll from the virus outside of China, the epicentre of the outbreak.There have been no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Saudi Arabia amid the outbreak.“Saudi Arabia renews its support for all international measures to limit the spread of this virus, and urges its citizens to exercise caution before travelling to countries experiencing coronavirus outbreaks,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement announcing the decision. “We ask God Almighty to spare all humanity from all harm.”Disease outbreaks always have been a concern surrounding the hajj, required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their life, especially as pilgrims come from all over the world. The earliest recorded outbreak came in 632 as pilgrims fought off malaria. A cholera outbreak in 1821 for instance killed an estimated 20,000 pilgrims. Another cholera outbreak in 1865 killed 15,000 pilgrims and then spread worldwide.More recently, Saudi Arabia faced a danger from another coronavirus that caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which jumped from ill camels to humans. The kingdom increased its public health measures during the hajj in 2012 and 2013, though no outbreaks occurred amid the pilgrimage.Since September 2012, there have been nearly 2,500 cases of MERS reported, with 858 deaths attributed to the virus, according to the World Health Organization.Since it emerged in December in central China, the new coronavirus has sickened 82,000 people globally, with more than 2,700 deaths.While millions attend the hajj, which is this year set for late July into early August, millions more come during the rest of the year to the holy sites in the kingdom. That pilgrimage is referred to as the umrah.“It is unprecedented, at least in recent times, but given the worldwide spread of the virus and the global nature of the umrah, it makes sense from a public health and safety point of view,” said Kristian Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. “Especially since the Iranian example illustrates how a religious crossroads can so quickly amplify the spread and reach of the virus.”The hardest-hit nation in the Mideast is Iran, where Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 19 people have died among 139 confirmed cases of the illness, named COVID-19.Experts are concerned Iran may be underreporting cases and deaths, given the illness’s rapid spread from Iran across the Persian Gulf. For example, Iran still has not confirmed any cases in Mashhad, even though a number of cases reported in Kuwait are linked to the Iranian city.In Bahrain, which confirmed 33 cases as of Thursday morning, authorities halted all flights to Iraq and Lebanon. It separately extended a 48-hour ban over flights from Dubai and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, through which infected travelers reached the island kingdom off the coast of Saudi Arabia.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said there were no immediate plans to quarantine cities but acknowledged it may take “one, two or three weeks” to get control of the virus in Iran.As Iran’s 80 million people find themselves increasingly isolated in the region by the outbreak, the country’s sanctions-battered economy saw its currency slump to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in a year on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Iraq’s Health Ministry on Thursday announced the first coronavirus case in the capital, Baghdad, bringing the overall number of cases reported in the country to six. All have been linked to Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-halts-travel-to-islam-s-holiest-site-over-coronavirus-outbreak/story-hg0KUC9ZPmz7QbbeEHZVXN.html
27-02-2020||World||Pak PM Imran Khan to visit Qatar ahead of signing of US-Taliban peace deal||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will visit Qatar on Thursday, just two days prior to the signing of a landmark peace deal between the US and the Taliban in Doha to end more than 18 year long Afghan war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.The US is set to sign a peace deal with the Taliban on Saturday provided that a week-long reduction in violence across Afghanistan holds, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a recent statement. The Taliban also released a statement confirming the plan to sign a peace deal that day.During his day-long visit, Prime Minister Khan will meet Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani and the two leaders will discuss matters related to the bilateral ties and regional development, according to an official statement.“During the visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to Qatar, the focus will be on strengthening bilateral cooperation and exchanging views on regional developments,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a statement.This would be the second visit of Prime Minister Khan to Qatar after taking office in 2018.The Emir of Qatar visited Pakistan in June 2019 and the visit resulted in strengthening the bilateral economic collaboration in diverse areas, the statement said.Qatar has invited Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to attend the peace deal signing ceremony in Doha.President Donald Trump said on Monday in India that the landmark Afghan peace deal had received “tremendous support”.Trump’s remarks came after the US and the Afghan Taliban started a seven-day partial truce ahead of the possible peace deal to end more than 18-year-long war.The longstanding war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Some 2.5 million Afghans are registered as refugees abroad and another two million are displaced within their country.The agreement struck during talks between the US and the Taliban, if maintained, may secure a peace deal that would lead to a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.The US currently has less than 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, but military officials would not confirm the exact number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-to-visit-qatar-ahead-of-signing-of-us-taliban-peace-deal/story-dIlAUKsnOlXFK938vO2WyO.html
27-02-2020||World||Gunman kills 5 before taking his own life at US’s one of largest breweries||An employee opened fire Wednesday at one of the nation’s largest breweries in Milwaukee, killing five fellow workers before taking his own life, police said.The assailant who attacked the Molson Coors complex was identified as a 51-year-old Milwaukee man who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.“There were five individuals who went to work today, just like everybody goes to work, and they thought they were going to go to work, finish their day and return to their families. They didn’t — and tragically they never will,” Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said.Authorities offered no immediate motive for the attack and did not release details about the shooter or how the shooting unfolded.None of the victims was identified. Police, who were still contacting relatives, said identities would not be released for at least 24 hours. No one was wounded beyond those who were killed, authorities said.Officers worked for hours to clear the more than 20 buildings in the complex where more than 1,000 people work. Police announced at a late evening news conference that the work was done and all employees had been allowed to go home. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said authorities believe the shooter acted alone.President Donald Trump addressed the shooting before speaking at the White House about his administration’s efforts to combat the coronavirus.“Our hearts break for them and their loved ones,” the president said. “We send our condolences. We’ll be with them, and it’s a terrible thing, a terrible thing.”The attack occurred at a sprawling complex that includes a mix of corporate offices and brewing facilities. The complex is widely known in the Milwaukee area as “Miller Valley,” a reference to the Miller Brewing Co. that is now part of Molson Coors.Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley called the shooter “an active brewery employee.”“Unfortunately, I am devastated to share that we lost five other members of our family in this tragic incident,” he said in an email sent to employees. “There are no words to express the deep sadness many of us are feeling right now.”He said the office would be closed the rest of the week and the brewery shuttered “for the time being” to give people time to cope.A group of brewery employees gathered at a nearby bar to talk about what had happened.“We are all a family. We work a lot of hours together, so we’re all very sad,” said Selena Curka, a brewery employee who was about to start her shift when the complex went on lockdown and she was turned away.“It’s just weird, because nine times out of 10 you’re going to know the shooter,” said another employee Thomas Milner. “It’s a tight-knit family. Within the brewery we all interact with each other.”Milner was also on his way to work when the shooting happened, and he was turned away too.James Boyles told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his wife, Lasonya Ragdales, works at Molson Coors in the claims department. She was texting from inside the facility and told her husband that there was an active shooter and she was locked in a room with a bunch of co-workers, the Journal Sentinel newspaper reported.“Miller Valley” features a 160-year-old brewery, with a packaging center that fills thousands of cans and bottles every minute and a distribution center the size of five football fields. A massive red Miller sign towers over the complex and is a well-known symbol in Milwaukee, where beer and brewing are intertwined in the city’s history.The facility is also home to corporate customer service, finance, human resources and engineering departments. Tours take people to underground caves where beer was once stored, a saloon with intricate woodwork, a stein hall with stained-glass windows, a champagne room meeting hall with leaded-glass windows, and an outdoor beer garden that can hold 300 people.Molson Coors announced in October that it planned to close a Denver office as part of a restructuring to eliminate 400 to 500 jobs. The reorganization was to benefit Milwaukee, which was expected to see hundreds of corporate and support jobs relocated there.Before Wednesday’s shooting, there had been three mass killings nationwide in 2020, with 12 total victims. All have been shootings. In 2019, there were 44 mass killings, with 224 total victims. The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killings database tracks all U.S. homicides since 2006 involving four or more people killed, not including the offender, over 24 hours regardless of weapon, location, victim-offender relationship or motive.The last mass shooting in the Milwaukee area was in August 2012, when white supremacist Wade Michael Page fatally shot six people and wounded four others at a Sikh temple in suburban Oak Creek. Page killed himself after being wounded in a shootout with police. The worst mass shooting in the area in the past 20 years was in 2005, when seven people were killed and four wounded at a church service in Brookfield, a Milwaukee suburb. The shooter killed himself.Shortly before word of the brewery shooting broke, Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald told reporters in suburban Franklin that state gun laws would not be changing despite a push by Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, to do so, according to a report in the Journal Sentinel.Evers called lawmakers into special session late last year to consider expanding background checks and allowing guns to be taken from people deemed a threat. But the Republican-controlled Legislature adjourned without action. Fitzgerald later called the shootings “an act of evil,” the Journal Sentinel reported.At a news conference outside Molson Coors, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said, “We shouldn’t accept this.” He took up the issue later on social media, tweeting: “Another avoidable uniquely American tragedy. It’s not normal, we should never accept it, and we should never relent when ‘leaders’ offer hollow thoughts and prayers but choose inaction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-kills-5-before-taking-his-own-life-at-us-s-one-of-largest-breweries/story-c6TRx9KBQbNVhcLlXFxg2K.html
27-02-2020||World||New United States coronavirus case may be the first from unknown origin||A new coronavirus case in California could be the first in the U.S. that has no known connection to travel abroad or another known case, a possible sign the virus is spreading in a U.S. community, health officials said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the case Wednesday.California officials said the person is a resident of Solano County, northeast of San Francisco, and is getting medical care in Sacramento County. They said they have begun the process of tracking down people who the patient has been in contact with, a process known as contact tracing.Officials did not immediately release any other details.All of the 59 other cases in the U.S. had travelled from abroad or had been in close contact with those who travelled. Health officials have been on high alert for so-called community spread.Earlier U.S. cases included 14 in people who travelled back from outbreak areas in China, or their spouses; three people who were evacuated from the central China city of Wuhan; and 42 American passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were evacuated by the federal government to the U.S. from where the ship was docked in Japan.Some of those evacuated were taken to Travis Air Force Base, which is in Solano County. A number of the earlier cases have been in California, including among some of the people taken to Travis and one in which a traveller who returned to San Benito County spread it to a spouse.California officials have been preparing for the possibility that community spread of the virus might first surface there.“We have been anticipating the potential for such a case in the U.S., and given our close familial, social and business relationships with China, it is not unexpected that the first case in the U.S. would be in California,” said Dr. Sonia Angell, Director of the California Department of Public Health and State Public Health Officer, in a statement.The outbreak, which began in China, has infected tends of thousands of people in more than three dozen countries, with the vast majority in mainland China.The new virus is a member of the coronavirus family that can cause colds or more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.Officials are advising people to take steps to avoid infection with coronavirus or other respiratory infections like a cold or the flu, including washing hands with soap and water and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-united-states-coronavirus-case-may-be-the-first-from-unknown-origin/story-KNTkwqHrSn1fMDZ2O8yQSO.html

Hundreds of prisoners have been sickened by the virus, some likely infected because guards used the same bus station as workers at a pulmonary hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hardest-hit-china-south-korea-count-767-new-coronavirus-cases/story-c1QoDFzLjZa1Kwwy6O7rEJ.html
27-02-2020||World||Malaysian king summons Mahathir Mohamad , who’s keen to become PM again||Malaysia’s king summoned Mahathir Mohamad to the palace Thursday, fuelling talks he may have majority support to return as the next Prime Minister after his abrupt resignation and the collapse of his ruling coalition this week.Mahathir didn’t speak to reporters as he was driven into the palace grounds. The meeting came after the king interviewed lawmakers to determine who they support as Prime Minister and if they want fresh elections.A comeback as Prime Minister for a third time will be a remarkable feat for Mahathir, the world’s oldest leader at 94, after nail-biting twists, turns and machinations in the political drama that unraveled over the weekend. A failed bid by Mahathir’s supporters to form a new government without his named successor Anwar Ibrahim plunged the country into a political limbo.A total of 37 lawmakers, led by Mahathir’s Bersatu party, left the ruling alliance, depriving it of majority support and sparking a crisis less than two years after it ousted a corrupt-tainted coalition that had ruled for 61 years. The king dissolved the Cabinet but reappointed Mahathir as interim leader.The result was a renewed battle between Mahathir and Anwar, whose political feud has stretched more than two decades.Mahathir said Wednesday he had quit to show he wasn’t power crazy and because he doesn’t want to work with the former corrupt regime that he had ousted in 2018 polls. Despite a prelection pact to handover power to Anwar, he said Parliament should pick the next leader and that he would form a non-partisan government if he is chosen again to helm the government.“I just want to do what is best for the country. … I believe, rightly or wrongly, politics and political parties must be set aside for now. If allowed, I will form an administration that does not side with any party. Only national interest will be prioritized,” Mahathir said in a televised message.His unity government plan was rejected by Anwar’s camp, which said it would only create a “Mahathir government” that is not accountable to the people and unsustainable.Anwar said lawmakers from the three remaining parties in his alliance have nominated him as the prime minister after Mahathir rejected their offer to restore their former government. He has said they will wait for the king’s decision. His camp still controls 41% of parliamentary seats but could be the largest bloc after two key Malay opposition parties withdrew their support for Mahathir.Anwar was Mahathir’s deputy during Mahathir’s first stint in office in the 1990s, but he was sacked following a power struggle and later jailed on sodomy and corruption charges that he said were trumped up. Anwar led a reform movement that helped built a fledgling opposition but was jailed a second time for sodomy in 2014 in a move he said was aimed at killing his political career.Mahathir, who retired in 2003 after 22 years in power, made a comeback in 2016 spurred by anger over a massive graft scandal involving a state investment fund. Mahathir and Anwar reconciled and forged an alliance that won a historic vote in 2018 that ushered in the first change of government since independence from Britain in 1957. But their relationship remained uneasy as Mahathir refused to set a time frame to hand over power to Anwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-king-summons-mahathir-mohamad-who-s-keen-to-become-pm-again/story-wkdKjDKWi8vIoB7hw2Q1eO.html
