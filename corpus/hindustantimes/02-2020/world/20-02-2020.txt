20-02-2020||World||Michael Bloomberg mauled at debate, Elizabeth Warren stood out||Billionaire Michael Bloomberg came under blistering attack Wednesday from rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination at his first time on a debate stage with them, some of whom are in a desperate struggle to keep their chances alive as the race enters a crucial phase.Straight off the bat, Senator Bernie Sanders, who leads the pack in polls, brought up discriminatory policing methods during Bloomberg’s stint at mayor of New York calling them “outrageous”. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who turned in a strong performance, was next, and everyone joined in even as they also turned upon each other with equal enthusiasm.Warren landed one of the most severe, and defining blow, in a way. “I’d like to talk about who we’re running against: a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians,” she said referring to a compilation of insulting and demeaning remarks Bloomberg has made about women as a businessman, which he has denied. “And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump. I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.” Nothing could be more devastating for a Democratic candidate than to be compare to President Donald Trump.Bloomberg was expected to be tested at the debate, and more so as he is seen to have been buying his way into the race. He has spent $400 million on advertisements on TV and social media and shop in polls, overtaking many of his rivals despite entering the contest late — he is now in third position in the RealClearPolitics average of polls behind Sanders who is Number 1, and former Vice-President Joe Biden is second.Biden and Warren have both performed poorly in the only two nomination contests held thus far, Iowa and New Hampshire. And repeat debacles in the next two — Nevada on Friday and South Carolina on February 29 — could imperil their candidacy irretrievably. Both came out swinging Wednesday.And so did former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, who skirmished with each other as they try to build on the momentum from their surprisingly strong performances in the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, as they both seek to elevate their stature nationally. It got quite testy in that corner as well. Buttigieg brought up her failure to name the president of neighboring Mexico in a recent interview, despite her vast congressional experience in related issues. Klobuchar shot back, asking if he was calling her “dumb”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michael-bloomberg-mauled-at-debate-elizabeth-warren-stood-out/story-Sl1vW5hG1Ctu7jla9Dwu2H.html
20-02-2020||World||US blacklists 5 Iranian officials for disqualifying election candidates||The United States on Thursday blacklisted five Iranian officials, accusing them of preventing free and fair elections, a day before a parliamentary vote seen as a referendum on the handling of various political and economic crises.The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement it imposed sanctions on the officials, members of Iran’s Guardian Council and its Elections Supervision Committee, over the council’s role in disqualifying several thousand candidates.The Guardian Council, which must approve candidates, has rejected around 6,850 moderate or conservative hopefuls in favour of hardliners from among the 14,000 applicants seeking to contest the Feb. 21 vote. About a third of lawmakers have also been barred from standing again.“The regime denies the Iranian people a representative Parliament by pre-deciding who is qualified to run for office,” Brian Hook, U.S. special representative for Iran, said in a news conference.“You can’t truthfully call them elections when half of the people who want to run are disqualified by an unelected few,” he added.Washington’s action targeted Ahmad Jannati, the secretary of the Guardian Council, Mohammad Yazdi, a member of Iran’s Guardian Council who was formerly Iran’s first judiciary chief, and three additional members of the Elections Supervisory Committee.The sanctions freeze any U.S.-held assets of the officials and generally bar Americans from doing business with them.Campaigning officially ended on Thursday for Iran’s parliamentary election. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said voting is “a religious duty” but some prominent pro-reform politicians in Iran and activists abroad have called for a boycott.“The Trump Administration will not tolerate the manipulation of elections to favor the regime’s malign agenda, and this action exposes those senior regime officials responsible for preventing the Iranian people from freely choosing their leaders,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.Tensions between Washington and Tehran have spiked since Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.The vote to pick 290 lawmakers will have no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran’s nuclear policy, which is determined by Khamenei, whose hardline loyalists are likely to dominate the parliament.Hook, when asked if the new parliament might have an effect on Iran’s diplomacy with the United States, said: “I doubt it, because the day after the elections, the supreme leader is still going to be in charge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-blacklists-five-iranian-officials-for-disqualifying-election-candidates/story-mdszaQq33oWJne0LchegCO.html
20-02-2020||World||Irish PM Leo Varadkar set to quit as parliament returns following inconclusive election||Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar was preparing to resign on Thursday but stay on as interim leader, with the country’s three main parties still locked in coalition talks after an inconclusive election.The 160 MPs gathered for the first time since the February 8 vote, which saw a surge in support for left-wing republicans Sinn Fein, now the second biggest party with 37 MPs.Fianna Fail is the largest party in the new legislature with 38 seats and Varadkar’s Fine Gael has 35, but none looks likely to get the necessary support for a coalition.The Dail -- the parliament’s lower house -- is likely to adjourn at around 2000 GMT and Varadkar will offer his resignation, staying on as interim leader until a new government is formed.In parliament, members moved to elect a speaker from a field of two candidates. Parties will later make their nominations for taoiseach (prime minister) and debate the possible candidates.A new balance Sinn Fein, which picked up 14 seats, attracted voters by focusing on Ireland’s housing shortage and health crisis. But its flagship policy on Irish unity is likely to be a top issue if it gains power.“I will be standing for the position of taoiseach today because I want to stand up for all of those who voted for real change and I want to deliver for all those that voted for change,” said leader Mary Lou McDonald as she arrived at the Dail.Sinn Fein is now the second-biggest party in the Irish Republic and in the largely self-governing Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK. It wants a referendum on uniting the two parts of the island within five years.The IRA fought British rule in Northern Ireland for decades until the late 1990s, when a peace agreement largely ended violence that left more than 3,000 dead on all sides.With none of the three main parties having the 80 seats required for a majority, at least three parties will be needed to form a government.Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have both ruled out working with Sinn Fein, which has been forced to sound out smaller, left-leaning parties in a bid to forge broad alliance that keeps the two traditional powers out.Varadkar told state broadcaster RTE on Monday he was prepared to go into opposition.Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said Wednesday his party had formed a negotiating team “to deal with the range of crises facing the country”. Sinn Fein said it was “intensifying” negotiations with parties and independents seeking “a government for change”.As the three main parties will not work together, the Green Party -- the fourth largest with 12 seats -- may become a power broker in the next government.It has invited all three paries to meetings from Friday to sketch out a plan for the next administration.Talks may take some time and could result in a new election in which Sinn Fein could emerge as a favourite.After a 2016 vote it took 70 days for a minority coalition government to form under Fine Gael, which was supported in a confidence and supply agreement by Fianna Fail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irish-pm-leo-varadkar-set-to-quit-as-parliament-returns-following-inconclusive-election/story-W1UlRWCaiXXgvRSMZEihrL.html
20-02-2020||World||German man shoots nine dead in attack on migrant bars, then kills himself||A gunman with suspected far-right links shot dead nine people, some of them migrants from Turkey, in an overnight rampage through a German city before killing himself, officials said.Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the attack on two shisha bars in Hanau, near Frankfurt. She told reporters it appeared to have been motivated by the “poison” of racism that was to blame for “too many crimes”, as Turkish officials called on her government to respond robustly.The presumed killer was a 43-year-old German man who held a firearms licence and was a member of a gun club. Police chased a car used to leave the scene of one shooting to its owner’s address, where they found his body and that of his 72-year-old mother, said Peter Beuth, interior minister of Hesse state, where Hanau is located.Federal prosecutors said they had taken charge of the case due to its likely extremist motive, and newspaper Bild said the suspect had expressed far-right views in a written confession.In shisha bars, customers share flavored tobacco from a communal hookah, or water pipe. In Western countries, they are often owned and operated by people from the Middle East or South Asia, where use of the hookah is a centuries-old tradition.Turkey’s ambassador in Berlin, Ali Kemal Aydin, told state broadcaster TRT Haber that five Turkish nationals were among the dead.“We expect German authorities to show maximum effort to enlighten this case. Racism is a collective cancer,” Turkish presidency spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said earlier on Twitter.The Confederation of the Communities of Kurdistan in Germany said several victims were Kurdish, expressing anger that Germany’s political leaders “are not resolutely opposing right-wing networks and right-wing terrorism.”POLITICAL POLARISATIONGermany, which is home to three million people of Turkish origin including one million ethnic Kurds, has seen its political landscape polarised in recent years, with a wave of immigration and a slowing economy helping to fuel support for extremist groups at both ends of the spectrum.In October, an anti-Semitic gunman opened fire outside a German synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, and killed two people as he livestreamed his attack.Authorities have banned some far-right groups endorsing violence, while Germany’s post-war centrist political consensus has been undermined by growing support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, notably in the former-Communist eastern states.Social Democrat Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that, 75 years after the Nazi dictatorship, right-wing “terror” had returned. “We must defend our liberal democracy,” he posted on Twitter.‘THEY WERE HORRIFIED’ Police said there were no indications that other suspects were involved in the Hanau attack.They said investigations into the identity of gunman and victims were ongoing and, Beuth said, whether any letters of confession had been written. The minister said the suspect was in legal possession of weapons and belonged to a shooting club, and Bild said ammunition and gun magazines were found in the suspect’s vehicle. Can-Luca Frisenna, whose father and brother run one of the two bars attacked, said he rushed there after learning about the shooting.“I heard my father was affected and my little brother, they run the kiosk,” he said. “... They were horrified and they were crying and everything. So everyone was shocked.”At one of the bars on Thursday morning, forensics police in white overalls inspected the crime scene, cordoned off close to Hanau’s historic market place. Nearby, traffic flowed as normal and commuters waited for buses.Kadir Koese, a 38-year businessman who runs a bar opposite one of those attacked, described hearing shots being fired.“There was a guy lying on the sidewalk, shot in the head, I think. My neighbour said ‘get down’. The police came quickly,” he said.French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his immense sadness over the attack and his support for Germany, according to a Twitter posting.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is German, said in a tweet that she was deeply shocked by the shooting and that she mourned with the families and friends of the victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-man-shoots-nine-dead-in-attack-on-migrant-bars-then-kills-himself/story-EzPXT8nkPf7otuvRDQguUP.html
20-02-2020||World||Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg donates prize money to new foundation||Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg is using her prize money from an award known as the alternative Nobel to help set up a non-profit organisation in her name “to promote ecological and social sustainability”.Thunberg, 17, who won the Right Livelihood Award in December, will use the 1 million Swedish crown ($100,000) prize to establish the Greta Thunberg Foundation in Sweden.The Swedish teenager said in January that she was establishing a foundation to handle the money she gets from book royalties, donations and prizes.“We are convinced that Thunberg’s new foundation will have a great impact and empower much-needed change,” Ole von Uexkuell, executive director of the Sweden-based Right Livelihood Foundation, said in a statement on Thursday.Thunberg, who was last month again nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by two Swedish legislators, is among a growing list of people to dedicate funds to battling the impact of climate change, sparking discussions on the best use of this money.Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest man, this week pledged $10 billion to fund scientists, activists, nonprofits and other groups fighting to protect the environment and counter the effects of climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teen-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-donates-prize-money-to-new-foundation/story-MuvNaMnDrNnwiwowvdmRhN.html
20-02-2020||World||China alters coronavirus diagnosis definition again; new cases drop, 2,122 dead||China has for the second time in week changed the criteria to diagnose confirmed coronavirus (covid-19) cases, resulting in a drop in numbers from the worst-hit Hubei province but a spike in suspicion on the reliability of official data.The change in criteria was announced as the death toll as of early Thursday stood at 2122 on the mainland.Under the new criteria, there were 394 cases nationwide on Wednesday down from 1749 on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases to 74,576, the national health commission (NHC) announced. Hubei, the epicenter province of the outbreak, reported 349 new cases on Wednesday, down from 1,693 a day earlier.The revised guidelines for the first time raised the possibility of covid-19 transmission through aerosol in closed environments for extended periods of time.It added: “…the possibility of aerosol transmission in prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosol in a relatively closed environment”.The number of new covid-19 cases dropped because the health officials have decided to apply stricter and universal criteria nationwide rather than a different, broader standard only for Hubei province as in the previous version.Under the earlier plan, cases in the epidemic’s epicentre Hubei could be diagnosed clinically, such as with chest X-rays – it resulted in 15000 new cases being reported on February 13.From now, all confirmed cases will be determined using lab tests known as nucleic acid tests (NATs) – like it was being done before the first change in diagnostic criteria was made specifically for Hubei.The way cases are diagnosed and confirmed decides the official covid-19 tallies from across China, and changes – two in quick succession -- in the diagnosis method have raised questions about the accuracy of numbers – worse, it barely suppresses the suspicion that the government could be hiding the extent of the outbreak.The NHC officials said China’s daily number of new infections outside Hubei recorded a drop for 16 consecutive days.Meanwhile, state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi has said Chinaefforts to control the outbreak “are working”, adding that the easing in new cases to his country’s “forceful action” against the illness.Speaking in Laos after talks with counterparts from the 10 Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries, Wang Yi said the outbreak was “controllable and curable” despite the global panic it has seeded.“China is not only protecting its own people but also the rest of the world,” he told the summit in Vientiane, referring to the drop in new cases.In Hubei, and its capital, Wuhan, the fight against the outbreak continues as authorities scramble to arrange for more beds and deploy medics.“China has gone all out to treat covid-19 patients both with mild symptoms and in severe conditions alike in the epicentre city of Wuhan as the number of hospital beds reserved for covid-19 patients has risen to about 40,000 and the supporting medical personnel over 30,000,” official news agency, Xinhua said in a report early Thursday.“Currently, more than 30,000 medical personnel, including military medics, have been sent to Wuhan from across the country with specialties in a number of disciplines, including respiratory infections, heart and kidneys. Wuhan now has 11,000 intensive care medical staff, accounting for 10 percent of the nation’s total,” the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-alters-coronavirus-diagnosis-definition-again-new-cases-drop-2-122-dead/story-GBGlzexyUhTy9lsGxTD1zI.html
20-02-2020||World||South Korea confirms first coronavirus death as infection cases surge||South Korea recorded its first confirmed death from a person infected with coronavirus and its verified cases more than tripled within a day, with the bulk of the new cases tied to a cluster from a fringe religious sect.South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that one person died of the virus and its domestic infection total reached 104, a troubling sign that comes as neighbour Japan posted a sharp rise in infections and recorded its second and third deaths attributed to the disease.South Korea’s CDC didn’t provide many details on the country’s first recorded fatality but gave its location as a hospital near Daegu, one of the country’s biggest cities where a cluster of infections has been found among members of the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, formerly known as Shincheonji Church of Jesus.The person who died from pneumonia Wednesday was confirmed to have the coronavirus, according to Yonhap News. South Korea’s CDC said it was investigating the cause of the person’s death.The center said that it found at least 28 new cases confirmed today involved those who attended church services with a person confirmed with the virus earlier this week. The pastor told JoongAng Ilbo newspaper in an interview that some 1,000 people attended the same service.The outbreak in Daegu, about 235 kilometers (150 miles) south of Seoul, has raised renewed concerns about the virus after a lull in reported cases last week. On Tuesday, President Moon Jae-in warned that the impact from the virus on the economy could be bigger and longer-lasting than the 2015 MERS epidemic that killed 38 people in South Korea.“We have closed down our Daegu church as of the 18th morning and are continuing to investigate, disinfect, and take preventive measures,” the group said in a statement.Moon pledged full support to the city in a call to Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin, the presidential office said. Kwon told residents in a Facebook post to “refrain from going outside” and wear a protective mask, even at home.Daegu ‘Shutdown’The global death toll climbed to 2,128, including 10 fatalities outside of mainland China, the epicenter of the disease.Even before reports of the death, “shut down Daegu,” started trending on Twitter Korea, with many on social media calling on Moon’s government to isolate the city of about 2.5 million people in a way similar to the Chinese lockdown of Wuhan.“At this stage, the government judged that COVID-19 is spreading locally with a limited scope,” Vice Health and Welfare Minister Kim Kang-lip was quoted as saying by Yonhap News.Many in the city increased their safeguards after the surge was reported. U.S. Army Garrison Daegu said in a statement on its Facebook page that it will put in place entry restrictions that would ban visitors, including relatives, friends and those coming from overseas.“Travel to and from Daegu is restricted for U.S. service members and highly discouraged for civilians, retirees and family members,” it said, adding the policy will be reassessed daily.Daegu education officials ordered the closing of preschools and daycare centers, citing concerns relayed by parents of students, Kyongbuk Ilbo reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-confirms-first-death-of-person-infected-with-coronavirus/story-i5d44shEHr3WQEAmiRR83J.html
20-02-2020||World||‘I know how to take on an arrogant con man like Donald Trump’: Bloomberg||In his maiden appearance on a Democratic presidential primary debate, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg tore into Donald Trump, saying he is the best candidate to defeat “an arrogant con man” and the “worst president ever”.The five other Democratic presidential aspirants opened Wednesday’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas by piling quickly onto Bloomberg, with Senator Elizabeth Warren describing him as a misogynist who has promoted racist policies. “I think we have two questions to face tonight. One is, who can beat Donald Trump? And, number two, who can do the job if they get into the White House? And I would argue that I am the candidate that can do exactly both of those things,” Bloomberg said. “I’m a New Yorker. I know how to take on an arrogant con man like Donald Trump, that comes from New York. I’m a mayor or was a mayor. I know how to run a complicated city, the biggest, most diverse city in this country,” he said.Bloomberg, 78, a well-known philanthropist who also has a global news outlet by the same name, quickly became center of the Wednesday night’s debate. He has spent millions of dollars from his own pocket in the race so far.“I’m a manager. I knew what to do after 9/11 and brought the city back stronger than ever. And I’m a philanthropist who didn’t inherit his money but made his money. And I’m spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst president we have ever had. And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids,” he said in his opening remarks.Bloomberg asserted that Senator Bernie Sanders did not have any chance whatsoever of beating Trump. “You don’t start out by saying I’ve got 160 million people I’m going to take away the insurance plan that they love. That’s just not a way that you go and start building the coalition that the Sanders camp thinks that they can do. I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever. And if he goes and is the candidate, we will have Donald Trump for another four years. And we can’t stand that,” he said.Sanders in response to a question said in order to beat Trump, there was a need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States.“Mr Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop and frisk which went after African-American and Latino people in an outrageous way. That is not a way you’re going to grow voter turnout,” he said.Massachusetts Senator Warren said the Democrats will take a big risk if they just substituted “one arrogant billionaire for another.” “I’d like to talk about who we’re running against, a billionaire who calls women ‘fat broads’ and ‘horse-faced lesbians’. And, no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump. I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist polls like redlining and stop and frisk,” Warren said.Welcoming Bloomberg to the debate stage, Senator Amy Klobuchar said the former mayor should not be hiding behind his TV ads.“And so I was all ready for this big day. And then I looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning, and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way. That is what his campaign said because we should pave the way for him to become the nominee,” she said.Dark horse Pete Buttigieg said that both Sanders and Bloomberg were the two most polarising figures on the stage.“Most Americans don’t see where they fit if they’ve got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power,” he said.“We shouldn’t have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better,” Buttigieg said.Bloomberg is worth more than USD 64 billion, according to Forbes, towering over Trump’s USD 3.1 billion net worth.The former mayor has also come under fire for pouring millions of his own money into his campaign, leading to charges he effectively bought his spot in the presidential race and on the debate stage. His past comments about women and his support of policies such as stop-and-frisk and red-lining have also made him a target of his Democratic competitors. Wednesday’s debate is the last before Saturday’s Nevada caucuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-know-how-to-take-on-an-arrogant-con-man-like-donald-trump-bloomberg/story-rZSB1MX83Xo5Q5rMYaearN.html
20-02-2020||World||‘We’re running against a billionaire’: Democrats attack Bloomberg in US presidential debate||The top six candidates competing for the Democratic nomination to take on US President Donald Trump in November participated in the ninth presidential debate on Wednesday, with one quickly becoming the focus: Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor making his first debate appearance in the race, faced criticism from all his rivals on the stage in Las Vegas: ELIZABETH WARREN“We’re running against a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-face lesbians. And no I’m not talking about Donald Trump, I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk.”Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, also criticized Bloomberg for reports that his namesake media company mistreated women employees. She called on him to release women who sued his company from non-disclosure agreements. “I hope you heard what his defense was: I’ve been nice to some women. That just doesn’t cut it. The mayor has to stand on his record and what we need to know is what’s lurking out there.”“This is not just a question of the mayor’s character. This is also a question about electability. We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many non-disclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against.”PETE BUTTIGIEGThe former South Bend, Indiana, mayor went after both Bloomberg and US Senator Bernie Sanders.“Most Americans don’t see where they fit if they have to choose between a socialist who thinks money is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power. Let’s put forward somebody who actually lives and works in the middle class neighborhood in an industrial Midwestern city. Let’s put forward somebody who’s actually a Democrat.”“We shouldn’t have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better.” JOE BIDENThe former vice president assailed Bloomberg over the stop-and-frisk policing policy in New York City that was criticized for ensnaring disproportionate numbers of blacks and Latinos.“The fact of the matter is he has not managed his city very well when he was there. He didn’t get a whole lot done. He had stop-and-frisk - throwing close to 5 million young black men up against the wall - and when we came along in our administration, President Obama and I said we’re going to send a mediator to stop it, he said that’s unnecessary.”Biden said that the Obama administration worked to put an end to the policy. “Let’s get the facts straight. Let’s get the order straight. It’s not whether you apologize or not, it’s the policy. The policy was abhorrent. And it was in fact a violation of every right people have.”AMY KLOBUCHARThe Minnesota senator responded to reports of the Bloomberg campaign saying the other moderates should drop out to let him fight the liberal Sanders.“I have been told as a woman, as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage, but I am because of pure grit ... I’ve been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside, and I’m not going to do that now ... I think we need something different than Donald Trump. I think don’t you look at Donald Trump and say, ‘We need someone richer in the White House’.”BERNIE SANDERS “We are giving a voice to people who would say we are sick and tired of billionaires, like Mr. Bloomberg, seeing huge expansions of their wealth, while a half a million people sleep out on the street tonight ... Maybe it’s time for the working class in this country to get a little bit of power in Washington, rather than your billionaire campaign.” Sanders added later: “Maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage, or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If that’s a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised.”MICHAEL BLOOMBERG“I’m a philanthropist who didn’t inherit his money, but made his money. I’m spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump – the worst president we’ve ever had. And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids.”Bloomberg said he had not mistreated women employees but defended his decision not to release those he settled with from non-disclosure agreements, saying they were made consensually.“We have a very few non-disclosure agreements. None of them accuse me of anything ... maybe they didn’t like the jokes I told.”Bloomberg criticized his opponents, particularly Sanders, for advocating higher taxes on corporations and forcing unions onto boards.“I can’t think of a better way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get reelected than listening to this conversation. We’re not gonna throw out capitalism. We tried that, other countries tried that, it was called communism and it just didn’t work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-re-running-against-a-billionaire-democrats-attack-bloomberg-in-us-presidential-debate/story-xQGIoJLa5w4qkWaKAOgHPL.html

I was among those who had some hopes. But now it is like choosing between bad and worse,” the 44-year-old women’s rights campaigner told AFP in Geneva, where she was attending an annual conference for human rights activists.Shajarizadeh said the supposed political choice in Iran between reformist and conservative politicians was like picking between “two faces of the same coin”.Thousands of reformist and moderate candidates are in any case being barred from contesting the elections -- something that critics say could turn the vote into a choice between conservatives and ultra-conservatives.Iranians “lost their hopes,” particularly after a bloody crackdown last year on fuel-price protests, she said.Shajarizadeh calls President Hassan Rohani, who was first elected in 2013 and again in 2017 and was once seen as a possible force for change, a “so-called reformer”.Escape on footThe protest movement against Iran’s Islamic dress code began when in December 2017 when a woman, Vida Mohavedi, stood on a pillar box on Enghelab Avenue in Tehran without the mandatory long coat and raised her veil on a stick.Enghelab means revolution in Farsi and the square and avenue are among the busiest areas in the capital.Movahedi’s move sparked similar protests by other women like Shajarizadeh and they soon won recognition as “Dokhtaran-e enghelab”, or the Girls of Revolution Street.“Young women are back in the streets,” she said -- a reference to other demonstrations in recent years which have seen women taking a leading role.During her visit to Geneva, Shajarizadeh received a prize for her defence of women’s rights in Iran but she talks about herself as an ordinary person whose life changed completely when she decided to join the protest.She was arrested three times and beaten for her defiance.She decided to run away, crossing the mountains into Turkey on foot with her head covered to avoid detection.She now lives in Toronto in Canada with her husband and their 11-year-old son, from where she is still campaigning against the obligation of wearing the hijab.The BBC has listed her as one of the world’s most influential women and she has written a book about her story with Canadian journalist Rima Elkouri.Her lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, is a leading women’s rights campaigner in her own right and is currently in prison.Shajarizadeh said “targeted sanctions” on the government could help change the situation in Iran but these should be designed “not to put more difficulties on the people”.Ultimately she thinks the best agents of change are civil society movements like her own and the “real heroes” are the women who decide to show their hair in public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-headscarf-campaigner-calls-for-vote-boycott/story-HXONcP1pr839HhfTEN1g4K.html
20-02-2020||World||Trump ‘offered pardon’ to Assange if he denied Russia leak, his lawyer tells court||US President Donald Trump promised to pardon WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange if he denied Russia leaked emails of his 2016 election rival’s campaign, a London court was told on Wednesday.Assange’s lawyer Jennifer Robinson said in a document that Trump relayed the offer through former US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, the UK’s domestic Press Association news agency reported.The White House quickly issued a denial that Trump had dangled a pardon in exchange for help in the Russia controversy, which has cast a shadow over his first term in office.“The president barely knows Dana Rohrabacher other than he’s an ex-congressman. He’s never spoken to him on this subject or almost any subject. It is a complete fabrication and a total lie,” Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.“This is probably another never-ending hoax and total lie” by the Democratic Party, she said, a day after Trump controversially pardoned or issued other forms of clemency to 11 people including a former governor jailed for corruption, and other high-profile white-collar criminals.The revelation came at a case management hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court before Monday’s formal start of Washington’s extradition request for him to face espionage charges.If found guilty in the United States, he could be jailed for 175 years.Assange faces 18 US counts Assange’s defence cited a statement from Robinson in which she said that Rohrabacher had been to see Assange and said “on instructions from the president, he was offering a pardon or some other way out, if Mr Assange... said Russia had nothing to do with the DNC leaks”.District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said the evidence was admissable.Robinson did not respond to emailed and telephone requests from AFP for comment.Rohrabacher on Tuesday evening denied the allegations that he had offered Assange a deal.“When speaking with Julian Assange, I told him that if he could provide me information and evidence about who actually gave him the DNC emails, I would then call on President Trump to pardon him,” the former congressman said in a statement on his website.“At no time did I offer a deal made by the President, nor did I say I was representing the President.”US intelligence agencies have concluded Russia hacked into the computer servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during Trump’s campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.WikiLeaks later published the emails, which proved politically damaging to Clinton, before the November 2016 vote.Australian national Assange, 48, is facing 18 counts in the US -- 17 of them under the Espionage Act.None of them is related to the DNC hack and instead concern WikiLeaks’s publication of diplomatic and defence cables about US campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.Trump has played down Russia’s involvement in the DNC leak, including when he appeared to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agency’s assessment of what happened.“I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Trump said during a joint press appearance with Putin during their July 2018 summit in Helsinki.The extradition hearing is set to start at Woolwich Crown Court, which is next to the high-security Belmarsh prison where he is being held.The hearing is expected to last all week, before being adjourned for three months, to resume on May 18. Assange appeared at the administrative hearing via videolink, wearing dark tracksuit bottoms and a brown jumper over a white shirt.He spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. He sat and held a pile of papers throughout the hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-offered-pardon-to-assange-if-he-denied-russia-leak-his-lawyer-tells-court/story-bf3YlKTDhErRrmkMcbrdcP.html
20-02-2020||World||Job offers delayed in Asia’s financial hubs in coronavirus fallout||Financial firms operating in Singapore and Hong Kong are delaying hiring as the coronavirus outbreak disrupts their businesses.Both domestic and foreign institutions have slowed recruitment, according to headhunters in the financial hubs. They’ve been impacted by quarantines, restrictions on travel to and from China, remote working arrangements and decisions not to conduct face-to-face interviews.It’s another aspect of the fallout from the virus, which has also caused factory closures, disrupted supply chains and initiated the world’s largest work-from-home experiment. Recruiting has become less of a priority as firms including DBS Group Holdings Ltd. have highlighted the revenue impact of worsening business conditions.“Everybody is distracted,” said Gurj Sandhu, a managing director at Morgan McKinley Group Ltd. in Singapore. Hiring is falling down the “pecking order,” he said, while adding that nobody is canceling roles yet.Bloomberg spoke with six recruitment firms, all of which confirmed the slowdown. Hiring processes and relocation plans are taking longer at most companies because of logistical difficulties.“Companies are not risking international travel, they are not risking client meetings unless it is critical,” said Bethan Howell, a Hong Kong-based consultant at Selby Jennings Ltd.Closing dealWhile some financial firms are conducting interviews by video conference or phone, closing the deal is more problematic, especially at investment banks and wealth-management units.Bankers are “big-ticket items,” said Hubert Tam, a managing partner at Sirius Partners Ltd. in Hong Kong. Private banks and investment banks are holding off on hiring until they can meet candidates in person, “even if they performed well last year,” he said.What’s more, many private bankers covering China would have to travel to the country to meet clients and “get their blessings” before they move banks, according to Amod Jain, a Morgan McKinley consultant in Singapore. “Not everything can be done by phone.”Selby Jennings’ Howell gave the example of a person scheduled to relocate to Hong Kong from Shanghai for a quant fund. The person may have to work from the client’s Shenzhen office while waiting for a visa, which is taking more time these days, she said.Some recruiters pointed to early signs companies are reconsidering their initial hiring plans for 2020 as the outbreak deals a deeper blow to their operations.A few banks and asset managers are reviewing their hiring budgets for 2020, said Tam from Sirius Partners. Working from home has led to a decline in trading, impacting profits, he said.New headwindsSome lenders are considering whether to hold off on adding headcount for non-essential roles such as back-office functions, according to Mark Li, head of client solutions at Randstad Singapore.The financial services industry in Asia’s biggest hubs was facing economic headwinds even before the coronavirus outbreak because of U.S.-China trade tension, which was affecting recruiting at some firms, Li said. Hong Kong also had to grapple with its months-long protests.The slowdown in hiring is also starting to weigh on recruitment firms. “Financially, we have been impacted because we can’t close enough deals that make the revenues,” Morgan McKinley’s Sandhu said.However, recruiters expressed optimism that new viral infections are slowing, with some lauding the Singapore government for its efforts to contain the outbreak.“It’s still relatively early to see any hiring freeze,” said Nilay Khandelwal, managing director at Michael Page International Pte. in Singapore. “The real extent of impact will be seen in the days to come when new headcount and hiring plans for this year might get revised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/job-offers-delayed-in-asia-s-financial-hubs-in-coronavirus-fallout/story-OkpZt3HccXxzY1rivD7exI.html
20-02-2020||World||US condemns China’s expulsion of Wall Street Journal reporters over controversial headline||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China’s move to revoke the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters over a controversial headline, a decision that comes as Beijing continues to lash out at countries that fault its handling of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.“The United States condemns China’s expulsion of three Wall Street Journal foreign correspondents,” Pompeo said in a statement late Wednesday.“Mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions,” he said. “The correct response is to present counter arguments, not restrict speech. The United States hopes that the Chinese people will enjoy the same access to accurate information and freedom of speech that Americans enjoy.”China made the rare move of punishing multiple journalists at a single news organization after it said the Journal refused to apologize for a “racially discriminatory” op-ed, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday. Foreign journalists need press passes issued by the foreign ministry to qualify for visas to report in the country.China’s rebuke to the American newspaper comes after the Trump administration said this week that Chinese state news outlets operating in the US -- including the official Xinhua News Agency -- should be treated like “foreign missions” as a result of President Xi Jinping’s control over the media. It also came as Beijing continued to condemn criticism over its handling of the outbreak, and called for countries to end flight bans and harsh travel restrictions on Chinese citizens.‘A new low’The Wall Street Journal reported that the three were Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin and reporters Chao Deng and Philip Wen. Chin and Deng are both US nationals, while Wen is an Australian citizen.“This marks a new low in relations between China and the foreign press, and says a lot about Beijing’s broader antipathy to the West,” said Richard McGregor, a former Financial Times bureau chief in Beijing who’s now a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute. “Beijing is looking to lash out at its critics. Once it has gotten over the coronavirus crisis, expect to see more such measures.”While China has declined to approve press credentials for foreign journalists before, it’s rare for authorities to punish three reporters at once from the same news organization. It also sets a worrying precedent for news outlets with staff in China as the article was written by an author based in the US who wrote opinions, which are generally removed from news-gathering operations.China’s economy strains under virus as Beijing steps inThe Feb. 3 article described China as the “sick man of Asia,” a phrase often used by 19th century European powers to describe the weakened state of the Qing Empire, which then governed China. A representative for the Wall Street Journal in Beijing didn’t immediately reply to an email requesting comment.The op-ed ran as China began battling the deadly coronavirus, which has now claimed the lives of more than 2,000 people and delivered a massive setback to the world’s second-biggest economy. The government has described the virus as a threat to “social stability” in China and tightened restrictions on online expression.“The editors used such a racially discriminatory title, triggering indignation and condemnation among the Chinese people and the international community,” Geng told reporters in an online press conference. “China demands the WSJ recognize the severity of its mistake, make an official apology and hold the persons involved accountable.”‘Foreign missions’The three journalists’ visas were canceled and they have been ordered to leave China in five days, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said in a statement. None were involved in the opinion piece or its headline, it said, adding that the move was “an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations.”The FCCC said it’s now aware of nine journalists who were either expelled or did not have their visas renewed since 2013.China expelled a Wall Street Journal reporter last August after the paper published a report detailing allegations that President Xi’s cousin was involved in gambling and potential money-laundering in Australia.The US this week designated five Chinese state media companies as “foreign missions,” a decision that reflects the Trump administration’s view that Xi’s Communist Party is imposing increasingly draconian government-control over news services, senior State Department officials said. The designation requires the outlets to adhere to requirements similar to those imposed on embassies and consulates in the USUS puts restrictions on five Chinese state media outlets“China and the US, and a number of Washington’s allies, aren’t just decoupling parts of their economy,” said McGregor, of the Lowy Institute. “With decisions like these, they are entering parallel news and information universes.”China’s foreign ministry denounced the US designation on Wednesday, saying the country’s media outlets helped promote understanding and adding that Beijing would “reserve the right” to retaliate. “We urge the US to discard its ideological prejudice and Cold War zero-sum-game mentality, and stop ill-advised measures that undermine bilateral trust and cooperation,” Geng said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-condemns-china-s-expulsion-of-wall-street-journal-reporters/story-MVKvYO7WWSZEd9PgiBWLpM.html
20-02-2020||World||Shooting in German city leaves at least 8 people dead: Police||Eight people were killed in shootings in the German city of Hanau on Wednesday evening, authorities said. Two hookah lounges reportedly were targeted.Authorities were searching for the perpetrators early Thursday, three hours after the shootings which took place at about 10 p.m. (2100 GMT).A short police statement gave no information on the victims. It said the motive is not immediately clear.Police said a dark vehicle was seen leaving the scene of the first shooting, and another shooting was reported at a second site.Regional public broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk said, without citing sources, that an attack took place in a hookah lounge in the center of the city. It said witnesses reported hearing eight or nine shots and seeing at least one person lying on the ground.The perpetrator or perpetrators then apparently went to another part of the city, where shots were fired in another hookah lounge, the broadcaster said.Hanau is in southwestern Germany, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of Frankfurt. It has about 100,000 inhabitants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shooting-in-german-city-leaves-at-least-8-people-dead-report/story-Drd9rzPOGcptlIN8xTNEKJ.html
20-02-2020||World||Indian industry, students welcome UK’s new points-based visa system||Indian industry and students’ groups in the UK have widely welcomed the new points-based visa system unveiled by Home Secretary Priti Patel on Wednesday to attract the “brightest and the best” from around the globe.The new post-Brexit policy is pitched as a “firm and fair” mechanism that will treat all migrants equally as the free movement of people from within the European Union (EU) comes to an end from January 1 next year.The magic number of points required to apply under the new system will be 70, accrued in increments of 20 or 10 based on professional skills, English language proficiency, a job offer from an approved sponsor and salary levels between 20,480 pounds and 25,600 pounds or above.Some of the categories will fall under tradable points, such as salary levels and jobs that fall within the shortage occupation list, giving applicants some options to make up a total of 70.“We welcome the Home Office’s proposed new system, which rightly recognises that immigration to the UK should be based on skills, salaries and knowledge of the English language,” said Jim Bligh, Chair of the Confederation of Indian Industry’s (CII) UK-India Business Forum (IBF).“For business, it’s essential that the system retains flexibility for employers, particularly those bringing in highly-skilled workers on short-term assignments to support UK plc’s growth and transformation. It will also be important to ensure salary thresholds are not a deterrent to finding staff with the right specialist skills from around the world,” he said.The tradable aspect of the salary threshold is likely to prove beneficial for Indian professionals, who already make up the largest chunk of skilled worker visas issued by the UK to nationals outside the EU.Baroness Usha Prashar, Chairperson of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), UK, said the changes meet a long-standing business demand.She said: “Majority of the Indian businesses in the UK require skilled manpower. The new point-based immigration system coupled with the lower salary threshold is a positive move. This has been a long-standing demand of FICCI members.“The new system will benefit not just qualified professionals from India but also large number of Indian students in the UK universities.” Student visa routes will also be points-based and bring EU citizens into the same remit as other international students from next year, at the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. A Graduate route announced by the government earlier had brought back a two-year post-study work visa route for overseas students, to allow eligible students to work, or crucially look for work, in any career or position of their choice, for two years after completing their studies from later this year.The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU), which actively lobbied the government on a fairer visa regime that offers international students the chance to gain some work experience at the end of their degrees, believes the new changes are a step in the right direction.“We welcome the points-based system. It feels like a good step towards creating a fair immigration system that meets the need of the British economy but also creates an environment that welcomes talent, particularly scientific talent,” said Sanam Arora, founder and chairperson of NISAU UK.“Genuine Indian applicants with demonstrable skills should considerably benefit. As always though, the proof lies in the pudding and we await clarity over the coming months on details, and also particularly on how the Graduate route fits into the overall points-based system,” she said.The latest announcement follows British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s constant references to moving towards an Australian-style points-based visa system once the UK is free of EU immigration rules as a non-member of the economic bloc. The new regime effectively clamps down on low-skilled workers, aimed at cutting down overall numbers coming into the country – a central pledge of the ruling Conservative Party government.“For too long, distorted by European free movement rights, the immigration system has been failing to meet the needs of the British people. Failing to deliver benefits across the UK and failing the highly-skilled migrants from around the world who want to come to the UK and make a contribution to our economy and society,” notes the Home Office in its policy statement, which will take the form of a new Immigration Bill to be passed by Parliament.“We are ending free movement and will introduce an Immigration Bill to bring in a firm and fair points-based system that will attract the high-skilled workers we need to contribute to our economy, our communities and our public services. We intend to create a high wage, high-skill, high productivity economy,” the Home Office said. The Opposition parties remain critical of the new system, with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott warning that the government did not “appear to have thought through what the effects of this policy will be on the economy as a whole and what message it sends to migrants already living and working here”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-industry-students-welcome-uk-s-new-points-based-visa-system/story-pSbzzASA9KCpFoDVcK0yVP.html
20-02-2020||World||Coronavirus kills two Iranians, first Mideast deaths||Two people have died in Iran after testing positive on Wednesday for the new coronavirus, the health ministry said, in the Islamic republic’s first cases of the disease.According to YJC news agency, a branch of state television, the pair who died were Iranian citizens and residents of the holy city of Qom.They are also the first deaths from the COVID-19 virus in the Middle East and only the seventh and eighth outside China, where the outbreak has killed more than 2,000 people.State news agency IRNA quoted Kianoush Jahanpour, a ministry spokesman, as saying the virus was detected in two elderly people with immunity problems in Qom, south of the Iranian capital.“Following the recent cases of chronic respiratory diseases in Qom, two of the patients tested positive in preliminary tests,” it quoted him as saying.“Unfortunately both passed away in the intensive care unit due to old age and issues with their immune system.”IRNA had earlier quoted Jahanpour as saying that the “new coronavirus” had been confirmed in two people and that other suspected cases were isolated.The state news agency also quoted a media adviser to Iran’s health minister as saying two people had died after testing positive for the coronavirus.“Both of the people who had tested positive for coronavirus were in Qom and were old. Both have passed away,” said Alireza Vahabzadeh.- Quarantine hospitals readied -Qom is a centre for Islamic studies attracting scholars from Iran and beyond.However, the head of the health ministry’s contagious diseases unit said the pair who died were Qom residents who were not known to have left Iran.“These two were from Qom and visited (us) two days ago after falling ill... they didn’t even have a history of going abroad,” IRNA quoted Mohammad Mehdi Gouya as saying.Another official in Qom said people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus would be put into quarantine in two hospitals.Mohammadreza Ghadir, head of the city’s medical sciences unit, told IRNA that “the spread of coronavirus in Qom has been controlled and we want the people not to worry about it.”The new coronavirus has now claimed the lives of eight people outside mainland China.One has died in Japan, one in Taiwan, another in the Philippines and two in Hong Kong. One has also died in France.The United Arab Emirates last month became the first country in the Middle East to report cases of the coronavirus strain. Egypt has also reported cases.Iran’s health sector has been hit by sanctions imposed by the United States since Washington withdrew in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal between the Islamic republic and world powers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-kills-two-iranians-first-mideast-deaths/story-96Sx67djKIJOUa0MPVmELK.html
20-02-2020||World||Scientists announce ‘breakthrough’ atomic map of coronavirus||US scientists announced Wednesday they had created the first 3D atomic scale map of the part of the novel coronavirus that attaches to and infects human cells, a critical step toward developing vaccines and treatments.It came as the death toll from the COVID-19 virus jumped past 2,000, almost all of them in mainland China where 74,185 cases of infection have been confirmed since it first emerged in late December.The team from the University of Texas at Austin and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) first studied the genetic code of the virus made publicly available by Chinese researchers, and used it to develop a stabilized sample of a key part called the spike protein.They then imaged the spike protein using cutting-edge technology known as cryogenic electron microscopy, publishing their findings in the journal Science.“The spike is really the antigen that we want to introduce into humans to prime their immune response to make antibodies against this, so that when they then see the actual virus, their immune systems are ready and loaded to attack,” UT Austin scientist Jason McLellan, who led the research, told AFP.He added that he and his colleagues had already spent many years studying other members of the coronavirus family including SARS and MERS, which helped them develop the engineering methods required to keep the spike protein stable.Their engineered spike protein is itself being tested as a potential vaccine by the NIH.The team is sending the map of its molecular structure out to collaborators around the world so they can improve it by making it provoke a greater immune response.The model can also help scientists develop new proteins to bind to different parts of the spike and prevent it from functioning, to treat those already infected. These are known as antivirals.“This is a beautifully clear structure of one of the most important coronavirus proteins -- a real breakthrough in terms of understanding how this coronavirus finds and enters cells,” said virologist Benjamin Neuman at the Texas A&M University-Texarkana, who was not involved in the work.“The structure shows that although the spike is made of the three identical proteins, one flexes out above the rest, effectively giving the virus a longer reach,” he added.A useful aspect of the structure for vaccine development is that it maps out the size and location of chains of sugar molecules the virus uses in part to avoid being detected by the human immune system, added Neuman.Cryogenic electron microscopy uses beams of electrons to examine the atomic structures of biomolecules that are frozen to help preserve them.Three scientists credited with developing the technology were awarded the 2017 Nobel prize in chemistry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-announce-breakthrough-atomic-map-of-coronavirus/story-Bc4i7WcPZUFAlrGBkXG8vM.html
20-02-2020||World||Sri Srinivasan first Indian American chief judge, to head Washington DC circuit court||Sri Srinivasan has become the first Indian American and Asian to head a US court of appeals after taking over as Chief Judge of the Washington DC circuit from Merrick Garland.Under US rules, circuit courts of appeals - something like the high courts of India in the judicial hierarchy - must be headed by the senior-most judge under the age of 65, and Garland, who is 67, stepped down on February 12, paving the way for Srinivasan, who is 52.The DC circuit court of appeals is often considered the second most powerful court in the United States after the Supreme Court, and has been a stepping stone to the highest court. Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama, but Republicans blocked it by denying him a confirmation hearing in the senate that they controlled then, as now. Obama had considered Srinivasan for that nomination also before going with Garland. The Indian-descent judge, who was born in Chandigarh, is widely expected to be named to the apex court at some stage, possibly by a Democratic president — he was named to the DC circuit by Obama.Srinivasan joined the DC circuit in 2013. His swearing in was attended by then prime minister Manmohan Singh’s wife Gursharan Kaur and the family; their families have been friends from their days in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-srinivasan-first-indian-american-chief-judge-of-washington-dc-circuit-court/story-YhXogZFQaVXpGLWdvSLtUO.html
