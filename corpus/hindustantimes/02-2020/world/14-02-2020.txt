But there were plenty of other White House and National Security Council officials who had been tasked to listen in as a matter of practice. Among them were NSC’s expert on Ukraine Lt Col Alexander Vindman and the vice-president’s national security aide Jennifer Williams, both of whom testified before the House intelligence committee during the impeachment inquiry and said they had found the president’s conversation inappropriate and concerning.Trump had pressed Zelensky in that call to investigate former Vice-President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination to contest against Trump in November, and his son Hunter Biden who had held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company during his father tenure.Trump had been had held up $391 million in military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with the president to force the issue.Though Trump insisted the call was “perfect, the House impeached him last December for abusing the powers of his office for personal benefit and obstruction of congress’s investigation into it. The Republican-led senate voted to proposal to remove him from office and acquitted him of both charges in earlier this month.Barrs fails to bar Trump’s tweetingIn a rare public rebuke of the president, Attorney General William Barr on Thursday told an interviewer that Trump’s tweeting made “it impossible for me to do my job”. He was referring to the case of Roger Stone, a long-time confidant of the president. The department of justice had recommended a lesser sentence for him than the one submitted earlier by the case’s prosecutors, shortly after Trump had complained about it.“I think it’s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,” Barr said.Trump ignored the rebuke and was back at it Friday morning sating he had the “legal” right to intervene in criminal cases as president and that he hasn’t done so yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-stop-officials-from-listening-in-calls-with-foreign-leaders/story-mieszIYoTLDifgeIWvmkgM.html
14-02-2020||World||What makes Covid-19 a global public health enemy?||Coronavirus, which emerged from Wuhan city in China’s Hubei province in December last year, quickly spread across the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) took time to declare it a health emergency (it did so weeks later), and later named it Covid-19. The virus has caused 1,380 deaths, has infected 63,851 people and spread across 28 countries. In the middle of rumors and reports, here is all you need to know about the virus. What is Covid-19? It is a new strain from the coronavirus family (hence the initial name novel coronavirus or n-CoV) which affects the respiratory system in humans. Other examples of the virus are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome or MERS. It has only recently been renamed,Covid-19, inspired from words “corona”, “virus”, and “disease”, with 2019 representing the year that it emerged. This virus that causes flu-like symptoms , such as dry-cough, fever, and breathing problems. It probably seems mild in some cases, like that of an Australian student who contracted the virus on Diamond Princess, the ship quarantined off the coast of Japan. Such cases may have a fairly quick recovery rate like one patient, out of the three who were initially tested positive for Covid-19 in Kerala, whose diagnosis later turned negative. In more severe cases, patients may have underlying health conditions and then go on to develop viral-phenomena. This strand of coronavirus, much like others, came from animals. Illegal trading of pangolin is suspected to be the cause for the entrance of Covid-19 into human species. How did Covid-19 spread?The virus was first identified in China, at Wuhan on December 31st. Covid-19 is airborne and transmitted by people sneezing or coughing. Someone can either swallow the virus or touch a surface where the virus is with their hands, and then touch their mouth & nose with the same. The advancements in international transportation systems and excessive globalization have made it easy for Covid-19 to hop into a host’s body to travel far and beyond. Evidence of this phenomenon is the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship initially carrying 3,711 passengers, now has about 174 identified cases of the disease. Outside Mainland China, the ship is the largest cluster of Covid-19. There are two Indian citizens among those tested positive on the ship quarantined at a dock in Yokohama, Tokyo since February 3rd. The ship is said to be under Japanese jurisdiction until February 19th, 2020 and it is unclear if and what Indian authorities are going to do after that. What is the economic threat? Global pandemics are very costly for human society and have only gotten pricier with the increasing interconnectedness of the international economy. For example, SARS caused losses in productivity estimated over $40 billion. Though, right now, there are no estimates about how much Covid-19 is going to cost the global economy in total, businesses, big and small, are suffering its effects. Handset manufacturer Vivo and chipset maker Intel, along with some other prominent brands, have pulled out of the Mobile World Congress 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. This is an important event that creates over 14,000 part-time jobs in Barcelona. Giants like Airbnb and Apple have also been impacted. Airbnb has suspended check-ins to all Beijing listings until March and Apple’s prime manufacturer Foxconn is producing under 50% until the end of February. Lack of tourism and fall in demand of general commodities because of quarantine efforts has also adversely affected small business in China.There have been mounting concerns about the impact that continuing spread of the disease would have on China’s economy. One reason why, President Xi was reported to have cautioned officials to not go overboard with imposing restrictions. President Xi, according to a Reuters report, felt they had already gone too far. Any impact of the virus on the Chinese economy would have a ripple effect that would be felt far away including on, oil prices, as China is the world’s largest importer. The politics around Covid-19Given the virus’s ‘global’ footprint, it may be impossible to contain it without support from different international parties. The World Health Organization has been heavily involved with the Chinese government to prevent further spread of the disease and to hunt for a potential cure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conveyed solidarity with the Chinese President Xi in the form of a letter. In the same, he expressed appreciation for the measures taken by the Chinese government to restrict the spread of the virus.United States President Donald Trump has also congratulated President Xi on his efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. Trump claimed “...(that) during the month of April, the heat, generally speaking, kills this type of virus.” This remark has been condemned by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The US State Department moved out almost 300 U.S. citizens, from Wuhan, on February 6st. However, Tedros Adhanom, head of WHO, has advised against the evacuation of foreigners. Response by India and its neighbours 600 Indians were flown back to the country from Wuhan by the government on January 31th and February 1st. They were housed in two quarantine centres, one in Delhi and one in Manesar. According to Vikram Misri, Indian Ambassador to China, the whole evacuation process was a ‘strategic nightmare’. Passengers coming from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Nepal into India are being screened at all major sea and land ports. There are now two positive novel coronavirus cases in India in the state of Kerala currently undergoing treatment. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has criticized the Centre for not giving the Covid-19 outbreak graver attention. Bangladesh has decided not to fly back its 171 citizens due to internal issues. Pakistan, a country that’d initially decided not to evacuate the 800 Pakistani students living in Wuhan, is now reconsidering its course of action after coming under pressure by quarantined students on social media. “The matter is being considered at the high level and best possible decision would be taken after considering all possible aspects. Rest assured that we care about you,” said Zafar Mirza, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health, on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-what-makes-covid-19-a-global-public-health-enemy/story-dMXCdarnDcSfzpHel2bpNJ.html
14-02-2020||World||Antarctica registers record temperature of over 20 degrees||Scientists in Antarctica have recorded a new record temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius (69.35 Fahrenheit), breaking the barrier of 20 degrees for the first time on the continent, a researcher said Thursday.“We’d never seen a temperature this high in Antarctica,” Brazilian scientist Carlos Schaefer told AFP.He cautioned that the reading, taken at a monitoring station on an island off the continent’s northern tip on February 9, “has no meaning in terms of a climate-change trend,” because it is a one-off temperature and not part of a long-term data set.But news that the icy continent is now recording temperatures in the relatively balmy 20s is likely to further fuel fears about the warming of the planet.The reading was taken at Seymour Island, part of a chain off the peninsula that curves out from the northern tip of Antarctica.The island is home to Argentina’s Marambio research base.Schaefer, a soil scientist, said the reading was taken as part of a 20-year-old research project on the impact of climate change on the region’s permafrost.The previous high was in the 19s, he said.“We can’t use this to anticipate climatic changes in the future. It’s a data point,” he said.“It’s simply a signal that something different is happening in that area.”Still, he added, a temperature that high had never been registered in Antarctica.Accelerating melt-off from glaciers and especially ice sheets in Antarctica is helping drive sea level rises, threatening coastal megacities and small island nations.The news came a week after Argentina’s National Meteorological Service recorded the hottest day on record for Argentine Antarctica: 18.3 degrees Celsius at midday at the Esperanza base, located near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.The previous record stood at 17.5 degrees on March 24, 2015, it said. It has been recording Antarctic temperatures since 1961.The past decade has been the hottest on record, the United Nations said last month, with 2019 the second-hottest year ever, after 2016.And 2020 looks set to continue the trend: last month was the hottest January on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antarctica-registers-record-temperature-of-over-20-degrees/story-tV12gBydmd0Pd4Hrdn1McL.html
14-02-2020||World||China happy about India’s offer to fight coronavirus, blanks it out from list of donor countries||China on Friday said it “appreciates” India’s offer of help to fight the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, soon after it blanked out New Delhi from an official list it released naming the 57 countries, which have either sent assistance or even offered aid to Beijing to contain the epidemic.The puzzling lack of a clear acknowledgment from Beijing, and sending out a mixed message instead, comes in the backdrop of a letter written by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to President Xi Jinping where the Indian leader offered assistance to China.At an online briefing on Friday afternoon, the Chinese foreign ministry released the 57-country list comprising 33 countries that had given medical supplies, 17, which had offered to provide the same and seven more that had offered money and material aid.The list also named international organisations, which had donated supplies.The list was updated as of 12 noon Friday, the ministry said, profusely thanking the donor countries.India wasn’t named among those 57 countries.In a written response to questions from HT hours later, the ministry said something else. Well, almost.“After the outbreak of the new coronary pneumonia, President Xi Jinping received a letter of condolence from Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. State councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi had a telephone conversation with Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar,” the brief statement in Chinese said.“The Indian side highly appreciated the strong measures taken by the Chinese government to deal with the epidemic. China appreciates India’s willingness to provide support and help to China in the fight against the epidemic,” the statement added.The foreign ministry response didn’t address a direct question from HT: Why wasn’t India’s name not on the list of the 57 countries?Details of Modi’s offer aren’t public but it is learnt that India has reiterated it through a formal written note indicating India’s intention to send an “aircraft load of assistance”.Details, it’s learnt, are being worked out for an Indian air force aircraft with medical supplies to fly to China next week.Official sources in Beijing had confirmed earlier this week that one of the two Air India aircraft deployed to evacuate Indians from Hubei and Wuhan, the province and city worst hit by the escalating epidemic, in early February had carried dozens of boxes of supplies.Beijing hadn’t acknowledged that either.India’s name wasn’t in the list of 21 countries the foreign ministry had released on February 6, naming the nations that had donated epidemic prevention supplies.It’s not clear whether Beijing’s lack of acknowledgement is the symptom of seemingly sour bilateral ties.However, Chinese state media have lately carried articles and opinion pieces criticising India in the context of the outbreak.The nationalistic tabloid, Global Times, which is affiliated to the Communist Party of China’s mouthpiece, People’s Daily recently carried a report accusing Indian hackers of targetting Chinese medical institutions during the ongoing health crisis.Another opinion piece in the same tabloid pointed out India’s ban on the export of medical protective clothing after the epidemic broke out in China, and how New Delhi suspended e-visas for the Chinese.The opinion piece didn’t mention that India had subsequently waived the ban specifically for a handful of China-based importers to purchase the same from Indian companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-happy-about-india-s-offer-to-fight-coronavirus-blanks-it-out-from-list-of-donor-countries/story-HefYe7phZetVfldizduF5H.html

Turkey will continue to stand by justice, peace and dialogue in the resolution of the Kashmir issue,” the president said.The Turkish President, in his address, likened the “struggle” of the Kashmiris with that of his country in the World War I against foreign domination.Drawing comparison with the battle of Gallipoli which was fought in Turkey between the Allied Powers and the Ottoman Empire in which over two lakh troops were killed on the both sides, Erdogan said “there is no difference between Gallipoli and Kashmir”.“Turkey will continue to raise its voice against the oppression,” he told Pakistani lawmakers in his address to the National Assembly and Senate, which was his record fourth address to the Pakistani Parliament over the years.In September last year, Erdogan raised the Kashmir issue during his address at the United Nations General Assembly.Reacting to his remarks in the UN, India said it “deeply regrets” the statement of Turkey on the Kashmir issue, and termed it an internal matter.External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar called upon Turkey to have a proper understanding of the situation in Kashmir before making further comments.India revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5. Reacting to India’s move, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner.India has always maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is its integral part and ruled out any third party mediation, including either from the UN or the US, saying it is a bilateral issue with Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-raises-kashmir-in-pak-parliament-says-issue-close-to-both-countries-pulwama-february-14-valentine/story-LYRVPPJzcjRafndSwbZiHN.html

14-02-2020||World||1716 medics infected, 6 dead, China finally reveal weeks into coronavirus outbreak||More than 1700 medical workers have been infected and at least six have died fighting the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak in China, health officials revealed for the first time on Friday.At least 87 percent of the 1716 were working at hospitals in Wuhan, at the epicentre of the outbreak.The rate of infection among doctors and nurses is increasing, a senior health official said, further confirming that the pathogen is highly contagious.The epidemic has so far killed 1,381 people and infected nearly 64000 in China.Weeks into the outbreak, the information was released Friday following the publication of medical research papers and unconfirmed media reports, which said the rate of infection among frontline medics was high and raising questions why the government wasn’t releasing the numbers.The figures were disclosed by China’s national health commission’s (NHC) vice minister, Zeng Yixin at a press conference in Beijing.“A total of six medical workers had died as a result of Covid-19 as of Tuesday, accounting for 0.4% of the total fatality rate; there are 1,716 infected medical workers in total, 3.8 percent of all infections,” Zeng said.“At present, the duties of medical workers at the front are indeed extremely heavy; their working and resting circumstances are limited, the psychological pressures are great, and the risk of infection is high,” Zeng said.More analysis needed to be done on how many of the medical workers were infected in hospitals, Zeng said. The figure for the number of medial workers who had died was as of Tuesday.Among the six medics who have died so far was Li Wenliang, a doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about the disease in December.Li later contracted the disease and his death triggered a wave of public anguish this month and rare expressions of anger with the government.The infection rate among medics and the deaths also bring to focus the conditions under which they are working – amid a massive shortage of medical supplies and protecting clothing.Chinese authorities had allocated 25.94 billion yuan ($3.71 billion) by Thursday to improve working conditions of medical staff fighting the novel coronavirus, said a finance official Friday.Ou Wenhan, assistant minister of finance, made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing, adding that the money was used to purchase medical equipment and protective materials and upgrade facilities in medical institutions.“Each frontline medical and epidemic prevention worker would receive a subsidy of 300 yuan or 200 yuan per day according to different risk levels, which would be fully covered by the central fiscal,” said Ou was quoted as saying by the state media.Among the earliest warn about infection among medics was a research paper published in the medical journal JAMA last week.Conducted by Chinese doctors working at a Wuhan hospital on 138 patients, their research data revealed hospital-related transmissions of the virus were suspected in about 41% of the patients.Specifically, 40 health care workers in the study and 17 patients who were already hospitalised for other reasons were presumed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus in the hospital.It exposed the risks under which medics were working at hospitals in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1716-medics-infected-6-dead-china-finally-reveal-weeks-into-coronavirus-outbreak/story-lpb3oaRwbcS3sBrvNLFmKP.html
14-02-2020||World||Turkey to oppose Pakistan blacklisting at FATF meet||Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said he would help Pakistan stay off a terrorism financing blacklist at a meeting of a global finance watchdog, a move he suggested would counter “political pressure” from Islamabad’s critics.The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which tackles money laundering, told Islamabad late last year that it could face blacklisting if it continued to apply inadequate controls over terrorism financing.The FATF is meeting next week in France, and support from Turkey and longtime allies like China, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia could help Pakistan remain off the blacklist. A minimum of three votes are required for any country to escape the blacklisting.If it joined the blacklist alongside Iran and North Korea, Islamabad would face sanctions and economic setbacks at a time when its economy is struggling with a balance of payment crisis.“We will be supporting Pakistan at the Financial Action Task Force meetings, where Pakistan is subject to political pressure,” Erdogan told Pakistan’s parliament a day after he arrived in Islamabad.The FATF already has Pakistan on its “gray-list” of countries with inadequate controls over curbing money laundering and terrorism financing.But its arch-rival India, which came close to war with its nuclear-armed neighbour last year, wants Pakistan blacklisted.Of 40 recommendations made by the watchdog, Pakistan had fully complied with only one, largely complied with nine, partially complied with 26, and totally missed four parameters, which were mandatory if Islamabad wanted to be removed from the gray-list, a review by the group last year said.The FATF says Pakistan should adequately identify, assess and understand risks associated with militant groups operating in Pakistan such as Islamic State group, al-Qaeda, Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which continue to raise funds openly.Pakistan says it has made a significant improvement on the requirements since the last review.Islamabad says it has seized the groups’ assets and put the militants on trials, like the entire leadership of the JuD, including its chief Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks in India, which killed 166 people.In a move praised by Washington as an important step forward, Saeed was jailed for 11 years on Wednesday on terrorism financing charges.Pakistan remained committed to the earliest completion of its FATF action plan, Minister for Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar tweeted on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-to-14-feb-oppose-pakistan-blacklisting-pulwama-at-fatf-meet-valentine/story-QbIGs1qZIS4ElnjWyO3RDN.html

Talking about life on the ship, he said he spends his days mostly taking photos of each meal and posting them anonymously on Twitter. The man did not reveal his name due to privacy concerns.Others, however, has been compiling regular food reviews on Twitter. One of them is Matthew Smith. Another home run for Princess food service.

Courtesy the Japan's Ministry of Health etc. pic.twitter.com/6n6DgksouqA law student, meanwhile, described how it feels to contract the virus.“Honestly, it just felt like your everyday cold. Like, I feel absolutely fine now, physically,” Bianca D’Silva, a law student in Australia, told a local TV channel. “I had a bit of headache before and just a slight fever but that’s about it, honestly,” said the 20-year-old who was taken off the ship and to a hospital along with her mother.Some crew members who’ve tested positive for the virus are restaurant, bar or housekeeping staff who most likely had contact with passengers until February 5 when the first test results were released and restaurants and bars were closed.“Until the quarantine started, everything was business as usual, and everyone was freely moving around on board, so there are various possibilities of infection during that time,” said Kazuho Taguchi, director of global health cooperation at the health ministry. Crew members still share rooms, as the number of cabins for them is limited, Taguchi added.Guests must often change their own sheets, clean their bathrooms and do their own laundry because contact with the crew has been limited since the first 10 cases were confirmed on board.The boat has added more movies and TV channels to try to help with the boredom. People without balconies are allowed to walk on the deck for about an hour each day, as long as they keep 6 feet (2 meters) apart. Passengers chat and wave to each other from their balconies.A couple from Syracuse, Cheryl and Paul Molesky, can be seen in their YouTube videos lounging, often in plush bathrobes, on their balcony in the boat, enjoying the sweeping views of a glittering, sun-streaked ocean and, on occasion, snow-capped Mount Fuji. The ship has a sushi restaurant, Japanese style bath and theater, but passengers are now mostly confined to their rooms.Authorities in Japan say isolating people on board is the way to prevent the disease’s spread; other experts say the measure could create more infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-felt-like-everyday-cold-student-describes-catching-the-coronavirus/story-P3YSttnAPNgGIR6bEL4MmN.html

Massimiliano Martigli Jiang, an Italian-Chinese, stood blindfolded and with a mask in Italy’s Florence with a message board which read “I am not a virus, I am a human being, free me from prejudice”.Jiang lives in Florence and was touched by the responses he got. Many people hugged Jian, and some even removed the blindfold. He uploaded a video of the people’s reaction on his Facebook page and Instagram.  A post shared by Massimiliano Martigli Jiang (@massi_jiang) on Feb 6, 2020 at 4:31am PST“This video was one of those things that didn’t make me sleep the day before, it put me anxiety while waiting for filming, during and all the moments later. But now. Thanks to your beautiful words, you made me cry so much!” he wrote on Facebook. The video, uploaded more than a week ago, has been widely shared in Italian media.He also cheered the people of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of coronavirus outbreak. “Come on Wuhan - Come on China,” Jiang said in his Facebook post.China has put Wuhan and other cities where the virus has spread, under unprecedented lockdown. The diease is now officially known as Covid-19.There has been a spike in reports of anti-Chinese rhetoric directed at people of Asian origin, regardless of whether they have ever visited the centre of the epidemic or been in contact with the virus.Chinese tourists have reportedly been spat at in the Italian city of Venice, a family in Turin was accused of carrying the disease, and mothers in Milan have used social media to call for children to be kept away from Chinese classmates.In Canada, a man was filmed telling a Chinese-Canadian woman “you dropped your coronavirus” in the parking lot of a local mall.In Malaysia, a petition to “bar Chinese people from entering our beloved country” received almost 500,000 signatures in one week.“It’s a common phenomenon,” said Rob Grenfell, director of health and biosecurity for Australia’s science and research agency CSIRO. “Sure it emerged in China,” he said of the coronavirus, “but that’s no reason to actually vilify Chinese people.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned against “measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade”, but this has not stopped scores of countries from introducing travel bans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-i-am-a-human-not-a-virus-italian-man-s-anti-racist-campaign-wins-hearts/story-TjPtY2eNE0ZUTKlTY5WoAK.html
14-02-2020||World||Thousands of new Covid-19 cases in China as Hubei locks up people inside homes||The authorities in China’s Hubei on Friday morning reported that 113 more people had died from the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak until last midnight, pushing the country-wide death toll to at least 1380 deaths.The rise in number of cases comes amid the city of Huanggang, hard hit by the novel coronavirus in Hubei, issuing an order Thursday to “…put all residential communities and areas on lockdown as the city upgraded virus prevention and control measures.”“A notice issued by the municipal epidemic control headquarters said that starting from Friday, all residents will not be allowed to exit and re-enter their communities or residential areas as the city took the strictest and most effective control measures.Daily necessities for residents will be handed out by the community committees, and purchasing services will be provided for urgently-needed goods,” state media reported.This comes after another county in Hubei, Shiyan, implementing similar “war time” measures to contain the virus.Tens of millions remain under lockdown in Wuhan, facing severe restrictions on day-to-day living.Nearly 65000 people in China are now infected with Covid-19, which is said to have emerged from a seafood and meat market in the provincial capital of Wuhan in December.It has now spread to more than two dozen countries, killed at least three outside the Chinese mainland and infected nearly 450 globally.The spike of nearly 20000 new cases and over 370 deaths in the past two days has been attributed to a change in the definition of the disease to include “clinically diagnosed cases” in the list of the infected.The term “clinically diagnosed case” refers to cases with clinical symptoms similar to those of confirmed cases before laboratory tests have confirmed or determined the infection.This means that a suspected case will be clinically diagnosed – and added to the infected column of people -- as long as the patient shows pulmonary lesions typical of the new coronary pneumonia following a CT scan even if they have not been given a nucleic acid test.Only Hubei province - which accounts for more than 80% of overall Chinese infections - is using the new definition to diagnose new cases.The WHO has said there’s no dramatic increase in the number of Covid-19 cases outside China.The increase within China – in Hubei specifically – is because of the tweak in definition, the Geneva-based organisation has said.Meanwhile, a total of 189 medical teams of 21,569 medical workers had been sent to Hubei to help combat the outbreak, according to the national health commission (NHC).“To further support medical work in Hubei, more than 1,000 doctors, 1,681 nurses and 213 experts from 17 provincial-level regions including Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi, were dispatched on Wednesday to 16 cities and prefectures other than the provincial capital city of Wuhan, such as Enshi and the Shennongjia forestry district, to assist with the local anti-epidemic fight, the official news agency, Xinhua reported.Another 2,600 military medical staff were also sent to Wuhan on Thursday, Guo Yanhong, an official with the NHC, said at a press conference on Thursday in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-china-as-hubei-locks-up-people-inside-homes/story-Q7M0Ykn4DmVmF6c87j3ByL.html

Way to rub it in!” Passengers on board were being offered a “Valentine’s Day” breakfast, Smith said.“We were reminded what day it was by the delivery of what the crew member said was a ‘special’ breakfast,” he said.“Not sure why hard-boiled eggs, sausage, and sauteed mushrooms are special.” The dinner menu, on the other hand, promises several special treats in honour of the day.“Cupid’s Avocado and Shrimp salad” to start, followed by “Shrimp Valentine Japanese style with rice and vegetables.” The main course is the French classic Coq au Vin with mashed potato and vegetables, and a “Valentine’s Day surprise dessert of the day” is promised.“Coq au Vin, yes please,” tweeted Yardley Wong, who has been posting her efforts to keep her young son entertained on the quarantined vessel.“A special meal for Valentine’s Day, a reserved bottle of red,” she added, with her usual hashtag #hanginthereDiamondPrincess and a picture of a bottle of wine.She also posted a drawing by her six-year-old son for Valentine’s Day, with the caption “Stay strong, we are with you Diamond Princess.” American passenger Jackie joked that she had big plans for Valentine’s Day on the cruise, which has proved far from the gala holiday everyone planned.“We’re going to have a formal night on Valentine’s Day in our cabin. Take some pics, have some laughs,” she tweeted.Another passenger cut out paper hearts and left them on her door for the crew to read, with messages including: “Thank you for all your hard work” and “Thank you for taking care of us.” More than 200 people on board the ship have been diagnosed with the newly named COVID-19 and taken to local hospitals. Those remaining on board will be in quarantine until at least February 19.While passengers are battling isolation, fear and boredom, some members of the crew have voiced concerns about their conditions, including eating together and sleeping two to a cabin.But the coronavirus has also ripped some couples apart for Valentine’s Day, including at least one on their honeymoon.Kent Frasure was forced to say goodbye to his partner Rebecca, who has contracted the virus and is now in isolation in hospital.“We said ‘goodbye, see each other later’ and gave each other a hug. We didn’t have a goodbye kiss because we didn’t really know what was going on,” Kent told CNBC.“Then I watched her walk down the hallway, turn the corner and then she was gone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/didn-t-have-a-goodbye-kiss-man-aboard-quarantine-japanese-cruise-on-v-day/story-JufdO4AnQX2KaXcO3nzQXI.html
14-02-2020||World||IMF asks Pakistan to cut ‘trade and commerce reliance’ on China||The visiting IMF mission has asked Islamabad “to reduce its trade and commerce reliance on Beijing” and look for other international options by signing free trade agreements (FTA) with other countries too, a media report said on Friday.The development comes as the mission has extended its stay in Pakistan for making more efforts to strike a consensus on the staff-level agreement as both sides so far persisted with their respective differences on “immediate measures” for reducing the revenue-expenditure gap and fixing cash bleeding energy sector, The News International said in the report. Official sources confirmed to The News International on Thursday night that both sides were busy ironing out differences over revenue generation efforts as the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) wants a further reduction in its revised target of 5,238 billion Pakistani rupees but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) desires to see the plan aimed at removing distortions and expanding narrowed tax base on a permanent basis. According to senior Finance Ministry sources, the issue of discord between the IMF and financial authorities is the former’s insistence to cut down heavily of Pakistan’s reliance on trade and commerce ties with China and contract FTAs with other international partners. This is a position Islamabad is not prepared to even consider.Although, the Ministry of Finance and other officials claimed in their background discussions that there was no “deadlock” and the staff-level agreement would be finalized anytime soon. But when they were asked to share details, they were non-committal saying that the talks were underway, so nothing could be stated with credence.The mission arrived in Islamabad on February 2 for an 11-day second review of Pakis­tan’s performance under the $6 billion bailout package signed in July 2019 amid a massive revenue shortfall in the first seven months of the current fiscal year, Dawn news said in a report last week.The completion of the review against a significantly modified 39-month programme in November 2019 would determine if the government would secure disbursement in March of another tranche of about $450 million direly needed to build market confidence and foreign exchange reserves. Pakistan has so far secured about $1.44 billion through an upfront release of about $991 million last July and the first instalment of about $452 million in December.The review is taking place at a time the government has suffered a revenue shortfall of about $2 billion in the first seven months of the current fiscal against the target of $17 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-asks-pakistan-to-cut-trade-and-commerce-reliance-on-china/story-AJFdLzEIEkULiQU6cautIO.html
14-02-2020||World||China’s coronavirus death toll nears 1500, over 64000 infected||Death toll in China’s coronavirus epidemic has gone up to 1,483 with Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, reporting 116 new fatalities, the country’s health officials said on Friday. The hard-hit province reported 4,823 new confirmed cases on Thursday, the provincial health commission said.The new cases included 3,095 clinically diagnosed ones which have been considered as confirmed, state run Xinhua news agency reported. The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in the province to 51,986, the report said. The new cases have pushed the number of infections in the country to 64,627 in total. The National Health Commission has not yet announced the nationwide figures. On Thursday the commission had announced 254 fatalities as authorities adopted a new diagnosis method amid concerns. Of the total deaths, 242 were from Hubei province and 12 from other provinces. The World Health Organization on Thursday had said that a sharp rise in reported COVID-19, (official name for coronavirus) cases in China was due to a change in counting methods and it did not represent a big shift in the epidemic. “This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme told a press conference in Geneva. “We’re not dealing, from what we understand, with a spike in cases of 14,000 on one day,” he said. “This increase that you’ve all seen in the last 24 hours is largely, in part, down to a change in how the cases are being reported,” he said. Ryan also said that he expected members of a WHO-led international mission to arrive in China over the weekend. A 15-member advance WHO team already reached China on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-1500-over-64000-infected/story-DoX1eK3XuidC1vorEpN4RI.html
14-02-2020||World||Pentagon shifts $3.8 billion more to Mexico border wall||The US Defense Department said Thursday it is shifting another $3.8 billion towards paying for a wall on the US-Mexico border as President Donald Trump extended his “national emergency” declaration over unlawful migration for another year.Pentagon officials said the money would be used to build about 177 miles (285 kilometers) of the concrete and steel barrier Trump wants to deter migrants from entering the country illegally.That will bring to a hefty $9.9 billion the total amount the US military has been forced to divert to border wall construction over the past two years as Trump seeks to overcome Congress’s repeated refusal to provide the funding.The Pentagon called the money a contribution to the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to combat drug trafficking.But Trump has made clear that the barrier targets migrants from the south.The wall construction “will allow DHS to fulfill the president’s border security policy promise,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses.“The Corps of Engineers, under the direction of the Secretary of the Army, is ready to contract and construct the border barrier.”Trump declared a national emergency last year to overcome Congress’s resistance and draw federal budget funds already allocated to other needs for the wall.In a new White House order Thursday, that emergency was extended through February 2021, despite a sharp decline in migrants crossing the border from Mexico illegally. “The ongoing border security and humanitarian crisis at the southern border of the United States continues to threaten our national security,” the order said.“Further action is needed to address the humanitarian crisis and to control unlawful migration and the flow of narcotics and criminals across the southern border of the United States.”Last year opponents of the wall sued to block the use of military funds, and a judge placed a stay on any spending pending a hearing on the case.But in January an appeals court lifted the stay and allowed the Trump administration to go ahead and deploy the Pentagon funds for the project.Election promiseThe $3.8 billion announced Thursday was to be culled from various programs for buying tactical vehicles for the Army National Guard, vessels for the Navy, and combat and transport aircraft for the Navy and Air Force.Trump promised to build the wall along most of the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) US-Mexico border -- paid for by Mexico -- during his 2016 presidential campaign.After he was elected however he sought some $25 billion from Congress but was repeatedly rebuffed amid opposition to his harsh stance against undocumented migrants already living in the country.Meanwhile the number of illegal border-crossers detained soared as hundreds of thousands of migrants poured into the US, mostly from Central America, seeking asylum.A crackdown and changes in policy that made it far more difficult stay in the United States after submitting an asylum request has seen border apprehension numbers plunge in recent months.The figure stood at fewer than 37,000 last month, from more than 58,000 a year earlier.Salesses told reporters it was possible that the Pentagon could also be asked to divert money from its own construction projects to the border this year.“I am aware of ongoing discussions, but no decisions have been made,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-shifts-3-8-billion-more-to-mexico-border-wall/story-JdoN8qQlRLKrwukTPckiZJ.html
14-02-2020||World||In win for Amazon, judge freezes work on Pentagon contract||A federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary halt of Microsoft’s work on a $10 billion military cloud contract, a win for Amazon, which sued the US government last year for awarding the contract to its rival.Amazon’s lawsuit, filed in November, alleged that President Donald Trump’s bias against the company hurt its chances to win the project. Amazon and Microsoft were finalists for the lucrative contract, for which Amazon was considered an early front-runner.The project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, will store and process vast amounts of classified data. It’s intended to improve the Pentagon’s communications with soldiers on the battlefield and would use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities.Pentagon officials have said the work would be important to advancing the US military’s technological advantage over adversaries.Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Robert Carver said in a statement that the department was disappointed in the ruling that delayed changes “and deprived our warfighters of a set of capabilities they urgently need.” But he said the Pentagon remained sure of its decision to choose Microsoft.Microsoft echoed the disappointment in a statement Thursday, but said it believes that it will ultimately be allowed to move forward with the project. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Charles Tiefer, a government contracting law professor at the University of Baltimore, called the order to stop work on the project “striking,” noting that judges typically halt work on contracts when they see some merit in the case.Earlier this week, Amazon asked to question Trump for its case. In July, Trump publicly stated that other companies told him the contract “wasn’t competitively bid,” and he said the administration would “take a very long look” at it. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has long been a target of Trump; the president calls the Bezos-owned Washington Post “fake news” whenever it publishes unfavourable stories about him.In arguments making a case for Trump’s deposition, Amazon sought to fit Trump’s actions on the JEDI contract into a broader pattern of interference. That included the president’s role in a border wall contract, his push to block AT&T’s acquisition of CNN parent company Time Warner and his impeachment by the House of Representatives over his dealings with Ukraine.Two government watchdog groups, Protect Democracy and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed legal briefs in the case this week supporting the call for depositions of Trump and other officials.Microsoft opposed Amazon’s request for depositions in a court filing this week, arguing that Amazon “is grasping at straws to find support for its baseless allegations.” Microsoft, arguing that government contract professionals did their jobs properly regardless of Trump’s tweets, said Amazon “impugns, demeans and discredits government personnel at all levels, despite the utter absence of any support for their accusations.”Amazon asked the court to halt work on the project last month. Both the documents requesting the work stoppage and the judge’s decision Thursday to issue the temporary injunction are sealed by the court.A public court notice, however, confirmed the injunction on the Pentagon and noted that Amazon will have to establish a security fund of $42 million that will be used to pay damages if the court later finds the injunction was improper. No further details of the decision were immediately available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-win-for-amazon-judge-freezes-work-on-pentagon-contract/story-VxHt6IyhYku7Lt57eaoHkL.html
