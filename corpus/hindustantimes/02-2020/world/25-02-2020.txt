25-02-2020||World||Hundreds of tourists under lockdown in Tenerife hotel over Covid-19||Hundreds of people were confined to a Tenerife hotel Tuesday after an Italian tourist was hospitalised in a suspected case of coronavirus, officials in Spain’s Canary Islands said.“Hundreds of hotel clients are being monitored for health reasons.. but so far, we’re not talking about quarantine,” a health authority spokeswoman told AFP, saying the Italian tourist “was staying at this hotel while on holiday in Tenerife”.The archipelago’s health authorities said late on Monday that an Italian man had tested positive for coronavirus and was being kept in isolation while his results undergo a second analysis in Madrid as required by Spain’s protocol for suspected cases of the disease.The results are expected late on Tuesday and until then “the guests will remain in the hotel,” Spanish government spokesman Maria Jesus Montero told a news conference.“Depending on the results of the test, appropriate measures will be taken,” she added.The tourist is reportedly a doctor from Italy’s northern Lombardy region where several people have died from the virus. He and his wife, who have both been hospitalised, had been staying at the four-star H10 Costa Adeje hotel on the island’s southwestern coast. Outside the hotel, which overlooks the sea, a handful of local and national police could be seen standing around wearing masks and purple protective gloves, the entrance cordoned off by plastic tape, footage from one of the hotel guests showed. Some guests could be seen sunbathing outside by one of its pools.- Hand sanitiser empty -“We were told to stay in our rooms however it does not seem like people are following this,” a British guest at the hotel told AFP by telephone, without giving his name. “Absolutely bizarrely the hotel canteen opened for breakfast. All the staff were wearing face masks and the bottle of hand sanitiser at the entrance was empty,” said the man, who had been due to fly home on Tuesday but will now miss his flight. Another British tourist who also refused to be identified said hotel guests had received a notice telling them to stay in their rooms.“We regret to inform you that for health reasons, the hotel has been closed down. You must remain in your rooms until the health authorities say so,” said the text in Spanish, English, French, Italian and German, a copy of which was sent to AFP.Travel firms Tui and Jet2holidays both use the H10 Costa Adeje hotel for package holidays, with Tui having around 200 guests there.Ashotel, the association of hoteliers on Tenerife, said around 1,000 people were at the hotel and called for calm, saying the establishment was “following all the steps laid out in the protocol”.- Two confirmed cases -The scare came as hotels across the Canary Islands were packed with guests who had flown in for the traditional February carnival festivities. Spain is the second-most visited country in the world after France and tourism is crucial for the domestic economy, accounting for around 12 percent of its gross domestic product.Spain had so far registered two confirmed cases of coronavirus, both in foreign tourists.The first case was that of a German man on La Gomera island in the Canaries who tested positive on January 31 followed by a British man who tested positive in Mallorca in the Balearic Islands on February 9. Both recovered.Seven people in Italy have so far died after catching the virus, making it the hardest-hit country in Europe. In China, where the virus first appeared, the virus has killed more than 2,600 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-hundreds-of-tourists-under-lockdown-in-tenerife-hotel-over-covid-19/story-ZKIIu8ChaIG26chYphehzJ.html
25-02-2020||World||German police investigate driver’s motive for ploughing into crowd at recent Carnival||German authorities scrambled Tuesday to determine the motives of a man who ploughed his car into a carnival procession, injuring dozens and further unsettling a country rocked by a fatal mass shooting last week.In an afternoon statement, police said the number injured had now reached “almost 60” and asked those hurt in the incident or with possible evidence to come forward.Investigators said the 29-year-old German driver had not been drunk at the time of the incident on Monday, but could not yet rule out that he was under the influence of drugs, national news agency DPA reported.The suspect has still not been questioned because of his own injuries, a police spokesman told reporters near the scene of the incident in Hessian town Volkmarsen.Among the injured in the ramming were 18 children aged from just three years.It followed just days after a gunman with suspected racist motives killed nine people with migrant backgrounds in Hanau, also in western Hesse state, prompting fears of a repeat attack.Officials cancelled all carnival parades across the state Monday, while a children’s procession was called off Tuesday in state capital Wiesbaden.But authorities have stopped short of calling the incident an attack until they know more about the driver’s motives.“I saw him drive off, he looked as if he was on drugs and said ‘soon I’ll be in the papers’,” a neighbour of the suspect told German broadcaster RTL.Nevertheless, prosecutors in Frankfurt have opened an investigation on suspicion of attempted homicide.Prosecutors said they had also arrested a second person who filmed the car rampage, citing a privacy law against gawkers.- ‘Children lying on ground’ -Eyewitnesses described how the man ploughed his silver Mercedes at high speed through a barrier and into crowds at the traditional “Rose Monday” parade in Volkmarsen, a small town in Hesse state.“My wife called me and I ran out there straight away. I saw my daughter lying bleeding on the ground,” 33-year-old Sven Hirdler told mass-market daily Bild.Hirdler’s four-year-old child Emilia escaped with relatively light injuries and a concussion.On Tuesday morning, carnival floats and balloons were still in place around Volkmarsen, while emergency vehicles remained at the scene as the perpetrator’s car was hauled away.Hessian police said that among the injured, 35 remained in hospital while 17 had already returned home.- Climate of fear -As in many parts of the country, residents in Volkmarsen were celebrating Rose Monday, a highlight of annual carnival festivities that sees adults and children dress up and attend parades where people play music and throw candies from floats.The party, traditionally celebrated mostly in western Germany, had been a welcome relief for a country shaken by Wednesday’s deadly Hanau shootings.The rampage fuelled concerns over the country’s increasingly emboldened far-right scene, after a pro-migrant politician was murdered in June and an anti-Semitic attack on a synagogue left two dead in the city of Halle last October.Meanwhile the sight of a car ploughing through crowds recalled Germany’s deadliest terror attack in recent history, when a jihadist drove his truck into a crowded Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 people in December 2016.The attacker, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.After the Hanau shootings, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer on Friday vowed to put more police at mosques, train stations, airports and borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-police-investigate-driver-s-motive-for-ploughing-into-crowd-at-recent-carnival/story-HRkmks8L46ZUW0sDMUUqRI.html
25-02-2020||World||IAF’s relief flight for coronavirus-hit Wuhan to reach Wednesday, bring back remaining Indians||The Indians stranded in coronavirus-ground zero Wuhan are likely to be evacuated Wednesday night in an Indian air force (IAF) transport aircraft that’s coming in with medical supplies to help China fight the outbreak.For the second time within a week, the Indian embassy in Beijing sent out a social media message to the Indians in locked down Wuhan -- where the covid-19 is said to have originated -- to be ready for departure tomorrow.About 90 had registered for the evacuation flight. Until Monday midnight, 2666 had died and nearly 77800 infected in China, the majority in Hubei and Wuhan. The last time the same message was sent to the anxious Indians, the embassy had to rescind it, saying a technical issue had forced postponement.That technical issue was Beijing’s reluctance in handing out a unique clearance number required for foreign aircraft to land in China.Beijing is learnt to have given the required clearance for the transport aircraft to land in Wuhan on Monday after keeping New Delhi waiting for more than a week.Usually, such clearances are given within 48 hours.The embassy’s message on Tuesday was cautious – seemingly keeping a window partially open for another round of postponement.“We are working on our plan to operating the relief flight tomorrow (February 26) evening/night,” it told the Indians.“Embassy representatives who are already in touch with individually will directly advise you regarding the exact time of pick up. We are making arrangements for your pick up and onward movement to Wuhan airport by vehicles hired by the Embassy”.“You are requested to prepare for departure tomorrow morning bearing in mind the points mentioned in the advisory already issued on this group.”“Kindly note that these arrangements are still tentative, and subject to change. We appreciate your understanding,” the embassy message pointed it out to the Indian nationals.India has already evacuated 674 Indians from the central Chinese of Hubei, and its capital, Wuhan, earlier this month in two special Air India flights; seven Maldivians had also taken the same flight out of Wuhan.Those who will be evacuated Wednesday night will have to go through similar a 14-day quarantine period in two different facilities after reaching New Delhi.All the Indians from the last two rounds of evacuation had tested negative for the coronavirus.New Delhi and Beijing had a few terse exchanges in the run-up to the third round of evacuation of Indians from Wuhan with the former saying China had deliberately delayed it.It is not easy to put a finger on the reason behind the delay – Beijing has denied any delay on its part – but the number of extra days it took for the clearance to be given could have been because of India’s ban on the export of anti-epidemic protective clothing when China, facing a massive shortage in Hubei, needed it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iaf-s-relief-flight-for-coronavirus-hit-wuhan-to-reach-wednesday-bring-back-remaining-indians/story-nYFtnbVSV7NedQV2XDsJJP.html
25-02-2020||World||Britain’s finance minister Rishi Sunak in Twitter storm over a tea brand||A tweet by Rishi Sunak, Britain’s new Indian-origin chancellor of the exchequer, showing him preparing tea for his team working on the forthcoming budget, has blown into a storm, with those opposed to Tory politics subjecting him and a tea brand to much abuse.Sunak, 39, was the surprise appointment in the February 13 reshuffle by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The key post, equivalent to India’s minister for finance, is one of the most high-profile roles in the UK government, with the chancellor based in Number 11, Downing Street.“Quick Budget prep break making tea for the team. Nothing like a good Yorkshire brew”, Sunak, who is MP from Richmond (Yorkshire), tweeted, with an image of a large bag of Yorkshire Tea, a popular brand that sources tea from Assam, among other gardens. Quick Budget prep break making tea for the team. Nothing like a good Yorkshire brew. pic.twitter.com/zhoQM9KshoThe company, however, soon received boycott calls. Sunak’s past in the world of finance was also raked, as twitteratti dissected the image showing six cups, and commented on the Conservative government’s budget policies.Taken aback at the level of abuse, Yorkshire Tea insisted it had nothing to do with the image.It said: “On Friday, the Chancellor shared a photo of our tea. Politicians do that sometimes (Jeremy Corbyn did it in 2017). We weren’t asked or involved – and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same”.“It’s been pretty shocking to see the determination some have to drag us into a political mudfight…We’ve spent the last three days answering furious accusations and boycott calls. For some, our tea just being drunk by someone they don’t like means it’s forever tainted, and they’ve made sure we know it”, the company added, asking people to “try to be kind”.Sunak, one of four Indian-origin MPs around Johnson’s cabinet table, is not the only one to face charges after the reshuffle. Home secretary Priti Patel was the subject of reports claiming the intelligence agencies were withholding information because they did not trust her.Downing Street had to intervene to assert that Johnson had full confidence in Patel, who also faced accusations of bullying officials and trying to allegedly remove the top civil servant in the Home Office.According to an expert in the think-tank Institute for Government, Business secretary Alok Sharma allegedly did not have the required expertise or seniority to do justice to the role of president of COP26 to be held in Glasgow later this year, to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders.Attorney-general Suella Braverman, the fourth Indian-origin MP in the cabinet, was the subject of a report that claimed she had links to a Buddhist sect whose founder reportedly faced charges of being a serial sexual predator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-finance-minister-rishi-sunak-in-twitter-storm-over-a-tea-brand/story-zmzWVnwiTryiEEZuqckl1M.html
25-02-2020||World||‘Reduction in violence’ week continues in Afghanistan despite Taliban attacks||A partial, week-long truce between the Taliban, American and Afghan forces held tenuously for a fourth day Tuesday, despite several insurgent attacks and the US hitting Islamic State targets.If the so-called “reduction in violence” continues, the United States and the Taliban are expected to sign a historic deal in Doha on Saturday that would see the Pentagon pull thousands of troops from Afghanistan after more than 18 years of war.While the agreement doesn’t amount to a full ceasefire -- the insurgents insist it only covers certain urban and military areas -- the number of Taliban attacks has fallen dramatically. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an Afghan security source said Taliban attacks had dropped from an average of 75 a day to about 15 since the truce began on February 22.But underscoring the fragility of the situation, the interior ministry said five security personnel were killed in three attacks in rural areas Tuesday.Meanwhile, US forces announced the death of four IS members in two airstrikes in Kunar province.IS are not part of the “reduction in violence” and are being separately pursued by the US and the Taliban.They first became active in Afghanistan in 2015 and for years held territory in the eastern province of Nangarhar, while claiming responsibility for a string of horrific bombings, including in Kabul.The jihadists have complicated negotiations between the US and the Taliban. While the Taliban want all American forces out, the Pentagon insists thousands must remain in Afghanistan to tackle IS and other jihadist groups.“We continue to eliminate ISIS terrorists wherever they hide to protect Afghanistan while honoring US-Afghan-Taliban agreement to reduce the violence,” US Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Sonny Leggett said on Twitter.The Afghan government said in November that its forces had largely defeated IS, but many of the group’s members fled from Nangarhar to bordering Kunar in pursuit of safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reduction-in-violence-week-continues-in-afghanistan-despite-taliban-attacks/story-vNWpaYf0yDarh8p35KQRrN.html

25-02-2020||World||Iran’s deputy health minister tests positive for coronavirus||Iran’s deputy health minister confirmed on Tuesday that he has tested positive for the new coronavirus, amid a major outbreak in the Islamic republic.Iraj Harirchi coughed occasionally and wiped sweat from his brow repeatedly during a news conference in Tehran on Monday with government spokesman Ali Rabiei.At the time, he denied a lawmaker’s claim that 50 people had died from the virus in the Shiite shrine city of Qom, saying he would resign if the number proved accurate.In a video broadcast on state television, the deputy minister put on a brave face as he admitted he was infected.“I too have been infected with coronavirus,” Harirchi said in the video apparently shot by himself.“I had a fever as of last night and my preliminary test was positive around midnight,” he said.“I’ve isolated myself in a place since. A few minutes ago, I was told that my test was final, and now I am starting medication.- ‘Virus does not discriminate’ -“I wanted to tell you that... we will definitely be victorious against this virus in the next few weeks,” Harirchi declared.But he warned Iranians to be careful as the “virus does not discriminate” and infects anyone, regardless of their standing.Following news of Harirchi’s infection, government spokesman Rabiei, who stood by his side on Monday, appeared at another news conference on Tuesday with the country’s industries minister and other officials.A prominent Iranian reformist politician, Mahmoud Sadeghi, also announced he had tested positive for the virus.“My coronavirus test was positive. I send this message but I don’t have much hope of staying alive,” Sadeghi said in a tweet.He used the occasion to call on the judiciary to provide prison leave time to those detained over political and security charges so that “they can go through this epidemic with their families”.Iran confirmed three more deaths and 34 new infections on Tuesday, taking the country’s overall death toll to 15 and infection tally to 95.The Islamic republic has been hit by the deadliest coronavirus outbreak by far outside China, the epidemic’s epicentre.- Quarantine an ‘old method’ -According to the health ministry, most of the deaths and infections outside Qom are among people who have recently visited the holy city.The ministry’s spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 16 of the new cases were confirmed in Qom, while nine were in Tehran, and two each in Alborz, Gilan and Mazandaran.The virus appeared to be spreading to new parts of Iran, as one new case was also reported in the provinces of Fars and Khorasan Razavi, as well as Qeshm island.Despite being the epicentre of the outbreak in Iran, Qom has yet to be quarantined.Health Minister Saeed Namaki defended the decision on Tuesday and said that quarantine was an “old method”.“We still do not agree with quarantining cities since we believe the people are cultured enough to refrain from travelling from infected cities to other places,” semi-official news agency ISNA quoted him as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-iran-s-deputy-health-minister-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-xC227eGNJqvb97Y4DZbLJM.html
25-02-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak death toll reaches 2666 in China as new cases fall, global figures cross 80,000 mark||The coronavirus outbreak has killed 2666 people and infected nearly 77800 people in China, health officials here have said with the global figures for those sickened by the pathogen crossing the 80000 mark in more than 30 countries on Tuesday.China’s national health commission (NHC) on Tuesday said more than 500 new cases and over 70 deaths were reported until midnight before.The good news was that no new confirmed cases of covid-19 were reported Monday in 23 provincial-level regions on the mainland, including Shanghai and Tianjin, the NHC said.Only nine new confirmed cases were reported Monday outside the province of Hubei, epicentre of the outbreak.The NHC added that until Monday midnight, a total of 27,323 patients infected with the novel coronavirus had been discharged from hospital after recovery.“China’s daily number of newly cured and discharged novel coronavirus patients has surpassed that of new infections for the seventh consecutive day,” the NHC was quoted as saying at the daily morning briefing.The Hubei province, however, will continue to take the most stringent prevention and control measures, the NHC said.The province of nearly 60 million has been under a lockdown for nearly a month.The eastern Chinese city of Qingdao, where a large number of South Koreans stay and is also a popular tourist destination for them, announced that it was adopting a stricter epidemic prevention policy, asking foreign visitors to either undergo a 14-day home quarantine or stay in designated hotels, as infection numbers in South Korea soared tenfold in less than a week. State media reports said Qingdao in Shandong province has begun “…to arrange for designated vehicles to pick up all foreign visitors arriving in Qingdao and send them to their homes for a 14-day mandatory quarantine. Foreigners coming for short-term visits or business travel will be sent to designated hotels, Qingdao government announced.” Meanwhile, the falling number of cases is prompting the government to gradually plan the road back to normalcy with focus on cranking up manufacturing and reopening factories.China’s top planning body, the national development and reform commission (NDRC) on Tuesday said China will classify regions -- outside epicentre Hubei and capital city Beijing -- into low, medium, and high-risk areas based on the extent and severity of the local covid-19 epidemic situation.“County-level administration regions outside Beijing and Hubei Province will be categorized into three classes, namely low, medium, and high-risk regions,” Ou Xiaoli, an NDRC official said.“Regions with a low-risk classification will resume overall normal life production, and lift transport restrictions. Governments of these regions should help companies address challenges and problems including the lack of employment and raw materials,” the commission noted.Several Chinese localities have or plan to lower their emergency responses towards the coronavirus outbreak, official news agency, Xinhua reported Tuesday.Since late January, all provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland have activated top-level emergency responses to the novel coronavirus, cancelling mass events, closing scenic attractions and suspending long-distance buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-death-toll-reaches-2666-in-china-as-new-cases-fall-global-figures-cross-80-000-mark/story-1fn2BCyqG5t3QPF7rxATZL.html
25-02-2020||World||Hosni Mubarak, Egypt’s ousted ‘Pharaoh’ President, dies at 91: Report||Hosni Mubarak, who became Egypt’s longest-serving ruler in more than 150 years before being forced from office by a popular uprising, has died. He was 91.His death was announced Tuesday by state TV. No cause was mentioned, although his family recently said he’d been hospitalized.Dubbed the “pharaoh” by his detractors, Mubarak had ruled for 30 years and was widely accepted to be preparing his younger son Gamal as successor when the Arab Spring surged into Cairo in January 2011. After 18 days of mass protests, he was gone, his image of an all-powerful ruler shredded.Mubarak attended his trial for the killing of more than 850 protesters by security forces in the final days of his regime in a hospital bed and faced other serious charges, but was only found guilty of fraud and avoided serving additional time in jail. In photographs, a man famously known for jet-black dyed hair and swagger was seen seated, tired and graying.Military CareerMohammed Hosni Said Mubarak was born on May 4, 1928, in Kafr El Meselha in the Nile Delta. Opting for a military career when Egypt was still a monarchy, he entered the Air Force Academy in 1950. Four years later, King Farouk was overthrown in a coup led by Gamal Abdel Nasser.In 1964, Mubarak was appointed head of the Egyptian military delegation to the Soviet Union, the sole supplier of weapons to Nasser’s regime. From 1967 to 1972, he served as air force chief of staff, became deputy minister for military affairs and was promoted to air marshal after the 1973 Arab-Israel war.After Nasser’s death, Egypt was led by President Anwar Sadat, who appointed Mubarak as vice president in April 1975, effectively designating him as heir apparent. That succession came earlier than expected, with Sadat gunned down by Muslim fundamentalists on Oct. 6, 1981, during an annual parade marking the 1973 war anniversary. Sadat was killed while Mubarak, seated next to him, escaped with a hand wound.Mubarak cracked down on violent groups and went on to govern in a low-key, stolid style that contrasted with the glitter of the Sadat years.“Having Sadat as president was like being married to Miss World,” Layla Takla, an opposition member of parliament, said at the time. “It was great for a while, but then you needed someone to do the cooking and look after the children.”Suppressed RivalsWhile Mubarak provided some room for dissent -- within specific red lines that included no criticism of his family -- he failed to follow through on pledges to open the country’s political system. Suppression of a wide array of perceived rivals, under an emergency law promulgated in 1981, marked his years in power and helped fuel the discontent that led to his downfall.In the late 1980s, the country was on the verge of bankruptcy when it stopped paying its foreign debts. It was only when Mubarak agreed to send forces as part of the U.S.-led coalition to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1990 that creditors agreed to write off debts.In 2004, Mubarak appointed a government that revived the sale of state assets. By 2009, it attracted more than $40 billion of foreign direct investment in industries such as oil and gas, and telecommunications. Emirates Telecom Corp. and Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo SpA were drawn to the country.Out of TouchBut critics saw him as out of touch with the lives of most Egyptians -- embracing the elite while the poor were left to grapple with an inflation rate that reached more than 20% in 2008. His supporters blamed explosive population growth and the economic mismanagement of past administrations for the ills of a nation that grew to 85 million people by the time of Mubarak’s ouster.Egypt’s per-capita gross domestic product in 2009 was $2,160, almost identical to $2,155 a decade earlier, according to International Monetary Fund data.Mubarak never backtracked on the policy of diplomatic rapprochement with Israel, though his only visit to the Jewish state was for the funeral of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. He managed to restore links with fellow Arab rulers who were enraged by Sadat’s decision to sign a peace treaty with Israel.“There isn’t among us anyone who wants to take the region back to the destruction of war or to the phase of no war and no peace,” he told Arab leaders in 1996. “We are sincerely determined to struggle for peace until the end.”Key AllianceHe also retained Egypt’s alliance with the U.S., which began with Sadat’s noisy break with the Soviet Union. Egypt receives about $1.3 billion a year in U.S. military aid.Mubarak presided over several years in which domestic Islamic extremism flared in Egypt. In 1997, violence reached a zenith when 58 foreign tourists in Luxor were gunned down. The massacre, which harmed Egypt’s tourism industry, turned many Egyptians firmly against religious violence.The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that had renounced violence in the 1970s, gained in popularity amid dissatisfaction over corruption and economic inequality.His experiences at home prompted warnings to his allies. In September 2001, he chided the West for failing to take terrorism seriously, warning that serious events were imminent. A few days later, on Sept. 11, al-Qaeda struck the U.S.‘Gates of Hell’Mubarak opposed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, warning that “the gates of hell” would be opened in the Middle East. He argued that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be tackled as the first step to regional peace.He tried to end the rivalry between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas, an Islamic movement that took over the Gaza Strip in 2007 but faced criticism at home and in several Arab countries for keeping Gaza’s border largely closed as Israel sealed its frontier with the coastal enclave.It was his ever-tighter grip on domestic freedoms that proved his undoing.In 2005, Mubarak had opened presidential elections to multiple candidates. Yet the regulations were so restrictive that no strong challengers emerged; the runner-up, lawyer Ayman Nour, won only 7% of the vote to Mubarak’s 88%. After the election, Nour was jailed for four years on fraud charges that human-rights groups say were trumped up.Muslim BrotherhoodIn elections later that year, the Muslim Brotherhood won 88 seats in the 454-member parliament -- a surprise result that prompted a crackdown on Islamic activists and on anti-Mubarak secular politicians, judges, newspaper editors, bloggers and street demonstrators. Hundreds of Brotherhood activists were rounded up and some put on trial in closed-door military courts.His fall came at the hands of an unexpected coalition of opposition parties, the Brotherhood and, most poignantly, a youth movement whose Facebook and Twitter-driven demonstrations mobilized the streets.Mubarak never officially designated anyone as his likely successor, only appointing intelligence chief Omar Suleiman as vice president in January 2011 in a bid to diffuse mounting protests. The rise of his son, Gamal, up the ranks of the ruling National Democratic Party led Egyptians to conjecture that he’d succeed his father.Instead that job went, briefly, to Islamist President Mohamed Mursi and then after a 2013 military-backed revolt to former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who has dragged Egypt back to the brand of autocracy mastered by Mubarak.Mubarak is survived by his wife, Suzanne Thabet, and sons Gamal and Alaa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hosni-mubarak-egypt-s-ousted-pharaoh-president-dies-at-91-report/story-b80cSMDMef8iwIS0otWAqL.html
25-02-2020||World||Quiet after two day firing in and around Gaza||Calm returned on Tuesday after a two-day flare-up in and around Gaza between Israel and Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad that raised fears of an escalation a week before an Israeli general election. The Israeli military reported no rocket fire from the territory during the morning and AFP correspondents in Gaza reported no Israeli strikes.Islamic Jihad announced a ceasefire on Monday evening but later briefly backtracked, accusing Israel of breaching it.As with other Gaza truces, there was no official Israeli confirmation.In a statement on Tuesday, the army said people in cities near the Gaza Strip could return to work and lifted restrictions on public gatherings.Road and rail routes were reopened, but 65,000 pupils remained off school. The main border crossing between the Palestinian enclave and Israel reopened for medical cases only, the Israeli defence ministry said. - 80 rounds fired -Islamic Jihad, the second largest militant group in Gaza after dominant Islamist movement Hamas, fired more than 80 rockets and mortar rounds towards Israel after the army killed one of its fighters allegedly planting a bomb on the border on Sunday morning.The Israeli army removed the militant’s body with a bulldozer, with video of the extraction triggering widespread anger.Most of the ensuing fire was intercepted by Israeli air defences and there were no reports of casualties. One rocket hit a playground but it was empty at the time, the army said.Israeli fighter jets and helicopters responded with strikes on Islamic Jihad targets across Gaza, as well as in neighbouring Syria.Sunday’s fighting was the most intense between Israel and Islamic Jihad since November, when Israeli air strikes killed senior commanders from the group. That three-day flare-up saw 35 Palestinians killed and more than 100 wounded, according to official figures.There were no Israeli deaths despite hundreds of rockets being fired from Gaza.Islamic Jihad did not accept a wider truce Hamas agreed with Israel in late 2018 and renewed after successive flare-ups last year.Under the truce, Israel has allowed Hamas ally Qatar to provide fuel for Gaza’s sole power station and million of dollars for cash payouts to the needy, among other relaxations of its more than decade-old blockade in exchange for a let-up in the violence. Hamas and Israel last fought a full-scale war in 2014, but smaller flare-ups have been relatively common.- Israeli election looms -On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is battling for re-election on March 2 in the shadow of an impending corruption trial, threatened an “extensive campaign” to end the rocket fire.The election, Israel’s third is less than a year, is on track to be another close contest between Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud and the centrist Blue and White Party led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz. Gantz has repeatedly accused Netanyahu of being too soft in his responses to aggression from Gaza. On Monday, the Blue and White leader vowed that if he is elected prime minister, Israel “will strike Hamas, Jihad and any other terrorist element with might, in unconventional ways, and anytime”.“We will restore deterrence with force,” he said. Netanyahu, who has long accused Gantz of relying on Israel’s Arab minority for support, seized on comments by the head of the Arab-led Joint List that it would not support any government that attacked Gaza.“While the Israeli Defence Forces protect Israeli security, Gantz’s partner slams them,” Netanyahu tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quiet-after-two-day-firing-in-and-around-gaza/story-9AMBsjmhr7MCFCEI9qy17I.html

Japan has confirmed 850 cases, the third highest number behind China and South Korea.Basic measures announced Tuesday to fight the illness include urging people to wash their hands carefully, follow “cough etiquette” and avoid going out when feeling unwell. They also urge people with mild illness to go to family doctors instead of hospitals with specialized virus-control facilities, which are treating many seriously ill patients.In a country known for long working hours blamed for “karoshi,” or death from overwork, the virus scare may help change Japan’s corporate culture and allow people to work more flexible hours and ask for time off when they are not feeling well.“In order to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus, commuting in shifts and teleworking need to be widely exercised across society,” said Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama. “We will call on the corporate world to actively implement (the measures).”Flexible working hours are mainly aimed at reducing the risk of getting infected on packed trains, but companies are also encouraged to “create an environment where employees can ask for sick leave when they are feeling unwell,” Kajiyama said. He said the trade ministry began flexible hours on Tuesday and is promoting teleworking.Japan’s case total includes 691 people infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Yokohama near Tokyo. Abe’s government has been widely criticized after the quarantine of the ship was seen to have failed to stop the virus from spreading. Four former passengers on the ship died and more than a dozen people who were evacuated by their home countries later tested positive for the virus. Six government officials involved in the quarantine effort also contracted the virus.Japanese health officials and government experts have acknowledged the quarantine was not perfect, but have defended it. They said Japanese health authorities faced tough challenges in the absence of established rules in such a crisis and that it wasn’t feasible to quarantine the ship’s passengers and crew elsewhere.While the ship quarantine was capturing global attention, the virus was spreading across Japan as many tourists visited the country during the Lunar New Year holiday, experts said. At least 160 of Japan’s cases are not related to the ship and have occurred even in remote areas such as Hokkaido, Wakayama and Kumamoto.Japan allowed about 1,000 mostly Japanese former passengers from the cruise ship to go home if they did not share a room with a virus patient, tested negative and had no symptoms at the end of the ship’s 14-day quarantine. About 100 who infected roommates on the ship were moved to a government facility for an extended quarantine.One former passenger who went home tested positive for the virus later. On Tuesday, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament that 28 of the former passengers have developed fevers and other symptoms since returning home, though they have not been confirmed to be infected by the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-flexible-working-hours-key-to-fighting-covid-19-japanese-prime-minister-shinzo-abe/story-9U0YMv57n0OlyWrEe0q43K.html

That demand remains,” Linde said in a statement.Gui Minhai, one of five Hong Kong-based booksellers who fell foul of the authorities for selling critical works on top Chinese leaders, was snatched while on a train to Beijing in February 2018, the second time he disappeared into Chinese custody.A court in the eastern city of Ningbo said Gui was convicted on Monday on charges of illegally providing intelligence abroad.The court also said that he had his Chinese citizenship reinstated in 2018 but it was not immediately clear if he had given up his Swedish nationality.Gui first vanished in 2015 while on holiday in Thailand and eventually surfaced at an undisclosed location in China, confessing to involvement in a fatal traffic accident and smuggling illegal books.His supporters and family have claimed his detainment is part of a political repression campaign orchestrated by Chinese authorities.Relations between Sweden and China have been strained for several years over Beijing’s detention of Minhai, and Sweden has repeatedly called for his release.Chinese ambassador to Sweden Gui Congyou in November threatened “countermeasures” after Sweden’s culture minister awarded a rights prize to Gui Minhai. Two Chinese business delegations to Stockholm were subsequently cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/want-china-to-release-bookseller-gui-minhai-says-swedish-foreign-minister/story-jQirMW1LXxDrPIDoIPP0eP.html

The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it.The latest figures reported by each government’s health authority as of Tuesday in Beijing:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-covid-19-has-infected-over-80-000-people-globally/story-3tEZw9abMXCeh2hmYtmjiN.html

People feverishly stocking up on instant noodles and rice. Friends calling each other and asking if they’re still alive.Fears of a soaring viral outbreak are gripping the South Korean city of Daegu and the surrounding area, with residents struggling as they try to stay away from a virus that has already sickened hundreds of people in the region, killing at least 10 of them.“I’m also a human being and scared of contracting the virus,” Choe Hee-suk, a 37-year-old office worker in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people in the country’s southeast, said by phone. “We call each other here and half-jokingly ask whether they are alive and tell each other not to wander around.”The region hadn’t reported a single case until Feb. 18, when a Daegu woman in her early 60s tested positive for the virus that first emerged in China, becoming the area’s first patient.But a week later, over 790 cases have been reported there, a sudden jump that has prompted concerns that the outbreak is getting out of control.The Daegu region accounts for over 80% of South Korea’s nearly 1,000 virus cases and all of its deaths. South Korea has seen the largest outbreak of the virus outside mainland China, which has confirmed more than 77,660 cases and over 2,660 fatalities.More than half of the cases in the Daegu area are linked to a controversial church that is viewed as a cult by mainstream Christian organizations.The region’s first patient is a member of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus who had attended services before being diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus. Authorities say it’s unlikely that the woman, who has no record of recent overseas travel, set off the chain of infections.As South Korea’s central government vows all-out efforts to contain the region’s outbreak, public anxiety is destabilizing everyday lives and threatening to seriously impact the local economy.In Daegu’s usually bustling Dongseongro commercial district on Monday, only a few pedestrians were seen, making it look like a ghost town. Workers dressed in black protective gear and white masks sprayed disinfectant at a nearly deserted branch of the popular Lotte Department Store, local media photos showed.Oh Sang-hak, a taxi driver, said he hadn’t worked for several days because he was uneasy about picking up strangers with the virus circulating in the city.“It’s like time has stopped ... and there is just no movement,” Oh said. “Until last week, we thought the coronavirus was someone else’s problem.”Lee Nag-hyeon, 63, said he thinks media reports on virus fears in Daegu have been a bit exaggerated. But he said he saw a masked woman wearing a pair of disposable gloves when he took a subway on Monday. He said he also heard about convenience store staff wearing goggles when dealing with customers.Daegu residents posted photos on social media of supermarket shelves devoid of staples such as instant noodles, curry and dried laver.On Monday, people wearing masks stood in long lines outside an Emart discount store in Daegu’s Mancheon district as they tried to stock up on face masks, which have also been quickly selling out online.Choe, the office worker, said she had three boxes of ramen, four boxes of cereal and three 20-kilogram (44-pound) bags of rice at her home. Lee said he began writing on his masks the dates he last wore them to re-use later, when there are no more available for sale.At Daegu’s Gyodong traditional market on Monday, about half of the roughly 1,000 shops were closed, with the number of visitors declining recently by more than 90%.“Maybe it would be better for all the merchants to shut their doors, but their means of a living are here. So some have made the difficult decision to open their shops,” said Ahn Sook-hee, an official at an association of merchants at the market.The virus is also changing the scenes at weddings and funerals, events that typically draw large crowds in South Korea.At Daegu’s Gangbug Convention wedding hall, only two of the 10 scheduled wedding ceremonies were held over the weekend, with the other eight couples postponing their big day at the last minute. A typical wedding ceremony would draw around 200 people, but the two held on Saturday had only about 50 each, according to wedding hall employee Park Ye Jin.At both ceremonies, everyone except for the bride and groom were required to wear masks. “We didn’t let anyone enter the hall if they didn’t wear masks,” Park said.She said most guests left without eating any of the food set up at the banquet reception.Ahn said that all of her planned gatherings of relatives and friends had been canceled, and that she recently skipped a funeral and just sent condolence money to the bereaved family. Lee said that even if a loved one of a close friend were to die, he wouldn’t go to the funeral — an event he would feel obligated to attend in ordinary times.Choe said her family canceled her father’s 70th birthday party, which was scheduled to take place at a Daegu restaurant this past Saturday with about 30 guests.“We just had barbecues at home, and my father was very disappointed,” Choe said, adding that her family plans a more formal party for him at home later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-you-still-alive-coronavirus-fears-grip-south-korean-city-daegu/story-lvLcSK7BZjbKmWclHDx3uJ.html
25-02-2020||World||Two Turkish soldiers killed in Libya: President Erdogan||Two Turkish soldiers have been killed in fighting in Libya, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday as he also defended Ankara’s move to also send Syrian opposition fighters to the North African country.Erdogan’s remarks followed reports that as many as 16 Turkish soldiers may have been killed in the fighting in Libya since last April, reports that the Turkish leader did not address.Turkey, which backs the U.S.-supported Libyan government that is based in Tripoli, has sent Turkish military trainers as well as Syrian fighters to battle against rival Libyan forces under commander Khalifa Hifter, who in April launched an offensive to capture Libya’s capital.Erdogan had said on Saturday that a “few” Turkish soldiers have been killed in Libya but did not say how many. That angered Turkey’s opposition, which claimed the government was not disclosing military losses in Libya.The head of mobilization for Hifter’s forces, Khaled al-Mahjoub, had claimed that their fighters killed at least 16 Turkish soldiers who were taking part in the fighting in and around Tripoli since April.Hifter’s forces also said that a Turkish military officer, an intelligence officer and their Syrian interpreter were killed in artillery shelling that targeted a ship that was about to unload a weapons cargo at the Tripoli port earlier in February.The Syrian opposition fighters fought along Turkish forces in Ankara’s various offensives in Syria.“They are with us in Syria. And these brothers who are with us in Syria consider it an honor to be with us there (in Libya) too,” Erdogan said.The United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia, support Hifter’s forces. The embattled Tripoli administration, which controls just a shrinking corner of western Libya, has increasingly relied on Turkey for military aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-turkish-soldiers-killed-in-libya-president-erdogan/story-fvjFodm7FUR3P5KSn1GZ2M.html
25-02-2020||World||UAE limits flights to Iran over fears of Covid-19 outbreak||Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, said Tuesday that the United Arab Emirates is limiting flights to Iran over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, just a day after it spread across multiple Mideast nations from the Islamic Republic.The UAE, home to long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, remains a key international transit route for Iran’s 80 million people. While Dubai International Airport said flights to Tehran would continue under close watch, it shows the growing concern over the spread of the virus in Iran amid worries the outbreak may be larger than what authorities there now acknowledge.Emirati officials declined to comment or confirm the airport’s announcement. There was no immediate acknowledgement from Iran of the decision as well.In a statement to The Associated Press, Dubai International Airport said it would follow an order issued by the country’s General Civil Aviation Authority.“All flights to and from the Islamic Republic of Iran, with the exception of Tehran, have been suspended until further notice,” the airport said. “All passengers arriving on direct flights from Tehran will receive thermal screening at the airport by (the) Dubai Health Authority and its airport medical center team.”Emirates, the government-owned carrier based in Dubai, flies daily to Tehran. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its low-cost sister airline, FlyDubai, said its flights to Isfahan, Lar, Mashhad and Shiraz had been cancelled. FlyDubai will continue its twice-weekly flights to Tehran.Sharjah-based low-cost carrier Air Arabia, which also flies to multiple Iranian cities, did not respond to a request for comment.The airport’s announcement came after Bahrain said it would suspend all flights from Dubai and Sharjah, a neighboring UAE emirate that is home to Air Arabia, for 48 hours. Officials at Sharjah’s airport could not be immediately reached.Bahrain’s Health Ministry on Tuesday raised the number of infected cases from the new virus to eight, saying that all had traveled from Iran via Dubai. Four of them have been identified as Saudi nationals. The cases were confirmed upon arrival to Bahrain during screenings at the airport, and prior to the suspension on flights to Dubai and Sharjah, according to Bahrain’s official news agency.Dubai has been screening passengers on incoming flights from China, where the outbreak began in December. Long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad are among the few international airlines still flying to Beijing. However, the outbreak in Iran only became public in recent days.The novel coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally, causing around 2,700 deaths, mainly in China. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it.Iran’s government said Monday that 12 people had died nationwide from the new coronavirus, rejecting claims of a much higher death toll of 50 by a lawmaker from the city of Qom that has been at the epicenter of the virus in the country. The conflicting reports raised questions about the Iranian government’s transparency concerning the scale of the outbreak.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sought to reassure the nation in a speech on Tuesday, calling the new coronavirus an “uninvited and inauspicious passenger.”“We will get through corona,” Rouhani said. “We will get through the virus.”Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq and Oman also announced their first cases of the virus on Monday and connected them to travel with Iran.The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, has reported 13 cases of the new virus. Most of those were connected to Chinese travel.Meanwhile, Kuwait raised the number of its infected cases from three to five people. All five were passengers returning on a flight from the Iranian city of Mashhad, where Iran’s government has not yet announced a single case of the virus.The state-run Kuwait News Agency reported the two latest cases on Monday evening in two women whose nationalities were not disclosed. Kuwait had halted over the weekend transport links with Iran and was evacuating its citizens from Iran.Also, Oman, which has good ties with Iran, has halted flights with its Persian Gulf neighbor. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are the only two Gulf countries that still have direct flights to Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-uae-limits-flights-to-iran-over-fears-of-covid-19-outbreak/story-BKC6oDqfAH6ADFjGxqQxYK.html
25-02-2020||World||Three more Covid-19 related deaths reported in Iran||The novel coronavirus has claimed three more lives in Iran, state media reported, taking the country’s overall death toll from the outbreak to 15 -- the highest outside China.Iran has been scrambling to contain COVID-19 since Wednesday when it announced its first two deaths in Qom, a centre for Islamic studies and pilgrims that attracts scholars from abroad.Two of the dead were elderly women in the central province of Markazi and the other was a patient in the northern province of Alborz, state news agency IRNA said.“One was an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver and kidney diseases who passed away after being hospitalised for two days,” Abbas Nikravesh, head of Saveh city’s medical university, told IRNA.The other was an 82-year-old with “serious blood and cardiovascular diseases” and died after being hospitalised for a day, he added, noting that she had a history of visiting Qom as her children live there.“Three cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed in Saveh city so far, with two dead,” Nikravesh said.“There is now one infected 78-year-old woman from Afghanistan under special care.”IRNA did not name the patient in Alborz or detail any underlying health conditions.“This patient was under special care in recent days when he passed away,” Hassan Inanlou, deputy head of Alborz’s medical university, was quoted as saying.According to IRNA, there are two more confirmed cases hospitalised in Alborz.Iran has confirmed 61 cases of coronavirus infection so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-three-more-covid-19-related-deaths-reported-in-iran/story-hmubvBRt596mpNU7ltiqwO.html

25-02-2020||World||Democrat Bernie Sanders slams Donald Trump for ‘selling weapons’ to India||Democratic presidential front-runner Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday slammed President Donald Trump for selling weapons to India, saying that the US should instead partner with New Delhi to fight climate change to save the planet.Sanders, who has won the Nevada and New Hampshire primaries and tied in Iowa, made the comments after Trump, who is on a two-day visit to India, on Monday announced that the US will sign defence trade deals worth USD 3 billion with India.In an address at a massive “Namaste Trump” rally at Motera stadium in Ahmedabad, Trump announced that deals to sell state-of-the-art military helicopters and other equipment worth over USD 3 billion will be sealed with India on Tuesday.“Instead of selling USD 3 billion in weapons to enrich Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed, the United States should be partnering with India to fight climate change,” Sanders said in a tweet, the first by a Democratic presidential candidate on Trump’s India visit.“We can work together to cut air pollution, create good renewable energy jobs, and save our planet,” he said.However, a former White House official defended the US’ decision to sell arms and weapons to India.“I’m proud of my service in the White House, in which we poured enormous energy into deepening climate and green tech cooperation w/ India... and also advancing security cooperation and defence sales. I’d like to think both can be part of a strong, values-based partnership,” Joshua White said.According to the US State Department, India plays a vital role in the US vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.In 2016, the US designated India as a Major Defence Partner. Commensurate with this designation, India in 2018 was granted Strategic Trade Authorization tier 1 status, which allows New Delhi to receive license-free access to a wide range of military and dual-use technologies that are regulated by the Department of Commerce.Bilateral defence trade with India in a little over a decade has increased from near zero in 2008 to USD20 billion.Among some of the key foreign military sales notified to Congress include MH-60R Seahawk helicopters (USD2.6 billion), Apache helicopters (USD2.3 billion), P-8I maritime patrol aircraft (USD3 billion), and M777 howitzers (USD737 million).India was the first non-treaty partner to be offered a Missile Technology Control Regime Category-1 Unmanned Aerial System – the Sea Guardian UAS manufactured by General Atomics.The State Department is also advocating for the Lockheed Martin F-21 and Boeing F/A-18 – two state of the art fighter aircraft that India is currently evaluating.These platforms provide critical opportunities to enhance India’s military capabilities and protect shared security interests in the Indo-Pacific region, it argued.Since 2008, the US has also sold to India over USD 6.6 billion in defence articles via the direct commercial sales process, which licenses the export of the defence equipment, services, and related manufacturing technologies controlled under the 21 categories of the US Munitions List (USML). The top categories of DCS to India include aircraft, electronics and gas turbine engines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrat-bernie-sanders-slams-donald-trump-for-selling-weapons-to-india/story-9OrhmNbQ3xvAwqRnpqgnzI.html
25-02-2020||World||China sentences Swedish book publisher Gui Minhai to 10 years||A Chinese court has sentenced Swedish book publisher Gui Minhai to 10 years in prison on charges of illegally providing intelligence abroad in a case that has rattled relations between Beijing and Stockholm.Gui Minhai, one of the five Hong Kong-based booksellers known for publishing salacious titles about Chinese political leaders, was snatched by Chinese authorities while on a train to Beijing in February 2018, the second time he disappeared into Chinese custody.The court in the eastern city of Ningbo said Gui was convicted on Monday and that he had his Chinese citizenship reinstated in 2018, but it was not immediately clear if he had given up his Swedish nationality.Gui first vanished in 2015 while on holiday in Thailand and eventually surfaced at an undisclosed location in China, confessing to involvement in a fatal traffic accident and smuggling illegal books.He served two years in prison but three months after his October 2017 release, he was again arrested while on a train to Beijing while travelling with Swedish diplomats.His supporters and family have claimed his detainment is part of a political repression campaign orchestrated by Chinese authorities.The Ningbo court also sentenced Gui to five years of “deprivation of political rights”, which in practice means he cannot lead state-owned enterprises or hold positions in state organs.China does not recognise dual citizenship and foreigners are required to renounce their foreign nationality once they gain Chinese citizenship.- Rights prize -A video released by China three weeks after Gui’s disappearance showed him purportedly confessing wrongdoing and blaming Sweden for “sensationalising” his case and “instigating” law-breaking behaviour.Gui’s friend, dissident poet Bei Ling, said at the time that Gui’s confession was likely made under coercion.Chinese criminal suspects often appear in videotaped “confessions” that rights groups say sometimes bear the hallmarks of official arm-twisting.Gui’s detention has put a strain on relations between Sweden and China in recent years, with Stockholm repeatedly calling for his release.China called off two business delegation visits to Sweden after Culture Minister Amanda Lind defied a Chinese threat of “counter-measures” and presented a rights prize to Gui in November.Sweden’s former envoy to China Anna Lindstedt is being investigated for allegedly overstepping her duties and arranging an unauthorised meeting with Chinese businessmen and Gui’s daughter to get Gui freed.Yang Hengjun, an Chinese-born Australian writer known for his series of spy novels, has also been detained in China since January 2019 and was recently charged with spying.Yang reportedly once worked in China’s foreign affairs ministry in Hainan province -- although this has been denied by Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-swedish-book-publisher-gui-minhai-to-10-years/story-50H7DQEtg7WHzrBpDQZT1K.html
25-02-2020||World||WHO warns of pandemic risk after coronavirus peaks in China||The new coronavirus has peaked in China but could still grow into a pandemic, the World Health Organization has warned, as infections mushroom in other countries.Financial markets have gone into a tail-spin after grim news of deaths and outbreaks in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, even as the Chinese epicentre appeared to be calming, with the death toll at its lowest for three weeks.But the situation is worsening in other countries, with more than 2,000 cases and 30 deaths reported abroad, prompting a raft of restrictions on travellers from infected nations.South Korea, Italy and Iran have logged particularly sharp increases in infections and deaths, while several countries in the Middle East reported their first cases of the novel coronavirus.But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes insisted the virus could still be contained, praising China’s drastic quarantine measures in several cities for helping to prevent an even bigger spread.“For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,” Tedros told reporters in Geneva.He added, however, that countries should be “doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.”The term “pandemic” is used to describe an illness that spreads across numerous communities.- South Korea hotspot -South Korea, which has the largest number of cases outside China, reported 60 more infections and one more fatality on Tuesday, raising its death toll to eight and total patients to nearly 900.South Korea’s outbreak has centred around a religious sect in Daegu, the country’s fourth largest city.The country is on its highest “red” alert. As part of the containment efforts, school holidays were extended nationally while the 2.5 million people of Daegu were told to remain indoors.The US Centers for Disease Control raised its caution level to warn Americans against “all nonessential travel to South Korea”.Italy, which has reported seven deaths and over 200 cases, has locked down 11 towns, while upcoming football matches in its Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors. With police manning checkpoints to enforce a blockade, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks of lockdown.- Iran fears -The disease -- officially known as COVID-19 -- spread to new countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman.At least 12 people have died in Iran, the highest toll outside China.But there were concerns the situation might be worse than officially acknowledged. The semi-official ILNA news agency quoted one local lawmaker in hard-hit Qom -- a religious centre -- who said 50 people had died there.The Iranian government denied the report, and pledged transparency.Even so, authorities have only reported 64 infections in Iran, an unusually small number that would mean an extremely high mortality rate.Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said a team from the UN agency would be arriving in Iran on Tuesday.But he cautioned against drawing any conclusions about the mortality rate. Iran “may only be detecting severe cases” because the epidemic was still at an early stage, he said.Several countries have taken measures to prevent arrivals from Iran.- China peak -In China, 508 new cases were reported, with all but nine at the epicentre in central Hubei province. Although that was up from 409 on Monday it was much lower than new infections being reported just a week ago.China’s death toll reached 2,663 on Tuesday, after 71 more people died.WHO’s Tedros said the epidemic peaked in China between January 23 and February 2.China has placed some 56 million in Hubei and its capital under quarantine since late last month, while other regions have enacted some forms of travel curbs and measures to keep millions more people indoors.Bruce Aylward, leader of a WHO mission of international experts, said late Monday it was time for China to start lifting some of the restrictions.“Obviously they want to get society back to a more normal semblance of what probably is the new normal, because this virus may be around... for months,” Aylward said.Reflecting the disquiet, global markets plunged on Monday, with Wall Street off 3.6 percent.

Two were confirmed to have the new coronavirus, while the health ministry declined to comment on whether the third person tested positive for the virus.At least 691 people who were on board the Diamond Princess have so far tested positive for COVID-19, according to the health ministry.Around a 1,000 people were allowed to leave the ship after it completed a 14-day quarantine if they tested negative and displayed no symptoms.But several people who left the boat after getting the all-clear have since tested positive, and the health ministry has admitted some people were allowed to disembark despite not being tested during the quarantine.Separately, Japan has confirmed at least 156 cases of infection with the virus, and one death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fourth-person-from-quarantined-japan-ship-dies-report/story-1DHvmESojRE8kkPbPXD9jN.html
25-02-2020||World||China reports 508 more coronavirus cases, South Korea has 60 more||China reported 508 new cases Tuesday in an outbreak of a viral illness that has spread to the Middle East and Europe.Another 71 deaths were reported, 68 of them in the city of Wuhan, where the epidemic has been concentrated.The updates bring mainland China’s totals to 77,658 cases and 2,663 deaths.South Korea reported 60 more cases of the new virus, bringing its total to 893. Cases there now outnumber Japan, where many cases were detected among passengers and crew on a cruise ship.South Korea has reported a near 15-fold increase in viral infections in a week, as health workers continue to find batches of cases in the southeastern city of Daegu and nearby areas, where panic has brought towns into an eerie standstill.Of the 60 new cases reported by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 49 came from Daegu and the surrounding areas of North Gyeongsang province.The country also reported its eight fatality from the virus, a man in his 60s who was linked to a hospital in Cheongdo, where a slew of infections has been reported among patients who had been hospitalized at a mental ward.Clusters have also emerged in Iran and Italy.Schools were closed in Iran for a second day. Movie theaters and other venues were shuttered through at least Friday, and daily sanitizing of public buses and the Tehran metro, which is used by some 3 million people, was begun.In Italy, where 229 people have tested positive for the virus and seven have died, police manned checkpoints around a dozen quarantined northern towns as worries grew across the continent.After large increases in COVID-19 cases in other countries, the World Heath Organization said the virus had the potential to cause a pandemic but wasn’t one yet.“The past few weeks has demonstrated just how quickly a new virus can spread around the world and cause widespread fear and disruption,” WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.But “for the moment we’re not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-508-more-coronavirus-cases-south-korea-has-60-more/story-fcxJvpnyLjKCuDCopGdQqI.html
25-02-2020||World||Katherine Johnson, NASA mathematician portrayed in ‘Hidden Figures’, dies at 101||Katherine Johnson, the black woman whose mathematical genius took her from a behind-the-scenes job in a segregated NASA as portrayed in the film “Hidden Figures” to a key role in sending humans to the moon, died on Monday at the age of 101, NASA said.“Our NASA family is sad to learn the news that Katherine Johnson passed away this morning at 101 years old,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine posted to Twitter. “She was an American hero and her pioneering legacy will never be forgotten.”Johnson was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom by former President Barack Obama in 2015 and in 2016 he cited her in his State of the Union Address as an example of America’s spirit of discovery.“She’s one of the greatest minds ever to grace our agency or our country,” then NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said when Johnson was presented the presidential medal.In 2016, NASA named a research facility for Johnson in her hometown of Hampton, Virginia, and a year later her alma mater, West Virginia State, marked her 100th birthday in August 2018 by establishing a scholarship in her name and erecting a statue.Johnson and her black colleagues at the fledgling NASA were known as “computers” when that term was used not for a programmed electronic device but for a person who did computations. They were little known to the public for decades but gained overdue recognition when the book “Hidden Figures” was published and the 2016 Oscar-nominated movie hit the screens. Johnson attended the 2017 Oscars ceremony, joining the film’s cast in presenting an award for documentaries, and was given a standing ovation.Johnson had a groundbreaking career of 33 years with the space agency, working on the Mercury and Apollo missions, including the first moon landing in 1969, and the early years of the space shuttle program. Astronaut John Glenn thought so much of her that he insisted Johnson be consulted before his historic earth-orbiting flight in 1962.“Get the girl to check the numbers,” he said.“He knew I had done (the calculations) before for him and they trusted my work,” Johnson told the Washington Post in 2017.IGNORED THE RACISMDuring the space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union that began in the late 1950s, Johnson and her co-workers ran the numbers for unmanned rocket launches, test flights and airplane safety studies using pencils, slide rules and mechanical calculating machines. But they did their work in facilities separate from white workers and were required to use separate restrooms and dining facilities.Johnson always said she was too busy with her work to be concerned with racism.“She didn’t close her eyes to the racism that existed,” Margot Lee Shetterly wrote in “Hidden Figures.” “She knew just as well as any other black person the tax levied upon them because of their color. But she didn’t feel it in the same way. She wished it away, willed it out of existence inasmuch as her daily life was concerned.”As a girl, Johnson was fascinated by numbers and counted everything, even the steps she took while walking and the dishes she washed after dinner. She grew up in West Virginia at a time when educational opportunities for blacks were limited because of segregation. But her mother, a former teacher, and her father, a farmer and handyman, stressed education and moved the family 120 miles to a town that had a high school for black children.Johnson’s math skills got her into West Virginia State College at age 15. She zipped through the school’s math program, earning degrees in math and French before becoming one of the first black students in the graduate school at West Virginia University in 1938.After teaching school for seven years, Johnson went to work for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a forerunner of NASA, in Hampton in 1953 with dozens of other black women.Johnson found herself in a realm made up almost exclusively of white men when she was chosen to be part of the team supporting the 1961 mission that made Alan Shepard the first American in space. She would go on to calculate crucial rocket trajectories, orbital paths and launch windows.Johnson made the transition to the computer era and worked on the shuttle program while writing or co-writing 26 research reports before retiring in 1986, NASA said.She said she was most proud of her contributions to the first moon mission, which included the calculations that synched the lunar lander craft and the orbiting command module.Johnson and her first husband, James Goble, who died in 1956, had three daughters. She married Lieutenant Colonel James Johnson in 1959.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/katherine-johnson-nasa-mathematician-portrayed-in-hidden-figures-dies-at-101/story-LsGpF1buhqmQo19XlROrBI.html
