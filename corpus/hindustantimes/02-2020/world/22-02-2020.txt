Tomikazu Fukuda said at a televised news conference.The woman had tested negative for the virus on Feb. 15, four days before she got off the ship with her husband, with neither showing any symptoms at the time. The couple took a train home, officials said.Despite strong doubts raised from inside and outside the country, Japanese health ministry officials have insisted that any passengers who completed the 14-day quarantine, tested negative for the virus and showed no symptoms had nearly zero risk of becoming a virus patient.“I would like to urge the government to take more thorough preventive measures,” Fukuda said sternly at the news conference.Some experts and former passengers have criticised the quarantine, saying anti-infection measures were inadequate. The US, Australia and other governments that evacuated their citizens from the ship are requiring them an additional two-week quarantine.Japan’s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said Saturday that 18 Americans, six Australians and one Israeli passenger who were flown out of Japan by their respective governments before the end of the ship’s quarantine tested positive after returning home. He said the results were understandable because those passengers did not fully meet the stricter requirements for release from the ship.Kato said Japanese officials were working closely with their respective countries’ health officials to follow up the cases.Kato also said Saturday that 23 passengers had been released from the Diamond Princess at the end of the quarantine without being tested for the virus due to procedural mistakes, another sign of sloppiness in the quarantine of the ship, where more than 600 people were infected.He said the 23 were tested before the quarantine began February 5, but were allowed to leave the ship on Wednesday and Thursday without being tested again. Three of them have since tested negative, and most of the others have agreed to be tested, he said.Kato said officials have tracked all 23 passengers down and asked them to self-quarantine at home for 14 days.“We deeply regret that there was an operational error,” he said at a news conference. “We will examine what went wrong so we will not repeat the same mistake.” Japan has confirmed more than 760 cases of the new virus, which first emerged in China, including at least 634 from the Diamond Princess, which docked and was quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo.The ship initially carried about 2,600 passengers and 1,100 crew members. Most of the passengers were either taken to hospitals, disembarked or took chartered flights home. About 100 others who had infected roommates or contact with other passengers during the quarantine period were taken to a government facility to complete the 14-day quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-passenger-tests-positive-for-covid-19-after-leaving-infected-ship-in-japan/story-mwNXdGgIoqvqJonedpHc2K.html

22-02-2020||World||WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange’s supporters march through London before extradition hearing||Hundreds of supporters of Julian Assange marched through London on Saturday to pressure the U.K. government into refusing to extradite the WikiLeaks founder to the United States to face spying charges.Famous Britons, including Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters, Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood joined the crowd protesting the U.S. espionage charges against the founder of the secret-spilling website. An extradition hearing for Assange is due to begin in a London court on Monday.WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told a rally outside Parliament that the prosecution of Assange represented “a dark force against (those) who want justice, transparency and truth.”U.S. prosecutors have charged the 48-year-old Australian computer expert with espionage over WikiLeaks’ publication of hundreds of thousands of confidential government documents. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to up to 175 years in prison.American authorities say Assange conspired with U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Assange argues he acted as a journalist and is therefore entitled to First Amendment protection. He also maintains the documents exposed wrongdoing and protected many people.Civil liberties groups and journalism organizations, including Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders, have urged the U.S. to drop the charges, saying they set a chilling precedent for freedom of the press.More than 40 jurists from the U.K., the U.S., France and other countries published a letter Saturday asking the British government to reject the extradition request. They accused the U.S. of “extra-territorial overreach” in seeking to prosecute an Australian who was based in the U.K.Assange is currently incarcerated in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison, having previously spent seven years inside the Embassy of Ecuador.He holed up in the South American country’s U.K. diplomatic mission in 2012 to avoid being sent to Sweden to face questioning over rape and sexual assault allegations. That case has since been dropped.Assange was evicted from the embassy in April 2019 and arrested by British police for jumping bail seven years earlier.Assange’s legal team argues that the case against him is politically motivated. His lawyers said they would present evidence they claim shows that Assange was offered a pardon if he agreed to say Russia was not involved in leaking Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.Emails embarrassing for the Democrats and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign were hacked before being published by WikiLeaks in 2016.Assange’s lawyers say the offer was made in August 2017 by then-Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who claimed to be acting on behalf of President Donald Trump.The White House called the claim “a complete fabrication and a total lie.”Rohrabacher said in a statement that he told Assange “that if he could provide me information and evidence about who actually gave him the DNC emails, I would then call on President Trump to pardon him. At no time did I offer a deal made by the President, nor did I say I was representing the President.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-s-supporters-march-through-london-before-extradition-hearing/story-y2HsTNTM925cR9ndOKF9JM.html
22-02-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak began in November from outside Wuhan seafood market, says new study||The novel coronavirus (covid-19) could have begun transmission between humans in November from a place other than the seafood market in Wuhan in Hubei province, new research by institutes under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has said.Until now the Huanan seafood market in the outbreak epicentre Wuhan has been seen as the most probable location where the virus had jumped from a wild animal to a human in December, and then quickly spread across China and beyond.The new study contradicts that sequence of events – and pushes back the timeline of the outbreak significantly.It says that the coronavirus was introduced to the seafood market from another location – by a human – and then rapidly spread in the city.The findings were the result of analyses of genome data, sources of infection and the route of spread of 93 samples of the novel coronavirus collected from 12 countries across four continents including the US, France, Australia, Japan, and Taiwan.“The new coronavirus from the South China seafood market was introduced from other places, and spread rapidly outside the market; at the same time, the current spread of cases came from at least 3 routes. The new coronavirus had two significant population expansions before February 12 (December 8 and January 6 respectively),” the study said.“According to the new coronavirus genome data, it was estimated that the population expansion before January occurred on December 8. This result suggests that the virus may have spread from person to person in early December and even in late November, and then accelerated human-to-human transmission in the south China seafood market,” the study added.The authors argued that a “patient zero” could have passed on the virus to workers or sellers at the Huanan seafood market; subsequently, the crowded market facilitated the further transmission of the virus to buyers, which could have then triggered a wider spread in early December 2019.“Researchers further confirmed that infection cases in the other nine provinces and 11 other countries in China were basically directly or indirectly imported from Wuhan,” the study said.The study estimates that the population expansion before February was January 6, which was related to the annual travel rush related to the Chinese New Year’s day holidays.“It should be noted that on this day, the National Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued a Level 2 emergency response. Early warnings at that time served as a warning, and public activity and travel were reduced. If the warnings at that time could (have) attracted wider attention, the number of cases spreading nationally and globally in mid-to-late January would (have) been reduced,” the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-began-in-november-from-outside-wuhan-seafood-market-says-new-study/story-KFRg8VTBMUbGe6oyQHNtCO.html

So far, the health ministry was not aware of anyone developing symptoms after returning home, he said.Japan has confirmed more than 750 cases of the new virus, which first emerged in China, including 634 from the Diamond Princess, which docked and was quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo.The ship initially carried about 2,600 passengers and 1,100 crew members.

About 100 others who had infected roommates or contact with other passengers during the quarantine period were taken to a government facility to complete the 14-day quarantine.Meanwhile, 18 Americans, six Australians and one Israeli passenger from the cruise ship have tested positive after returning home on their respective chartered flights, including some who had tested negative earlier, Kato said.He said the results were understandable because they did not fully meet the stricter requirement for release from the ship. Some of them had close contacts with patients while on the ship and may have been tested just before getting infected. Kato, however, said Japanese officials were closely working with their respective countries’ health officials to follow up the cases.Some experts and former passengers have criticized the quarantine, saying anti-infection measures were inadequate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-23-passengers-not-tested-for-covid-19-before-disembarking-infected-cruise-in-japan/story-n1hxlSAiFos1Y9J6TP4K7O.html
22-02-2020||World||Banner on school bus urges Prince Andrew to testify against late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein||A yellow school bus with a banner depicting the face of Britain’s Prince Andrew drove past Buckingham Palace on Friday, urging him to testify in the investigation of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The stunt organized by American lawyer Gloria Allred sought to pressure Queen Elizabeth II’s son to reveal what he might know about the disgraced financier. Allred represents some of Epstein’s victims and has demanded that Andrew cooperates.The message, featuring pictures of Andrew, said: “If you see this man please ask him to call the FBI to answer their questions.”Andrew has stepped back from royal duties following a catastrophic BBC interview in which he categorically denied having sex with a teenager who says she was trafficked by Epstein. Britain’s newspapers and social media commentators slammed the royal for defending his friendship with Epstein and for failing to show empathy for the convicted sex-offender’s victims.U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman told reporters in January that Andrew has provided “zero cooperation” to the FBI and U.S. prosecutors seeking to speak with him about Epstein.The statement by Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, was the first official confirmation that the leading U.S. law enforcement agency had sought — and failed — to obtain evidence from Andrew, third child of the monarch, despite his pledge to cooperate with legitimate law enforcement agencies.Andrew was reported to be “angry and bewildered” at the comments by American authorities, with the Telegraph quoting a source as saying: “The duke is more than happy to talk to the FBI but he hasn’t been approached by them yet.”The American prosecutors have since stood by their statements.The FBI declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/banner-on-school-bus-urges-prince-andrew-to-testify-against-late-sex-offender-jeffrey-epstein/story-7lmeZZf8dqUMsIpkqOjtnI.html

22-02-2020||World||5 out of the 28 infected with Covid-19 dead in Iran||Iranian health authorities on Saturday reported a fifth death from the new virus that emerged in China, and said the fatality was from among 10 new confirmed cases of the virus in Iran.So far, 28 cases have been confirmed in Iran, including the five who died. People are being treated for the virus in at least four different cities, including the capital, Tehran, where some pharmacies had already run out of masks and hand sanitizer. Other cities are Qom, Arak and Rasht.The virus loomed over a nationwide parliamentary election in Iran on Friday. Many voters went to the polls wearing face masks.Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour made Saturday’s announcement for the latest figures on state TV, but did not specify when the fifth death occurred. Two people had died earlier Friday from COVID-19, the illness caused by virus. Authorities reported two deaths previously this week.Jahanpour said that of the 10 newly detected cases, two were in the capital of Tehran and eight were in the city of Qom. That’s where the first two elderly patients died on Wednesday. He said the two patients in the capital had visited Qom or had links with the city.Minoo Mohraz, an Iranian health ministry official, had said Friday that the virus “possibly came from Chinese workers who work in Qom and travelled to China.” She did not elaborate. A Chinese company has been building a solar power plant in Qom.World Health Organisation officials have said that China’s crackdown on parts of the country bought time for the rest of the world to prepare for the new virus. But as hot spots emerge around the globe, including in South Korea and Iran, there has been trouble finding the first patient who sparked each new cluster.Qom is a popular religious destination and a center of learning and religious studies for Shiite Muslims from inside Iran, as well as Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan and Azerbaijan.Elsewhere in the region, Saudi Arabia announced that citizens and residents of the kingdom are not permitted to travel to Iran following the spread of the virus there. Anyone previously in Iran will only be permitted entry to the country after the 14-day incubation period of the virus has passed.The decision, while not specifically mentioning Iranian nationals, directly impacts thousands of Iranians who travel to Mecca and Medina for Islamic pilgrimages, effectively barring them from entry to Saudi Arabia.The kingdom has already barred its citizens and residents from travel to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-5-out-of-the-28-infected-with-covid-19-dead-in-iran/story-ZurAsPVYbsMEMdbqYDZ12M.html

Around 970 passengers disembarked earlier this week.Television footage showed a driver in a white protective suit at the wheel of a bus with the curtains drawn so that passengers could not be identified.They will be quarantined for two weeks near Tokyo, officials said.With the disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1,000 crew still on board as many of them did not undergo quarantine because they were needed to keep the ship running.They were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to charge they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly COVID-19 disease.Health minister Katsunobu Kato on Saturday defended Japan’s on-board quarantine, saying there was no medical facility large enough to admit more than 3,000 people at once.Meanwhile, Kato said Japan was considering using the anti-influenza medication Avigan to treat patients.“We will check if various medicines, led by Avigan, can be effective,” Kato told a TV programme, saying the government would push for their use if they are confirmed to be effective.Outside the Diamond Princess, Japan has seen 105 cases of the new coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-100-passengers-leave-covid-19-infested-ship-after-being-in-close-contact-with-those-infected/story-NYRxllVzQhSjotTIL2mBaL.html

Venus is an extreme world. With a surface temperature in excess of 448 degrees Celsius and a surface pressure 90 times that of Earth, Venus can turn lead into a puddle and crush a nuclear-powered submarine with ease. While many missions have visited our sister planet, only about a dozen have made contact with the surface of Venus before quickly succumbing to the oppressive heat and pressure. The last spacecraft to touch the planet’s surface, the Soviet Vega 2, landed in 1985. Now, engineers and scientists at JPL are studying mission designs that can survive the hellish landscape.Powered by wind, AREE is intended to spend months, not minutes, exploring the Venus landscape, NASA said.AREE could collect valuable, long-term longitudinal scientific data. As the rover explores the planet, it must also detect obstacles in its path, such as rocks, crevices and steep terrain. NASA said that the competition’s winning sensor will be incorporated into the rover concept and could potentially one day be the mechanism by which a rover detects and navigates around obstructions.The difficulty of this challenge is in designing a sensor that does not rely on electronic systems. Current state-of-the-art electronics fail at just over 440 degrees Celsius and would easily succumb to the extreme Venus environment. That is why NASA is turning to the global community of innovators and inventors for a solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-to-award-15-000-to-the-designer-of-key-sensor-for-venus-rover-in-a-competition-open-to-public/story-7fB7k1iGDQ9toWcVwOc16M.html

But individual cities outside that core cordon area, such as Cremona, issued their own restrictions canceling school after confirming cases.State-run RAI television reported a 78-year-old man, one of two people in the Veneto region to have been infected, died Friday. Italian news agencies ANSA and LaPresse also reported the death, citing the Veneto regional president, Luca Zaia.The numbers of infected were in constant flux, after Lombardy reported an initial quadrupling of cases on Friday bringing Italy’s total to at least 19. Authorities planned a news conference later Saturday to give the most up-to-date figures.Authorities urged calm, but acknowledged that the clusters were alarming given people were being infected who had no known contact with anyone directly related to China. The first man to be confirmed as infected had met with someone who had returned from China but remains without symptoms.Separately Saturday, 19 Italians who spent more than two weeks quarantined on a virus-stricken cruise liner in Japan landed at Rome’s military Pratica di Mare airport. They had been stranded on the Diamond Princess since Feb. 5.Following the first health checks and decontamination process, the passengers were transferred to the military campus of Cecchignola where they will spend a 14-day isolation period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-towns-on-effective-lockdown-after-virus-clusters-form/story-f9F8X2h6KTtCr42tUTZi9M.html

On Friday, a prison in Rencheng, in each China’s Shandong province, reported 200 new cases of novel coronavirus infection.Another 27 were reported in Shilifeng prison in Zhejiang province, also in eastern China.The worst-hit central Chinese province of Hubei also reported that two prisons in the province saw 230 cases and 41 cases respectively.:Shandong, Zhejiang and Hubei have punished those accountable. It is hoped that the punishments will strengthen the alarm bell these incidents have rung. Everyone must be clear that the virus is far from being defeated. It can break our line of defense at any time,” the tabloid, Global Times said.“These transmission accidents in prisons serve as a stark reminder that institutions and venues where people gather must step up their vigilance. We must prevent any kind of formalism and make every preventive and control measure a real safety valve,” it added.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that the WHO-led team of international experts currently in China to investigate the novel coronavirus outbreak will travel to China’s central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, on Saturday.At a daily briefing, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the WHO-led joint mission in China has been working in Beijing, Sichuan and Guangdong, and will travel to Wuhan on Saturday to continue its work at the epicenter of the outbreak.He added that WHO is also working with partners to safeguard the health of the members of the team, and to take appropriate measures when they return to their countries of origin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-now-at-2345-new-infections-drop-in-many-provinces/story-n3UmxnZ6caV9AY5xPWw0XI.html
22-02-2020||World||‘Trump cheats at golf’: Mike Bloomberg mocks US Prez with billboard message||Democratic White House hopeful Michael Bloomberg mocked Donald Trump with a giant billboard on the Las Vegas Strip on Friday, fueling their feud as the US president visits the city for a rally.“Donald Trump lost the popular vote,” read one slogan on the world-famous street lined with casinos, while another read “Donald Trump’s wall fell over.”The giant digital billboard is just two miles (three kilometers) down the Strip from Trump’s own hotel, where the president is staying while in Las Vegas.Bloomberg is vying for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump at November’s election, and has focused his fire on the president rather than candidates from his own party.When Bloomberg did face fellow Democrats at a Las Vegas debate on Wednesday, Trump was quick to crow: “Worst debate performance in history!”Perhaps inevitably in a row between billionaires, golf was also a theme of the billboards -- “Donald Trump cheats at golf,” read a third sign.“A lot of people cheat at golf, it’s probably true,” said Gerry Frenze, a transport company owner from Delaware who was in town for a convention Friday.“But I don’t like the idea (Bloomberg) can buy his way into office.”His wife, Kim Corrigan, had little sympathy for Trump.“Trump makes you want to attack him,” she said. “I don’t like (Bloomberg) doing that. But Trump started it. The way he operates cheapens everyone.”The attack comes on the eve of Nevada’s key vote in the race for the Democratic nomination, with media from around the world in town.Another passerby who did not wanted to be named simply shrugged: “He’s got the money.”But Mya Sepeda, a tarot card reader working on a pedestrian bridge beneath the sign, took the matter more seriously.“Maybe it’s true but he is the president and he deserves a bit of respect,” said Sepeda -- adding that he had foreseen Trump would win the last election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-cheats-at-golf-michael-bloomberg-mocks-us-president-with-billboard-message/story-qTaxuFmfsCt0Hm9kv0awGP.html

22-02-2020||World||WHO says window of opportunity to stem coronavirus ‘narrowing’ as cases soar||The World Health Organization warned Friday that the window to stem the deadly coronavirus outbreak was shrinking, amid concern over a surge in cases with no clear link to China. The warning came as Italy moved to close public spaces in ten towns, in a move with echoes of China’s lockdown of entire cities in the province at the centre of the outbreak.Over 50,000 people have been asked to stay at home in the areas concerned in northern Italy while all public activities such as carnival celebrations, church masses and sporting events have been banned for up to a week.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has for weeks insisted the low number of cases of COVID-19 outside the epicentre of the deadly outbreak in China’s central Hubei province presented a “window of opportunity” to contain the international spread.But as cases surged across the Middle East and in South Korea Friday, he cautioned for the first time that while “we are still in a phase where containment is possible... our window of opportunity is narrowing.”He warned that if countries did not quickly mobilise to fight the spread of the virus, “this outbreak could go in any direction. It could even be messy.”The outbreak which began in December has already killed more than 2,200 people and infected more than 75,500 in China.More than 1,150 people have also been infected and more than a dozen have died across 27 other countries.On Friday, cases of the deadly virus were reported in a range of countries in the Middle East, including in Israel and Lebanon for the first time, while Iran said four people there had died and 18 been infected in the outbreak.Infections also nearly doubled in South Korea to 204, making it the hardest-hit country outside China.The US advised citizens to avoid travelling by cruise liner in Asia because it said the vessels acted as amplifiers of the virus.The world modern pentathlon championships were also been moved from the Chinese city of Xiamen to Cancun in Mexico as a consequence of the deadly outbreakTedros stressed though that the number of cases outside of China still remained “relatively small”.But he voiced concern “about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to or contact with a confirmed case,” urging countries worldwide to be “very, very serious” about preventing the spread of the virus.“We must not look back and regret that we failed to take advantage of the window of opportunity we have.”China has meanwhile pointed to official figures showing new cases in the country slowing this week as evidence that its drastic containment measures are working, but fresh infections emerged at two Beijing hospitals, and more than 500 others were reported in prisons across the country.Chinese authorities have placed tens of millions of people under quarantine in hard-hit central Hubei province, restricted movements in other cities far from the epicentre and closed schools nationwide.At a Politburo meeting chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday, the leadership said the epidemic’s peak “has not yet arrived”, and the situation in Hubei and Wuhan remains “grim and complex,” according to state media. Many nations have banned travellers from China and airlines have suspended flights to and from the country.- South Korean sect -In hard-hit South Korea, more than 120 members of Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect in the southern city of Daegu, have now been infected.The mayor of Daegu -- South Korea’s fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million -- has advised residents to stay indoors.Most people on the streets were wearing masks Friday, but many businesses were closed and workers sprayed disinfectant outside the church.“With so many confirmed cases here I’m worried that Daegu will become the second Wuhan,” said Seo Dong-min, 24, referring to Hubei’s capital, where the virus first emerged.Two Australians and an Israeli evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship meanwhile tested positive for coronavirus on returning to their home countries, despite being cleared in Japan.The cases will fuel questions about Tokyo’s policy of allowing former Diamond Princess passengers to return home after testing negative.Two former passengers, both Japanese and in their 80s, died in Japan on Thursday.- Prisons and hospitals -China reported 118 more deaths on Friday, raising the toll to 2,236, most of them in Hubei.The National Health Commission also said in its daily update that China tallied 889 new cases, up from the previous day when it reported the lowest number of new infections in nearly a month, fuelling hopes that the epidemic is nearing its peak.But Hubei’s figures have raised questions as officials have changed methods of counting cases twice and amended their figures. A 29-year-old Wuhan doctor died on Thursday, making him one of the youngest known fatalities of the epidemic and the eighth among medical workers.New hotspots were found in several prisons and hospitals, prompting the firing of a number of officials. burs-nl/apo/har/lc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-window-of-opportunity-to-stem-coronavirus-narrowing-as-cases-soar/story-A2S9NbC3QFRXiT8Bw9fl3K.html
22-02-2020||World||Donald Trump to meet Indian investors in US manufacturing during his visit||Amid the pomp and ceremony of an official visit next week, US President Donald Trump will take time to meet with Indian companies investing in manufacturing in the US, which will showcase India’s contribution to his grand plan of revitalising his country’s industrial base, a core of element in his election platform. The two-day itinerary for Trump, who has said the trip “is going to be very exciting,” includes a State Dinner at the Rashtrapati Bhavan hosted by the President Ramnath Kovind, a quick trip to the Taj Mahal and, of course, the mega event in Ahmedabad, according to a senior US administration official who briefed the media on Friday. The official said that after Trump arrives in Ahmedabad on Monday, he will speak at the Sardar Patel Stadium and after that, he and First Lady Melania Trump will go with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal. They will then fly to New Delhi for an overnight stay and then begin a hectic day of programmes on Tuesday when ceremonial and formal events are lined up. Trump will have bilateral meetings with Modi, meet with Kovind and attend the State Dinner, which is usually held with a lot of ceremony. He is also scheduled to have a meet-and-greet with the staff of the US embassy. In between, he will participate in business events with Indian investors “with a special focus on companies that are investing in manufacturing in the US,” the official said. With the trade agreement between India and US held up amid Washington’s complaints about Modi’s “Make in India,a the meeting will be an opportunity for India to show its contributions to reviving manufacturing in the US.Briefing reporters about the visit, a senior administration official had said, “‘The Make in India’ push of the Indian government ... has made the protectionism concerns even more of a concern to us.” The official said that while a trade agreement was not coming during the trip, it was likely that some memorandums of understanding or some other documents dealing with defence, energy and trade maybe signed, but did not have any details. More than 110,000 people are expected to participate in the Sardar Patel Stadium event and it will be one of the biggest crowds that Trump, who has a penchant for numbers and records, will address. Excited about the size of the crowds expected, he said earlier this month, “When we have 50,000 people nowadays (in the US), fellas, I’m not going to feel so good.” He said that Modi told him that between the stadium and the airport “we’ll have about 7 million people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-meet-indian-investors-in-us-manufacturing-during-his-visit/story-UqjJug4X9qXCwT8yAPOx8K.html

The couple will formally step down as senior royals from March 31 and will no longer carry out duties on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II after that date. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use ‘SussexRoyal’ in any territory post Spring 2020,” said the spokeswoman. They will also not use the name for their new non-profit organisation, due to be announced in the coming months, she added. The couple currently use the name for their popular Instagram account and a website set up after their shock announcement. They also have made dozens of trademark applications for various products. They announced on Wednesday that their new life will begin on April 1, when they will give up their office at Buckingham Palace -- the queen’s London residence. Harry, the 35-year-old second son of the heir apparent Prince Charles, will remain sixth in line to the throne, with no change in the line of succession. The former army officer will also keep his military ranks of major, lieutenant commander and squadron leader in the army, navy and air force, the spokeswoman announced. He and Meghan, 38, will continue to be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. They have been living in a luxury mansion on Canada’s Pacific west coast with their baby son Archie since the New Year. Harry and Meghan first used the Sussex Royal name when they created their own household following a split from brother Prince William.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-prince-harry-and-meghan-to-stop-using-royal-brand/story-YCQWSX0bZyo9ojOcNcQ1yK.html
22-02-2020||World||Russia trying to get Trump elected again: US intel warns lawmakers||US intelligence officials told lawmakers in a confidential briefing last week that Russia is meddling in the 2020 poll campaign to ensure the re-election of President Donald Trump, viewing his administration as favourable to Kremlin’s interests, according to media reports.Though no specifics were reported, The New York Times, which broke the news, said Moscow intended to interfere in the 2020 Democratic nominating contests and the general election, which is due in November.Russia has denied it was interfering in the US election. “These are new paranoid reports, which, to our deep regret, will continue to grow in number as the election day approaches,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “Naturally, they have nothing to do with the truth.”Trump on Friday dismissed reported warnings by US intelligence that Russia is meddling in this year’s elections as a “hoax” planted by his Democratic rivals.“Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa,” Trump wrote on Twitter.On Thursday, a judge sentenced Trump’s adviser Roger Stone to three years and four months in prison and said his lies to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election posed a threat to American democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-trying-to-get-trump-elected-again-us-intel-warns-lawmakers/story-inynGFAwnrq7IClAVwM96N.html

It must stop now,” Guterres told reporters.“The message is clear: There is no military solution for the Syrian crisis. The only possible solution remains political.”Guterres recalled that he had repeatedly called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Idlib, and urged all parties to avoid any escalation in the fighting.“It is crucial to break the vicious circle of violence and suffering,” he said.Since December 1, about 900,000 people have been displaced by the fighting, including more than 500,000 children, according to the United Nations.“An estimated 2.8 million people in northwest Syria require humanitarian assistance,” Guterres said, launching an appeal for an additional $500 million in donations to help the displaced over the next six months.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to halt the Syrian regime’s violence in Idlib on Friday.“The president during the call stressed that the regime should be restrained in Idlib and that the humanitarian crisis must be stopped,” the Turkish presidency said in a statement after the two leaders spoke by phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-made-humanitarian-nightmare-in-syria-must-end-un-chief/story-wILNOVjUovONI57Oosiv6N.html
22-02-2020||World||US, India at odds over trade as Trump heads for meeting with PM Modi: Officials||Trump administration officials on Friday acknowledged that U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India next week will not result in even a limited trade deal, saying they still have major concerns over India’s trade barriers.Hopes that the world’s two largest democracies could negotiate a “confidence building” deal in time for Trump’s arrival Monday on a two-day visit have faded in recent days as differences over agriculture, medical devices, digital trade and proposed new tariffs fester, according to business groups.U.S. concerns that led last year to the suspension of India’s tariff free access for some $5.6 billion in exports under the 1970s-era Generalized System of Preferences still remain, a senior Trump administration official told reporters on a conference call.“We do want to make sure that we get this balance right. We want to address a lot of concerns and we’re not quite there yet,” the official said, adding that Trump will likely discuss these concerns with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Trade talks will continue, but new Indian tariff proposals aimed at strengthening the country’s “Make in India” domestic manufacturing push have made them more difficult, the official said.Apart from growing protectionism, the Trump visit comes against the backdrop of India’s multibillion-dollar purchase of a Russian missile shield system, which added friction to its ties with Washington.India in its Feb. 1 budget proposal announced new import tariffs on medical devices, walnuts, toys, electronics and other products in a move aimed at reducing imports from China but affecting many U.S. firms.The new tariffs surprised U.S. negotiators, especially as they were working with Indian counterparts to reduce the impact of India’s price controls on U.S. medical devices such as cardiac stents and knee implants.“We will be discussing those concerns and what we see an increase in barriers not a decrease. This will certainly come up among the leaders,” the U.S. official said.The official did not completely rule out any trade related announcements during the trip, but said this was “really wholly dependent on what the Indians are prepared to do.”U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has been leading the trade discussions, will not be among the U.S. delegation accompanying Trump, the official said. Earlier this month, Lighthizer cancelled a trip to India to work out a package, even as India made some new proposals to improve U.S. dairy and poultry access. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is joining the trip, which will include announcements of commercial transactions in the energy and defence sectors, the officials said.The United States is India’s second-largest trade partner after China, and bilateral goods and services trade climbed to a record $142.6 billion in 2018. The United States had a $23.2 billion goods trade deficit in 2019 with India, its 9th largest trading partner in goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-india-at-odds-over-trade-as-trump-heads-for-meeting-with-pm-modi-us-officials/story-C1zWH2FcE4jKrA0fZkQMEJ.html
22-02-2020||World||Watchdog sanctions Iran over lax terror financing laws||A multinational financial crimes watchdog on Friday faulted Iran for not doing enough to counter a “terrorist financing risk” and announced the reinstatement of punitive measures against the country. In a statement issued after a meeting in Paris, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said it was rescinding a suspension of the measures, granted in 2016, to give Tehran time to work on reforms. The FATF “fully lifts the suspension of counter-measures” it said, citing Iran’s failure to enact the UN’s 2001 Palermo Convention against organised crime and the Terrorist Financing Convention. It also urged FATF member states and “all jurisdictions to apply effective counter-measures”. Iran is alone with North Korea on an FATF blacklist, which severely restricts their access to loans and international aid. The agency has 37 nations and two regional organisations as members. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the FATF call “for all jurisdictions to swiftly enact counter-measures. “The regime needs to adhere to the basic standards that virtually every other country in the world agrees to,” Pompeo said in a statement. “Iran must cease its reckless behavior and act like a normal nation if it wants its isolation to end,” Pompeo added. Iran’s government has hoped to salvage banking and trade ties after the United States walked out of a landmark 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed crippling unilateral sanctions. The other parties to that deal -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- have sought to salvage the agreement and maintain trade with Iran, but have called on Tehran to meet the FATF requirements. In a bid to do so, the government drafted amendments to laws aimed at curtailing counter-terrorist financing and money laundering. But it has yet to ratify the two conventions, and the FATF said Iran had further work to do on criminalising terrorist funding, identifying and freezing terrorist assets, and properly regulating wire transfers. The FATF it would keep Iran on the “high risk jurisdictions” blacklist, and will decide on next steps “if Iran ratifies the Palermo and Terrorist Financing Conventions, in line with the FATF standards.” Counter-measures include audits of Iranian banks and subsidiaries, and stricter oversight of their transactions. “Until Iran implements the measures required to address the deficiencies identified with respect to countering terrorism financing... the FATF will remain concerned with the terrorist financing risk emanating from Iran and the threat this poses to the international financial system,” it said. The watchdog also raised the pressure on Pakistan, threatening to put it on its blacklist unless the government completes an anti-terror financing action plan by June. “Otherwise, should significant and sustainable progress especially in prosecuting and penalising terrorism financing not be made... the FATF will take action,” the statement said. This could include calling on its members to advise their financial institutions “to give special attention to business relations and transactions with Pakistan,” a measure that could in effect limit its access to the global banking system. Regarding North Korea, the FATF expressed “serious concerns with the threat posed by the DPRK’s illicit activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.” (AFP) IND IND||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/watchdog-sanctions-iran-over-lax-terror-financing-laws/story-AQlWwfWjxEKRKfQiSNwnGL.html
22-02-2020||World||3 dead, 1 injured in central Texas stabbings: Police||A man fatally stabbed three people, including a 13-year-old girl, in a small central Texas city early Friday before leading officers on a car chase and eventually being arrested, police said.Sheriff’s deputies in San Saba, a community of about 3,000 people 100 miles (160 kilometers) north-west of Austin, received a call around 4:30 a.m. from a 18-year-old woman who said she was one of four people stabbed inside a home, said Sgt. Bryan Washko of the Texas Department of Public Safety.Officers arrived to find a 62-year-old man, a 44-year-old woman and the girl dead, Washko said. He could not provide the names of the victims or the 22-year-old suspect. He also said it’s unclear how they are connected and that no motive is known at this point. The Texas Rangers were investigating.The girl was a seventh-grade student at a local school, which was open and offering counseling, said San Saba Independent School District Superintendent Wayne Kelly.“It’s hit us pretty hard, “ Kelly said. ”When there are only 200 kids in the junior high they tend to know each other.” Kelly described the stabbings as a “domestic situation” but said he could not elaborate. He declined to name the student.Moments after the stabbings, Washko said, the suspect fled in a car belonging to one of the victims. Police gave chase and followed him for 20 miles (32 kilometers) into the city of Goldthwaite, where he crashed into the wall of a senior citizen center and was arrested, he said. No one, including the suspect, was injured in the crash.Washko said the 22-year-old was being held Friday in the Mills County jail but it’s not yet clear what charges he faces. The Mills County’s sheriff did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The woman who survived the stabbing was hospitalized in critical condition, Washko said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-dead-1-injured-in-central-texas-stabbings-police/story-uRUlp52xmWLLn92heZubhM.html

President Trump’s praise for the film came in the wake of a tweet posted by human rights campaigner and LGBTQ+ activist Peter Tatchells social media post praising the Ayushmann Khurrana starrer.“A new #Bollywood rom-com featuring a gay romance is hoping to win over older people, following the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Hurrah!” tweeted @PeterTatchell.To this, @realDonaldTrump tweeted: “Great!” Great! https://t.co/eDf8ltInmHThe retweet has been liked 16.3k times at the time of publishing the story.Given Trump administration’s view on gay rights, the ‘great’ tweet praising an Indian movie championing the cause, took twitterati by surprise. The tweet may be seen as a departure from Trump’s earlier view on the issue just ahead of his second presidential bid.Trump has repeatedly touted himself as an ally of the LGBT+ community, despite his administration curtailing the rights of trans people, including banning them from military service and urging the Supreme Court to ensure gay employees are not protected under the Civil Rights Act.Trump’s comment comes ahead of his 36-hour standalone visit to India. He will be travelling to Ahmedabad and Agra, apart from New Delhi. Trump is expected to be welcomed in Gujarat by 7-10 million people enroute to the Motera stadium.Gay sex was made legal by India’s Supreme Court in 2018 after judges cast off colonial-era legislation.‘Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan’ released on February 21 in India. The film stars Ayushmann Khurrana and debutant Jitendra Kumar in a small town setup, and also features the ‘Badhai Ho’ pair of Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao. The film is written and directed by debutant Hitesh Kewalya.The movie is a standalone sequel to the 2017 film ‘Shubh Mangal Saavdhan’. The film stars Ayushmann Khurrana as a gay man, and is being touted as the first mainstream gay love story in Bollywood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/great-tweets-donald-trump-on-ayushmann-khurrana-s-film-shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhan-championing-gay-rights/story-u1AGxUINszSB9TSjYFm7NO.html
22-02-2020||World||‘Act soon or get blacklisted’: FATF warns Pak on terror funding||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday warned Pakistan it faced the possibility of being added to the watchdog’s “black list” and face greater scrutiny of all transactions in its financial system if it fails to fully implement an action plan to counter terror financing by June.A statement issued by the multilateral watchdog’s president, Xiangmin Liu of China, at the conclusion of the FATF’s plenary meeting in Paris noted that all deadlines for the 27-point action plan had expired and expressed concerns at Pakistan’s failure to implement the plan according to agreed timelines.The FATF, which has been repeatedly assessing Pakistan’s efforts to implement the action plan since the country was placed on the watchdog’s “grey list” in June 2018, said Islamabad has “largely addressed” only 14 of the 27 action items, with “varying levels of progress” on the rest of the plan.“All deadlines in the action plan have expired. While noting recent and notable improvements, the FATF again expresses concerns given Pakistan’s failure to complete its action plan in line with the agreed timelines and in light of the [terror financing] risks emanating from the jurisdiction,” the statement said.It added: “The FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by June 2020.“Otherwise, should significant and sustainable progress especially in prosecuting and penalising [terror financing] not be made by the next Plenary, the FATF will take action, which could include the FATF calling on its members and urging all jurisdiction to advise their [financial institutions] to give special attention to business relations and transactions with Pakistan.”The reference to a “call to action” for countries to apply counter measures to protect the global financial system from money laundering and terror financing risks is the equivalent of being placed in the “black list”, which now has only Iran and North Korea.The FATF listed eight specific areas that Pakistan should focus on while implementing its action plan to address “strategic deficiencies”, including “effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all [UN Security Council Resolution] 1267 and 1373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services”.Among the UN-designated terrorists active on Pakistani soil are Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed, who was given a five-and-a-half year prison term in two terror financing cases four days before the FATF meetings began in Paris, Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and mob boss Dawood Ibrahim.Also among the eights areas listed by the FATF are “enforcement against TFS violations including administrative and criminal penalties and provincial and federal authorities cooperating on enforcement cases”; ensuring that facilities and services owned by designated person are deprived of resources; application of remedial actions and sanctions in terror financing and money laundering violations; demonstrating that competent authorities are cooperating and taking action against illegal money or value transfer services; demonstrating the implementation of cross-border currency and BNI controls at all ports of entry; demonstrating that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity and that investigations and prosecutions target designated persons and entities; and demonstrating that prosecutions result in “effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions”.The statement listed “risk-based supervision and pursuing domestic and international cooperation to identify cash couriers” among the areas where Pakistan has made progress.Unlike the reports issued after plenary meetings during the US presidency of the FATF, which named terror groups such as LeT, JeM, Haqqani Network, Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, Islamic State and al-Qaeda, the latest report didn’t go into specifics.There was no immediate response to the FATF report from Indian officials.A person familiar with developments, who declined to be named, said Indian authorities would be satisfied with Pakistan’s retention on the grey list as it meant the country hadn’t been let off.The person added: “Pakistan is under considerable pressure to perform with regard to the FATF’s parameters. Black-listing is always there, but keep in mind that the moment you black list a country, it is beyond the pale. As long as they’re grey listed, they’re still on the hook.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-deadlines-have-ended-fatf-s-sharp-warning-to-pakistan-on-terror-funding/story-uOCJs2QunMz4KZZdxhDW6L.html
