His remarks were published by state media late Saturday.“On Jan. 22, in light of the epidemic’s rapid spread and the challenges of prevention and control, I made a clear request that Hubei province implement comprehensive and stringent controls over the outflow of people,” Xi told a meeting of the party’s standing committee, its top body.The number of new cases in mainland China fell for a third straight day, China’s National Health Commission reported Sunday. The 2,009 new cases in the previous 24-hour period brought the total to 68,500.Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the percentage of severe cases had dropped to 7.2% of the total from a peak of 15.9% on Jan. 27. The proportion is higher in Wuhan, the Hubei city where the outbreak started, but has fallen to 21.6%.“The national efforts against the epidemic have shown results,” Mi said at the commission’s daily media briefing.Taiwan on Sunday reported its first death from the virus, the fifth fatality outside of mainland China. The island also confirmed two new cases, raising its total to 20.Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported that the person who died was a man in his 60s living in central Taiwan. He had not traveled overseas recently and had no known contact with virus patients, CNA said, citing Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung.China reported 142 more deaths, almost all in Hubei, raising mainland China’s death toll to 1,665. Another 9,419 people have recovered from COVID-19, a disease caused by a new coronavirus, and have been discharged from hospitals.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an experts meeting to discuss measures to contain the virus in his country, where more than a dozen cases have emerged in the past few days without any obvious link to China.“The situation surrounding this virus is changing by the minute,” Abe said.Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the country is “entering into a phase that is different from before,” requiring new steps to stop the spread of the virus.Hundreds of Americans on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan were awaiting charter flights home, as Japan announced another 70 infections had been confirmed on the Diamond Princess. Canada, Hong Kong and Italy said they were planning similar flights.Japan now has 413 confirmed cases, including 355 from the cruise ship, and one death from the virus.Xi’s role was muted in the early days of the epidemic, which has grown into one of the biggest political challenges of his seven-year tenure.The disclosure of his speech indicates top leaders knew about the outbreak’s potential severity at least two weeks before such dangers were made known to the public. It was not until late January that officials said the virus can spread between humans and public alarm began to rise.Zhang Lifan, a commentator in Beijing, said it’s not clear why the speech was published now. One message could be that local authorities should take responsibility for failing to take effective measures after Xi gave instructions in early January. Alternatively, it may mean that Xi, as the top leader, is willing to take responsibility because he was aware of the situation, Zhang said.Trust in the government’s approach to outbreaks remains fractured after the SARS epidemic of 2002 and 2003, which was covered up for months.Authorities in Hubei and Wuhan faced public fury over their initial handling of the epidemic. In apparent response, the Communist Party’s top officials in Hubei and Wuhan were dismissed and replaced last week.Hubei announced Sunday that all vehicle traffic will be banned across the province, expanding on an existing ban in Wuhan, in another step to try to stop the spread of the virus. Exceptions will be made for vehicles involved in epidemic prevention and transporting daily necessities.The fall in new cases follows a spike of more than 15,000 announced on Thursday, when Hubei began to include those that had been diagnosed by a doctor but not yet confirmed by laboratory tests.The roughly 380 Americans aboard the cruise ship docked at Yokohama, near Tokyo, were given the option of taking U.S.-government chartered aircraft back to the U.S., where they would face another 14-day quarantine. Those going were to begin leaving the ship Sunday night. People with symptoms were to be banned from the flights.The Japanese defense ministry said around 300 of the Americans were preparing Sunday night to leave on buses to take them to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport.The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said Washington was evacuating the Americans because the passengers and crew members on board the Diamond Princess were at a high risk of exposure to the virus.About 255 Canadians and 330 Hong Kong residents are on board the ship or undergoing treatment in Japanese hospitals. There are also 35 Italians, of which 25 are crew members, including the captain.The American evacuees will be taken to Travis Air Force Base in California, with some continuing to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.Malaysia said it would not allow any more passengers from another cruise ship to transit the country after an 83-year-old American woman from the MS Westerdam tested positive for the virus.She was among 145 passengers who flew from Cambodia to Malaysia on Friday. Her husband also had symptoms but tested negative. The Westerdam was turned away from four ports around Asia before Cambodia allowed it to dock in Sihanoukville late last week.Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said that her country would bar cruise ships that came from or transit any Chinese ports from docking.Cambodia said earlier that all 1,455 passengers on the Holland America-operated ship had tested negative for the virus.___Associated Press writer Ken Moritsugu and researcher Henry Hou in Beijing and writers Yuri Kageyama and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Sopheng Cheang in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Frances D’Emilio in Rome and Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-s-early-involvement-in-virus-outbreak-raises-questions/story-sxSxwNsRreuTWMupWglp4K.html
16-02-2020||World||Trump doesn’t want war ahead of 2020 vote: Iran||Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that he doesn’t believe the US will pursue war with his country, because it will harm President Donald Trump’s 2020 reelection bid.Rouhani said that Trump knows that war with Iran will “ruin chances” his chances of winning the 2020 U.S. presidential election.The Iranian leader added that war would be harmful to US interests and those of its regional allies, as well as Iran.“I think the Americans aren’t after war since they know what harm it could do them,” said Rouhani in a news conference.He said that Persian Gulf nations like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar stood a lot to lose if conflict between Iran and the US turns to war.Tehran and Washington came close to an open conflict in January, when a US drone strike killed Iran’s top general, Qasem Soleimani, outside Baghdad. Iran retaliated with missile strikes on a base housing US troops in Iraq.Tensions have been escalating steadily since Trump pulled the US out of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.Rouhani reiterated that the U.S. should rejoin the nuclear deal if it wants to return to negotiations.“We will finally get the enemy to sit at the negotiating table some day, like before,” said Rouhani, referring to the U.S.Rouhani also encouraged Iranians to turnout in large numbers for parliamentary elections on Friday, as a show of defiance against the US“Americans will not be happy with a high-turnout,”he said. “Surely they will be happy with a low-turnout election.”Iran’s parliamentary elections are seen as a test of the popularity of Rouhani’s relatively moderate and pro-reform bloc led. His government, however, has mostly struggled to deliver on campaign promises to improve people’s lives as Iran’s economy buckles under the weight of US sanctions.Iranian authorities have also barred thousands of parliamentary candidates from running, mainly reformists and moderates.Friday’s elections could strengthen the hand of Iranian hard-liners, who champion confronting the West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-doesn-t-want-war-ahead-of-2020-vote-iran/story-sdw9Ujl9mY517tN3YB846O.html
16-02-2020||World||Ivanka Trump lauds Saudi, UAE on women’s rights reforms||Ivanka Trump lauded Sunday a handful of Mideast countries, including close US allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, for embarking on “significant reforms” to advance women’s rights, while speaking at a gathering of women entrepreneurs and regional leaders in Dubai.The daughter of US President Donald Trump was delivering the keynote address at the two-day Global Women’s Forum held in an opulent resort overlooking the city’s Persian Gulf coastline.“We know that when women are free to succeed, families thrive, communities flourish and nations are stronger,” Trump said.The theme of the forum in Dubai was “The Power of Influence.” It was an apt theme for Trump, whose loyalty and support for her father’s presidency saw her and her husband, Jared Kushner, take up formal roles in the White House as his advisers.The 38-year-old mother of three has positioned herself as an Oval Office confidante while spearheading initiatives that broadly back women’s empowerment. Her husband has become a top adviser on US Mideast policy.Once the owner of an eponymous fashion line, Ivanka Trump has wielded her proximity to the president to promote policies affecting women and deliver speeches around the world about women’s economic empowerment. She meets with world leaders as a key White House official. Some of her efforts even have some bipartisan support in Washington, standing in sharp contrast to the level of controversy and political division surrounding her father’s presidency.In her keynote speech at the women’s forum in Dubai on Sunday, Trump touted what she said was the progress of women in the United States.“Today, American women are leading in every aspect of society. Last year, there were more women than men in the United States workforce, with women securing over 70 per cent of new jobs,” she said in her address.Trump made no mention, however, of legislative obstacles in the US around paid family leave, which she and the US president support. Currently, just a few US states offer paid leave.While questions continue to swirl over just how much influence she wields with her father, the US president gave a glimpse into their relationship in 2017 when he wrote on Twitter: “She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing!” She’s previously said that when she disagrees with her father, “he knows it”.During her speech in Dubai, Trump congratulated Saudi Arabia for recent changes in the law that allow women to travel abroad and obtain a passport without the permission of a male relative. In 2018, a ban on women driving cars was lifted. The changes are part of a wide-ranging push to transform the Saudi economy, attract greater foreign investment and ease international criticism.Trump pointed to changes in other Mideast countries, as well. She said Bahrain had introduced legislation against discrimination in the workplace; Jordan had eliminated legal restrictions on women’s ability to work at night; Morocco had expanded women’s land rights; and Tunisia had introduced laws to combat domestic violence.She said, though, more work needed to be done. She noted that across the region, women on average still have only half the legal rights of men.The audience for her speech in the UAE included Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Crown Prince Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, World Bank President David Malpass and International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva.The Dubai ruler is wildly popular at home and is seen as a modernising force. He has, however, faced some criticism abroad concerning women’s rights following reports that one of his daughters tried to flee the country and was forcibly returned. In previous years, Jordanian Princess Haya, with whom Sheikh Mohammed has two children, would have attended a forum of this kind by his side, but she too has reportedly fled the country and is seeking custody of their children in a British court.The UAE and Saudi Arabia have worked to cultivate close ties with the Trump administration and were early supporters of the Women’s Empowerment Fund, a World Bank initiative to help female entrepreneurs that Ivanka Trump strongly backs. During the first trip abroad of her father’s presidency to Saudi Arabia, the two Gulf countries pledged USD 100 million to the fund.In her speech at Sunday’s forum, Trump lauded Emirati leaders for “removing barriers to women joining the workforce and developing a national strategy that recognizes that women are central to sustainable growth.” She noted that although 70 per cent of Emirati university graduates are women, only 10 per cent of the UAE’s total national income is derived from women.“We know that this going to grow and flourish in the years ahead,” she said.During her two-day visit to the UAE, Trump met with women entrepreneurs and discussed a US government project she’s leading that’s aimed at helping women in developing countries. The Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative was launched last year with backing by her father.On Saturday, she toured Abu Dhabi’s grand mosque, visited Abu Dhabi’s branch of the Louvre Museum, and met privately with the country’s day-to-day ruler, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-lauds-saudi-uae-on-women-s-rights-reforms/story-kd8snYQFtR0qcibdH6UVHO.html

16-02-2020||World||India to send medical supplies to China to help in tackling coronavirus||India will send a consignment of medical supplies to China to assist it in the ongoing coronavirus (covid19), Vikram Misri, the Indian ambassador has said.Misri, in a video posted on the official Twitter handle of the Indian embassy in China, expressed his solidarity with Chinese people and the government in the fight against the epidemic.“As a concrete step to tackle the outbreak, India will soon send a consignment of medical supplies to aid and assist China in tackling this outbreak,” Misri said.“This is a concrete measure which will fully demonstrate the goodwill, solidarity and friendship of the people and government of India with the Chinese people,” Misri said, adding that India would do everything within its means to support the people of China in this hour of crisis.“The people of the city of Wuhan and the province of Hubei are the worst affected by the epidemic. They have a very special place in the hearts of the Indian people. With courage, persistence and effective measures we will be able to overcome the crisis,” the ambassador tweeted.He expressed hope that the epidemic will be effectively controlled in the very near future, praising the “determination of the Chinese people and government in dealing with this epidemic” being “evident” to the world.Misri said: “At present India is also facing the threat of infections from the novel coronavirus epidemic. Our country is working hard to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-to-send-medical-supplies-to-china-to-help-in-tackling-coronavirus/story-usRKCYT0j0aUk5c1cruUSO.html
16-02-2020||World||Coronavirus could damage global growth in 2020: IMF||The coronavirus epidemic could damage global economic growth this year, the IMF head said Sunday, but a sharp and rapid economic rebound could follow.“There may be a cut that we are still hoping would be in the 0.1-0.2 percentage space,” the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, told the Global Women’s Forum in Dubai.She said the full impact of the spreading disease that has already killed more than 1,600 people would depend on how quickly it was contained.“I advise everybody not to jump to premature conclusions. There is still a great deal of uncertainty. We operate with scenarios, not yet with projections, ask me in 10 days,” Georgieva said.In its January update to the World Economic Outlook, the IMF lowered global economic growth forecast in 2020 by a 0.1 percentage point to 3.3 percent, following a 2.9 percent growth the previous year, the lowest in a decade.Georgieva said it was “too early” to assess the full impact of the epidemic but acknowledged that it had already affected sectors such as tourism and transportation.“It is too early to say because we don’t yet quite know what is the nature of this virus. We don’t know how quickly China will be able to contain it. We don’t know whether it will spread to the rest of the world,” she said.If the disease is “contained rapidly, there can be a sharp drop and a very rapid rebound”, in what is known as the V-shaped impact, she said.Compared to the impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002, she said China’s economy then made up just 8.0 percent of global economy. Now, that figure is 19 percent.She said the trade agreement between the United States and China, the world’s first and second economies, had reduced the disease’s impact on global economy.But the world should be concerned “about sluggish growth” impacted by uncertainty, said the IMF chief.“We are now stuck with low productivity growth, low economic growth, low interest rates and low inflation,” she told the Dubai forum, also attended by US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka and former British prime minister Theresa May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-could-damage-global-growth-in-2020-imf/story-Epwh8KQNcPQyjj1VY3XREM.html
16-02-2020||World||Coronavirus cases on Japan ship rise to 355||The number of people infected with the deadly new coronavirus on a quarantined ship off Japan has risen to 355, the country’s health minister said Sunday, as the United States, Canada and Hong Kong prepare to repatriate their residents on board.The figure is a jump of 70 cases from a government tally released Saturday and comes as Katsunobu Kato voiced worries that the rising infection count among the nation’s general population could mean the virus’s spread has entered a new phase.“So far, we have conducted tests for 1,219 individuals. Of those, 355 people tested positive,” Kato told a roundtable discussion for public broadcaster NHK on conditions aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.The vessel has been in quarantine since February 5 at the port of Yokohama near Tokyo and Japan’s efforts to control the viral infections on board have prompted international concern.The ship was carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew from more than 50 countries and territories when it docked and was placed in isolation, after authorities found a passenger who got off in Hong Kong during the voyage had tested positive for the virus.Japanese officials continued to find new infections among the passengers and crew and rushed them to local hospitals, while others have been told to stay inside their cabins during the 14-day quarantine period set to end Wednesday.The US was preparing Sunday to evacuate some of its citizens but said those repatriated will go through another two-week quarantine period at home.- Limited supplies -“Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases identified on board the Diamond Princess, the Department of Health and Human Services made an assessment that passengers and crew members on board are at high risk of exposure,” the US embassy said in a letter to its citizens on the boat.Hong Kong has also said it will offer its 330 city residents on board the chance to take a charter flight back.Canada announced a similar decision to repatriate its nationals.Japan has not been able to test all those on board due to limited supplies of testing kits, facilities and manpower, which are also needed by authorities tracking the spread of the virus on land.But the health ministry said Saturday that passengers older than 70 are being examined and those testing negative and in good health will be allowed to leave the ship from Wednesday.Tests on younger passengers were expected to start Sunday and healthy people will be allowed to get off after Wednesday, it said.Meanwhile, Japan has seen 53 infections across the nation, including a dozen new cases reported on Saturday and 13 cases among more than 760 Japanese nationals and their relatives repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the outbreak.Kato said Japan will boost efforts to encourage people with possible infections to quickly seek medical care.“If you look at the figures, we are seeing changing situations compared with before,” Kato said on the NHK show.“What we have to think about now is preventing cases from becoming severe and preventing deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-on-japan-ship-rise-to-355/story-yWx48vXxiz3hadP88sHAoI.html
16-02-2020||World||Two more Indians on board cruise ship off Japanese coast test positive for coronavirus||Two more Indians on board a quarantined cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the novel coronavirus even as India assured that it will provide all possible assistance to its nationals on the ship to return home after they test negative in the final coronavirus tests that would begin on Monday, the Indian Embassy said on Sunday. A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and 6 passengers, were among the 3,711 people on board the ship, Diamond Princess, that arrived at the Japanese coast earlier this month. The total number of people infected with COVID-19 on the ship rose to 355 on Sunday. “Over the last 2 days, 137 new cases on #DiamondPrincess tested positive for #COVID-19, including two Indian nationals, taken to onshore medical facilities for treatment. Three other Indian crew members, receiving treatment are responding well, with no fever or pain,” the Indian Embassy tweeted. Earlier, three Indian crew members tested positive for the virus and are receiving treatment. The Indian Embassy in a tweet said that the final tests for the COVID-19 on the ship would begin on February 17 and continue over multiple days. “Hoping our Indian nationals - braving the situation, to test negative, allowing them to travel back HOME. @IndianEmbTokyo stands ready for all possible assistance,” the mission said.On Saturday, it said that the condition of the three Indians infected with the virus was improving.The embassy said it was making efforts for early de-boarding of all the Indians from the ship after the end of the quarantine period and was in discussions with the Japanese government and the ship management company for the disembarkation modalities and welfare of Indians.The ship was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the COVID-19 on the ship.The embassy has also sent an email to all the Indian nationals on board the ship, assuring them of all help and assistance.They are also requested to follow the Japanese government’s health and quarantine protocols, the embassy said on its Facebook page.The Japanese government on Thursday announced that passengers aged 80 or older will be given the option to disembark the ship if they test negative for COVID-19. Those who meet the age requirement and have pre-existing conditions or are staying in rooms without balcony will be prioritised for disembarkation. No Indian national falls under this category, eligible for early disembarkation, the statement said on Friday. The death toll from China’s coronavirus epidemic climbed to 1,665 after 142 more people died, mostly in the worst-hit Hubei Province, and the confirmed cases jumped to 68,500, officials said on Sunday. The coronavirus outbreak originated in central China’s Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries, including India. Many countries have banned arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-more-indians-on-board-cruise-ship-off-japanese-coast-test-positive-for-coronavirus/story-ycWFKfZRw4ZH91S9NW0bMM.html

India expresses solidarity with China, will send medical supplies to contain coronavirus outbreakThe death toll from COVID-19 outbreak in China has climbed to 1,665 after 142 more people died, mostly in the worst-hit Hubei province, officials said on Sunday.“As a concrete step to tackle the outbreak, India will soon send a consignment of medical supplies to China,” Misri said, adding that this is a concrete measure which will fully demonstrate the goodwill, solidarity and friendship of the people and Government of India with the Chinese people.ALSO WATCH | Coronavirus: Sending medical help to China as goodwill gesture, says Harsh VardhanHe said India will do everything within its means to assist the people of China in this time of difficulty.Indian officials said the details of the aid required by China are being worked out and the consignment would be sent as soon as they are finalised. Also, India has lifted the ban and cleared some of the medical equipment ordered by the Chinese importers to meet the requirements.China has said that it needed medical masks, gloves and suits especially for the medical staff attending the virus affected patients. Masks also have become scarce in China in view of the nationwide demand in the last three weeks.“During the past few weeks, the entire world has borne witness to the severity of the novel coronavirus outbreak and the tremendous challenges posed by it,” Misri said in a video message released to Chinese media outlets on Sunday.“I wish to convey my solidarity and support to the Chinese people and Government in tackling this epidemic,” he said.“We feel deeply for the people and the families that are affected by this epidemic. I would particularly wish to express support for the people of Wuhan City and Hubei province who have been most affected by this epidemic, and who hold a very special place in the hearts of the people of India,” he said.Hubei and its capital Wuhan have become the epicentre of the virus and most of the fatalities in China have been reported from the province.“The determination of the Chinese people and Government in dealing with this epidemic is evident to all of us. We hope that it will be effectively controlled in the near future,” he said.Misri said that India is also facing the threat of infections from the novel coronavirus epidemic and the country is working hard to safeguard the health and wellbeing of its citizens.“I once again express my support for all people in China affected by this outbreak, and I hope through courage, persistence and effective measures, we will be able to overcome this epidemic,” he said.On February 9, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote to Chinese President Xi Jinping, offering India’s assistance to China to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang appreciated Modi’s offer and said, “India’s acts of goodwill fully demonstrate its friendship with China”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-to-send-medical-supplies-to-china-to-combat-coronavirus-indian-envoy/story-2uOtcUZgeKQ6gSV2lmFmhM.html
16-02-2020||World||‘I’d disown them’, says Joe Biden on Bernie Sanders’ aggressive supporters||As early voting surged in Nevada’s nominating contest, former Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on Saturday for not doing enough to control his most aggressive supporters.Biden’s attack during an interview for NBC’s “Meet The Press” came as he fights to rescue his struggling presidential bid and Sanders works to strengthen his strong standing with the contest speeding into a new phase. Biden also sought to downplay expectations for next Saturday’s Nevada caucuses, telling reporters that he did not need to win.In the interview, the former vice president seized on reports that Sanders’ supporters insulted and made online threats against leaders of an influential union that declined to endorse any of the eight candidates still in the Democratic race.“He may not be responsible for it, but he has some accountability,” Biden charged. He continued: “If any of my supporters did that, I’d disown them ... flat disown them.”The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Biden’s assertion.Earlier Saturday, the fiery progressive senator went on the offensive against his moderate competitors for accepting campaign cash from billionaires, although he declined to go after his opponents by name.“Democracy is not candidates going to the homes of billionaires raising money,” Sanders charged during a rally at a suburban Las Vegas high school.Both Biden and Pete Buttigieg have aggressively courted wealthy donors over the past year. Buttigieg met with donors behind closed doors in Seattle at roughly the same time Sanders made the comments.It was a familiar line of attack in a relatively unfamiliar setting as the 2020 primary contest descended upon Nevada for a weekend of frenzied campaigning, colored by mobile campaign billboards cruising the Las Vegas strip and a diverse set of voters weighing in for the first time.While the state’s formal presidential caucuses are still a week away, Democrats opened the first of four days of early voting across more than 80 locations. State party officials at some sites across Nevada were overwhelmed by long lines.In northern Nevada’s Washoe County, a line of more than 300 people snaked through aisles of book shelves at a public library as another 100 queued up at the county party’s headquarters. Dozens left without voting.A spokeswoman for the Nevada Democrats, Molly Forgey, downplayed concerns related to the large early turnout as the political world anxiously watched from afar less than two weeks after Iowa’s presidential caucuses turned disastrous.“We are happy to see the number of energized Democrats participating in our first ever early voting period,” Forgey said, noting that early voters have four days to participate. “Our volunteers and staff are working to make every site runs as efficiently as possible and to ensure every voter gets to make their voice heard.”Early votes cast on paper ballots will be added to in-person caucus votes made on Feb. 22, when Democrats will attend about 2,000 precinct meetings around the state. The Nevada State Democratic Party abandoned its plans to use an app like the one that caused trouble in Iowa and has scrambled to come up with a new system to tabulate results.Amid heightened concern over the process, several candidates were making urgent get-out-the-vote pushes with rallies and town halls ahead of a fundraising gala for the Las Vegas-based Clark County Democratic Party to feature a half-dozen White House hopefuls.Biden, looking to Nevada’s diverse electorate to help revive his campaign after weak finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, seized on President Donald Trump’s hard-line policy and incendiary rhetoric on immigration as he courted voters.“Everybody knows how Donald Trump is. We gotta let him know who we are,” Biden said, drawing a roar from about 100 campaign volunteers gathered at a Las Vegas middle school gymnasium for a Latino organizing event.Biden thanked the volunteers, emphasized the importance of the Latino vote and touted his relationships with unions. He later told reporters that he didn’t need to win Nevada’s caucuses to mount a comeback.“I just have to do well,” the former vice president said when asked what he needs out of the state. Asked whether he has to win, he replied, “No, I don’t think I have to, but I think we have a shot at winning.”Former Sen. Harry Reid, an icon in Nevada’s Democratic politics, told reporters that “people should not be counting Joe Biden out of the race yet,” but also offered warm words for Sanders’ candidacy. When asked he downplayed concerns from some Democrats that Sanders might hurt other candidates should he become the nominee.“I care a great deal about Bernie Sanders. And he has gotten where he has by having people support him,” said the 80-year-old Reid. “And so I’m not going to be critical of Bernie Sanders.”Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, also reeling after a weak performance last week in New Hampshire, looked to Nevada’s women for momentum.The Massachusetts senator pitched her universal childcare plan as she addressed about 30 people, mostly women, at a downtown Las Vegas reggae and cocktail bar. After being introduced by actress Yvette Nicole Brown, Warren said her childcare plan would be paid for by a wealth tax of 2 cents on every dollar for fortunes of more than $50 million.“It’s good for our babies,” Warren said. “Think about what it means for every mama. Every mama who can now finish her education, even if she’s just had a baby. Every mama and every daddy who could take a job.”Mike Bloomberg, who isn’t competing in Nevada as part of a strategy to skip the first four states voting for a nominee, was on the cusp of qualifying for Wednesday’s presidential debate in La Vegas. The billionaire businessman and former New York mayor has increasingly become a target of the Democratic Party’s far-left wing as national polls show suggest he is on the rise.Both Warren and Sanders criticized the role of big money in politics and billionaires seeking the presidency. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer are in that category.“Democracy is not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to get elected. Democracy is when working people stand up, fight for justice,” Sanders declared.The campaign of Bloomberg, who campaigned Saturday in Virginia, announced the opening of seven new campaign offices in Florida, bringing the total to 10. The former New York mayor has more than 2,000 paid staff spread out across the nation and has already spent over $300 million on TV, radio and digital advertising, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics.___Peoples reported from New York.

16-02-2020||World||‘Exercising newly won freedom’: Saudi women on smoking in public||Rima settles in a chair at an upscale Riyadh cafe, looks around carefully, and seeing no one she recognises, drags on her electronic cigarette and exhales a cloud of smoke.“I feel that smoking in public is a part of exercising my newly won freedoms. I am happy that now that I can choose,” the 27-year-old Saudi who works for a private company in the capital told AFP.Like Western feminists of the early 20th century, in an era of social change in Saudi Arabia some women are embracing cigarettes, shisha pipes or vaping as a symbol of emancipation.The sight of women smoking in public has become much more common in recent months, an unthinkable prospect before the introduction of sweeping reforms in the ultra-conservative kingdom.The kingdom’s ambitious de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has rolled out an array of economic and social innovations to project a moderate, business-friendly image.Women are now allowed to drive, attend public sporting events and concerts, and obtain passports without the approval of a male guardian. Rima, who started smoking two years ago, dismisses concerns about the harmful effects of tobacco, but is worried her family will find out.She says she is prepared for a showdown.“I won’t tell them that this is about my personality liberty, because they won’t understand that women are free to smoke like men,” said Rima, dressed in a traditional black abaya with gold embroidery matching the hijab that covered her hair.Najla, 26, who like Rima asked to use a pseudonym, said that despite the rapid social changes, double standards still existed, and that it was still considered a “scandal and disgrace” if women smoked.The only woman lighting up amid several tables of male smokers, she said she intended to “challenge society” and ignore the occasional dirty looks.“My rights will be fully respected when my family accepts me as a smoker,” she said, recalling that a friend was sent to an addiction clinic when her parents found out about her smoking.Najla started smoking while still a school student, and like her, up to 65 percent of female Saudi high schoolers light up secretly, according to a 2015 study by the medical faculty at King Abdulaziz University cited by Arab News. ‘Everything is allowed’Despite the limitations, in a country where until just a few years ago religious police would chase and hit women for infractions like wearing nail polish or allowing a strand of hair to escape from their hijab, the changes have been head-spinning.“Most of our women clients order shisha. It’s something that was totally unimaginable just three months ago,” a Lebanese waiter told AFP at an upscale cafe in north Riyadh. Heba, a 36-year-old longtime smoker who sat at a table nearby, described growing up in a closed country where “everything was forbidden to women”. “I never imagined I would be able to smoke shisha in public next to men,” she told AFP.“Now, everything is allowed. Women venture out without hijab, without abaya and they even smoke publicly.”But even as the kingdom has introduced reforms, it has attracted condemnation for a heavy-handed crackdown on dissidents including intellectuals, clerics and female activists.In 2018, authorities arrested at least a dozen women activists just before the historic lifting of the decades-long ban on female motorists.Many of the detained have accused interrogators of sexual harassment and torture. Saudi authorities reject the accusations.“There is no doubt that at the persona level there is more freedom,” said Walid al-Hathloul, whose sister Loujain is on trial over allegations of having contacts with foreign media and diplomats.“But the reforms in favour of women are part of a public relations campaign to improve the kingdom’s human rights record,” he told AFP.“The arrest and demonisation of women activists is proof of this -- it’s designed so that the reforms will not be credited to the activists,” he told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-women-on-smoking-in-public-exercising-newly-won-freedom/story-sV4vSnljxciHWIfOhvD05H.html
16-02-2020||World||Hong Kong to arrange flights to take home passengers from Diamond Princess ship||The Hong Kong government will send aircraft to Japan to bring back passengers from the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, where the most coronavirus infections outside China have occurred.In a statement late on Saturday, the Security Bureau said chartered flights would return Hong Kong residents to the city for free once Japanese authorities had confirmed the plan.The passengers will be required to undergo a further 14 days of quarantine after arriving in Hong Kong, the bureau added.The cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp and carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew, has been quarantined in Yokohama since Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it travelled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus.There are around 330 Hong Kong residents on board, including 260 holding Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong passports and roughly 70 people with foreign ones.The cruise liner’s quarantine is set to end on Wednesday.In Hong Kong, there have been 56 confirmed cases of coronavirus and one death.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has called on residents to stay indoors as much as possible to curb the risk of a possible community outbreak in the global financial centre where, shopping malls, restaurants and cafes are almost deserted.Anger has been brewing over Lam’s handling of the crisis, with critics calling on her to shut the entire border with mainland China and some medical workers going on strike.On Saturday, hundreds of anti-government protesters, many wearing surgical masks and dressed in black, marched in multiple neighbourhoods against plans to potentially turn some buildings into coronavirus quarantine centres. They also reiterated calls for the closure of the mainland China border.Lam has said such a move would be “inappropriate”, “impractical” and “discriminatory”.Latest figures from Beijing on Sunday showed 68,500 cases of the illness and 1,665 deaths, mostly in Hubei province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-arrange-flights-to-take-home-passengers-from-diamond-princess-ship/story-OKAWGK15ZNimLNDbgrvfuL.html
16-02-2020||World||Iran says Donald Trump is wrong if he thinks Tehran regime will collapse||Iran’s foreign minister said Saturday that US President Donald Trump is receiving bad advice if he believes an American “maximum pressure” campaign against his country will cause the government in Tehran to collapse.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told a group of top defence officials and diplomats at the Munich Security Conference that the information provided to the president has dissuaded Trump from accepting offers from other leaders to mediate between Washington and Tehran.“President Trump has been convinced that we are about to collapse so he doesn’t want to talk to a collapsing regime,” Zarif said.To support his argument, the Iranian minister cited Trump’s decision to pull out unilaterally in 2018 from Iran’s nuclear deal with the US and other world powers. Trump said the landmark 2015 accord didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program or regional activities and needed to be renegotiated.Since then, the Trump administration’s re-imposition of US sanctions in a campaign of so-called “maximum pressure” have taken a severe toll on the Iranian economy and sent Iran’s currency plunging.“I believe President Trump, unfortunately, does not have good advisers,” Zarif said. “He’s been wanting for Iran to collapse since he withdrew from the nuclear deal.” Zarif also said the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Iraq on January 3 was a miscalculation by Washington that has galvanized support for Iran instead of increasing pressure on the regime.The Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, promised Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. It was intended to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb, which Iran insists it does not want to do.Since the US withdrawal, the deal’s other signatories - Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China - have unsuccessfully struggled to come up with ways to offset the effects of the new American sanctions.Washington has pressured the other countries - so far without success - to abandon the deal entirely US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the Munich Security Conference earlier Saturday that while there may be disagreements on what to do with the JCPOA, “when I talk to my counterparts here in Europe, everybody gets it.” “Everyone understands that these are folks who continue to build out their nuclear program,” Pompeo said. “So there’s a common understanding about the threat; we have tactical differences on how to proceed.” In recent months, Iran has steadily violated the limitations the deal placed on the amount of enriched uranium and heavy water it can stockpile, the number and type of centrifuges it can operate, and the purity of the uranium it enriches.Iranian officials insist the moves are intended only to put pressure on the countries that remain part of the deal to provide economic help to Iran and that all the measures taken are fully reversible.However, the so-called “breakout” time it would take for Iran to build a bomb decreases with every step.Zarif rejected Trump’s suggestion of negotiating a new deal, saying the one negotiated during the Obama administration was the only vehicle for talks on Iran’s nuclear program.“There is no point in talking over something you already talked about. You don’t buy a horse twice,” he said.“It’s not about opening talks with the United States. It’s about bringing the United States to the negotiating table that’s already there,” Zarif said.

A family lawyer said Flack had killed herself and was found in her London apartment.Flack hosted “Love Island” from its launch in 2015, but stepped down last year after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton. She denied the charge and was scheduled to stand trial starting next month.British commercial network ITV, which broadcasts the show, said in a statement that “everybody at ‘Love Island’ and ITV is shocked and saddened by this desperately sad news.”“Caroline was a much loved member of the ‘Love Island’ team, and our sincere thoughts and condolences are with her family and friends,” the network statement said.The sixth season of the show is currently airing. The next new episode is due to be broadcast Sunday, although an episode of unseen footage was scheduled to air later Saturday.“Love Island” deposits young and attractive contestants in a tropical paradise, where they must pair up or risk being exiled. Critics claim the program puts vulnerable young people under intense scrutiny and pressure, increased by blanket tabloid newspaper coverage of the show.Two former “Love Island” contestants, Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis, died by suicide in 2018 and 2019.Their deaths renewed a debate about the ethics of reality TV that has raged in the UK since producers started making British equivalents of sensationalist American programs like “The Jerry Springer Show” two decades ago, putting ordinary people under a microscope on reality shows such as “Big Brother.”Flack’s career, though, blossomed after she won the BBC show “Strictly Come Dancing” in 2014, the British version of “Dancing With The Stars.” Fellow TV presenters expressed shock over her death Saturday.Talk show most Piers Morgan tweeted that Flack “was a fun, bright & sparky person whose whole world collapsed recently, both professionally & personally. She told me it had been the worst time of her life, and was clearly struggling to cope with losing everything she held dear. This is such sad, awful news.”Another well-known host, Eamonn Holmes, tweeted: “Caroline Flack .... Dear God. Shocked beyond belief. May she have found peace . #Rip Has to be repercussions for Love Island now surely?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-love-island-host-caroline-flack-found-dead-in-london-home/story-euc7fPBZ0OnZU1x3HJFijN.html
16-02-2020||World||After cities, China quarantines cash to control coronavirus outbreak||China is sanitising large volumes of old currency notes for at least two weeks before redistributing them to contain the spread of the coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak from spreading through possibly infected paper cash.China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), has also pumped in billions in new notes in the worst-hit central Chinese province of Hubei for the safety of citizens and bank staff dealing with cash.The central bank has given the order to “withdraw cash from key areas for epidemic prevention and control, disinfect them with ultraviolet or high temperature, and store them for more than 14 days before putting them in the market,” Fan Yifei, the PBOC deputy government said at a press conference on Saturday.Money circulated in less riskier areas is also subject to a week of “quarantine” – or stored for a week – before being put back in circulation.Commercial lenders have been asked to separate cash from hospitals and food markets, he said.The rules have been put in place under the principles of “Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Security of Cash Use During Epidemic Prevention and Control”.Fan said around January 17, the PBOC “…allocated nearly 600 billion yuan of new banknotes ($85 billion) to the country, and hurriedly put 4 billion yuan of new banknotes into Wuhan before the Spring Festival, which improved the sense of security of bank branch staff and people handling cash operations,” Fan said.“The suspension of inter-provincial cash transfers and intra-provincial transfers in some severely affected areas has minimized personnel movements and reduced the risk of infection and transmission in transit,” Fan was quoted in a Chinese transcript provided by China’s state council information office.It is helping that China’s electronic payment market is already robust and rapidly expanding.In 2018, 82.39 percent of Chinese adults used electronic payments, up 5.49 percentage points from the previous year, according to a report on inclusive finance from the People’s Bank of China issued late last year.In rural areas, the proportion went up 5.64 percentage points to 72.15 percent.Online payments handled by banking financial institutions totaled 2,126.3 trillion yuan (about 300.9 trillion U.S. dollars), up 2.47 percent year on year, the report showed.Mobile payments handled by these institutions stood at 277.39 trillion yuan, surging 36.69 percent from the previous year.Online transactions through non-bank payment service providers jumped 45.23 percent year on year to 208.07 trillion yuan, said the report.Meanwhile, payments via mobile banking in rural areas rose 34.26 percent to 52.21 trillion yuan, according to the report.“It should be said that China’s electronic payment is still relatively advanced,” Fan said.“Recently, there have been some new cases in various places, such as ‘meatless vegetable baskets’. People pay for their orders on their mobile phones, and they can buy fresh and affordable meat, eggs, vegetables and fruits without going out, which has solved a major problem in people’s lives during the epidemic,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanitises-old-currency-notes-against-coronavirus-with-ultraviolet-rays-high-temperature/story-fSJXknU0PzxbmYpdVwCmSM.html
