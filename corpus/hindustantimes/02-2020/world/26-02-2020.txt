She has not come close to the top in any of the four caucuses and primaries held so far.Warren is fighting to stay in the race, as former mayor Pete Buttigieg - who has fared better in the primaries with a tie and a close second finish; Senator Amy Klobuchar and billionaire Tom Steyer. Bloomberg has not contested any yet.Biden finished second in Nevada. But he is hoping to take charge of the race as the frontrunner he had been for a month until upstaged recently by Sanders. Heavily black state of South Carolina is where he plans to turn around his fortunes, and picked up the endorsement Wednesday of Jim Clyburn, a senior and influential African American congressman.“I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,” Clyburn said, announcing his endorsement.Biden needs a win in South Carolina, and he is facing questions he will stay in the race if he doesn’t. He has a double-digit lead in polls over his rivals in the state, but he has seen the gap shrink. Steyer, the billionaire, has put in a considerable amount of time and money there, his exchanges with Biden were noticeably sharp on the debate stage.Sanders is seeking to expand his base, building on his emphatic win in Nevada, an ethnically and racially diverse state that is more representative of the country and the Democratic party than the white-majority Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that held the first two nominating contests.All eyes are on the Super Tuesday contests on March 3, when 14 states hold their nominating contests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-nomination-warren-shines-sanders-mauled-biden-wins-key-endorsement/story-u1umR4tlAJXThKIXHoBUKN.html

Lombardy is the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, and there have been hundreds of confirmed cases there as well as several deaths.Sao Paulo’s Albert Einstein Institute, where the man received medical attention, carried out respiratory tests, and the Adolfo Lutz Institute in the same city carried out the subsequent test confirming the virus The man was in stable condition and in isolation at home in Sao Paulo.Brazil’s national health agency Anvisa has been working to map all contact the man had with other people in the hospital, at home, and on the plane returning to Brazil. Yesterday Anvisa requested the flight manifest to investigate other possible cases.Due to the spread of the virus worldwide, Brazil adopted the preventative measure of broadening its critieria for analysis of suspected cases on Monday. The Health Ministry had determined that people with fever and flu symptoms returning from Italy and six other countries should be considered suspected cases. Those countries are Germany, France, Australia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines.The countries already on that watch list were China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, North Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-brazilian-patient-tests-positive-for-novel-coronavirus-first-case-in-latin-america/story-2o9hzwfUJ6On5KkVvKSRBI.html
26-02-2020||World||More novel coronavirus cases reported daily outside China than inside: WHO||There are now more new cases of the coronavirus reported each day outside China than inside the hardest-hit country, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday.“Yesterday, the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told diplomats in Geneva, according to a written version of his speech.The UN health agency put the number of new cases in China at 411 on Tuesday and those registered outside the country stood at 427.Governments worldwide are scrambling to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus after a surge of infections in Italy, Iran and South Korea.Tedros said the “sudden increase of cases” in those countries was “deeply concerning”, adding that a WHO team would travel to Iran this weekend to evaluate the situation.While new case numbers and deaths are dwindling at the disease epicentre in China, the country remains by far the hardest hit.Tedros said that as of Wednesday morning, 78,190 cases of COVID-19 had been registered in China, including 2,718 deaths.That compares with 2,790 cases and 44 deaths reported across 37 other countries.But WHO has said the epidemic in China peaked and on February 2 and has been declining since.Bruce Aylward, who headed a WHO-backed expert mission to China, hailed the drastic quarantine and containment measures taken by Beijing, saying the country had “changed the course” of the outbreak.But he told reporters in Geneva that other nations were “simply not ready”.In Wednesday’s speech, Tedros acknowledged that the hike in cases outside China had prompted a push for a pandemic to be declared.“We should not be too eager to declare a pandemic,” he said, stressing that such a declaration could “signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true.” “We are in a fight that can be won if we do the right things.” But he insisted that WHO would not hesitate to declare a pandemic “if it is an accurate description of the situation.” “I am not downplaying the seriousness of the situation, or the potential for this to become a pandemic, because it has that potential,” he said. “All countries, whether they have cases or not, must prepare for a potential pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-update-more-novel-coronavirus-cases-reported-daily-outside-china-than-inside-who/story-VN2iFxRjbD2C7rAIr1eVUP.html

The wealthy island state, an important regional financial centre and transport hub, has confirmed 91 cases so far.The health ministry on Wednesday said it had charged a 38-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus first surfaced late last year, and his wife who resides in Singapore for allegedly providing false information to authorities about their movements for contact tracing.The husband had been confirmed to be infected with the virus in late January, and has since recovered, while his wife had been quarantined due to her close contact with him.The health ministry said “detailed investigations” had established their true movements and they were charged “in view of the potentially serious repercussions of the false information...and the risk they could have posed to public health”.Charges under the Infectious Diseases Act are rare and this is the first case during the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore. First time offenders under the Act can be fined up to S$10,000 ($7,147) or imprisoned for six months, or both.Also on Wednesday, Singapore said a 45-year-old man lost his residency status after failing to comply with an order to stay at home for 14 days when he returned from China. The city-state - known for its tough laws - has also cancelled work passes and cut employers’ rights to hire foreigners for breaches of other virus prevention measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-novel-coronavirus-carrier-faces-jail-for-lying-about-location-in-singapore/story-tJQf1qhsOobgkGOYQMvHzL.html

He will step down as a working member of Britain’s royal on March 31, according to an arrangement approved by Queen Elizabeth.Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle have moved to Canada and intend to divide their time between Britain and Canada. After March 31, they will cease to receive public funds. The Travalyst conference is one of his last official engagements as the duke.Calling for sustainable growth in the tourism industry, the prince paid tributes to tourism in Scotland and said if action were not taken now, more destinations would have be closed to visitors.He told the delegates: “We want to hear truths and perspectives from across the industry. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, a lot of great work has already been done. But our research again shows that many of these endeavours have failed to reach the conscientiousness of consumers.”“We have to work together … to scale up the good practices already being used around the world. Scotland is a great example of what we mean. There is a holistic ambition to Scotland’s intent that can be adopted across the UK and even around the world”.“Scotland is one of the fastest-growing tourism destinations worldwide and it’s at the forefront of a more sustainable approach, which is why your insight into these issues is so incredibly valuable,” Prince Harry, who founded the Travalyst coalition of travel brands, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-call-me-harry-prince-tells-edinburgh-conference/story-mw4me2ZLU1NRKvzh8Ak9UK.html
26-02-2020||World||Worry over coronavirus outbreak has Chinese turning to online healthcare||Spooked by a sneeze or a cough, Chinese consumers are turning to online consultations in droves for advice about possible coronavirus symptoms - a boon for a fledgling industry that has struggled to win over customers. Due to the epidemic, hundreds of millions of Chinese are stuck at home due to quarantine restrictions imposed by authorities or companies. Even if not under quarantine, many are too worried to venture for long outside or to visit a hospital for other ailments as they fear they might catch the highly contagious virus.The surge of inquiries has also been driven by healthcare platforms offering some services for free amid the epidemic.JD Health, an arm of JD.com Inc, has seen its daily volume of respiratory-related online consultations jump by nine times while mental-health consultations have grown five to seven times, according to Xiao Jianbo, the company’s general manager of online healthcare. “Most of the requests I’ve had between the end of January and mid-February were about the coronavirus,” said Liu Yafeng, a doctor who works fulltime for JD Health. “People are so worried even just by a sneeze.”Such is the state of fretfulness that “Always thinking I’ve been infected by the virus” has become a trending topic with more than 570 million views on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like microblogging platform. Liu said he worked around 12 hours per day from end January to mid-February, but in a positive sign that panic about the epidemic is receding, he is now working eight hours a day. Baidu Inc said its online doctor consultation platform Wenyisheng, which translates to “Ask Doctor”, has been handling around 850,000 free inquiries daily. Of those 400,000 were respiratory-related, around 50 times the level seen a year earlier.Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd said it exceeded 100,000 consultations a day on Jan. 29 and that some of its respiratory doctors were providing more than 200 consultations daily. It did not provide comparisons with pre-outbreak levels.Online healthcare has long been seen as a promising sector in China, where there is a dearth of doctors and patients often have to travel hundreds of miles to see a specialist.But the industry had struggled to win over customers and big listed firms like Alibaba Health and Ping An Good Doctor have yet to turn a profit. Compared to other internet services, online healthcare is not used as frequently and does not benefit as much from word of mouth, industry executives say.“Health consultations are very private, so you don’t see a lot of people sharing their healthcare experience with friends or followers on social media,” said JD Health’s Xiao.The coronavirus has, however, reset expectations with shares in Alibaba Health surging 58% for the year to date while Ping An Good Doctor’s stock has climbed 33%.While analysts say more venture capital funding could soon flow into the sector, some industry veterans warn that the sector has a long way to go.“The outbreak has in fact educated the market, but I don’t think China’s online healthcare has really taken off because of this,” said Simon He, founding partner at Shanghai-based Eminence Ventures.That’s only going to happen with innovation in providing more services such as blood tests, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worry-over-coronavirus-outbreak-has-chinese-turning-to-online-healthcare/story-RL0dH5c4jGH6xB3CdGKrIO.html
26-02-2020||World||Two exhausted Wuhan nurses’ plea for international help in open letter||Two frontline Chinese nurses working in covid-19 outbreak epicentre Wuhan has appealed for international medical help, asking for medical workers from across the world to help them fight the epidemic.In an open letter published in the medical journal, The Lancet, nurses Yingchun Zeng and Yan Zhen wrote about the severe shortage of protective equipment, the day-to-day difficulties and the physical and mental exhaustion the 14000 nurses deployed in the city are facing.“Due to an extreme shortage of health-care professionals in Wuhan, 14000 nurses from across China have voluntarily come to Wuhan to support local medical health-care professionals,” they wrote.ALSO WATCH | Air India captain describes evacuation of Indians from Coronavirus-hit Wuhan“But we need much more help. We are asking nurses and medical staff from countries around the world to come to China now, to help us in this battle,” they said.Until Wednesday, the outbreak had killed 2718 and infected more than 78000 in China; more than 3200 medical workers have been infected and at least 20 have succumbed.The brief letter from the two nurses gives a glimpse of how the outbreak has overwhelmed the response to it.“The conditions and environment here in Wuhan are more difficult and extreme than we could ever have imagined. There is a severe shortage of protective equipment, such as N95 respirators, face shields, goggles, gowns, and gloves. The goggles are made of plastic that must be repeatedly cleaned and sterilised in the ward, making them difficult to see through,” they wrote.Yingchun and Yan are from two hospitals in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou and have been working in Wuhan for a month.They wrote in detail about how difficult it was to treat patients through layers of protective clothing.“When wearing a mask to speak with patients, our voices are muted, so we have to speak very loudly. Wearing four layers of gloves is abnormally clumsy and does not work—we can’t even open the packaging bags for medical devices, so giving patients injections is a huge challenge,” they wrote.Medical workers avoid eating for hours before entering the isolation ward, some nurses get blisters from wearing masks.They wrote about the psychological toll medical workers are going through.“While we are professional nurses, we are also human. Like everyone else, we feel helplessness, anxiety, and fear. Experienced nurses occasionally find the time to comfort colleagues and try to relieve our anxiety,” the two wrote.Besides comforting colleagues, the only other outlet is to occasionally cry.“But even experienced nurses may also cry, possibly because we do not know how long we need to stay here and we are the highest-risk group for COVID-19 infection”.Yingchun and Yan ended the letter with a prayer and a hope.“We hope the covid-19 epidemic will end soon and that people worldwide will remain in good health”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-exhausted-wuhan-nurses-plea-for-international-help-in-open-letter/story-MRpD4XuJL6MirJwusgB3cI.html
26-02-2020||World||US woman charged for being topless in front of stepchildren, accepts plea deal||A Utah woman has accepted a plea deal after being charged for being topless in front of her stepchildren in her own home.Tilli Buchanan opted for the plea to avoid having the criminal case go to trial and having to register as a sex offender if convicted, her attorney told local media.“She would have loved to take it up on appeal,” the attorney, Randy Richards, told the Salt Lake Tribune, describing the case as “ludicrous.”“But it was pretty much at my advice that she not -- not because I don’t think she would win, but there’s a possibility that if we go all the way to trial, she’d be convicted by a jury and then she had to be on the sex offender registry.”Buchanan had been charged with three misdemeanor counts of lewdness involving a child after her three stepkids aged nine to 13 saw her topless while she and her husband had been installing insulation in their garage.The husband was also topless but he was not charged.The couple had said they had stripped down to their underwear to avoid getting dirty.Buchanan was charged in early 2019 after the children’s mother reported the incident to authorities.She argued in court documents that if her husband could bare his chest, there was no reason she couldn’t.But prosecutors disagreed and underlined that lewdness includes a woman’s breasts in contemporary American society.In her plea on Tuesday, Buchanan admitted to exposing her breasts in front of an adult which “caused affront or alarm.” The charge will be dropped after a year as long as she does not commit another crime.“This whole thing is ridiculous,” her attorney said. “She (or other women) have to worry about their kids seeing them topless? It’s ridiculous.”He said his client had essentially pleaded guilty to being topless in front of her husband.The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, which was involved in the case, had said the charges against Buchanan amounted to prosecutorial overreach and should have never gone this far.“When I talk to people about the case I don’t think any of them realized they could be charged for a crime for walking around with their shirt off inside their own home,” ACLU attorney Leah Farrell previously told The New York Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-woman-charged-for-being-topless-in-front-of-stepchildren-accepts-plea-deal/story-Z9LrGv3M7Erxe64d0g90LN.html
26-02-2020||World||WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange was handcuffed 11 times and stripped naked, says lawyer||A lawyer for Julian Assange complained Tuesday that the WikiLeaks founder was handcuffed 11 times, stripped naked twice and had court papers taken away on the first day of a hearing on his extradition to the United States.Attorney Edward Fitzgerald told a judge that the treatment of Assange at London’s Belmarsh Prison “could be a contempt of this court.” The extradition hearing opened on Monday at Woolwich Crown Court, which is located next to the prison.District Judge Vanessa Baraitser, who is hearing the case, said she had no power to act unless Assange became unable to participate in the proceedings, which are expected to last several months.“If it comes to that, please let me know,” the judge said.Another lawyer for Assange, Gareth Peirce, told the judge on Tuesday that Assange was “struggling” and finding it hard to concentrate.Assange, 48, is wanted in the U.S. on espionage charges over the leaking of classified government documents a decade ago.U.S. prosecutors accuse Assange of conspiring with U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a password, hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.They allege that WikiLeaks’ publication of the unedited documents put U.S. intelligence sources who were mentioned in them at risk of torture of death.Assange says he was acting as a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection. His lawyers argue that the U.S. charges — which carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison — are a politically motivated abuse of power.Defense lawyers also deny that Assange put lives at risk. Attorney Mark Summers said that in 2010 WikiLeaks worked with international news organizations to publish the trove of files in edited form.He said that the following year Assange phoned the White House to warn that a password published in a book about WikiLeaks by journalists from The Guardian newspaper — one of WikiLeaks’ then-media partners — could allow people to view the full unredacted cache of documents. Summers said Assange had warned that “unless we do something, then people’s lives are put at risk.”WikiLeaks’ relationship with its media partners, which included The Guardian and The New York Times, soon soured, and in 2011 WikiLeaks began releasing large numbers of the uncensored documents.The Guardian said it was “entirely wrong to say the Guardian’s 2011 WikiLeaks book led to the publication of unredacted U.S. government files.”“The book contained a password which the authors had been told by Julian Assange was temporary and would expire and be deleted in a matter of hours,” the newspaper said in a statement. “The book also contained no details about the whereabouts of the files.”Assange has been jailed in England since April 2019, when he was evicted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. He took refuge in the embassy seven years earlier to avoid being sent to Sweden over allegations of rape and sexual assault.A British court handed him a 50-week sentence for jumping bail in 2012.The extradition hearing is expected to continue for the rest of the week, then take a break before resuming in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-was-handcuffed-11-times-and-stripped-naked-says-lawyer/story-GOBVLL1oqiXgA8rbbYtGJL.html
26-02-2020||World||Greece reports first novel coronavirus case||Greece on Wednesday reported its first coronavirus case, a woman who had recently travelled to northern Italy.A health ministry spokesman said the 38-year-old woman was in a Thessaloniki hospital and in good condition.The announcement comes as the COVID-19 virus continues to surge in Italy, making it the hardest-hit country in Europe.The Greek government on Tuesday said a shutdown of some public areas and travel restrictions would be activated in case of a mass outbreak.The measures, contained in a government decree, include temporary travel bans to and from countries with a large number of infections and enable beds to be requisitioned in hotels and private clinics.The decree also foresees the temporary closure of “indoor public gathering areas” such as schools, places of worship, cinemas, theatres, sports halls and businesses.“We are ready to do whatever is necessary to protect public health,” government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters.Greece’s health ministry has earmarked 13 hospitals nationwide to handle virus cases.A health ministry spokesman earlier this week noted that owing to the virus’ long gestation period, health checks at ports and airports had only minor chances of success.On Monday, the Greek Olympic Committee said it had discussed alternative plans for the Olympic Flame lighting ceremony for the Tokyo 2020 Games in case of a virus outbreak.The flame for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is scheduled to be lit on March 12 at the site of ancient Olympia and, following a torch relay on Greek soil, will be handed to the Tokyo organisers at a ceremony on March 19 at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-reports-first-coronavirus-case/story-Xkdus9a1731JuVe5wAG83K.html

She said the Punjab government, which was authorised by the IHC to decide Sharif’s case on medical grounds, had written several letters asking the self-exiled former premier to submit his medical report from any hospital in London, but he failed to do so and only sent a certificate which was not accepted by the medical board. “If he (Nawaz Sharif) is seriously ill then why a comprehensive medical report is not being submitted to the medical board,” she added. “The medical board wants to know exactly about ailment of Nawaz Sharif and its treatment and due to his lack of response the Punjab government has decided not to accept Sharif’s application regarding extension in his eight-week bail (that expired on December 24, 2019),” Awan added.She did not elaborate how Sharif could be declared an “absconder” legally, the paper reported.Sharif was granted bail on humanitarian grounds on November 4 last year by the Lahore High Court in the case.The former prime minister left for London on November 19 in an air ambulance.On December 24, 2018, an accountability court had sentenced Sharif to seven years in prison in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills corruption case and acquitted him in the Flagship case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-former-pm-nawaz-sharif-declared-absconder-by-government-report/story-fOOJ4sGqikHFC38H0yQS2K.html

That comes after the top official in charge of Iran’s response to the coronavirus tested positive for the illness after a day earlier trying to downplay the disease.Still, Rouhani sought to portray the virus crisis in terms of Iran’s tense relations with the U.S.“Coronavirus must not be turned into a weapon for our enemies to halt work and production in our country,” Rouhani said, according to a transcript posted to the Iranian presidency’s website.Iranian state television reported Wednesday that 19 people have been killed by the new coronavirus amid 139 confirmed cases in the country so far.The announcement by a state TV anchor came as Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour urged Iranians to avoid “nonessential travel,” particularly to the hard-hit provinces of the country such as Gilan and Qom.The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally, causing over 2,700 deaths, mainly in China. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19.Experts remain concerned that Iran may be underreporting cases and deaths, given the rapid spread from Iran across the Persian Gulf. Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, a hard-line lawmaker in Iran alleged Monday there had been 50 deaths in the Iranian city of Qom alone, which was denied by authorities.Rouhani’s estimate of as much as three weeks to control the virus comes after officials repeatedly downplaying the virus previously. That’s spark more concern among Iranians already angry over nationwide economic protests, the U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general and Iran accidentally shooting down a Ukrainian jetliner and then denying it for days. A recent parliamentary election also saw the country’s lowest-ever recorded turnout.A Health Ministry spokesman on Tuesday suggested it could take as long as late April to control the virus. And with the Persian New Year, or Nowruz, coming March 20, experts worry about the virus spreading even further across the country if not stopped by then.“Containment of the COVID-19 virus within Iran will be a challenge because of Iran’s poor health infrastructure and traditional unwillingness to communicate freely and openly across all branches of government and between health institutions,” the Austin, Texas private intelligence firm Stratfor said.That worry was echoed by analysts at the Eurasia Group.“Tehran is likely significantly underestimating the risk posed by an outbreak of coronavirus to its citizens, economy and neighbors,” the analysts wrote. “Iran has a relatively robust public health system, although it has been weakened by US sanctions. But a breakdown in national-level decision-making has severely hampered its ability contain the spread of the virus.”Meanwhile Wednesday, Egyptian airport officials said the country’s national carrier, EgyptAir, has indefinitely extended the suspension of its flights to and from China, for the safety of its passengers. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren’t authorized to brief journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-novel-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-19-in-iran-amid-139-infections/story-3NMtIvWrineYxbxgR9sRxJ.html

26-02-2020||World||Maldives gets Amal Clooney to fight for Rohingyas at UN court||The luxury tourist destination of the Maldives has hired prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney to represent it at the UN’s highest court in seeking justice for Myanmar’s persecuted Rohingya Muslims.The Maldivian government said Wednesday it will formally join the mainly Muslim African state of The Gambia in challenging Myanmar’s 2017 military crackdown that sent around 740,000 Rohingya fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh.In a unanimous ruling last month, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Buddhist-majority Myanmar to implement emergency measures to prevent the genocide of Rohingya -- pending a full case that could take years.Clooney successfully represented former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed and secured a UN decision that his 2015 jailing for 13 years was illegal.With the fall of strongman president Abdulla Yameen in 2018, Nasheed as well as several other dissidents in the Sunni Muslim nation of 340,000 have been cleared of any wrongdoing. Nasheed is currently the atoll nation’s speaker in the national legislature.The government said it welcomed the ICJ’s decision to order provisional measures to secure the rights of victims in Myanmar and prevent the destruction of evidence in the ongoing case.“Accountability for genocide in Myanmar is long overdue and I look forward to working on this important effort to seek judicial remedies for Rohingya survivors,” Clooney was quoted as saying by the Maldivian government.Thousands are suspected to have been killed in the Rohingya crackdown and refugees brought widespread reports of rape and arson by Myanmar’s military and local Buddhist militias.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-gets-amal-clooney-to-fight-for-rohingyas-at-un-court/story-nRwajvlKJUC09RJbTlmeON.html

26-02-2020||World||Bangladesh postpones Rohingya refugee island relocation again||Bangladesh has yet again shelved a controversial plan to relocate some 100,000 Rohingya refugees to a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, a minister said Wednesday.Authorities have long sought to relocate some of the country’s million-plus Rohingya population to Bhashan Char, despite warnings the silty strip of land was prone to violent and potentially deadly monsoon storms.The move would take some pressure off the overcrowded border camps home to huge numbers of the persecuted and stateless Muslim minority, most of whom fled neighbouring Myanmar in 2017 after a brutal military crackdown. But rights groups say that some refugees had been coerced into agreeing to relocation and the plan has been staunchly opposed by the Rohingya community at large. Junior disaster management minister Enamur Rahman said Bangladesh would increase its focus on diplomatic talks aimed at returning the refugees home. “The relocation plan has been postponed,” he told AFP, adding that there had been “much progress” in repatriation discussions with Myanmar with China acting as intermediary. Bangladesh and Myanmar have already signed a repatriation deal to send back some Rohingya to their homeland -- but safety fears mean very few have agreed to return.Thousands are suspected to have been killed in Myanmar during the 2017 Rohingya crackdown and refugees brought reports of widespread rape and arson by soldiers and ethnic Rakhine mobs.The military denies nearly all wrongdoing and insists its operations were justified in order to root out Rohingya insurgents.Bangladesh’s navy has spent years building homes, facilities and flood walls on Bhashan Char at a cost of $280 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-postpones-rohingya-refugee-island-relocation-again/story-vlEIXxy4bEgjicgpshXzVP.html

The national health commission (NHC) reported over 430 new infections nationwide, continuing the slowing trend of the outbreak on the mainland.Less than 1000 new daily infections have been reported on the mainland for more than a week, the NHC said.The total number of confirmed cases was 78190.Global fears about the covid-19 outbreak continued on Wednesday with at least 38 countries reporting nearly 2900 cases and at least 45 deaths.First cases or suspected cases of the disease have emerged in new several countries Croatia, Switzerland, and for the first time, in Brazil in a 61-year-old who returned from Italy, the worst-hit in Eurppe.In China, more than 45000 patients were undergoing treatment until Tuesday midnight, about one-fifth of whom were in a severe condition.All the deaths were reported from central Chinese province, Hubei, the worst-hit by the epidemic – the first time in 23 days, according to state media.Worryingly, around 14 % of recovered covid-19 patients tested positive for the virus in later checkups in south China’s Guangdong province, raising concerns whether recovered patients can still infect others.Local authorities were quoted as saying it needs further testing to determine if they become a source of infection againState media reported that at least 49 police personnel had lost their lives in the line of duty in fighting the epidemic.The WHO has called the outbreak a global health emergency but stopped short of using the label “pandemic”, a term used when a disease takes hold in multiple regions and spreads rampantly within communities.The dramatic and worrying spread of the virus in South Korea – largest number of cases outside China --, Iran and Italy has fuelled fears that covid-19 could reach pandemic status – a matter of not if but when.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-china-now-2718-no-deaths-outside-epicentre-hubei-in-3-weeks/story-OuHZtGF3rv5JCSuGPv5NNM.html
26-02-2020||World||Malaysian King meets more lawmakers to end political vaccum||Malaysia’s king held unusual consultations with lawmakers for a second day Wednesday to resolve a political vacuum caused by the abrupt collapse of the ruling coalition and the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.The king’s role is largely ceremonial in Malaysia, but he appoints the person with majority support in Parliament as Prime Minister.Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah met with 83 lawmakers on Tuesday and is meeting the remaining 139 now to determine who they support as prime minister and if they want fresh elections.Mahathir’s Bersatu party ditched the ruling alliance Monday but failed to form a new government with parties to thwart an agreed transition of power to Anwar Ibrahim.The 94-year-old Mahathir resigned as premier and Bersatu chairman in what allies say was a protest of his party’s plan to work with the former corrupt regime that he had ousted in 2018 elections.The departure of 37 lawmakers, including 11 from Anwar’s party, deprived the governing Alliance of Hope of majority rule and sparked a crisis less than two years after its election victory ousted a corrupt-tainted coalition that had ruled for 61 years.The king dissolved the Cabinet but reappointed Mahathir as interim leader.Anwar and more than three dozen lawmakers from his party arrived at the palace Wednesday morning in an open-top double-decker bus.“God willing, may there be a good outcome for all,” Anwar tweeted.The turmoil has strengthened Mahathir’s position, with both Anwar’s alliance and the defectors trying to grab power by supporting him as their leader. Some analysts said it could allow Mahathir’s comeback with a clean slate with Anwar still in the running for the top job.“The (power transition) deal will have to be renegotiated, but support for Anwar among the (Alliance of Hope) remains strong and he remains the leading contender,” said Bridget Welsh, honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham in Malaysia.The premiership eluded Anwar once two decades ago. Once a high-flying member of the former ruling coalition. Anwar was convicted of homosexual sodomy and corruption after a power struggle with Mahathir, who was prime minister for 22 years until 2003. He was freed in 2004 but was once again convicted for sodomy in 2015, charges that he said were concocted to destroy his political career.Angered by a massive corruption scandal at a state investment fund, Mahathir made a political comeback and the two men forged an alliance that that ousted Prime Minister Najib Razak’s coalition, which had been in power since independence from Britain in 1957.Anwar couldn’t participate in the 2018 elections because he was behind bars for a second sodomy conviction. But he was freed and pardoned by the king after the alliance won power. Mahathir initially said he expected to stay as prime minister for two years to clean up the government, but refused to set a firm timeline for passing the baton to Anwar.Mahathir, the world’s oldest leader, has kept mum during the political debacle. He has been meeting with various political leaders and on Wednesday met with finance ministry officials about a stimulus plan to bolster the economy hurt by the COVID-19 illness.Leaders from two opposition Malay parties, which jointly control a quarter of the parliamentary seats, have called for fresh elections. The United Malays National Organization, party of disgraced ex-premier Najib who is on trial for corruption, and a fundamentalist Islamic party with strong rural support, said they opposed Mahathir’s plan for a unity government that would include rival parties and a Cabinet that isn’t split based on party strength.Analyst Welsh said their U-turn confirmed that Mahathir won’t work with them and that they think their best chances of getting into power are through elections.“Elections are a real possibility, but after negotiations for a government don’t work out,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-king-meets-more-lawmakers-to-end-political-vaccum/story-wFCbuBOVAAWNNYFeSnkB6J.html
26-02-2020||World||Dozens allowed off Japanese novel coronavirus infested cruise show ‘symptoms’: minister||Dozens of passengers allowed off a coronavirus-stricken ship have developed symptoms including fever and will be asked to take tests for the virus, Japan’s health minister said Wednesday.The news came as another death linked to the virus in Japan was reported and the government urged organisers of major events in the next fortnight to consider cancelling or downsizing them to help curb the spread of infections.The government has contacted 813 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship and found “45 people had certain symptoms”, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament.“We asked all of them (who have symptoms) to see a doctor and to take tests.”Around 970 people were allowed off the boat last week after testing negative for the virus, but several have subsequently been diagnosed with the illness.Japan has come under increasing pressure over its handling of the crisis on the vessel.Those allowed off the ship after a 14-day quarantine were asked to stay inside, but no formal measures restricting their movement were imposed.Opposition lawmakers have blamed the government for failing to implement a fresh 14-day quarantine after the passengers left the cruise ship -- as was required by countries that repatriated citizens from the boat.Infections have also continued to rise inside Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday said hosting large events should be reconsidered.“In light of the significant infection risks, we will ask that national sporting or cultural events that will attract large crowds be either cancelled, postponed or downsized for the next two weeks,” Abe told a cabinet task force meeting on the outbreak.The government has repeatedly said that the coming weeks will be critical in limiting the spread of the virus in Japan.But its measures have been largely advisory, including recommending that people work from home or commute off-peak.The recommendations come as the local government in northern Hokkaido announced in its latest update on the virus the death of a local resident, whose name, gender and age were not revealed. The school board in Hokkaido, where at least 38 people have been diagnosed, is expected to advise public schools to close.In Tokyo meanwhile, the regional education board said public high schools may start classes late to spare students travelling on packed commuter trains.Japan has seen at least 165 infections separate from the outbreak on the cruise ship.The outbreak has raised fears that the Olympic Games to be hosted in Tokyo this summer could be cancelled, a possibility government officials and organisers have rejected.“We have never discussed cancelling the Games,” the organisers said in a statement sent to AFP on Tuesday.“Preparations for the Games are continuing as planned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-dozens-allowed-off-japanese-novel-coronavirus-infested-cruise-show-symptoms-minister/story-x6uu0YStGN7WFBSEGnRwTI.html
26-02-2020||World||Coronavirus has infected 80,000 globally, caused 2,700 deaths||A viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 80,000 people globally. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it.The latest figures reported by each government’s health authority as of Wednesday in Beijing:— Mainland China: 2,715 deaths among 78,064 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei— Hong Kong: 81 cases, 2 deaths— Macao: 10 cases— South Korea: 1,146 cases, 11 deaths— Japan: 860 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 4 deaths— Italy: 323 cases, 11 deaths— Iran: 95 cases, 15 deaths— Singapore: 91 cases— Thailand: 37 cases— United States: 57 cases— Taiwan: 31 cases, 1 death— Australia: 23 cases— Malaysia: 22— Bahrain: 17— Vietnam: 16 cases— Germany: 17— United Arab Emirates: 13 cases— United Kingdom: 13— France: 14 cases, 1 death— Canada: 11— Kuwait: 11— Iraq: 5— Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death— India: 3— Spain: 6— Russia: 2— Israel: 2— Oman: 2— Austria: 2— Lebanon: 1— Belgium: 1— Nepal: 1— Sri Lanka: 1— Sweden: 1— Cambodia: 1— Finland: 1— Egypt: 1— Algeria: 1— Afghanistan: 1— Croatia: 1— Switzerland: 1ChinaChina’s massive travel restrictions, house-to-house checks, huge isolation wards and lockdowns of entire cities bought the world valuable time to prepare for the global spread of the new virus. It reported another 406 cases of the new virus, along with 52 additional deaths, all of them in hard-hit Hubei province and all but 10 in the epicenter of the city of Wuhan.South KoreaSouth Korea, the country with the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside mainland China said the total case of the virus had jumped to almost 1,150. The U.S. military says one of its soldiers based in South Korea tested positive for a new virus, the first U.S. service member being infected.JapanJapan has recorded the third highest number of coronavirus cases globally, being at 860. These 860 cases include 691 passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess. Four former passengers on the ship have died and more than a dozen people who were evacuated by their home countries later tested positive for the virus. Six government officials involved in the quarantine effort also became sick. Amid the coronavirus outbreak , A spokesman for the Japanese government on Wednesday said the International Olympic Committee and local organizers are going as planned with the Tokyo Olympics despite the threat. EuropeIn Italy, Civil protection officials in Italy say the number of virus cases in the country increased by 100, or 45%, in a 24-hour period and there now have been a total of 10 deaths. Other European Switzerland, Austria and Croatia have confirmed their first COVID-19 cases in their countries involving people who had recently traveled from virus-hit parts of neighbouring Italy.Portable pods have been set up at United Kingdom hospitals that will be used to assess people suspected of infection while keeping them apart from others. France developed a quick test for the virus and has shared it with poorer nations. German authorities are stressing “sneezing etiquette” and Russia is screening people at airports, railway stations and those riding public transportation.United StatesPresident Donald Trump and chief economic adviser said Tuesday that the new coronavirus is under control in the U.S., even as the government’s top disease fighters warned Americans to prepare for an outbreak here. The mixed messages came as the stock market tumbled for a second straight day and lawmakers of both political parties questioned whether the White House’s request for $2.5 billion in virus response funding will be enough to prepare the nationIndiaIndia’s health ministry has been framing step-by-step instructions to deal with sustained transmissions that will be circulated to the 250,000 village councils that are the most basic unit of the country’s sprawling administration.IranThe head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who had urged the public not to overreact about its spread has tested positive for the illness himself. Only a day earlier, a coughing and heavily sweating Iraj Harirchi said at a televised news conference in Tehran that “the situation is almost stable in the country.” Harirchi himself posted an online video saying he was infected with coronavirus and had quarantined himself at home. He promised that authorities would bring the virus under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-has-infected-80-000-globally-caused-2-700-deaths/story-lHJh2bu30rnZzS7lieOUmJ.html
26-02-2020||World||US health officials alert citizens to prepare for coronavirus outbreak||The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday alerted Americans to begin preparing for the spread of coronavirus in the United States after infections surfaced in several more countries.The announcement signalled a change in tone for the Atlanta-based U.S. health agency, which had largely been focused on efforts to stop the virus from entering the country and quarantining individuals traveling from China.“The data over the past week about the spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and expectation that we are going to have community spread here,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the CDC’s head of respiratory diseases, told reporters on a conference call.What is not known, she said, is when it will arrive and how severe a U.S. outbreak might be. “Disruption to everyday life might be severe” and businesses, schools and families should begin having discussions about the possible impact from the spread of the virus, Messonnier cautioned.In a teleconference later on Tuesday, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said that while the immediate risk in the United States was low, the current global situation suggested a pandemic was likely.“It’s not a question of if. It’s a question of when and how many people will be infected,” Schuchat said.Separately, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told a Senate subcommittee there will likely be more cases in the United States, and he asked lawmakers to approve $2.5 billion in funding to fight the outbreak after proposing cuts to the department’s budget.“While the immediate risk to individual members of the American public remains low, there is now community transmission in a number of countries, including outside of Asia, which is deeply concerning,” Azar said, adding that recent outbreaks in Iran and Italy were particularly worrying.Believed to have originated from illegal wildlife sold in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected some 80,000 people and killed close to 2,700 in China.Although the World Health Organization says the epidemic has peaked in China, coronavirus cases have surfaced in about 30 other countries, with some three dozen deaths reported, according to a Reuters tally. Growing outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea have raised concerns that coronavirus will surface in other nations and worsen in those that have already reported infections, further denting a global economy that had already been hit by a dependence on China.Global and U.S. stock markets fell sharply again on Tuesday, as investors feared the epidemic would further damage an already slowing world economy.The White House’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the U.S. economy would be able to ride out any disruption from the global spread of coronavirus, adding that he did not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to blunt the disease’s economic impact.U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, however, said Republican President Donald Trump and his administration had been caught “flat-footed” and lacked a comprehensive plan to deal with the coronavirus. He called for at least $3.1 billion in additional funding to fight it.“The Trump administration has shown towering and dangerous incompetence when it comes to the coronavirus,” said Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat. “Mr. President, you need to get your act together now. This is a crisis.”Trump defended his administration’s response. “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world,” Trump said on Twitter. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it would be at least a year before a coronavirus vaccine could be made available to the public. But Fauci said testing Gilead Sciences’ antiviral drug remdesivir for potential treatment of coronavirus could be done in a “reasonable amount of time.”‘DEADLY CONSEQUENCES’U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that Iran may have covered up information about the spread of coronavirus there, and he accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of media and medical professionals.“The United States is deeply concerned by information indicating the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,” Pompeo told reporters as Iran’s coronavirus death toll rose to 16.“All nations, including Iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,” Pompeo said.His remarks, coming less than two months after a short-lived U.S.-Iranian military clash and the signing of a U.S.-China trade deal, could inflame tensions with Tehran and Beijing. Beijing last week revoked the credentials of three Wall Street Journal correspondents over a column China said was racist. The United States has said it was considering a range of responses to their expulsion.“Expelling our journalists exposes once again the government’s issue that led to SARS and now the coronavirus: namely censorship. It can have deadly consequences,” Pompeo said, referring to the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also emerged from China.“If China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge” of coronavirus, he added.Despite the coronavirus epidemic, Pompeo said the United States still planned to host a special meeting with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Las Vegas in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-officials-alert-citizens-to-prepare-for-coronavirus-outbreak/story-phLg2GKRm3eb8o7CfL6VYK.html
26-02-2020||World||UK court told Julian Assange tried to call White House, Hillary Clinton over data dump||Julian Assange tried to contact Hillary Clinton and the White House when he realised that unredacted US diplomatic cables given to WikiLeaks were about to be dumped on the internet, his lawyer told his London extradition hearing on Tuesday.Assange is being sought by the United States on 18 counts of hacking US government computers and an espionage offence, having allegedly conspired with Chelsea Manning, then a US soldier known as Bradley Manning, to leak hundreds of thousands of secret documents by WikiLeaks almost a decade ago.On Monday, the lawyer representing the United States told the hearing that Assange, 48, was wanted for crimes that had endangered people in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan who had helped the West, some of whom later disappeared.US authorities say his actions in recklessly publishing unredacted classified diplomatic cables put informants, dissidents, journalists and human rights activists at risk of torture, abuse or death.Outlining part of his defence, Assange’s lawyer Mark Summers said allegations that he had helped Manning to break a government password, had encouraged the theft of secret data and knowingly put lives in danger were “lies, lies and more lies”.He told London’s Woolwich Crown Court that WikiLeaks had received documents from Manning in April 2010. He then made a deal with a number of newspapers, including the New York Times, Britain’s Guardian and Germany’s Der Spiegel, to begin releasing redacted parts of the 250,000 cables in November that year.A witness from Der Spiegel said the US State Department had been involved in suggesting redactions in conference calls, Summers said. However, a password that allowed access to the full unredacted material was published in a book by Guardian reporters about WikiLeaks in February 2011. In August, another German newspaper reported it had discovered the password and it had access to the archive.A spokesman for The Guardian said the authors were told the password was temporary and the book contained no details about the whereabouts of the files. PEOPLE’S LIVES “AT RISK”Summers said Assange attempted to warn the US government, calling the White House and attempting to speak to then- Secretary of State Clinton, saying “unless we do something, people’s lives are put at risk”.Summers said the State Department had responded by suggesting that Assange call back “in a couple of hours”.The United States asked Britain to extradite Assange last year after he was pulled from the Ecuador embassy in London, where he had spent seven years holed up avoiding extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations which have since been dropped.Assange has served a prison sentence in Britain for skipping bail and remains jailed pending the US extradition requestSupporters hail Assange as an anti-establishment hero who revealed governments’ abuses of power, and argue the action against him is a dangerous infringement of journalists’ rights. Critics cast him as a dangerous enemy of the state who has undermined Western security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-court-told-julian-assange-tried-to-call-white-house-hillary-clinton-over-data-dump/story-Ve7oMkIjXAIvMIefSb96WJ.html
26-02-2020||World||Bernie Sanders calls for India, US to combat climate change, not do arms deals||Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, on Monday slammed the arms deal agreed between India and United States during President Donald Trump’s visit as a sop to “enrich” defence firms and said the two countries should rather work together to combat climate change.“Instead of selling $3 billion in weapons to enrich Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed, the United States should be partnering with India to fight climate change,” the senator wrote on twitter, referring to the three big defense manufacturers. “We can work together to cut air pollution, create good renewable energy jobs, and save our planet.”India is a signatory to the 2015 Paris Accord and has continued to work towards its self-determined mitigation targets. The United States, on the other hand, was pulled out of the accord by President Trump, who has since gone on to reverse many mitigation measures, seriously imperiling its ability to meet its self-determined targets.Sanders, who has endorsed and adopted a progressive plan to combat climate change called the “Green Deal”, has been critical of the president’s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord and then rescind anti-climate change steps announced by the previous administration of President Barack Obama.His criticism of the sale of $3 billion worth of military helicopters and other equipment to India was intriguing as India doesn’t need to be pushed, if that is indeed what he is suggesting, to fight climate change, which it has acknowledged as a serious challenge and has resolved to fight it. India continues to work with other signatory countries to take the accord forward, in fact, through new alliances such as the award-winning Solar Alliance with France and launched a Coalition for Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure at the UN climate action summit in 2019.As a testimony to its efforts, the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors countries and their ability to meet their Paris Accord targets, has said India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy, and remains on track to “overachieve” targets. The tracker rates the United States’s actions as “insufficient”, and given Trump administration’s to pull it out of the accord, “critically insufficient.”The senator might be arguing here for the United States to work with India to combat climate change instead of selling it arms. But the two are not binary choices,The senator in now at the top of the Democratic race for the presidential nomination, and has tightened his grip on through significant victories in nominating contests, such as in Nevada last week. Former Vice-President Joe Biden still leads in the polls though, according to the RealClearPolitics aggregate.The senator has criticized India for the restrictions in Kashmir imposed the abrogation of Article 370 in August. “India’s action is unacceptable,” Sanders said last September. “The communications blockade must be lifted immediately and the United States government must speak out boldly in support of international humanitarian law and its support of a UN-backed peaceful resolution that respects the will of the Kashmiri people.”Sanders has been endorsed and supported by two of the four Indian American members of the House of Representatives, Ro Khanna, who is also a co-chair of the senator’s campaign, and Pramila Jayapal, who had endorsed him in in 2016 bid for the nomination as well. The Indian American community, which mostly votes Democratic, has endorsed Biden, as part of a wider coalition with other Asian American communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernier-sanders-calls-for-india-us-to-combat-climate-change-not-do-arms-deals/story-zWTath5AyjPbD0IZ7h65fK.html
