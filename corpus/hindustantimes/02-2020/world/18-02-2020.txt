18-02-2020||World||Michael Bloomberg to debut in Democratic debate amid accusations from rivals||Billionaire Michael Bloomberg will make his first appearance in a Democratic president debate on Wednesday amidst accusations from rivals candidates that he has used his vast personal wealth to “buy” his way into the race.Bloomberg has spent upwards of $300 million on ads and has run an unorthodox campaign in which he skipped the first four states to hold caucuses and primaries, including Iowa and New Hampshire. He is also not on ballot for the Nevada caucuses that take place next, followed by primaries in South Carolina.The billionaire has focussed on the March 3 Super Tuesday when 14 states go to polls, including California and New York, bastions of the Democratic party.Others on the stage with him on Wednesday will be Senator Bernie Sanders, who is currently leading the pack with a tie in Iowa and a narrow win in New Hampshire. Former Vice-President Joe Biden, who is struggling to stay in the race, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar are the other four.Bloomberg has not been on a debate stage yet, or faced a primary election, but has been creeping up the polls quietly with ads on TV and internet. He has projected himself as someone who can, and will beat, President Donald Trump. And his rise has put him in the cross-hairs of his rivals, and the president.Sanders slammed Bloomberg earlier this week at an election rally in Nevada saying “he’s going to try to buy the presidency -- by spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on TV ads”.And the president, who has kept an eye on the Democratic race, has been attacking Bloomberg, a fellow New Yorker, with increasing frequency. He has called Bloomberg “Mini Mike” for his height and a “loser”. To which, Bloomberg has said that the only height that matters is the one above the shoulder and has called the president a “carnival barking clown”.Bloomberg has also faced scrutiny of a law and order rule during his time as New York City’s mayor called “stop and frisk”, that had primarily targeted African Americans — he has apologized for it — and is facing renewed criticism engendering a culture of sexism in his businesses with his own crude and sexist remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michael-bloomberg-to-debut-in-democratic-debate-amid-accusations-from-rivals/story-GdkfiHQQGX0PM2uuYOtfJM.html
18-02-2020||World||Eastern Libyan forces strike Tripoli port targeting Turkish vessel||Eastern Libyan forces attacked the sea port of Libya’s capital on Tuesday as they targeted a Turkish vessel bringing in arms, an eastern official said, marking a new escalation in the battle for control of Tripoli.Eastern officials did not provide details about the alleged arms shipment at the port, which has remained open for food and other imports as rival factions battle for control of the capital.The eastern-based Libya National Army (LNA) faction, led by Khalifa Haftar, started a campaign in April last year to take the city, which is seat of the internationally recognised government also backed by Turkey.Authorities moved all ships including fuel tankers out of the port after Tuesday’s attack, two port officials said. The Tripoli forces said the LNA had fired four missiles.Since January, Turkey has sent several ships carrying arms and heavy trucks to Tripoli and Misrata, another western port, diplomats say.The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan and Russian mercenaries. Eastern ports and airports are out of range of the Tripoli forces.Tuesday’s attack happened as officers from the Tripoli forces and LNA prepared to meet for a second round of talks in Geneva to establish a permanent truce.Both sides refused again to sit in the same room, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told reporters, although he said he was hopeful of making progress.“So while the situation on the ground remains a situation where the truce is very fragile... nobody has so far reneged on the principle of accepting the truce and the political process is trying to find a way to move forward,” he said.He added that a ceasefire was not a precondition for advancing on other matters such as how to better distribute state revenues from oil, saying economic discussions were going “pretty well”.“It is going pretty well on the economic side, but it is harder on the military side,” he said.Salame said he had received conditions from tribesmen allied to eastern forces to lift a blockade of eastern oil export ports, but said they were quite general and would have to be tackled at a U.N.-led dialogue.Tribesmen and other groups allied to the LNA joined with Haftar’s forces a month ago to block major ports in eastern Libya and the southern Sharara oilfield, reducing oil output by more than 1 million barrels a day.Salame had spoken to some tribal leaders to hear their conditions to end the blockade. A further round of discussions is planned in Geneva next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eastern-libyan-forces-strike-tripoli-port-targeting-turkish-vessel/story-c4KSUFcgokbTel37wch0aO.html
18-02-2020||World||Air strikes hit hospitals, camps in northwest Syria, relief effort overwhelmed: UN||Government air strikes have hit hospitals and displaced persons camps in northwest Syria and killed about 300 civilians as President Bashar al-Assad’s forces press an assault against the last rebel stronghold, the United Nations said on Tuesday.UN officials said relief agencies were overwhelmed by the humanitarian crisis as nearly one million civilians, most of them women and children, had fled towards the Turkish border in bitter winter conditions to escape the onslaught.“Civilians fleeing the fighting are being squeezed into areas without safe shelter that are shrinking in size by the hour. And still they are bombed. They simply have nowhere to go,” UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said in a statement.Syrian and Russian warplanes meanwhile kept up raids on the town of Darat Izza in Aleppo province on Tuesday, witnesses said, one day after two hospitals there were badly damaged.At Al Kinana Hospital, blown-out walls and dust-covered medical cables and supplies were strewn about the hospital after two staff were wounded on Monday, witnesses said.Appearing on national television on Monday, Assad said the rapid military gains presaged the eventual defeat of the nine-year-old insurgency against him although it could still take time. The rebel factions include Turkish-backed rebels and jihadist militants.The offensive has also disrupted a fragile cooperation between Ankara and Moscow, who back opposing factions in the war. They began a new round of talks in Moscow on Monday after demands by Ankara that the Syrian army should back down and a ceasefire be put in place.POSSIBLE WAR CRIMESUN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville, asked if Syria and its ally Russia were deliberately targeting civilians and protected buildings, said: “The sheer quantity of attacks on hospitals, medical facilities, and schools would suggest they cannot all be accidental.”The attacks could constitute war crimes, Colville told a briefing in Geneva.The UN human rights office said it had recorded 299 civilian deaths since Jan. 1, about 93% caused by the Syrian government and its allies.The swift advance of government troops, backed by Russian air strikes, through northwest Syria has also caused the biggest displacement of the war as people flee towards a shrinking pocket near the Turkish frontier where insurgents hold their last strongholds.A UN spokesman, David Swanson, said close to 900,000 people have fled conflict zones in Idlib province and western Aleppo since December, more than 80% women and children.Many have been unable to find shelter and are forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures and burn plastic to stay warm, risking disease and death.“Only half of all the health facilities in northwest are still functioning now,” Swanson said.Hurras Network, a Save the Children partner in Idlib, said seven children including a seven-month-old baby had died from freezing temperatures and bleak conditions in displaced persons camps.The Syrian army said on Monday it had taken full control of dozens of towns in the Aleppo countryside.The M5 highway linking Damascus to Aleppo, the focus of recent fighting, was re-opened to civilian traffic on Tuesday after government forces recaptured it last week, the Syrian Observatory war monitor reported.The opposition also said air strikes in southern areas of Idlib province had left dozens of towns and villages in ruins in what it called a “scorched earth policy”. Alarmed by the new refugee crisis on its border, Turkey has sent thousands of troops and hundreds of convoys of military equipment to reinforce its observation posts in Idlib, established under a 2018 de-escalation agreement with Russia.Trucks carrying aid supplies still cross from Turkey into northern Syria in a UN relief operation, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Tuesday.About 525,000 displaced children are among those trapped, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-strikes-hit-hospitals-camps-in-northwest-syria-relief-effort-overwhelmed-un/story-g3UmoGmbEoJ6i3mwQ5euxN.html

Both Gantz and Netanyahu have called for bipartisan support for Israel in the United States.Gantz, who leads the Blue and White party, said it was “very important that we emphasize the importance of bipartisan relationship between Israel and the United States.”“We don’t care if the American president is a Republican or Democrat,” Gantz said. “If he is a good president for the United States,” then that person would be a “good president for the state of Israel as well.”Gantz and his running mate Yair Lapid addressed a crowd of around 1,000 mostly English speakers at an event in Tel Aviv. Lapid said that Israel faces the task of a “rehabilitation” of ties with the Democrats and with American Jewry in general.Gantz is trying to unseat Netanyahu in the March 2 vote — Israel’s third consecutive parliamentary vote after two elections in 2019 failed to yield a conclusive result. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, seeks reelection while facing indictments on corruption charges. He has denied any wrongdoing.Pre-election polls indicate that neither Gantz nor Netanyahu has a clear path to a parliamentary majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-opposition-chief-pledges-to-mend-ties-with-democrats/story-aC97EXV6DituFR3VjG3qbO.html

18-02-2020||World||Covid-19 death toll nears 1,900, WHO urges calm||The death toll from the new coronavirus outbreak rose again on Tuesday but Chinese and international health officials sought to calm global nerves, citing a study showing most cases are mild and warning against excessive measures to contain the epidemic.Nearly 1,900 people have now died and more than 72,000 others infected by the virus in China, with hundreds more cases in some 25 countries.The situation remains dire at the epicentre, with the director of a hospital in the central city of Wuhan becoming the seventh medical worker to succumb to the COVID-19 illness.But Chinese officials released a study showing most patients have mild cases of the illness, and World Health Organization officials said the mortality rate was relatively low.The epidemic has triggered panic-buying in Singapore and Hong Kong, concerns about cruise-ship travel and the postponement of trade fairs, sports competitions and cultural events in China and abroad.The outbreak is threatening to put a dent in the global economy, with China paralysed by vast quarantine measures and major firms such as iPhone maker Apple and mining giant BHP warning it could damage bottom lines.Several countries have banned travellers from China and major airlines have suspended flights.Authorities have placed about 56 million people in hard-hit central Hubei and its capital Wuhan under an unprecedented lockdown.Other cities far from the epicentre have restricted the movements of residents, with a 14-day self-quarantine for people returning to Beijing.President Xi Jinping, in a phone call with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said China’s measures were achieving “visible progress”, according to state media.- ‘Less deadly’ than SARS -The official death toll in China hit 1,868 Tuesday after another 98 people died -- most in Hubei and Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December.Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, became its latest victim, sparking an outpouring of grief online.Earlier this month, the death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang -- who had been punished by authorities for sounding the alarm about the virus in late December -- triggered anger and calls for political reforms on social media.Officials figures, meanwhile, showed there were nearly 1,900 new COVID-19 cases. New infections have been falling in the rest of the country for the past two weeks.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that it was too early to tell if the decline would continue.A study among 72,000 confirmed, suspected and clinically diagnosed cases showed that 81 percent of patients had only mild infections.Those most at risk were the elderly, and people with underlying medical conditions.The study released by China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also showed the death rate stood at 2.3 percent, falling below one percent for people in their 30s and 40s.Zhong Nanshan, a prominent expert with China’s National Health Commission, told reporters that 85 percent of patients can improve “if they have good life support, treatment conditions, and nutrients”.The research was cited by WHO officials, who said the COVID-19 illness was “less deadly” than its cousins, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).But it is higher than the mortality rate for the seasonal flu, at around 0.1 percent in the United States.Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said the outbreak was “very serious” and could grow, but stressed that outside Hubei the epidemic was “affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people”.There have been some 900 cases around the world, with five deaths in France, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong.- Cruise concerns -Another 88 people tested positive for the virus on the quarantined Diamond Prince cruise ship off Yokohama in Japan, raising the number of infections to 542,The US repatriated more than 300 American passengers on Monday and Britain became the latest country to offer its citizens a way off the boat after similar plans by Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and South Korea.Attention was also turning to the Westerdam, a cruise ship in Cambodia, where many of the 2,200 people aboard passengers were allowed to disembark after all initially received a clean bill of health.An 83-year-old American woman was later diagnosed with the virus in Malaysia, raising concerns that other passengers might have been infected before flying to other countries.The WHO rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted after hundreds of passengers were infected on one vessel off Japan.“Measures should be taken proportional to the situation. Blanket measures may not help,” the WHO’s Tedros said.Find additional latest updates about novel coronavirus on our live blog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-covid-19-death-toll-nears-1-900-who-urges-calm/story-RWJMqagZRPnTXDudsx1ekK.html

The Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbhandhik Committee and Evacuee Trust Property Board officials received the UN Secretary General at Kartarpur Sahib, some 125kms from Lahore. A Sikh boy presented him a bouquet.Guterres was also briefed about the Kartarpur Corridor pact between Pakistan and India. He was told that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan took this initiative to facilitate the Sikh community of India and elsewhere to visit the shrine. The corridor links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur - the final resting place of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev - to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India’s Gurdaspur district. Wearing an orange scarf, Guterres visited different parts of the Gurdwara. He was served with traditional food in lunch along with Sikhs and Pakistani officials.Strict security measures were taken during the visit.Indian Sikhs in good number were also present at Kartarpur Sahib.Later talking to media persons, the UN Secretary General said the Kartarpur Corridor is a practical example of Pakistan’s desire for peace and inter-faith harmony, Radio Pakistan reported.He said the opening of the corridor is a good step and it will promote tolerance and interfaith harmony.The UN chief appreciated the facilities being provided to Sikh pilgrims at the complex.Khan inaugurated the Kartarpur Corridor on November 9, 2019 in connection with the 550 birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the corridor from the Indian side on the same day by flagging off the first batch of over 500 Indian pilgrims, including former premier Manmohan Singh and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan is located across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It was established by the Sikh Guru in 1522. The first Gurdwara, Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib, was built here, where Guru Nanak Dev is said to have died. Earlier in the day, Guterres addressed students at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and urged them to focus on new technologies. He termed climate change as the major issue the world is facing today. He also inaugurated a polio campaign. Pakistan is one of the three countries where polio is still endemic.

18-02-2020||World||Pakistan successfully tests nuclear-capable air launched cruise missile||Pakistan conducted a successful flight test of the air launched nuclear-capable cruise missile Ra’ad-II with a range of 600 km on Tuesday, significantly boosting the military’s “deterrence capability” on land and at sea.The Ra’ad-II weapon system is equipped with state-of-the-art guidance and navigation systems ensuring engagement of targets with high precision, according to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing.The cruise missile with a range of 600 km significantly enhances air delivered strategic standoff capability on land and at sea, it said. The successful flight test was witnessed by senior Pakistan Army officers and military officials, the statement said.Director General Strategic Plans Division, Lieutenant General Nadeem Zaki Manj, termed the successful launch as “a major step towards complementing Pakistan’s deterrence capability”.He appreciated the technical prowess of the Pakistani scientists and engineers who developed the weapon system and made the launch a success, the statement said.Pakistan President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Imran Khan and senior military officials have congratulated the scientists and engineers on the successful conduct of missile test, it said. Pakistan’s development of the Ra’ad could be seen as an attempt to match India’s BrahMos cruise missile, according to the US-based Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, non-profit organisation. It also said that currently this missile is planned to be attached to Mirage aircraft or F-16 fighter jets of the Pakistan Air Force. Last month, the ISPR said Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of surface-to-surface ballistic missile Ghaznavi, capable of delivering multiple types of warheads up to a range of 290 km.Pakistan’s missile test comes amidst Indo-Pak tensions after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcated it into two union territories.Pakistan reacted strongly to India’s decision and downgraded bilateral ties and expelled the Indian envoy.

18-02-2020||World||Old patients with existing conditions most prone to die from Covid-19: Study||People infected with the novel coronavirus who are more than 80 years old have the highest chances of dying from infection of all age groups, according to the largest study since the highly contagious outbreak began in China, with details of nearly 44,000 cases.The study, published on Monday in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, revealed that a total of 1,023 deaths have occurred among 44,672 confirmed cases as of February 11, for an overall case fatality rate of 2.3 per cent. The novel Chinese coronavirus, or COVID-19, has so far killed over 1,800 individuals and infected more than 72,000 people, Chinese health officials said on Tuesday. According to the clinicians from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, majority of the patients were aged 30–69 years (77.8 per cent), male (51.4 per cent), farmers or labourers (22 per cent), and diagnosed in Hubei Province (74.7 per cent).The study noted that people with ages 80 and above had the highest case fatality rate of all age groups at about 15 per cent. It said the death rate from the disease for males was 2.8 per cent and that for females was about 1.7 per cent. In terms of occupation, patients who reported being retirees had the highest case fatality rate at about 5 per cent, and those in Hubei Province had a fatality rate that was more than seven-fold higher at nearly 3 per cent compared to patients in other regions of China, the study noted. The researchers reported that patients with comorbid conditions had much higher fatality rates -- 10.5 per cent for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3 per cent for diabetes, and 6.3 per cent for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0 per cent for hypertension, and 5.6 per cent for cancer. The fatality rate was about 50 per cent for cases categorised as critical, the study noted.Assessing the cases as they emerged over the weeks, the scientists found that in December 2019 only 0–22 cases/day began to experience symptoms with the peak onset of symptoms for all cases overall occurring on February 1, 2020. Since then, the researchers reported that the onset of illness has declined. The researchers noted that the virus is highly contagious. “It has spread extremely rapidly from a single city to the entire country within only about 30 days,” the researchers reported in the study. “Moreover, it has achieved such far-reaching effects even in the face of extreme response measures including the complete shutdown and isolation of whole cities, cancellation of Chinese New Year celebrations, prohibition of attendance at school and work, massive mobilisation of health and public health personnel as well as military medical units, and rapid construction of entire hospitals,” they said. Overall, the scientists said the viral infection has been mild for nearly four-fifths of the patients, and has a very low case fatality rate. Among the 1,023 deaths, they noted that a majority have been of age 60 years or older and/or have had pre-existing, comorbid conditions like hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. “Moreover, the case fatality rate is unsurprisingly highest among critical cases at 49 per cent, and no deaths have occurred among those with mild or even severe symptoms,” the clinicians wrote in the study. The scientists also suspect that the virus may have jumped from animals at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan to humans at several times in the past. This, they believe, may have allowed the novel coronavirus to be transmitted from a still-unknown animal into humans and, due to its high mutation and recombination rates, they speculate it adapted to become increasingly efficient at human-to-human transmission. The study also noted that some strategies used to curtail the spread of the outbreak may have worked. “The downward trend in the overall epidemic curve suggests that perhaps isolation of whole cities, broadcast of critical information (e.g., promoting hand washing, mask wearing, and care seeking) with high frequency through multiple channels, and mobilisation of a multi-sector rapid response teams is helping to curb the epidemic,” the researchers wrote in the study. One limitation pointed out by the authors of the study is that a large proportion of the 72,314 cases reported in the study were not confirmed by the sensitive nucleic acid testing as this process is slow, labour intensive, and requires specialised equipment. However, all the cases were diagnosed clinically and investigated by trained epidemiologists, they said. According to the authors, while the actions taken by the Chinese government has slowed down the epidemic in China, and curbed its spread to the rest of the world, there may be more challenges ahead. “Huge numbers of people will soon be returning to work and school after the extended New Year holiday. We need to prepare for a possible rebound of the COVID-19 epidemic in the coming weeks and months,” the researchers warned.

18-02-2020||World||Democrat Michael Bloomberg makes it to the debate, rivals raring to rattle him||Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday qualified for this week’s Democratic presidential debate in Nevada, putting him on the same stage as his rivals for the first tie in the race for the party’s nomination.The debate on Wednesday will be the ninth in the contest for who will challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the November 3 election.A late entry to the race, Bloomberg, 78, has risen in public opinion polls as he pours money from his estimated $60 billion personal fortune into a national campaign, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on television ads.When he takes the stage on Wednesday, he is likely to be challenged directly by rivals over his use as mayor of a policing policy widely seen as discriminatory and of supposed sexist practices at his company.“There’s a lot to talk about with Michael Bloomberg,” former vice president and candidate for the nomination Joe Biden told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Bloomberg had support from 19% of the people surveyed in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released on Tuesday.With that result, he met the Democratic Party’s requirements for debate qualification by receiving double-digit support in four national polls recognized by the party, his campaign said in a statement.While Bloomberg is not competing in the first four nomination contests - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina - he hopes to start winning delegates beginning on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states will vote.At least five other candidates have qualified for Wednesday’s debate ahead of Nevada’s Feb. 22 caucuses: Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, and former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg.Warren and Sanders charge that Bloomberg is trying to buy the election. He responds that he is playing by the rules and has offered to fund the Democratic effort to beat Trump even if he doesn’t win the nomination.He will likely be grilled about his support while New York mayor of a policing strategy that ensnared blacks and Latinos disproportionately.Bloomberg apologized for that policy, known as “stop and frisk,” just before announcing he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination.His campaign has declined to comment on criticism over 2008 remarks in which he tied a housing market collapse to a ban on a discriminatory housing practice known as redlining.    He has also expressed regret over making inappropriate jokes.“Did I ever tell a bawdy joke? Yeah, sure I did. And do I regret it? Yes. It’s embarrassing,” Bloomberg told ABC’s “The View” on Jan. 15. “But, you know, that’s the way I grew up.”    The Washington Post on Saturday published what it said was a copy of a 32-page booklet distributed at a party in 1990 that included sexist remarks by Bloomberg, reportedly compiled by his colleagues. The Post also chronicled numerous discrimination lawsuits filed against Bloomberg LP, a major provider of news and financial information, over the last three decades.    In one case, a saleswoman filed a lawsuit alleging that when she told Bloomberg she was pregnant in 1995, his response was, “Kill it.” Bloomberg has denied making the remark, and the lawsuit was settled. The Washington Post published comments by a man who said he witnessed Bloomberg’s remark.    Bloomberg said in the ABC interview that his company had experienced “very few” cases of sexual harassment given its large size, and said he thinks “most people would say we’re a great place to work.”   He said the company would not release women from non-disclosure agreements that were part of legal settlements, some of which stemmed from allegations of sexual harassment. Warren has called on Bloomberg to release the women from the agreements.    On Sunday, Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood said in an emailed statement regarding the allegations in the Washington Post: “Virtually all of this has been reported over the past two decades. In any large organization, there are going to be complaints — but Mike simply does not tolerate any kind of discrimination or harassment, and he’s created cultures that are all about equality and inclusion.” (Reporting by Jason Lange and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrat-michael-bloomberg-makes-it-to-the-debate-rivals-raring-to-rattle-him/story-a8e5eJrfSs3ppLdQjaxk5H.html

18-02-2020||World||Japan plans HIV drug trials to fight Covid-19 as Diamond Princess cases rise||Japan plans to start trials of HIV medications to treat coronavirus patients as an increase in the number of cases poses a growing threat to the economy and public health, the government’s top spokesman said on Tuesday.The government is making “preparations so that clinical trials using HIV medication on the novel coronavirus can start as soon as possible,” Yoshihide Suga told a briefing, but added he could not say how long it might take to approve a drug’s use.A further 88 people tested positive for the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the port of Yokohama, bringing the total number of infected passengers to 542, the Health Ministry said.Elsewhere, three more cases were diagnosed in Wakayama Prefecture, including the son of a doctor infected with the virus, local media said.As the contracting economy deepens recession fears, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to curb the size of public gatherings, while some companies are telling employees to work from home.HIV drugs have been touted as a potential cure for the coronavirus, which has killed almost 1,900 people in mainland China. No therapy has yet proven fully effective against the infection.People in China have begun exploring unorthodox ways to get treated, with some appealing to HIV patients and unauthorised importers for medicine.In Thailand, doctors said they appeared to have had some success in treating severe cases of the virus with a combination of medications for flu and HIV.As demand for surgical masks surges in Japan, police were investigating the theft of 6,000 masks reported by the Kobe Red Cross Hospital in the central city, a hospital official said.Japanese officials have promised to work hard to avoid disruption to the Olympic Games starting in Tokyo in July, but concern about the virus led Mongolia’s Olympics archery team to cancel training in Japan, the Kyodo news agency said.DIAMOND PRINCESS EVACUATIONSU.S. government evacuation flights on Monday flew home more than 300 Americans who had been on board the Diamond Princess.With more than 3,000 passengers and crew, the ship has been in quarantine since early this month, after a passenger who had left it in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.The vessel will receive meals from World Central Kitchen, a non-profit set up by celebrity chef Jose Andres, in a bid to reduce the burden on crew, said Rai Caluori, vice president of vessel operator Princess Cruises.Passengers still on the ship, about half of whom are Japanese, have expressed frustration over the quarantine and authorities in Australia, Canada, Italy and South Korea are also planning to evacuate citizens from the cruise liner.A plane chartered by the Canadian government has left for Japan to evacuate its nationals, TV Asahi said. Canada has said 14 days of quarantine await them on their return.South Korea is also sending a government charter flight on Tuesday to take home four citizens, and a Japanese spouse, who have no symptoms, a South Korean official said.Japanese who test negative will begin disembarking as early as Wednesday, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said.“Everyone wants to return home as soon as possible, so considering that feeling, we are making preparations,” Kato told reporters.Disembarkation was set for Feb. 19 to 21, Japan’s vice health minister said, according to a copy of a letter circulated on Twitter by a passenger using the handle @daxa–tw. The letter said local health authorities would take passengers’ temperatures before they left the ship.Find additional latest updates about novel coronavirus on our live blog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/update-4-japan-plans-hiv-drug-trials-to-fight-coronavirus-as-diamond-princess-cases-rise/story-TbDa7yfcUpw6HOv9MW7b6K.html
18-02-2020||World||Covid-19 slows China’s Belt and Road push||When President Xi Jinping made his first state visit this year to Myanmar and signed new infrastructure contracts, there was no indication of the obstacle about to trip up China’s plan for railways, ports and highways around the world: the coronavirus.Travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the disease, which has now killed more than 1,800 people, have idled much of the world’s second-largest economy and choked key elements of Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Chinese workers cannot get to overseas projects, and factories are cut off from the Chinese imports they need to keep running, according to more than a dozen company executives and officials.“Many factories in China remain closed; those that are open cannot reach full capacity,” said Boyang Xue, a China analyst at Ducker Frontier. “Since many BRI projects tend to source equipment and machinery from manufacturers based in China, the disruptions in industrial production and supply chain will cause further delays.”One giant project, China Railway International Group’s $6 billion high-speed railway in Indonesia, is on a war footing.The state enterprise has set up a task force to monitor the coronavirus’ spread and urged all Chinese employees who went home for the Lunar New Year holiday not to return to Indonesia, a senior executive with the company said on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak to the media.The company has stopped more than 100 Chinese personnel, mostly skilled workers or managers, from returning to the project linking Indonesia’s capital Jakarta with the textile hub of Bandung, about 140 km (85 miles) away, the executive said.“We have to focus on less-critical parts of the railway project until some of our key people come back to work,” he said. “We’re getting off to a very bad start in 2020. Our project has been dogged by delays and controversy, and this coronavirus brought us bigger challenges.”DISRUPTIONChina’s top regulator of state-run companies said in a Tuesday briefing that the outbreak has caused “difficulties” on some overseas projects and investments.The country “has already communicated with overseas companies, overseas owners, and governments as early as possible to gain support and understanding,” said Peng Qinghua, secretary general of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.Several Chinese companies in Indonesia, including Tsingshan Holding Group, GEM Co Ltd and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt saw nickel and cobalt projects disrupted as Southeast Asia’s biggest economy stopped flights from China in early February and denied entry to people who had been in mainland China in the previous 14 days.“The new projects may be postponed a little, but not that much,” said an executive at one of the companies, who had planned to travel to Indonesia before the travel ban made it impossible.More than 133 countries have imposed entry restrictions on Chinese citizens or people who have visited China, according to the Chinese National Immigration Agency.Pakistan’s $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) said the coronavirus was not having an impact, although officials said some managers had been quarantined after returning from China.The challenge of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to Belt and Road contracts follows a pushback in 2018, when officials in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere criticised projects there as costly and unnecessary.China scaled back some plans after several countries sought to review, cancel or scale down commitments, citing concerns over costs, erosion of sovereignty, and corruption.BROKEN SUPPLY CHAINThe coronavirus has also started to disrupt the supply chains that give companies access to key machinery and components.The offices of Chinese senior managers stand empty at the Cambodia Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, which describes itself as a “landmark project” on the Belt and Road Initiative and is home to more than 160 businesses and over 20,000 workers.Employees from Chinese-run factories told Reuters that most of the workers there were local, but that the greater challenge was their dependence on supplies from China.That “could elongate project timelines, for example, which might raise costs,” said Nick Marro, global trade lead at the Economic Intelligence Unit and a China analyst.And although that might only affect operations in the first quarter - depending on whether the virus is contained - slower Chinese growth will have a regional and global impact, he said.In some places on the Belt and Road, the impact of the coronavirus has already arrived.Bangladesh has announced delays to several infrastructure projects, including commissioning of the Payra coal power plant, which was supposed to begin commercial operations in early February.Well over 2,000 Chinese workers work on the plant and some 40 percent of them went home for the Lunar New Year holiday, local media reported. Twenty were allowed back to work on Monday after 14 days in quarantine.

18-02-2020||World||Northern Ireland to oppose leaving the UK to form a united Ireland||A majority of voters in Northern Ireland would oppose the region leaving the United Kingdom to form a united Ireland if a referendum were held tomorrow, according to a poll published by the Belfast Telegraph newspaper on Tuesday. Irish unity would be supported by just 29% of voters, with 52% against, the poll of 2,000 people organised by Liverpool University and Britain’s Economic and Social Research Council found. The remaining 19% said they did not know how they would vote. If ‘don’t knows’ are excluded, the figures show 65% to 35% in favour of remaining within the United Kingdom, the survey showed.“The data offers an antidote to excitable recent commentary concerning the imminence of Irish unity,” said Jon Tonge, Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool who led the survey. But he added that the poll indicated a 2% rise in support for Irish unification since the last poll in 2017, a rate of increase that would produce a majority for a united Ireland within two decades.Under Northern Ireland’s 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which largely ended decades of violence between mainly Catholic nationalists seeking to merge with Ireland and Protestant unionists who want to remain part of the United Kingdom, the British government can call a referendum if a “yes” majority looks likely.Sinn Fein, an Irish nationalist party in both Ireland and Northern Ireland which won the most votes in an Irish election earlier this month, has said it wants London to hold a poll within five years.Asked to label themselves ideologically, 28% chose ‘unionist’, 25% ‘nationalist’ and 40% said neither.The vast majority of self-identified nationalists supported a united Ireland and the vast majority of unionists were against. But there was also a clear majority against unification among people who defined themselves as neither, with 73% saying they would support remaining in the United Kingdom.Just over 2,000 people were interviewed between December 28, 2019 and February 11 by Social Market Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northern-ireland-to-oppose-leaving-the-united-kingdom-to-form-a-united-ireland-poll-shows/story-tyOBFK0vcAOAQlEJV44RWK.html
18-02-2020||World||China to waive tariffs on US medical imports amid coronavirus outbreak||China will waive trade-war tariffs on imports of selected US medical equipment from March 2, the government said Tuesday, as the country battles to contain the new coronavirus epidemic.More than 72,000 people have been infected by the outbreak of the new COVID-19 strain in China, which has claimed the lives of over 1,800 people.Products that will qualify for the exemptions include patient monitors, blood transfusion equipment and instruments to measure blood pressure, according to a list released by the Tariff Commission of the State Council.The commission said the move was “to better meet the growing needs of Chinese consumers” and that it would accept applications from firms in China.The tariff exemptions will apply for a designated period, supporting firms that want to import from the US based on “business considerations”, said authorities.The list of eligible products also includes a wide range of food items such as frozen pork, beef and seafood.There has been a spike in pork prices in China over the past year due to African Swine Fever, which ravaged pig herds across the country.The latest move follows other exemptions or cuts that China has announced -- either related to its virus fight or a trade deal it signed with the US in January.At the start of the month, China said US imports that can be used in its fight against the deadly virus will be exempted from retaliatory tariffs imposed in the trade war.More than a week ago, Beijing also announced it would halve tariffs on USD 75 billion worth of US imports as part of its trade truce with the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-waive-tariffs-on-us-medical-imports-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/story-QjANzudZta2eHexdtPxGJO.html
18-02-2020||World||‘Missing’ former Pak Army General died in 2018, claims Al Qaeda||Retired Pakistani General Shahid Aziz, who mysteriously disappeared a few years ago, had died in 2018, claimed a magazine published by a regional branch of Al Qaeda. The magazine--Nawa-e-Afghan Jihad,’ (Voice of Afghan Jihad) -- also claimed that Aziz had close ties with the Al-Qaeda, Arab News reported. The magazine is published by Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent’s (AQIS). Aziz, formerly a top Pakistani general, retired in 2005 after serving with the Pakistan army for 37 years. Aziz had served as the director-general of military operations among other key posts when Pervez Musharraf was military chief.In 2013, Aziz authored a book that criticized the policies of the former army chief.When rumors of his death and disappearance started circulating widely in 2018, Aziz’s relatives rejected these claims and said that the former general is living a “very private life” of religious preaching.This is the first time Al-Qaeda has made claims of Aziz’s allegiance to the terrorist organization.The February edition of the AQIS magazine also claimed Aziz had close ties with members of the militant organization and that the former general wrote a damning, never-before-seen manuscript for a book which was sent to AQIS in 2015, and would be published in the Urdu magazine in the coming months.AQIS was formed by Al-Qaeda chief Ayman Al-Zawahiri in 2014 and aims to fight the governments of Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-former-pak-army-general-died-in-2018-claims-al-qaeda/story-ma8KqdXzCfzIoSQE4TQk2M.html
18-02-2020||World||Coronavirus travel ban keeps thousands of maids from Hong Kong jobs||Mimi Ysulat flew home to the Philippines for her mother’s funeral at the end of January. By the time she was ready to return to Hong Kong, where she’s worked as a maid and nanny for the past decade, she got another dose of bad news: in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Philippine government had banned travel to the city, along with Macau and mainland China.Now the 48-year-old Ysulat is stuck in the Philippines for the foreseeable future, along with thousands of migrant workers, mostly women, who make up Hong Kong’s domestic labor force. “Helpers,” as they’re called, are critical to both economies. Having full-time, live-in childcare enables hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers — mostly women — to work outside the home; the money helpers send home to the Philippines contributes to more than $30 billion in remittances that comprise about 9% of the country’s gross domestic product.With the coronavirus still spreading, there’s no telling when these women might be able to return to the families and households that rely on them. They’re worried they’ll lose their jobs, their income and their work permits. In a survey of more than 900 Filipina domestic workers in Hong Kong  by placement agency HelperChoice, almost half said they were affected by the travel ban or knew someone who was. Meanwhile, with Hong Kong’s schools, community centers and nurseries closed for another four weeks at least, families with absent helpers are scrambling to manage their own jobs in a childcare vacuum. “[Helpers] are actually integral to Hong Kong. Without them, the local community will not be able to go out and work,” said Edwina Antonio-Santoyo, executive director of Bethune House Migrant Women’s Refuge, a charity that has been operating in the city since 1986. “There will be no one to take care of their children, take care of the elderly or to do the household chores.”Antonio-Santoyo is barely exaggerating. Like day cares and creches elsewhere in the world, migrant maids and nannies are critical to Hong Kong families, particularly those with children. By law, helpers earn a minimum of HK$4,630 ($596) per month, a not-unreasonable expense for two adults each earning Hong Kong’s median wage of HK$17,500.About 11% of Hong Kong households employ a domestic worker, a ratio that jumps to 30% among married couples with children and 43% when both parents work. The government credits the ready availability of foreign domestic workers with the rising labor force participation rate for female citizens as well.Yin Lo, a primary school teacher and mother of a three-year-old, said her helper got stuck in the Philippines after attending her daughter’s wedding and visiting her convalescent mother. She was flying Cebu Air Inc., which has halted flights to Hong Kong at least through the end of March.“If I wasn’t able to work from home, I don’t know what I’d do,” said Yin, who like most teachers hasn’t been required to go in during the closings, though lots of schools are still giving students assignments and online lessons. Her husband works in the financial industry and has been going into the office every day. Like Ysulat, who hails from a village 350 miles south of Manila, many domestic workers come from rural parts of the Philippines. Earlier this month, the country’s Labor Department announced that it would offer financial assistance and temporary housing to workers who’d gotten stranded in the capital en route to their jobs overseas.In the first week of February, more than 2,500 workers had collected the offered stipend of 10,000 pesos ($196)—about one-third of the minimum monthly salary for a helper in Hong Kong. With the flight cancellations extended through March, there may be as many as 15,000 Hong Kong workers stuck in the Philippines, according to Alfredo Palmiery, who leads a trade group of recruiters who help place Filipinos in Hong Kong households and elsewhere.If workers can’t return to work, their contracts and visas could be cancelled, Palmiery wrote in a letter to the governing board of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. “Most of the departing workers have already traveled from the provinces to Manila and have already incurred expenses, some of which they only borrowed,” he wrote, highlighting the families that depend on remittances. The Philippines lifted a short-lived ban on travel to Taiwan on Feb. 14. It may do the same for migrant workers to Hong Kong in the next two weeks, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin wrote on Twitter Feb. 15: ‘Time to allow our domestic workers to return to their employers in Hong Kong. Eagerly awaited. HK has better facilities to contain virus.”Ysulat is among the relatively lucky ones. Her employers have said her position is safe and that they’ll continue to pay her. The problem, now, is collecting her salary. She gets paid in cash, which she typically sends home through a remittance service; her family claims it from a local pawnshop. She doesn’t have a bank account to receive a wire transfer from her employers.For now Ysulat’s family will rely on the money her husband makes as a rickshaw driver. If she can’t get back to work soon, she said they’d have no choice but to borrow from friends and neighbors to make ends meet. “I was just finished paying down my old debts,” she said.“And now I have to take on new ones. I’m back to zero again.”The travel ban has also affected workers on the Hong Kong side of the South China Sea. After 32 years as a maid and nanny in Hong Kong, Virgie Iniego was ready to go home on Feb. 7. Chemotherapy to treat throat and nose cancer left her with kidney damage, and she needs biweekly dialysis. Two days before what was supposed to be her final flight to Manila, the Philippine government suspended most incoming travel from China, Hong Kong and Macau. As a Philippine national, Iniego’s not banned, but she might as well be: Philippine Airlines canceled its flights through the end of March.‘I really want to go home to be with my family,” said Iniego, whose two sons live in Imus City on the outskirts of the capital. Her husband died a few years ago. “I am old and sick, and I want to be with my sons.’Not far from Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, the Overseas Workers’ Welfare Administration converted a conference center into a sprawling help desk for stranded migrant workers.On Feb. 13, nearly a week after the government announced the travel ban, roughly a hundred people stood in line. They brought documents to prove their identity and employment abroad, and their tickets for their now-cancelled flights. In return, they got a stack of cash. It’s the third venue the welfare agency has commandeered since the restriction took effect, first tapping a shopping mall and then a sports complex to handle the volume. Some of the workers have come straight from the airport after being turned away at the check-in desks, their bags still in tow, taped up and ready for their big move. Last week, Dina Andales collected her stipend. She’d been traveling to a new position, and she wasn’t sure her employer would be willing to hold her job. Andales decided to stay in Manila — it would cost half the 10,000 peso allowance just to get back to her province, and the remainder wouldn’t cover the month’s expenses for her and her parents. The government says the travel ban is a protective measure, but Andales, at least, didn’t appreciate it. “We need to eat every day, and I’m not going to earn any money staying here [in the Philippines],” she said. “If I had a choice, I would rather just fly to Hong Kong. I can just stay indoors all the time to keep myself safe from the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-travel-ban-keeps-thousands-of-maids-from-hong-kong-jobs/story-0KJu9Kqft8pU1zjFee5n8H.html
18-02-2020||World||Leaked data shows China’s Uighurs detained due to religion||For decades, the Uighur imam was a bedrock of his farming community in China’s far west. On Fridays, he preached Islam as a religion of peace. On Sundays, he treated the sick with free herbal medicine. In the winter, he bought coal for the poor.But as a Chinese government mass detention campaign engulfed Memtimin Emer’s native Xinjiang region three years ago, the elderly imam was swept up and locked away, along with all three of his sons living in China.Now, a newly revealed database exposes in extraordinary detail the main reasons for the detentions of Emer, his three sons, and hundreds of others in Karakax County: their religion and their family ties.The database obtained by The Associated Press profiles the internment of 311 individuals with relatives abroad and lists information on more than 2,000 of their relatives, neighbors and friends. Each entry includes the detainee’s name, address, national identity number, detention date and location, along with a detailed dossier on their family, religious and neighborhood background, the reason for detention, and a decision on whether or not to release them. Issued within the past year, the documents do not indicate which government department compiled them or for whom.Taken as a whole, the information offers the fullest and most personal view yet into how Chinese officials decided who to put into and let out of detention camps, as part of a massive crackdown that has locked away more than a million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims.The database emphasizes that the Chinese government focused on religion as a reason for detention — not just political extremism, as authorities claim, but ordinary activities such as praying, attending a mosque, or even growing a long beard. It also shows the role of family: People with detained relatives are far more likely to end up in a camp themselves, uprooting and criminalizing entire families like Emer’s in the process.Similarly, family background and attitude is a bigger factor than detainee behavior in whether they are released.“It’s very clear that religious practice is being targeted,” said Darren Byler, a University of Colorado researcher studying the use of surveillance technology in Xinjiang. “They want to fragment society, to pull the families apart and make them much more vulnerable to retraining and reeducation.”The Xinjiang regional government did not respond to faxes requesting comment. Asked whether Xinjiang is targeting religious people and their families, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said “this kind of nonsense is not worth commenting on.”Beijing has said before that the detention centers are for voluntary job training, and that it does not discriminate based on religion.China has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, where the native Uighurs have long resented Beijing’s heavy-handed rule. With the 9/11 attacks in the United States, officials began using the specter of terrorism to justify harsher religious restrictions, saying young Uighurs were susceptible to Islamic extremism.After militants set off bombs at a train station in Xinjiang’s capital in 2014, President Xi Jinping launched a so-called “People’s War on Terror”, transforming Xinjiang into a digital police state.The leak of the database from sources in the Uighur exile community follows the release in November of a classified blueprint on how the mass detention system really works. The blueprint obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which includes the AP, showed that the centers are in fact forced ideological and behavioral re-education camps run in secret. Another set of documents leaked to the New York Times revealed the historical lead-up to the mass detention.The latest set of documents came from sources in the Uighur exile community, and the most recent date in them is March 2019. The detainees listed come from Karakax County, a traditional settlement of about 650,000 on the edge of Xinjiang’s Taklamakan desert where more than 97 percent of residents are Uighur. The list was corroborated through interviews with former Karakax residents, Chinese identity verification tools, and other lists and documents seen by the AP.Detainees and their families are tracked and classified by rigid, well-defined categories. Households are designated as “trustworthy” or “not trustworthy,” and their attitudes are graded as “ordinary” or “good.” Families have “light” or “heavy” religious atmospheres, and the database keeps count of how many relatives of each detainee are locked in prison or sent to a “training center.”Officials used these categories to determine how suspicious a person was — even if they hadn’t committed any crimes.“It underscores the witch-hunt mindset of the government, and how the government criminalizes everything,” said Adrian Zenz, an expert on the detention centers and senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C.Reasons listed for internment include “minor religious infection,” “disturbs other persons by visiting them without reasons,” “relatives abroad,” “thinking is hard to grasp” and “untrustworthy person born in a certain decade.” The last seems to refer to younger men; about 31 percent of people considered “untrustworthy” were in the age bracket of 25 to 29 years, according to an analysis of the data by Zenz.When former student Abdullah Muhammad spotted Emer’s name on the list of the detained, he was distraught.“He didn’t deserve this,” Muhammad said. “Everyone liked and respected him. He was the kind of person who couldn’t stay silent against injustice.”Even in Karakax county, famed for its intellectuals and scholars, Emer stood out as one of the most renowned teachers in the region. Muhammad studied the Quran under Emer for six years as a kid, following him from house to house in an effort to dodge the authorities. Muhammad said Emer was so respected that the police would phone him with warnings ahead of time before raiding classes at his modest, single-story home of brick and mud.Though Emer gave Party-approved sermons, he refused to preach Communist propaganda, Muhammad said, eventually running into trouble with the authorities. He was stripped of his position as an imam and barred from teaching in 1997, amid unrest roiling the region.When Muhammad left China for Saudi Arabia and Turkey in 2009, Emer was making his living as a doctor of traditional medicine. Emer was growing old, and under heavy surveillance, he had stopped attending religious gatherings.That didn’t stop authorities from detaining the imam, who is in his eighties, and sentencing him on various charges for up to 12 years in prison over 2017 and 2018. The database cites four charges in various entries: “stirring up terrorism,” acting as an unauthorized “wild” imam, following the strict Saudi Wahhabi sect and conducting illegal religious teachings.Muhammad called the charges false. Emer had stopped his preaching, practiced a moderate Central Asian sect of Islam rather than Wahhabism and never dreamed of hurting others, let alone stirring up “terrorism,” Muhammad said.“He used to always preach against violence,” Muhammad said. “Anyone who knew him can testify that he wasn’t a religious extremist.”None of Emer’s three sons had been convicted of a crime. But the database shows that over the course of 2017, all were thrown into the detention camps for having too many children, trying to travel abroad, being “untrustworthy” or “infected with religious extremism,”or going on the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. It also shows that their relation to Emer and their religious background was enough to convince officials they were too dangerous to let out from the detention camps.“His father taught him how to pray,” notes one entry for his eldest, Ablikim Memtimin.“His family’s religious atmosphere is thick. We recommend he (Emer) continue training,” says another entry for his youngest son, Emer Memtimin.Even a neighbor was tainted by living near him, with Emer’s alleged crimes and prison sentence recorded in the neighbor’s dossier.The database indicates much of this information is collected by teams of cadres stationed at mosques, sent to visit homes and posted in communities. This information is then compiled in a dossier called the “three circles”, encompassing their relatives, community, and religious background.It wasn’t just the religious who were detained. The database shows that Karakax officials also explicitly targeted people for activities that included going abroad, getting a passport or installing foreign software.Pharmacist Tohti Himit was detained in a camp for having gone multiple times to one of 26 “key” countries, mostly Muslim, according to the database. Former employee Habibullah, who is now in Turkey, recalled Himit as a secular, kind and wealthy man who kept his face free of a beard.“He wasn’t very pious, he didn’t go to the mosque,” said Habibullah, who declined to give his first name out of fear of retribution against family still in China. “I was shocked by how absurd the reasons for detention were.”The database says cadres found Himit had attended his grandfather’s funeral at a local mosque on March 10, 2008. Later that year, the cadres found, he had gone to the same mosque again, once to worship and once to celebrate a festival. In 2014 he had gone to Anhui province, in inner China, to get a passport and go abroad.That, the government concluded, was enough to show that Himit was “certainly dangerous.” They ordered Himit to stay in the center and “continue training.”Emer is now under house arrest due to health issues, his former student, Muhammad, has heard. It’s unclear where Emer’s sons are.It was the imam’s courage and stubbornness that did him in, Muhammad said. Though deprived of his mosque and his right to teach, Emer quietly defied the authorities for two decades by staying true to his faith.“Unlike some other scholars, he never cared about money or anything else the Communist Party could give him,” Muhammad said. “He never bowed down to them — and that’s why they wanted to eliminate him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaked-data-shows-china-s-uighurs-detained-due-to-religion/story-GdcTmLePYSdgaNUza9W9PL.html
18-02-2020||World||‘Help Kashmiris achieve right of self-determination’: Pak PM Imran Khan urges UN||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday urged the UN to fulfil its commitments with the people of Kashmir and help them achieve right of self-determination as he met chief of the global body Antonio Guterres here. During his meeting with the UN Secretary-General, Prime Minister Khan highlighted the “dire human rights and humanitarian situation” in Jammu and Kashmir following India’s August 5 decision to end the special status of the region. “The Prime Minister underscored that the Kashmiri people continued to look to the United Nations to honour its commitments for the realisation of their right to self-determination, as enshrined in numerous UN Security Council resolutions,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after New Delhi ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 last year. India’s decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded its diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian envoy. India has defended its move, saying the special status provisions only gave rise to terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. “The country took the decision of abrogation of Article 370, which had only given separatism and terrorism to that state,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in October last year. India has rejected any third party intervention to the Kashmir issue and has maintained that all outstanding matters in Indo-Pak ties should be resolved bilaterally. Khan claimed that India’s belligerent rhetoric, intensified ceasefire violations on the LoC, and other aggressive actions were imperiling peace and security in the region, the statement said. He also highlighted the possibility of a false flag operation by India to divert global attention from its “unacceptable actions” in Kashmir, it said.Talking about Afghanistan, Khan underscored that there was no military solution to the Afghan conflict and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast support for peace and reconciliation in the war-torn country. Khan also highlighted Pakistan’s generosity in hosting millions of Afghan refugees for the last four decades, the statement said. Earlier, Guterres and Khan attended the International Conference on 40 years of hosting Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The Prime Minister also stressed that climate change posed an existential threat to mankind and assured the Secretary General that Pakistan would work hand in hand with the global community to pursue swift implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement. He also highlighted the landmark ‘10 billion Tree Tsunami’. Guterres also held talks with Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Monday. Matters of mutual interests, overall regional security situation including Afghan refugees issue, Afghan reconciliation process and the Kashmir dispute were discussed during the meeting, Pakistan army said in a statement. “Visiting dignitary said that there is a need to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir,” the statement said. The UN chief on Sunday arrived on a four-day visit to Pakistan during which he will also visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib. Guterres thanked Pakistan for “full access given to United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) in Kashmir,” it said. He also commended the improved security situation in Pakistan and positive efforts towards regional peace and stability. The UN chief also acknowledged Pakistan’s contribution in UN peacekeeping missions and extraordinary achievements in counter terrorism. Separately, United States special envoy for Afghan reconciliation ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad also called on General Bajwa, the statement said. “During the meeting, matters of mutual interest including overall regional security situation and ongoing Afghan reconciliation process were discussed,” it said. Khalilzad was in Pakistan to attend the conference on Afghan refugees and discuss the Afghan peace process. He also met Prime Minister Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-urges-un-to-honour-its-commitments-on-kashmir/story-EC3xRCv5zn2ArskbGfmy3K.html

China’s cumulative death toll is 1870 whereas more than 72500 people have been infected.At least 11,741 are severely ill from the infection, which was first reported in Hubei’s capital city, Wuhan, in December. The total number of infections in the province climbed to 59,989, out of which 1,789 lost their lives, and 7,862 patients recovered, health officials said. Also Watch | Coronavirus: 7 Maldivian nationals evacuated from Wuhan discharged from ITBP facilityThree deaths and nearly 800 confirmed cases have been reported in 25 countries outside China. A team of medical experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) will visit Beijing and the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Sichuan in south and southwest China from Monday to assess the steps taken by the country to contain the virus’ spread. However, China’s foreign ministry hasn’t mentioned Wuhan or Hubei as part of the WHO team’s itinerary.A team from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) studied 72,314 cases till February 11, out of which 44,672 were confirmed cases of coronavirus. They also found that more than twice as many Chinese medical workers have been infected as officially reported by the government. As many as 3,019 medical workers had been infected, among whom 1,688 patients were in severe or critical condition.The large study was published Monday by the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology.As of February 11, the government had acknowledged that more than 1,700 medical workers were infected, almost 90 percent of them in Hubei, according to Chinese National Health Commission deputy chief Zeng Yixin at a press conference Friday.The study, titled ‘Analysis of the Epidemiological Features of New Coronavirus Pneumonia’, found that contrary to what was being assumed earlier, the virus was much more infectious than both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The report states that, as of now, there is no evidence that a “super spreader” incident has occurred in any of the medical institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-crosses-1800-new-study-says-3000-medics-infected/story-SX6XlyOl1TfKEwb2oWPT5H.html

18-02-2020||World||‘True Grit’ novelist Charles Portis dies at 86||Novelist Charles Portis, a favorite among critics and writers for such shaggy dog stories as “Norwood” and “Gringos” and a bounty for Hollywood whose droll, bloody Western “True Grit” was a best-seller twice adapted into Oscar nominated films, died Monday at age 86.Portis, a former newspaper reporter who apparently learned enough to swear off talking to the media, had been suffering from Alzheimer’s in recent years. His brother, Jonathan Portis, told The Associated Press that he died in a hospice in Little Rock, Arkansas, his longtime residence.Charles Portis was among the most admired authors to nearly vanish from public consciousness in his own lifetime. His fans included Tom Wolfe, Roy Blount Jr. and Larry McMurtry, and he was often compared to Mark Twain for his plainspoken humor and wry perspective. Portis saw the world from the ground up, from bars and shacks and trailer homes, and few spun wilder and funnier stories. In a Portis novel, usually set in the South and south of the border, characters embarked on journeys that took the most unpredictable detours.In “Norwood,” an ex-Marine from Texas heads East in a suspicious car to collect a suspicious debt, but winds up on a bus with a circus dwarf, a chicken and a girl he just met. “The Dog of the South” finds one Ray Midge driving from Arkansas to Honduras in search of his wife, his credit cards and his Ford Torino. In “Gringos,” an expatriate in Mexico with a taste for order finds himself amid hippies, end-of-the-world cultists and disappearing friends.The public knew Portis best for “True Grit,” the quest of Arkansas teen Mattie Ross to avenge her father’s murder. The novel was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in 1968 and was soon adapted (and softened) as a film showcase for John Wayne, who starred as Rooster Cogburn, the drunken, one-eyed marshal Mattie enlists to find the killer. The role brought Wayne his first Academy Award and was revived by the actor, much less successfully, in the sequel “Rooster Cogburn.”Rooster was so strong a character that a new generation of filmgoers and Oscar voters welcomed him back. In 2010, the Coen brothers worked up a less glossy, more faithful “True Grit,” featuring Jeff Bridges as Rooster and newcomer Hallie Steinfeld as Mattie. The film received 10 nominations, including best actor for Bridges, and brought new attention to Portis and his novel, which topped the trade paperback list of The New York Times.“No living Southern writer captures the spoken idioms of the South as artfully as Portis does,” Mississippi native Donna Tartt wrote in an afterword for a 2005 reissue of the novel.Portis was born in 1933 in El Dorado, Arkansas, one of four children of a school superintendent and a housewife whom Portis thought could have been a writer herself. As a kid, he loved comic books and movies and the stories he learned from his family. In a brief memoir written for The Atlantic Monthly, he recalled growing up in a community where the ratio was about “two Baptist churches or one Methodist church per gin. It usually took about three gins to support a Presbyterian church, and a community with, say, four before you found enough tepid idolators to form an Episcopal congregation.”He was a natural raconteur who credited his stint in the Marines with giving him time to read. After leaving the service, he graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1958 with a degree in journalism and for the next few years was a newspaper man, starting as a night police reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal and finishing as London bureau chief for the New York Herald Tribune.Fellow Tribune staffers included Wolfe, who regarded Portis as “the original laconic cutup” and a fellow rebel against the boundaries of journalism, and Nora Ephron, who would remember her colleague as a sociable man with a reluctance to use a telephone. His interview subjects included Malcolm X and J.D. Salinger, whom Portis encountered on an airplane. He was also a first-hand observer of the civil rights movement. In 1963, he covered a riot and the police beating of black people in Birmingham, Alabama. Around the same time, he reported on a Ku Klux Klan meeting, a dullish occasion after which “the grand dragon of Mississippi disappeared grandly into the Southern night, his car engine hitting on about three cylinders.”Anxious to write novels, Portis left the paper in 1964 and from Arkansas completed “Norwood,” published two years later and adapted for a 1970 movie of the same name starring Glen Campbell and Joe Namath.Portis placed his stories in familiar territory. He knew his way around Texas and Mexico and worked enough with women stringers from the Ozarks in Arkansas to draw upon them for Mattie’s narrative voice in “True Grit.” He eventually settled in Little Rock, where he reportedly spent years working on a novel that was never released. “Gringos,” his fifth and last novel, came out in 1991.Portis published short fiction in The Atlantic during the 1990s, but was mostly forgotten before admiring essays in Esquire and the New York Observer by Ron Rosenbaum were noticed by publishing director Tracy Carns of the Overlook Press, which reissued all of Portis’ novels. Some of his journalism, short stories and travel writings were published in the 2012 anthology “Escape Velocity.”In recent years, the author lived in open seclusion, a regular around Little Rock who drove a pickup truck, enjoyed an occasional beer and stepped away from reporters. He did turn up to collect The Oxford American’s Award for Lifetime Achievement in Southern Literature and was known to answer the occasional letter from a reader. But otherwise Portis seemed to honor Mattie’s code in “True Grit” for how to deal with journalists.“I do not fool around with newspapers,” Mattie says. “The paper editors are great ones for reaping where they have not sown. Another game they have is to send reporters out to talk to you and get your stories free. I know the young reporters are not paid well and I would not mind helping those boys out with their ‘scoops’ if they could ever get anything right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/true-grit-novelist-charles-portis-dies-at-86/story-RoSu932QLYCuejI1fMyoVN.html
18-02-2020||World||UK says will set own laws after Brexit, won’t accept EU-ruled ‘level playing field’||Britain’s trade negotiator warned Monday that his government would not accept EU supervision of its economy in exchange for close trade ties. Senior diplomat David Frost told academics in Brussels that London intended to set its own laws following Brexit and not follow EU-imposed “level playing field” rules.“It isn’t a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure -- it is the point of the whole project,” he said.Frost’s speech at the Free University of Brussels took place as EU member states were drawing up a mandate for their own negotiator, Michel Barnier.Some capitals, in particular France, are pushing for a deal in which Britain would have to sign up to EU-supervised regulation in exchange for privileged access to the huge European single market.But Frost, adding detail to the position championed by British prime minister Boris Johnson, said London wanted a typical trade deal of the kind Brussels signed with Canada.“It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us -- to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has,” Frost said. “So to think that we might accept EU supervision on so-called level playing field issues simply fails to see the point of what we are doing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-will-set-own-laws-after-brexit-won-t-accept-eu-ruled-level-playing-field/story-5oMEBSFMZVeC3Hi1njItBI.html
18-02-2020||World||Scramble to find US cruise passengers as 1 later tests positive for coronavirus||A scramble intensified on Monday to trace around 1,200 passengers from US cruise liner Westerdam, allowed to disembark in Cambodia, after one traveller was later diagnosed with the deadly coronavirus — the American woman only made it as far as the Kuala Lumpur Airport in Malaysia where she was stopped at the thermal scanner; she later tested positive. Meanwhile, 14 passengers, all American, who were evacuated from another cruise ship, Diamond Princess, this one in Japan, and initially believed to be free of the virus, tested positive shortly before their chartered flight was to take off for the US. They were flown out — after a section of the aircraft was made into a contained space for them — along with the other evacuees. Outside China, the Diamond Princess has had the largest number of cases of the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus that emerged in China late last year.Both incidents raised fresh concerns about the quality of screening ahead of evacuation or release of people who have had the chance of being exposed to the highly contagious virus, which originated in China and has killed around 1800 people, almost all in China, and infected tens of thousands across 26 countries (but, again, mostly in China). On Monday, about 70 Wuhan evacuees were discharged from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police’s quarantine facility on the outskirts of Delhi, and by Tuesday evening all 406 people under quarantine at the ITBP facility are expected to leave for their respective homes. None of them were infected, the health ministry said. However, the Westerdam issue has raised fears that potentially tens of infected passengers may now be scattered across the world without full health checks — as Cambodia on Monday afternoon treated a few dozen of the passengers to bus tours around the capital Phnom Penh.Passenger Christina Kerby, whose droll tweets as the Westerdam was bounced across ports drew widespread attention, admitted she was “surprised” to be allowed on a tour of the Cambodian capital before being given the complete all-clear from the virus. “I have young kids back home (in the US) and wouldn’t want to risk infecting them or anyone around me if I am carrying the virus,” she told AFP.The Westerdam was at sea for two weeks during which it was barred from Japan, Guam, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand over fears it could be carrying the virus. On Thursday Cambodia, a staunch ally of Beijing, allowed the ship to dock at Sihanoukville. It was met by the kingdom’s bombastic premier, Hun Sen, who hugged disembarking passengers as he swiftly latched on to the Westerdam’s PR potential for a nation more often in the spotlight for human rights abuses. His stance won applause from US President Donald Trump. But three days later one Westerdam passenger, an 83-year-old American, was stopped on arrival in Malaysia and later diagnosed with the coronavirus. On Monday, Malaysia said over 130 other passengers who also took the flight with the sick American women left for the US, Europe and Australia and Hong Kong.Thailand, a flight hub already used by scores of the Westerdam passengers, on Monday mulled a ban on transit by cruise goers, as the region played catch up to the risks posed by the boat. “Passengers on ship are at risk and travel by airplane will cause risk to other passengers,” health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Monday. Cruise operator Holland America is working with national health authorities “to investigate and follow up with individuals who may have come in contact with the guest”, chief medical officer Dr Grant Tarling said late Sunday.Another 233 passengers and 747 crew remain on the Westerdam, which is still docked at Sihanoukville. Authorities have been allowing them to leave the vessel in groups based on their flight bookings but those on board told AFP they are now not permitted to disembark.A Sihanoukville spokesman said Monday health samples are being collected from all onboard the Westerdam “in order to be clear”, adding that passengers will not go off-ship until the tests are completed.China’s foreign minister Wang Yi will meet South-east Asian counterparts in late Laos this week to discuss the unprecedented health crisis, which has battered manufacturing and tourism across the region and led to an array of travel restrictions.In Tokyo, Japanese health ministry officials confirmed on Monday that 99 more people were infected by the new virus aboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 454. The 14 Americans are part of the 99. The ministry has been carrying out tests on passengers and crew on the ship, docked in Yokohama, a port city near Tokyo.The 14-day quarantine for those on the ship was due to end Wednesday. The ministry said it now has tested 1,723 people on the Diamond Princess. The ship had about 3,700 passengers and crew.Two chartered planes flew 340 Americans who were aboard the vessel out of Japan. About 380 Americans had been on the ship. The State Department announced later that 14 of the evacuees were confirmed to have the virus in tests given before they boarded the planes.They were taken to the US because they did not have symptoms and were being isolated from other passengers on the planes, it said. Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Italy were planning similar flights for their citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scramble-to-find-passengers-who-left-us-cruise-liner-after-one-later-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-JkgDc1tDD0jvXMSbRbB8KI.html
18-02-2020||World||WHO warns against novel coronavirus ‘blanket measures’||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday warned against “blanket measures” over the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointing out the epidemic outside of China was only affecting a “tiny” proportion of the population.WHO also said that - with a mortality rate of around 2 percent -- COVID-19 was “less deadly” than other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).WHO officials rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted to avoid risking a new nest of infection like the one on the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess off Japan.“Measures should be taken proportional to the situation. Blanket measures may not help,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.The outbreak, which has infected some 70,500 people in China and killed over 1,700, has battered manufacturing and tourism across the region and led to multiple travel restrictions including for flights and cruises.“If we are going to disrupt every cruise ship in the world on the off chance that there might be some potential contact with some potential pathogen then where do we stop?” said Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme.Ryan said that even at the epicentre of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei Province, the “attack rate” -- a measure of the speed of spread of the virus -- was four per 100,000.“This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected. Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people,” he said.Tedros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend “must be interpreted very cautiously”.“Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,” he said.Tedros said that more than 80 percent of patients infected with the virus have mild disease and recover, while 14 percent have severe diseases such as pneumonia.Around five per cent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death,” he added.Tedros said there were “relatively few cases” among children and more research was needed to understand why.

Blanket measures may not help,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.The outbreak, which has infected some 70,500 people in China and killed over 1,700, has battered manufacturing and tourism across the region and led to multiple travel restrictions including for flights and cruises.“If we are going to disrupt every cruise ship in the world on the off chance that there might be some potential contact with some potential passenger then where do we stop?” said Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme.Ryan said that even at the epicentre of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei Province, the “attack rate” -- a measure of the speed of spread of the virus -- was four per 100,000.“This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected. Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people,” he said.Tedros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend “must be interpreted very cautiously”.“Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,” he said.Tedros said that more than 80 percent of patients infected with the virus have mild disease and recover, while 14 percent have severe diseases such as pneumonia.Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death,” he added.Tedros said there were “relatively few cases” among children and more research was needed to understand why.Find additional latest updates about novel coronavirus on our live blog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-who-warns-against-covid-19-blanket-measures/story-SXkG0nMpYOI8rhUJpSF6xM.html

At the foremost are the health and well-being of its teams and clients,” it said.The “31 Rue Cambon” show was first held in Paris in December, inspired by the studio and workshop of founder Coco Chanel. The decor was created by the film director Sofia Coppola.Hundreds of trade shows and other major events in China have been cancelled in recent weeks over fears of the virus, which has killed nearly 1,800 people in mainland China since it was first reported in December.Last week, the Chinese designer Jarel Zhang cancelled the showing of his new collection during Paris Fashion Week in March “in order to ensure the health and safety of both countries and reduce the number of contacts” that could spread the flu-like disease.Find additional latest updates about novel coronavirus on our live blog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-chanel-halts-beijing-fashion-show-over-covid-19-fears/story-oW62DsmSVcjK7FlUgdVRdO.html

India has maintained that Pakistan extends regular support to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen, whose prime target is India, and has urged FATF to take action against Islamabad. The week-long Financial Action Task Force plenary, currently on in Paris, will decide Pakistan’s fate -- whether it will continue in the FATF’s ‘Grey List’, or will be put in the ‘Black List’ or escape from listing. Without naming Pakistan, the FATF said in a statement that terrorists use various methods to gain financing, including using social media to identify new followers and to solicit financial or other forms of material support. Individuals sympathetic to humanitarian causes or vulnerable to violent messaging are often targeted, it said.Also read | Pak may stay in grey list as action over terror funding tops FATF meet agenda “The FATF has tightened its standards on terrorist financing which has helped disrupt access to funds for groups such as ISIL and Al-Qaida. However, various groups still benefit from funds raised through illegal activity and from supporters worldwide,” the Paris headquartered FATF said. The FATF said it is monitoring terrorist financing risks and works to help authorities trace funding to strengthen prosecutions. “The FATF is also monitoring illicit financing via new payment methods, such as cryptocurrencies,” it said. The plenary is examining the money laundering and terrorist financing risks that countries face to set and promote global standards to tackle these risks. Last week, an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan sentenced Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attack and founder of LeT, to 11 years in two terror financing cases. The move came just four days ahead of the FATF Paris plenary. Saeed, a UN designated terrorist on whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty, was arrested on July 17, 2019 in the terror financing cases. The 70-year-old fiery cleric is lodged at the high-security Kot Lakhpat jail in Pakistan. Pakistan has also recently informed FATF that JeM founder Masood Azhar and his family are “missing”. Pakistan has claimed that there were only 16 U.N. designated terrorists in Pakistan, of which “seven are dead”. Out of the nine who are alive, seven had applied to the UN for exemption from financial and travel restrictions. Pakistan needs 12 votes out of 39 to exit the ‘Grey List’ and move to ‘White List’. To avoid ‘Black List’, it needs support of three countries. In the last month’s FATF meeting in Beijing, Pakistan has got support of Malaysia and Turkey besides FATF current chair China. The FATF plenary held in October 2019 had noted that Pakistan addressed only five out of the 27 tasks given to it in controlling funding to terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Hizbul Mujahideen, responsible for a series of attacks in India. The FATF had said it strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February, 2020. In the Beijing meeting, Pakistan provided a list of its action taken to comply with FATF directions.Also read | Pakistan no longer a ‘safe haven’ for terror groups: Prime Minister Imran Khan Pakistan was placed on the ‘Grey List’ by the FATF in June, 2018 and was given a plan of action to complete it by October, 2019 or face the risk of being placed on the ‘Black List’ along with Iran and North Korea. The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF currently has 39 members including two regional organisations -- the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. India is a member of the FATF consultations and its Asia Pacific Group. If Pakistan continues with the ‘Grey List’, it will be difficult for the country to get financial aid from the IMF, World Bank, ADB and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-terror-groups-continue-to-get-funds-from-supporters-fatf/story-08aKPhVSfLEpk8SvKjnC2M.html

Passengers later descended wearing surgical masks.A couple hours earlier, a separate chartered jet landed at Travis Air Force Base in California.The passengers will remain under quarantine another 14 days.The coronavirus outbreak has killed 1,770 people in China and five elsewhere, with Chinese officials reporting another 2,048 cases on Monday, raising the total to 70,548.The cruise ship Diamond Princess, with 3,700 passengers total, held by far the largest cluster of cases outside China with around 400 people testing positive. The ship had been ordered to stay under quarantine at Yokohama port on Feb. 3. Before the arrival of the sickened passengers from the cruise, U.S. officials had reported 15 cases in seven states, most of them travelers who had returned from China but also three who had been evacuated on previous, U.S.-chartered planes repatriating Americans. Previously, more than 40 Americans on the Diamond Princess had tested positive, and U.S. health officials said they would remain in Japan for treatment.The 300 people removed from the ship and due to board the U.S.-bound planes were evaluated by U.S. government medical staff and initially deemed asymptomatic and fit to fly, the State Department said.But after passengers had left the ship and were on their way to the airport, U.S. officials received notice that 14 passengers in the group had tested positive, the State Department said. All had tested negative two to three days earlier.“These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,” the State Department said.The State Department said it decided to allow the 14 sickened Americans to fly home after consulting with U.S. health experts.Find additional latest updates about novel coronavirus on our live blog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates-american-passengers-fly-back-after-spending-two-weeks-on-covid-19-affected-cruise/story-EgMorgg7Z4FPHMQEJQqm8N.html
18-02-2020||World||Pakistan no longer a ‘safe haven’ for terror groups: Prime Minister Imran Khan||There are no “safe havens” for terror groups in Pakistan “right now”, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday while acknowledging publicly that it was possibly not the case earlier. Addressing an international conference marking 40 years of hosting Afghan refugees in the country, he said Pakistan seeks peace in Afghanistan and instability in the war-torn neighbouring country was not in its interest.Khan’s assertion on terror safe havens came as the Financial Action Task Force, the global anti-money laundering watchdog, began a crucial meeting in Paris where Pakistan is trying to wriggle out of being blacklisted for not doing enough to combat terror financing.The United States, India and Afghanistan have long accused Pakistan of providing safe havens to terror groups like the Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed.“I can tell you that there are no safe havens here,” Khan said at a conference here, also attended by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. “Whatever the situation might have been in the past, right now, I can tell you... there is one thing we want: peace in Afghanistan.” Khan said.He admitted that it was possible that such safe heavens were operating in the country after 9/11 in the Afghan refugee camps, The News reported.“How is the government capable of checking how militants operate from the camps,” Khan said, adding that it was not possible because the Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan have had a population of over 100,000.Prime Minister Khan’s assertion came after Afghanistan’s second vice president, Sarwar Danish accused Pakistan of allowing the Taliban to recruit new fighters from Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan to launch attacks in his country.While Pakistan cannot fully guarantee that no Taliban militants are hiding among the huge number of Afghans living in Pakistan, Khan said his government had done all it can to prevent attacks in Afghanistan, including by building a border fence.The whole country is on the same page on Afghanistan, he said, adding that previously it was said that the government and the country’s security forces were not on the same page. However, this was not the case now, he said.He highlighted that Pakistan was not seeking peace in Afghanistan because it has been hosting 1.4 million Afghan refugees, but because the people of Afghanistan deserve peace.Earlier, Earlier, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in his address stated that the people of Pakistan for 40 years have responded with generosity in hosting the Afghan refugees.“Even though major conflict has erupted in some other part of the world; Pakistan is still the second largest refugee host. I am struck by the extraordinary solidarity and compassion,” he said. At the same time, he urged the international community to step up support for Pakistan in tackling the problem of Afghan refugees.“The global community must step up,” Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-no-longer-a-safe-haven-for-terror-groups-prime-minister-imran-khan/story-8mRYBzzfWChfNFjIdbbZVP.html
18-02-2020||World||China to postpone top political event held annually in Beijing||The Chinese government is set to make the unprecedented call to postpone its biggest political gathering held in Beijing every March because of the ongoing coronavirus (covid-19) epidemic.The standing committee of China’s rubber-stamp Parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), will meet later this month to discuss the postponement, state media reported, indicating that the decision to push it back is but a formality.The official statement didn’t mention it but the postponement was likely caused by the risk of cross-infection among the thousands who gather for it inside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Thousands of members from all of China’s provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions gather in Beijing for two weeks in March for the session, commonly referred to as the Two Sessions.It comprises two separate meetings: One of NPC deputies, and the other of delegates to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Congress (CPPCC), the country’s top political advisory committee.The NPC has 2,980 deputies while the CPPCC has 2,158 delegates.The third annual session of the 13th NPC was originally planned to open on March 5 in Beijing at the Great Hall of the People.New dates for the meeting will be announced later.Preparations for the session had already been made.“But after the outbreak of covid-19, epidemic prevention and control has become the most important work. It is now a crucial moment to curb the spread and win the battle, so no effort should be spared,” the official news agency, Xinhua, said quoting NPC spokesperson, Zang Tiewei.Tiewei said that many of the nearly 3,000 NPC deputies, including leading officials at the municipal, provincial levels and other fields, are fighting at the frontlines of the epidemic battle.“After careful evaluation, the Council of Chairpersons (of the NPC) decided that it is necessary to postpone the annual legislative session to allow efforts to be concentrated on containing the epidemic. This is in line with putting people’s lives and health as the top priority,” Tiewei said.Though the decision to delay the Two Sessions seems to have been taken in principle, as per relevant Chinese laws, the NPC meets in session once a year and is convened by the NPC Standing Committee.The decision to postpone the session needs to be made by the NPC Standing Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-latest-updates-china-to-postpone-top-political-event-held-annually-in-beijing/story-f7KdiioD9Gkwj57X9QO4uK.html
