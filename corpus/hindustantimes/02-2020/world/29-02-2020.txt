Initially, the US will draw its troop levels down to 8,600 within 135 days of Saturday’s signing, while completely removing forces from five military bases.The US military currently has about 20 bases of varying sizes across Afghanistan, a US defence official said.If the deal continues to hold, then the US and its partners will complete the “withdrawal of all remaining forces from Afghanistan”.In the future, the US will also refrain from threatening or using force against Afghanistan or intervening in its “domestic affairs”.Afghan talks and ceasefire The deal also stipulates that talks between the Taliban and all “Afghan sides” will commence March 10. The exact makeup or who exactly will represent the Afghan team is not spelt out. The deal also says a ceasefire will only be an “item” on the agenda of the talks, falling short of making it a compulsory component. According to the agreement, the participants of the talks “will discuss the date and modalities of a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”.Prisoner release The US and the Taliban also agreed to swap thousands of prisoners in a “confidence building measure” set to coincide with the beginning of talks between the Taliban and the Afghan team. “Up to 5,000 prisoners of the (Taliban)... and 1,000 prisoners of the other side (Afghan forces) will be released by March 10.”Sanctions The US also pledged to begin reviewing the current list of sanctions targeting Taliban leaders and members, with the goal of removing these measures by August 27, 2020. Washington said it would also start “diplomatic engagement” with members of the UN Security Council and the Kabul government to remove the Taliban from sanctions lists. Al-Qaeda The deal also calls on the Taliban to prevent groups, including Al-Qaeda, from using Afghanistan as a base to threaten the security of the US and its allies.The Taliban will prevent such groups from “recruiting, training and fundraising” and will not host them in Afghanistan, the accord states. It also bars the Taliban from providing them with travel and legal documents. The agreement does not specify that the Taliban publically disavow and officially cut ties with Al-Qaeda.Even so, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on the Taliban in Doha on Saturday “to honour its commitments to sever ties with jihadist groups.”Relations and reconstruction The deal concludes with the US and Taliban pledging to seek “positive” relations with each other, along with whatever government comes out of intra-Afghan talks. And the US promises to “seek economic cooperation” for the reconstruction of the war-torn country with the “new post settlement” government in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/troops-withdrawal-sanctions-prisoners-release-key-elements-of-us-taliban-peace-deal/story-LdoelTwEBm49GegxImoRfK.html
29-02-2020||World||Beijing should act quickly on outbreak alerts, share data globally: WHO||China should overcome “obstacles” against acting immediately on early alerts and share key disease data “more clearly” internationally, the WHO-led team which carried out a 14-day investigation into the ongoing covid-19 outbreak in the country has said.Until Saturday, the infection had killed nearly 3,000 people and infected more than 82,000 globally with the WHO bumping up the international public health emergency category to the “highest level” – possibly the highest before declaring it a pandemic.China on Saturday reported at least 47 new deaths, taking the toll to 2,835 and added another 427 confirmed cases of covid-19 to take the number of total infections to 79,251, the national health commission (NHC) said.Of the 427 new cases, four cases of covid-19 were reported from outside the Hubei province, the outbreak epicentre.The WHO-China report, which is also very effusive about the steps China took to control the disease, comes in the backdrop of reports that say not only local medical and government authorities, the top leadership of Communist Party of China-ruled country was well aware of the outbreak by early January.President Xi Jinping had held a meeting to discuss the disease and it containment on January 7 – several days before any alert was publicly sounded.The covid-19 outbreak is said to have broken out in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province in early December – even November according to one report – but containment measures and restrictions were put in place only weeks later – a crucial time lost in the fight against an unknown and deadly pathogen.The report also indicates that the initial medics who were treating covid-19 cases were not protected against the virulence of the pathogen.“While the scale and impact of China’s COVID-19 operation has been remarkable, it has also highlighted areas for improvement in public health emergency response capacity,” the report said.“These include overcoming any obstacles to act immediately on early alerts, to massively scale-up capacity for isolation and care, to optimise the protection of frontline health care workers in all settings, to enhance collaborative action on priority gaps in knowledge and tools, and to more clearly communicate key data and developments internationally,” the 40-page report says.The report on “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (covid-19)” jointly compiled by WHO and the NHC identified the disease as a “zoonotic virus”, which jumped from animal to human, adding that there is no known “…pre-existing immunity in humans”, and everyone is assumed to be susceptible to infection. The report was drawn up by the WHO-China joint team, which visited Beijing, Guangzhou, Sichuan, and Wuhan between February 16 and 24.The report added that human-to-human transmission was largely happening within families.The report said that bats appear to be the reservoir of the virus, but the intermediate host(s) has not yet been identified“Airborne transmission has not been reported for covid-19 and it is not believed to be a major source of transmission based on available evidence,” the report stated.The “cordon sanitaire” around Wuhan and neighbouring cities imposed since January 23 has effectively prevented further exportation of infected individuals to the rest of the country, the report added.“In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in the history,” the report said.“The strategy that underpinned this containment effort was initially a national approach that promoted universal temperature monitoring, masking, and hand washing. However, as the outbreak evolved, and knowledge was gained, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor implementation,” it added.The implementation of these containment measures has been supported and enabled by the innovative and aggressive use of cutting-edge technologies, from shifting to online medical platforms for routine care and schooling to the use of 5G platforms to facilitate rural response operations, it stated.The report recommended that China should maintain “…an appropriate level of emergency management protocols, depending on the assessed risk in each area and recognising the real risk of new cases and clusters of covid-19 as economic activity resumes, movement restrictions are lifted, and schools reopen”.“Carefully monitor the phased lifting of the current restrictions on movement and public gatherings, beginning with the return of workers and migrant labor, followed by the eventual reopening of schools and lifting other measures,” it further recommended.China sends team to Iran help fight against coronavirusChina has sent a group of experts to Iran to help combat the novel coronavirus in the country, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying has said.She said on Twitter that the Chinese experts are on their way to Iran.The coronavirus disease is enemy of all, Hua said, adding “we must fight together”.During his phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif earlier, state councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi said China will continue to provide assistance within its capabilities to Iran in curbing the epidemic and treating the sick.China has already donated a batch of nucleic acid detection kits and medical supplies to Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-should-act-quickly-on-outbreak-alerts-share-data-globally-who/story-deocnZpWAtwKlNKTTwDO8N.html
29-02-2020||World||‘Historic opportunity for peace’: White House on US-Afghanistan deal||The Trump White House took a victory lap Saturday saying the president had come good on his promise of ending endless wars with the conclusion of the Afghan agreement, which, it said, was a “historic opportunity for peace” and the United States will be “closely” watching the Taliban to ensure compliance.President Donald Trump had not personally commented on the signing of the agreement yet, but the White House said in a note released shortly after that the president “is making good on his promise to bring our troops home from endless wars overseas by working toward peace in Afghanistan”.Trump ran for president on the promise of ending America’s long-running wars such as the one in Afghanistan and bring troops home. He has appeared to have been in a hurry and faced criticism earlier for engaging with the Taliban directly in an unprecedented move, cutting out the Afghan government. He was also criticized for wanting to withdraw troops from Syria after prematurely declaring victory against the Islamic State.Watch: US, Taliban sign peace deal aimed at ending war in Afghanistan While chalking up the Afghan agreement as another promise fulfilled, the White House noted it was only a “historic opportunity of peace” and “work remains” to be done.The United States has secured “strong commitments” from the Taliban that they will “permanently sever their ties to international terrorists”, the White House said. And “as the agreement is implemented, we will be watching closely and making determinations about compliance based on our own judgment and the safety of our personnel.”The United States will be withdrawing troops — from the current 13,000 to about 8,600 over the next months — but will sustain its counter-terrorism forces to “continue dismantling terrorist groups that seek to attack the United States” The pace of troop reduction, it stressed, “is conditions based and will depend on how well the Taliban comply with the commitments they have made”.“If the political settlement fails, if the talks fail, there is nothing that obliges the United States to withdraw troops.,” a senior administration official told reporters at background briefing, referring to the Taliban committing to engage in a political dialogue with the Afghan government. Apart from the commitment to “permanently” sever ties with terrorists, the Taliban will also be watched closely by the United States for its commitments to enter “negotiations with the Afghan government, its political leaders, and Afghan civil society, including women”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/historic-opportunity-for-peace-white-house-on-us-afghanistan-deal/story-r9sgD7diMZ90VIlGrrsG4H.html
29-02-2020||World||As coronavirus spreads, world’s richest lose $444 bn after hellish week for markets||Last week was an expensive one for most investors, even for billionaires.The combined fortunes of the world’s 500 richest people fell by $444 billion as the coronavirus continued to spread -- and spread fear -- rattling equity markets worldwide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 12%, the biggest five-day slide since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, in a rout that vaporized more than $6 trillion from global stocks.The drubbing more than erased the $78 billion in gains that the 500 wealthiest people had amassed since the start of the year through last week, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The world’s three richest people -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos, Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault -- incurred the biggest losses, with their combined wealth dropping about $30 billion.Elon Musk, the world’s 25th-richest person, rang up the fourth-largest weekly loss -- $9 billion -- as shares of his Tesla Inc. slid after a steep climb to start the year. He’s still up $8.8 billion in 2020 and has a net worth of $36.3 billion.Health officials are struggling to contain the virus, which can cause a potentially deadly pneumonia-like illness in a minority of patients and spread from others who look healthy. The World Health Organization has thus far refrained from declaring it a pandemic.About 80% of billionaires on Bloomberg’s wealth ranking are now in the red this year, including those whose businesses have been swept up in the global drama. Carnival Corp. Chairman Micky Arison lost $1 billion this week as the world’s largest cruise-line operator held tourists aboard one of its ships in Japan, where at least five passengers have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-coronavirus-spreads-world-s-richest-lose-444-bn-after-hellish-week-for-markets/story-FGoxC6Ji6IVLqWT3oM2QdM.html
29-02-2020||World||US signs peace accord with Taliban, to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan in 14 months||The United States signed a peace agreement with Taliban militants on Saturday aimed at bringing an end to 18 years of bloodshed in Afghanistan and allowing U.S. troops to return home from America’s longest war.Under the agreement, the U.S. would draw its forces down to 8,600 from 13,000 in the next 3-4 months, with the remaining U.S. forces withdrawing in 14 months. The complete pullout, however, would depend on the Taliban meeting their commitments to prevent terrorism.President George W. Bush ordered the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Some U.S. troops currently serving there had not yet been born when the World Trade Center collapsed on that crisp, sunny morning that changed how Americans see the world.Watch: US, Taliban sign peace deal aimed at ending war in Afghanistan It only took a few months to topple the Taliban and send Osama bin Laden and top al-Qaida militants scrambling across the border into Pakistan, but the war dragged on for years as the United States tried establish a stable, functioning state in one of the least developed countries in the world. The Taliban regrouped, and currently hold sway over half the country.The U.S. spent more than $750 billion, and on all sides the war cost tens of thousands of lives lost, permanently scarred and indelibly interrupted. But the conflict was also frequently ignored by U.S. politicians and the American public.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the ceremony in Qatar, where the Taliban have a political office, but did not sign the agreement. Instead, it was signed by U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.The Taliban harbored bin Laden and his al-Qaida network as they plotted, and then celebrated, the hijackings of four airliners that were crashed into lower Manhattan, the Pentagon and a field in western Pennsylvania, killing almost 3,000 people.Pompeo had privately told a conference of U.S. ambassadors at the State Department this week that he was going only because President Donald Trump had insisted on his participation, according to two people present.Dozens of Taliban members had earlier held a small victory march in Qatar in which they waved the militant group’s white flags, according to a video shared on Taliban websites. “Today is the day of victory, which has come with the help of Allah,” said Abbas Stanikzai, one of the Taliban’s lead negotiators, who joined the march.Trump has repeatedly promised to get the U.S. out of its “endless wars” in the Middle East, and the withdrawal of troops could provide a boost as he seeks re-election in a nation weary of involvement in distant conflicts.Trump has approached the Taliban agreement cautiously, steering clear of the crowing surrounding other major foreign policy actions, such as his talks with North Korea.Last September, on short notice, he called off what was to be a signing ceremony with the Taliban at Camp David after a series of new Taliban attacks. But he has since been supportive of the talks led by his special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad.Under the agreement, the Taliban promise not to let extremists use the country as a staging ground for attacking the U.S. or its allies. But U.S. officials are loath to trust the Taliban to fulfill their obligations.The prospects for Afghanistan’s future are uncertain. The agreement sets the stage for peace talks involving Afghan factions, which are likely to be complicated. Under the agreement, 5,000 Taliban are to be released from Afghan-run jails, but it’s not known if the Afghan government will do that. There are also questions about whether Taliban fighters loyal to various warlords will be willing to disarm.It’s not clear what will become of gains made in women’s rights since the toppling of the Taliban, which had repressed women and girls under a strict brand of Sharia law. Women’s rights in Afghanistan had been a top concern of both the Bush and Obama administration, but it remains a deeply conservative country, with women still struggling for basic rights.There are currently more than 16,500 soldiers serving under the NATO banner, of which 8,000 are American. Germany has the next largest contingent, with 1,300 troops, followed by Britain with 1,100.In all, 38 NATO countries are contributing forces to Afghanistan. The alliance officially concluded its combat mission in 2014 and now provides training and support to Afghan forces.The U.S. has a separate contingent of 5,000 troops deployed to carry out counter-terrorism missions and provide air and ground support to Afghan forces when requested.Since the start of negotiations with the Taliban, the U.S. has stepped up its air assaults on the Taliban as well as a local Islamic State affiliate. Last year the U.S. air force dropped more bombs on Afghanistan than in any year since 2013.Seven days ago, the Taliban began a seven-day “reduction of violence” period, a prerequisite to the peace deal signing.“We have seen a significant reduction in violence in Afghanistan over the last days, and therefore we are also very close to the signing of an agreement between the United States and the Taliban,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday in Brussels.He was in Kabul on Saturday for a separate signing ceremony with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper. That signing was intended to show continuing NATO and U.S. support for Afghanistan.“The road to peace will be long and hard and there will be setbacks, and there is a risk always for spoilers,” Stoltenberg said. “But the thing is, we are committed, the Afghan people are committed to peace, and we will continue to provide support.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taliban-sign-peace-agreement-aimed-at-ending-18-years-of-conflict-in-afghanistan-america-s-longest-running-war/story-DZ6TfZITPUX3P5xIfgfy9N.html
29-02-2020||World||Qatar confirms first coronavirus case||Qatar has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, state media reported Saturday, after a 36-year-old Qatari woman who was evacuated to Doha from Iran tested positive.Qatar on Thursday repatriated a number of its citizens from Iran -- which is battling the worst outbreak outside China -- and confined them to a 14-day period of quarantine, the government said.The health ministry said the infected patient had been admitted to hospital. “This had been expected because of the virus’s spread across the region and other countries, alongside the exponential increase in the number of cases,” the health ministry said according to the Qatar News Agency.Iran on Saturday reported nine new deaths from the novel coronavirus and 205 fresh cases in the past 24 hours, bringing its overall toll to 43 dead and 593 infected.Gulf countries have announced a raft of measures to cut links with Iran to prevent the coronavirus spreading, after infections emerged among people returning from pilgrimages to the Islamic republic.Saudi Arabia on Friday barred citizens from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar, from entering two of Islam’s holiest cities amid fears over coronavirus.The Gulf tally stands at 45 cases of coronavirus in Kuwait, 38 in Bahrain, six in Oman and two more in the United Arab Emirates for a total of 21.On Saturday the UAE also announced it was suspending nursery school classes, and limiting activities at other schools.Authorities said that two planes will also be sent to Iran to collect Emiratis and other Gulf citizens trapped there after air routes were closed.Cyclists taking part in the UAE Tour are awaiting the results of coronavirus tests from their hotel lockdown, after the event was abandoned Thursday when two staff from an Italian team tested positive.The race organisers said in a tweet Saturday that 167 of those quarantined had received negative results on coronavirus tests, but it did not say whether they were cyclists or staff members, nor how many others were awaiting results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatar-confirms-first-coronavirus-case/story-lA7EebXtyDHQKA5lKIXjoM.html

29-02-2020||World||UK minister Priti Patel’s top official quits in bullying row||Days after home secretary Priti Patel and the top civil servant in the Home Office, Philip Rutnam, jointly dismissed reports of alleged bullying by the former, Rutnam resigned on Saturday and took the extraordinary step of going public with the reasons for his resignation.According to Rutnam, his experience in recent days had been “extreme”, adding that he had received allegations that her conduct included “shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands - behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out”.Accusing Patel of orchestrating a campaign against him, he said in a video statement to the BBC: “In the last 10 days, I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign. It has been alleged that I have briefed the media against the home secretary”.“This - along with many other claims - is completely false. The home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her. She has not made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments.”“Despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no effort to engage with me to discuss this. I believe that these events give me very strong grounds to claim constructive, unfair dismissal and I will be pursuing that claim in the courts”.“My experience has been extreme, but I consider there is evidence that it was part of wider pattern of behaviour. One of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our 35,000 people”.“I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands - behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out”.Patel has been the subject of reports of allegedly not being trusted by Britain’s intelligence agencies, who reportedly hold back information from her. She is also accused of trying to ease out some officials – such reports have been strenuously denied.Rutnam’s resignation adds a new twist to swirling reports about Patel’s style of working. He said he would sue the government for constructive dismissal.The resignation comes days after cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill hit out at “unattributed briefings” and leaks in the media, saying they “besmirched the country’s hard-won reputation for good governance”.In an email to bureaucrats, Sedwill said “candour, confidentiality and courtesy” between ministers, civil servants and special advisers were “crucial to the trust and confidence on which good government depends.”FDA, the union for senior public servants, said Rutnam’s resignation was a consequence of people making anonymous claims about civil servants “who are unable to publicly defend themselves”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-priti-patel-s-top-official-quits-in-bullying-row/story-zr16hscRqegSM7gVzQJlCK.html

The banner, which read “Pakistani Army Epicenter of International Terrorism”, was seen near the iconic Broken Chair during the 43rd session of UNHRC. News agency ANI reported that a protest is also scheduled to be held by Baloch and Pashtun activists in front of the United Nations office against the involvement of the Pakistani military establishment in breeding terror outfits.The activists are demanding that the UN should reprimand Pakistan, take immediate action to stop this and establish the rule of law in the region, it reported.This comes after India on Friday advised Pakistan’s top leadership to stop terror funding and dismantle terrorist camps operating from its soil and territories under its control while decrying Islamabad’s efforts to derail the positive developments in Jammu and Kashmir.India’s statement came a week after the global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in Paris decided to retain Pakistan in its ‘Grey List’ and warned the country of stern action if it fails to prosecute and penalise those involved in terror funding emanating from its jurisdiction.India also highlighted the plight of minorities in Muslim-majority Pakistan, asking the Pakistani leadership to end harassment and execution of minorities through misuse of the blasphemy law, end forced conversions and marriages of women and girls from Hindu, Sikh and Christian religions and stop religious persecution against Shias, Ahmadiyas, Ismailia and Hazaras.The 43’s session of UNHRC started in Geneva on February 24 and will continue till March 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epicenter-of-international-terrorism-pakistani-minorities-put-up-poster-against-army-in-geneva/story-NUFFXxTR9Ttpy5kk6kX2FK.html

Health authorities have run tests on more than 210,000 members and 65,000 trainees of the church linked to a majority of cases after a 61-year-old woman known as “Patient 31” attended religious services there before testing positive. More than 88% have been checked, and about 3,300 have shown symptoms such as fever, Kim added. Some provincial officials want to press criminal charges against the church, saying it refused to release a complete list of members, although the church denied the accusation, and urged an end to “slander and oppression” of its followers. Kim said the government was working with the municipal authorities to check if the church provided an incomplete list. A court rejected a plan by conservative groups critical of President Moon Jae-in for a massive weekend rally in downtown Seoul, citing health concerns. The rapid spread of the coronavirus has fuelled fears of a pandemic, with six countries reporting their first cases this week as the World Health Organization raised its global risk alert to “very high”. In China, it has killed more than 2,800 people and infected about 79,000 after it emerged late last year in the central city of Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-tells-citizens-to-stay-home-at-critical-moment-in-coronavirus-battle/story-12iqSQrIPoCq1mPtaAfpKJ.html
29-02-2020||World||No impact, says Corona beer after ‘38% of American’ trends, suggesting sales hit||Confusion between coronavirus and Corona beer has been a punchline of questionable taste during the outbreak, but for the brand, the matter may be no joke.The phrase “38% of Americans” was trending Friday on Twitter following a survey showing that proportion of beer drinkers “would not buy Corona under any circumstances now,” according to public relations firm 5W.But Constellation Brands, which owns the Mexican-heritage beer label, disagreed, releasing a statement Friday saying that sales have stayed strong in the US even as the virus has spread internationally, and dismissing the question as a non-issue.“Our thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by this terrible virus and we hope efforts to more fully contain it gain traction soon,” said Bill Newlands, chief executive of Constellation.“We’ve seen no impact to our people, facilities or operations and our business continues to perform very well.”But the brand also got an earful on social media over an awkwardly-phrased advertising campaign to plug new hard seltzer offerings in the United States.The beverages, available in four “delicious” flavors, will be “coming ashore soon,” according to the spot posted to Twitter that had received 7.3 million views by Friday on the Corona USA page.“Given what’s hitting the news right now, this seems in remarkably poor taste,” one critic posted.“Pretty sure Corona has always had remarkably poor taste,” another replied.5W, the public relations firm that released the survey of 737 US beer drinkers, also found that 16 percent were confused about whether Corona beer is related to the virus.“While the brand has claimed that consumers understand there’s no linkage between the virus and the beer company, this is a disaster for the Corona brand,” Ronn Torossian, founder and CEO of 5W.5W lists several other beverage companies as clients on its website, including 1800 Tequila and Sparkling ICE. In an email, Torossian denied that the company works for any Corona competitors.The survey results were supported by a report from market analysis firm YouGov that pointed to an uptick in internet searches for phrases like “Corona beer virus” that was weighing on brand reputation.Brand favorability for Corona dropped from 75 percent in early January to 51 percent in late February, according to daily consumer surveys taken by YouGov.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-impact-says-corona-beer-after-38-of-american-trends-suggesting-sales-hit/story-pGvNNJPEcZZYodhFuAQs5I.html

Businesses have slowly started to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-47-more-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-day/story-XlHXXqxTmXa0pdu63QEUUK.html
29-02-2020||World||California confirms second US coronavirus case of unknown origin||California health officials on Friday confirmed a second suspected US case of the new coronavirus transmitted to a person who did not travel overseas or come in contact with anyone known to be ill, prompting fears of a possible outbreak in the country.“This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission but the extent is still not clear,” said Sara Cody, director of public health for Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley where tech giants like Apple and Google are based.“What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” she added.The patient in the second case of community spread of COVID-19, as the virus is called, is an adult woman with chronic health issues. She is being treated at a local hospital.Cody said the woman’s doctor had reached out to health officials on Wednesday evening, concerned she may have contracted the virus.Authorities have identified dozens of people the woman had come in contact with and they were quarantined in their homes.“An important priority... for us is to conduct public health surveillance to determine the extent of what’s happening,” Cody said. “We need to begin implementing additional measures to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus or at least slow it down as much as possible.”The first case of community spread coronavirus was announced Thursday and also involves a woman in northern California who was diagnosed belatedly because, despite showing symptoms, she had not traveled to outbreak-hit regions.The latest case announced on Friday is sure to heighten fears that the disease is spreading in the United States.Cody said people should brace for an escalation in the number of cases.“Schools should plan for absenteeism and explore options for learning at home and enhance cleaning of surfaces,” she said. “Businesses, wherever possible, can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase home working options as well as modify absentee policy.“I do understand that this whole situation may feel overwhelming and it’s difficult to think about the possible disruption to our everyday lives, especially when we’re still uncertain about what this may look like,” she added.According to the Centers for Disease Control, as of Thursday there were 62 people infected with the disease in the United States.California’s Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday said 33 people there had tested positive for the virus, and five of them had left the state.Worldwide more than 84,000 people have been infected with the disease and 2,870 have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-confirms-second-us-coronavirus-case-of-unknown-origin/story-XjqJrmcZL82Teq7igxOo3L.html
29-02-2020||World||China’s factory activity posts record contraction as coronavirus bites||China’s manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level on record in February as official data on Saturday confirmed the massive damage the deadly coronavirus epidemic has caused to the world’s second-largest economy.The announcement comes as the epidemic has rapidly spread to a growing number of countries, pushing stock markets to their lowest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis over fears that the coronavirus could wreak havoc on the world economy.Analysts have warned that China’s economic growth will likely take a major hit in the first quarter, and Saturday’s data was the first glimpse at the damage the virus has caused to industries across the country.The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), a key gauge of activity in China’s factories, was at 35.7 points in February, well below the 50-point mark that separates growth and contraction every month.This was down from 50 points in January and the worst level since China began recording the figure in 2005.It was also well below expectations of a smaller contraction, at 45.0, according to a Bloomberg poll of analysts.It was the first official economic indicator published for the month of February, showing the devastating impact of the epidemic on China’s economy -- with fallout likely to be seen around the world.Impact ‘weakening’ The National Bureau of Statistics said the auto and specialised equipment industries were hit hard, but the effect was “more severe” in the non-manufacturing area.“There was a plunge in demand for consumer industries involving gatherings of people, such as transportation, accommodation, catering, tourism, and resident services,” the NBS said in a statement.Non-manufacturing activity was at an abysmal 29.6 points in February, down from 54.1 points in January.Authorities have taken drastic steps to contain the virus, curbing the movement of people, temporarily closing factories across the country and quarantining central Hubei province, a key industrial region where the epidemic first appeared.The government has encouraged companies to progressively return to work as the number of new cases has been dropping in the past 10 days.“Although the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic has caused a larger impact on production and operations of Chinese enterprises... currently the epidemic has come under initial containment, and the negative impact on production is gradually weakening,” the NBS said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-factory-activity-posts-record-contraction-as-coronavirus-bites/story-XdV6yf2mPphO0lGTqlSgCO.html

Leap Day, which comes every four years on February 29, is a day observed in various solar calenders including Gregorian calendar.However, even in the Greforian calender, years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. The Earth’s orbital revolution around Sun takes 6 hours longer than 365 days, and Leap Day compensates this lag and realignes the calendar with the Earth’s position in the Solar System.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-marks-leap-day-with-a-doodle/story-NUbkLWbpwg21Ed3DfLUlBP.html
29-02-2020||World||Donald Trump nominates controversial ally John Ratcliffe as intelligence chief||US President Donald Trump announced Republican lawmaker John Ratcliffe as his intelligence chief Friday, sparking fresh controversy over a crucial position that has lacked a permanent office holder for months.The 53-year-old Trump loyalist was nominated as director of national intelligence after Dan Coats stepped down in July last year, but withdrew from consideration after strong criticism of his credentials from Democrats and a tepid response from key Republicans.Trump instead named counterterrorism expert Joseph McGuire as acting director, overseeing the 17 agencies of the intelligence community including the CIA and National Security Agency.But he forced McGuire out on February 20 after a senior intelligence official told Congress in a closed briefing that the Russians were again supporting Trump’s bid for re-election.The revolving door continued to spin as Trump appointed another loyalist, Richard Grenell, two weeks ago. But the former ambassador to Germany had no relevant experience and was viewed as highly political.Some intelligence experts view the latest nomination as a tactic by Trump to ensure that Grenell stays on beyond the statutory limit for “acting” directors who haven’t been approved by the Senate.“The formal submission of his nomination will allow @RichardGrenell to continue to serve as Acting DNI past March 11 - and for another 210 days after Ratcliffe’s rejection or withdrawal,” said University of Texas security law professor Steve Vladeck.Ratcliffe has been an outspoken Trump defender, frequently appearing on Fox News to spread conspiracy theories and deny the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia tried to boost the president’s election effort in 2016.Trump said Friday he had held back Ratcliffe’s formal nomination while an unspecified “inspector general report” was being prepared.“John is an outstanding man of great talent!” he tweeted.Trump has been determined to place someone politically close to him as chief of the intelligence community, which he views as hostile and full of leakers.He saw Coats, who was DNI for three years, as a political antagonist who protected the so-called “deep state” that Trump regards as a barrier to his agenda.He was especially upset when a CIA analyst filed a whistleblower complaint in August on his Ukraine dealings that led to his being impeached for abuse of power.The Ratcliffe nomination could spark a battle in Congress, amid reports that Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which must approve the nomination, expressed strong doubts about him in August.Republican Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the intelligence committee, made no comment Friday on his view of Ratcliffe’s qualifications.“I look forward to receiving Congressman Ratcliffe’s official nomination and ushering it through the Senate’s regular order,” he said in a statement.The top Democrat on the committee, Senator John Warner, suggested Friday that Ratcliffe would face high hurdles.“The last time this nomination was unsuccessfully put forward, serious bipartisan questions were raised about Rep. Ratcliffe’s background and qualifications,” he said.“It’s hard for me to see how anything new has happened to change that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-nominates-controversial-ally-john-ratcliffe-as-intelligence-chief/story-teNT29BsuKNuWlXdAI1o6L.html
29-02-2020||World||Luxembourg becomes first country to provide free public transport||Luxembourg will become the first country in the world on Saturday to offer a free public transport system as the government tries to reduce particularly dense car traffic.Some cities have already taken similar partial measures but the transport ministry said it was the first time such a decision would cover an entire country.The free transport, which is being flagged as “an important social measure”, will affect approximately 40 percent of households and is likely to save each one around 100 euros ($110) per year.The measure is part of a plan intended to reduce congestion.Private cars are the most used means of transport in the Grand Duchy. According to a 2018 survey by TNS Ilres, cars accounted for 47 percent of business travel and 71 percent of leisure transport.The bus is only used for 32 percent of trips to work ahead of the train which accounts for just 19 percent.In Paris, by way of contrast, 68.6 percent of workers use public transport, according to Insee, the French statistics institute.The capital city of Luxembourg, where a tram has been under construction for some years, is notoriously bad for traffic jams.The first section of the tram has been operational since the end of 2017 but work will continue for a few more years to link the southern outskirts of the capital to the north where the airport is located.“Systematic and continuous investment is a sine qua non (essential) condition for promoting the attractiveness of public transport,” said transport minister Francois Bausch.Sales from the existing 2 euro tickets amount to 41 million euros a year which, according to the authorities, represented just eight percent of the annual budget of 500 million euros. This will now be met by the treasury. The exception to the free-for-all rule will be first-class travel on trains and certain night bus services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/luxembourg-becomes-first-country-to-provide-free-public-transport/story-NergLP77tBy51HEdmI2H3N.html

Authorities said that efforts were underway to trace the infection path of the virus, as well as anyone exposed to it from the Icelandic patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iceland-confirms-first-case-of-new-coronavirus/story-xQK10pyzptOSeK94XqCLwJ.html
29-02-2020||World||Court temporarily halts Trump’s ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy||Dealing a significant blow to a signature Trump administration immigration policy, a federal appeals court ruled Friday that the government can no longer make asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases wind through the US immigration courts.The same court, based in San Francisco, decided to keep another major change on hold, one that denies asylum to anyone who enters the US illegally from Mexico.The twin setbacks for the Trump administration may prove temporary if it appeals to the US Supreme Court, which has consistently sided with the president on immigration and border security policies.The “Remain in Mexico” policy, known officially as “Migrant Protection Protocols,” took effect in January 2019 in San Diego and gradually spread across the border. Nearly 60,000 people have been sent back to wait for hearings, and officials believe it is a big reason why illegal border crossings plummeted about 80% from a 13-year high in May.Reaction to the decision was swift among immigration lawyers and advocates who have spent months fighting with the administration over a program they see as a humanitarian disaster, subjecting hundreds of migrants to violence, kidnapping and extortion in dangerous Mexican border cities. Hundreds more have been living in squalid encampments just across the border, as they wait for their next court date.Advocates planned to have immigrants immediately cross the border and present the court decision to border authorities on Friday. Lawyers were hoping to get their clients before US immigration court judges.The Justice Department sharply criticized the ruling, saying the 9th US Circuit Court’s decision “not only ignores the Constitutional authority of Congress and the Administration for a policy in effect for over a year, but also extends relief beyond the parties before the Court.”In the decision, the judges acknowledged the controversy that has engulfed federal courtrooms over the issue of nationwide injunctions in recent weeks. The Trump administration has been widely critical of nationwide injunctions, saying a few “liberal” areas should not be making policy for the entire country.Judge William Fletcher, writing the majority opinion, sided with the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups who argued the policy violates international treaty obligations against sending people back to a country where they are likely to be persecuted or tortured on the grounds of race, religion, ethnicity, political beliefs or membership in a particular social group. The question before the judges was whether to let the policies take effect during legal challenges.Fletcher agreed the government set the bar too high for asylum seekers to persuade officers that they should be exempt from the policy and didn’t provide enough time for them to prepare for interviews or consult lawyers. The judges said the government also erred by requiring asylum seekers to express fear of returning to Mexico to be considered for an exemption, instead of asking them unprompted.Fletcher quoted at length asylum seekers who reported being assaulted and victimized in Mexico, saying it was “enough — indeed, far more than enough” to undercut the government’s arguments.Fletcher was joined by Judge Richard Paez, both appointees of President Bill Clinton. Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, dissented.“The court forcefully rejected the Trump administration’s assertion that it could strand asylum seekers in Mexico and subject them to grave danger,” said ACLU attorney Judy Rabinovitz. “It’s time for the administration to follow the law and stop putting asylum seekers in harm’s way.”The ruling’s impact will be at least partially blunted by the expansion of other policies that were introduced in response to unprecedented surge of asylum seeking families that peaked last year, many of them from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.In November, the administration began sending asylum-seekers from Honduras and El Salvador to Guatemala, denying them a chance in the United States and instead inviting them to apply in the strife-torn Central American nation. Similar agreements with Honduras and El Salvador are set to take effect soon.Under another new policy, Mexicans and Central Americans who fail an initial screening are rapidly deported without leaving Border Patrol stations, which gained notoriety last year for Homeland Security internal watchdog reports of squalid conditions in some Texas locations. The screening interview is designed to take place in one day and any appeals to an immigration judge within 10 days. Asylum-seekers are given up to 90 minutes to contact a lawyer.Those policies for rapid deportations were introduced in October in El Paso, Texas, and extended across the border by this month.The other measure with far-reaching consequences denies asylum to anyone who passes through another country on the way to the US border with Mexico without seeking protection there first. That policy took effect in September and is being challenged in a separate lawsuit.Supporters of the “Remain in Mexico” policy note it has prevented asylum seekers from being released in the United States with notices to appear in court, which they consider a major incentive for people to come.The policy was introduced at the border crossing in San Diego and initially focused on Central Americans. By November, it had reached all major crossing corridors, the last one being Arizona.Asylum-seekers from more than 40 nations had been sent back, with Hondurans accounting for more than one of three, according to Syracuse University’s Transaction Records Access Clearinghouse. Guatemalans were second, followed by Cubans and Salvadorans.Mexicans are exempt under the policy, as are unaccompanied children.Asylum has been granted in less than 1% of the roughly 35,000 cases that have been decided. Only 5% are represented by attorneys, many of whom are reluctant to visit clients in Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-temporarily-halts-trump-s-remain-in-mexico-policy/story-VGQRB5CGR4N3eU8CxdZiVO.html
29-02-2020||World||Trump urges Afghans to ‘seize opportunity for peace’||President Donald Trump urged the Afghan people to embrace a chance for a new future Friday, one day before the signing of a historic peace deal between the United States and the Taliban in Doha.With a one-week ceasefire set as a condition for the pact holding firm, Trump said that there is now a possibility of ending the nearly two-decade war in Afghanistan.He announced he was sending Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to witness the signing of the treaty, and that Defense Secretary Mark Esper would separately issue a joint declaration with the Kabul government.The commitments to be made in the Taliban agreement and the joint declaration are an “important step to a lasting peace” that could free Afghans from the threat of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State group, Trump said in a statement.“If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home,” he said.Nevertheless, he added, “Ultimately it will be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future.”“We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country.”- US to reduce troops -The accord to be inked Saturday would see thousands of American troops quit Afghanistan after more than 18 years, in return for various security commitments from the Taliban and a pledge to hold talks with the government in Kabul.In Jalalabad, people danced and released balloons and pigeons Friday to celebrate the sharp fall in violence.Earlier in the week General Austin Scott Miller, commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, and Afghanistan’s acting Defense Minister Asadullah Khalid strolled the streets of Kabul and took selfies with citizens in a demonstration of their confidence in the ceasefire.More than 100,000 Afghans, Americans and others have died in the conflict, which began after Al-Qaeda, operating with the protection of the then-Taliban government, plotted the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington from Afghanistan.The conflict has cost the US government more than $1 trillion in military and rebuilding costs since the US-led invasion of 2001.The Doha accord comes after more than a year of talks between the Taliban and the US that faltered repeatedly as violence raged.A week-long truce set as a condition for the peace pact held for a seventh day Friday in Afghanistan, with only minor attacks reported.While the deal’s contents have not been publicly disclosed, it is expected to see the Pentagon begin pulling troops from Afghanistan, where between 12,000-13,000 are currently based.The US has said an initial drawdown over the coming months would be to about 8,600 -- similar to the troop level President Donald Trump inherited after his 2016 election win.“When I ran for office, I promised the American people I would begin to bring our troops home, and seek to end this war,” the US leader said Friday.“We are making substantial progress on that promise.”- Iran -Further reductions depend on how well the Taliban honor pledges to start talks with the government of President Ashraf Ghani -- who until now they have dismissed as a US-backed puppet -- and seek a comprehensive “intra-Afghan” ceasefire and peace deal.Afghan officials will be conspicuously absent from Saturday’s signing ceremony in Doha, but a government delegation will be there to make “initial contacts” with the insurgents.Earlier Friday Pompeo warned in a hearing in Congress that Iran, historically an opponent of the Taliban, could seek to undermine the agreement, though he offered no evidence of any such activities.“We’ve seen just these last six days a significant reduction in violence in Afghanistan and we are watching closely to see if the Islamic Republic of Iran begins to take even more active measures that undermine our efforts at peace and reconciliation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-urges-afghans-to-seize-opportunity-for-peace/story-Na2kxW5l7BRSYRbThKTteL.html

So strong was the impact of the train hitting the bus that it was split into three parts,” he said.The bus was dragged around 150-200 feet by the train, Ahmed said.Rescue officials said among the victims, some died on the spot while others breathed their last while being shifted to hospitals.Commissioner Shafique Ahmed said the injured, including women and children, were taken to different hospitals in Rohri and Sukkur.“It is a huge tragedy and all administration and police officials are rushing to the site. It was an unmanned railway crossing and unfortunately, the driver of the bus took a risk by trying to cross it when the train was coming in full speed,” he said.Sukkur District Health Officer Dr Munir Mangrio confirmed that 13 bodies were sent to the Rohri hospital, while the remaining bodies were sent to the Sukkur hospital. The deceased included five women and nine men.According to a Pakistan Railways spokesperson, the bus driver was apparently at fault in the incident.He said the train’s engine was damaged in the collision, while the assistant driver sustained injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bus-train-collision-kills-30-in-pakistan-report/story-dQBoiuGBU3ifoSW6d7lPZO.html
29-02-2020||World||WHO raises global virus risk to maximum level||The World Health Organization on Friday raised its global risk assessment of the new coronavirus to its highest level after the epidemic spread to sub-Saharan Africa and caused financial markets to plunge.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the risk was being raised to “very high” because of the continued increase in cases and the number of new countries affected in recent days.These developments “are clearly of concern”, Tedros told reporters in Geneva.But he added: “We still have a chance of containing this virus, if robust action is taken to detect cases early, isolate and care for patients and trace contacts.”The virus has proliferated around the globe over the past week, emerging on every continent except Antarctica, prompting many governments and businesses to try to stop people travelling or gathering in crowded places.Switzerland became the latest country to announce drastic measures on Friday, saying all events with more than 1,000 participants would be suspended until March 15.The ban forced the cancellation of the Geneva International Motor Show -- a major item on the global auto industry calendar -- that was due to start next week.Carnival celebrations, rock concerts and a major watchmaking trade show also had to be scrapped.‘Struggling with containment’The virus has killed more than 2,800 people and infected over 83,000 worldwide -- the vast majority in China -- since it emerged apparently from an animal market in a central Chinese city in late December.The number of deaths and new infections has been tapering off in China, following unprecedented quarantine efforts locking down tens of millions of people in the worst-hit cities. But infections elsewhere have started to surge, with Iran, Italy and South Korea becoming the major new hotspots and cases being confirmed in around 50 countries.“We see a number of countries struggling with containment,” said Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme.The WHO has voiced particular concern about Africa’s preparedness, warning that the continent’s health care systems were ill-equipped to respond to a COVID-19 epidemic.Cases had previously been reported in Egypt and Algeria, but not in the sub-Saharan region until Friday when Nigeria reported its first case: an Italian man in densely populated Lagos.Markets tankStock markets around the world have plummeted this week as it has become increasingly clear the virus will take a huge toll on the global economy.“Stock markets are well on their way to their worst week since the global financial crisis,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda trading group.Several companies have said they expect the virus to hit their earnings because of weaker demand.Oil prices also dived four percent to their lowest levels for more than a year, with Brent oil for April delivery sinking as low as $50.05 a barrel.Analysts have warned that China, the world’s second largest economy, will see a major cut in growth this quarter as the country remains largely paralysed by quarantines and containment measures.- China hope -Still, signs in China offered hope that the outbreak could be contained.China reported 44 more deaths on Friday, raising its toll to 2,788, with 327 new cases -- the lowest daily figure for new infections in more than a month.The main concern for health officials is outside of China, with governments this week forced into increasingly drastic measures in an attempt to battle spiralling epidemics.The biggest death toll outside China is in Iran, where 34 people have died.As elsewhere, the virus has mostly killed the elderly or people who had other health conditions.South Korea also now has the most cases outside China, with more than 2,000 infections and 13 deaths.The virus has had wide-ranging impact, even forcing K-pop megastars BTS to cancel four Seoul concerts due in April.Cruise ship victimIn Japan, the health ministry said a British man who was on board a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo had died, bringing the death toll to six.The unidentified man’s death is the latest linked to infections on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where more than 700 other people tested positive for the illness.The death comes as the governor of Japan’s rural northern island of Hokkaido urged people to stay at home this weekend in a desperate effort to contain the outbreak.In Europe, the largest epicentre is Italy with 650 cases and 17 deaths -- mostly in cities in the north.Wide-ranging measures to halt the spread of the virus have affected tens of millions of people in northern Italy, with schools closed and cultural and sporting events cancelled.Experts said the virus had probably “circulated unnoticed for several weeks” before the first confirmed cases -- possibly since January.Belarus, Denmark, Iceland, Lithuania, Mexico and New Zealand were the latest countries to report new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-outbreak-is-getting-bigger-who-spokesperson-on-novel-coronavirus/story-V6StgLcrNSZpRjzeWWBRRO.html

Basically nothing is being done ... despite all the beautiful words.”Supporters held placards reading: “Change the politics not the climate”, “The ocean is rising so are we!” and “At this point education is pointless.”Thunberg rose to prominence when she starting missing lessons two years ago to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. Since then, she has become the world’s most prominent climate activist.She has repeatedly upbraided world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump for ignoring the perils of climate change, though Trump has dismissed what he calls the climate “prophets of doom”.“Our house is still on fire,” Thunberg told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. “Your inaction is fuelling the flames.”Thunberg has been in Britain since last weekend. On Tuesday she visited the University of Oxford, where she met Malala Yousafzai, the 22-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and campaigner for girls’ education, who is studying there.Thunberg called Yousafzai her role model, while Yousafzai said on Twitter: “She’s the only friend I’d skip school for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-world-is-on-fire-says-teenage-activist-greta-thunberg-at-uk-climate-change-rally/story-M0A7LtCSJns9EoCbK6qr2N.html
29-02-2020||World||US patient with novel coronavirus of unknown origin untested for 5 days, whistleblower reports||Medical staff caring for a California woman with the first US case of novel coronavirus of unknown origin were unable to get her tested for five days because she had not traveled to outbreak-hit regions, a lawmaker revealed Thursday.The development comes amid reports citing a whistleblower complaint that federal health workers interacted with quarantined patients in two California air bases without proper gear or training, before dispersing around the country. One of these sites, Travis Air Force Base, is in Solano County where the ill woman is also from.In a congressional hearing, Representative Ami Bera said the patient was admitted to the University of California Davis Medical Center on February 19 and quickly placed on a ventilator. The same day, her doctors asked to submit a sample for a coronavirus test to federal authorities.But it was not until February 23, after her condition had worsened, that there was “an insistence and a strong push and ultimately the patient did get tested,” added Bera, a doctor who once worked at the same hospital.He said he learned of the case details from former colleagues.It took another three days for the positive result to return, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday declared it the first suspected case of community transmission.This means the source of infection is unknown, a sign that the pathogen is no longer contained. If confirmed, the development represents a new and more complicated challenge in the battle against the virus in the US.Bera, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation, questioned CDC director Robert Redfield, who said the agency’s testing guidelines were updated Thursday as a result of the case.- Difficult to recognize -“The recommendation should be when a clinician or public health individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus, so that’s the current guidance that went out today,” said Redfield.He testified that what made the coronavirus particularly difficult to recognize is that infected people can show no symptoms but still spread it. Or, they may have only mild symptoms like a scratchy throat or dry cough. Brian Garibaldi, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland, said he expected the number of cases being tested in the US to surge as a result of the new guidelines.- Whistleblower complaint -A whistleblower complaint cited by US media including The Washington Post and The New York Times said federal health employees were sent to interact with repatriated Americans at the two bases without protective gear or training.The complaint was submitted by a senior official in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) who said she was improperly re-assigned after raising her concerns and threatened with being fired if she did not comply.In total, there were just under 30 workers who were exposed in this way in late January and early February, the complaint said.Speaking at an earlier news conference in California, Governor Gavin Newsom said California was monitoring 8,400 people for possible infection.But he sought to reassure the public that the risk of contracting the virus remains low.Newsom told reporters his team was working with the CDC on making improved testing methods the top priority.“We are not overreacting but nor are we underreacting to the understandable anxiety,” he said.He added the state had only 200 testing kits and had appealed for more from the federal government. Redfield later told Congress more tests were on their way.Overall there are 61 cases in the US -- including 46 people who were repatriated from abroad.US President Donald Trump has downplayed the potential spread of the novel coronavirus in the country, a message seemingly at odds with senior public health officials who have urged Americans to prepare to cancel mass gatherings and work from home. In a series of tweets late Thursday he blamed the media for refusing “to discuss the great job our professionals are doing!”He said there are only “a very small number” of US cases “& China numbers look to be going down. “All countries working together!” Trump added.More than 80,000 people have been infected worldwide and 2,800 have died, mostly in China, where the virus originated late last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-patient-with-novel-coronavirus-of-unknown-origin-untested-for-5-days-whistleblower-reports/story-K5JEAy9HZzlx71Q0oclaRP.html
