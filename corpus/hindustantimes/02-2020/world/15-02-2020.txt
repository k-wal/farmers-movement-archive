No one was killed.But neither side wanted a war and quickly de-escalated.The Trump administration’s justification for the killing came under close scrutiny since the claim of “imminent” threat to American forces and assets--including four embassies-- was not backed with evidence. And officials had subsequently begun reeling back that narrative.“This official report directly contradicts the President’s false assertion that he attacked Iran to prevent an imminent attack against the United States personnel and embassies,” Eliot Engel, chairman of the Democratic-led House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a statement.“The administration’s explanation in this report makes no mention of any imminent threat and shows that the justification the President offered to the American people was false, plain and simple,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-government-accused-of-citing-false-imminent-threat-for-killing-iranian-general/story-rpojEUp9fSdM35LhrAFXSI.html
15-02-2020||World||Donald Trump claims he leads on social media, ahead of PM Modi, but numbers don’t add up||Numbers matter to President Donald Trump: the size of the crowd at his rallies, opponent’s height and weight, the size of the bank balance; and, of course, social media reach.On Friday, just days before his upcoming visit to India, President Trump claimed he was No 1 on Facebook and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was No 2, and for citation, he used a purportedly direct quote from Mark Zuckerberg. Hindustan Times could not find the quote on the internet, and it may have been an observation made privately. But the numbers of “likes” and “followers” on their respective Facebook pages — created, coincidentally just a month apart in 2009 and much before they were elected to their present positions — tell a vastly different story. Modi is way ahead.Here is the president’s tweet: “Great honor, I think? Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that “Donald J. Trump is Number 1 on Facebook. Number 2 is Prime Minister Modi of India.” Actually, I am going to India in two weeks. Looking forward to it!”President Trump is indeed looking forward to the trip and has seemed most excited about a rally he is to address in Ahmedabad, where he expects to see “millions” of people, vastly more than, he has himself acknowledged playfully, than the 50,000s he has been notching up here at a time. As stated before, numbers matter to him.The President and First Lady Melania Trump begin their two-day visit on February 24.The numbers don’t bear out the President’s claims, unless he, or supposedly Zuckerberg, are looking at a different set of numbers.Modi’s Facebook page, created in May 2009, has 44,380,858 followers and says 44,624,128 people liked the page.Trump’s page, created in April 2009, lists 27,543,545 followers, and 25,969,909 likes. Another page, in the name of President Donald J Trump, created just days before his inauguration in January 2017, has 5,388,767 follows and 3,100,731 likes.President Trump fares much better on Twitter though. With 72.5 million followers, he easily beats Prime Minister Modi, who crossed 50 million last September and is now at 53 million.Their social media reach has been closely followed and commented upon. A senior White House official had spoken of it in a briefing to preview Prime Minister Modi’s June 2017 visit to the White House for his first meeting with President Trump. “They are the world’s two most followed political leaders on social media,” the official had said. Even back then, Modi was ahead of Trump on Facebook and trailed him on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-claims-he-leads-on-social-media-ahead-of-pm-modi-but-numbers-don-t-add-up/story-tLyNtu8e6RH8uEDgzBnx7H.html

So far, 285 people from the ship have tested positive for a new virus, after 67 new cases were found Saturday.The aircraft will arrive in Japan late Sunday, and people will be flown to Travis Air Force Base in California, with some passengers continuing to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said in a letter to passengers and crew that was posted online Saturday.After arriving in the U.S., all will need to go through another two weeks of quarantine, the letter said.Everyone will get a checkup before being allowed on the chartered flight, and those who show symptoms of sickness will not be permitted to board the plane, the embassy said.“We recognize this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can and seeing you safely and expeditiously reunited with family and friends in the United States,” it said.The U.S. State Department urged American passengers to return home.“To fulfill our government’s responsibilities to U.S. citizens under our rules and practices, as well as to reduce the burden on the Japanese healthcare system, the U.S. government recommends, out of an abundance of caution, that U.S. citizens disembark and return to the United States for further monitoring,” the State Department said in a statement.One of the American passengers, Matthew Smith, who has been tweeting aboard the ship, including photos of the food passengers have been given, expressed disappointment at what he called “a monkey wrench” the American government was throwing into the quarantine that he and others had tried to maintain on the ship.Smith said he’ll have to start the 14-day quarantine period all over again even though he was due to get off the ship next week.“OK, so here’s the thing: As long as the official plan by Japanese health officials is to release those of us who are still healthy from quarantine in just under four days, why would I want to interfere with that by taking up an offer from U.S. officials to fly us back to Travis?” he said on Twitter.The letter to Americans on the Diamond Princess warns, “Should you choose not to return on this charter flight, you will be unable to return to the United States for a period of time.”Japan’s Health Ministry allowed 11 passengers to disembark Friday, saying that those over 80 years old or with underlying medical conditions, as well as those staying in windowless cabins during the 14-day quarantine, can stay at a designated facility on shore.That quarantine was set to be over as soon as Wednesday, meaning people might be able to leave the boat as long as they were healthy.Separately, the Japanese government said Saturday that a chartered flight to bring Japanese out of Wuhan — the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak of the virus — will leave Sunday and return Monday. That would be the fifth such plane for Japan.Besides the cases on the cruise ship, Japan has reported 55 other cases. Three new cases were reported Saturday in Wakayama prefecture in central Japan, and eight others were reported in Tokyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/380-americans-aboard-quarantined-ship-to-fly-home-us-embassy/story-ljYplYdoGJOzYJwlUAaz5K.html
15-02-2020||World||Xi says China must keep economic, social order while battling coronavirus||China must make every effort to maintain economic and social control as it battles the coronavirus epidemic, and avoid causing panic that could lead to secondary “disasters,” President Xi Jinping told senior officials earlier this month.Reuters reported this week that Xi had warned officials on Feb. 3 that efforts to contain the new coronavirus had gone too far, threatening the economy. Those comments came days before Beijing rolled out measures to soften the blow.The epidemic has become a major test for Xi in how to balance stamping out the epidemic with protecting an economy already growing at its slowest in nearly three decades.His Feb. 3 speech to the Politburo’s Standing Committee was published in full by the leading Communist Party theoretical journal Qiushi on Saturday. It showed how Xi had urged officials to roll out policies to support the economy even as they worked to control the spread of the coronavirus.In the speech, he said that the epidemic, which has killed more than 1,500 people and infected over 66,000 so far, was impacting the economy, especially service industries. Actions needed to be taken to maintain China’s industrial chain and encourage enterprises to resume production, he said.China “still has to adhere to this year’s economic and social development goals”, Xi said in the speech.He also said it was necessary to increase financial support, such as preferential policies for loan interest rates and terms, and get migrant workers in major industries back to work.Big projects, especially those in manufacturing, should start construction on time, he said, adding that boosting consumption was an important hedge against the epidemic’s impact. Work should be done to promote the wider adoption of 5G technology, as well as the purchase of products associated with healthy living and cars, Xi added.The epidemic had revealed “shortcomings and deficiencies” in national governance, he said, such as how the wildlife animal industry had remained huge despite clear risks in their consumption, and how the country’s reserves of health and anti-epidemic materials were seriously inadequate.A tendency to insist on formalities and bureaucracy have also emerged, creating problems in fighting the epidemic, he said, adding that party members who did not adequately engage in the work must be held accountable and removed from their posts.He also said he gave instructions on preventing and containing the coronavirus on Jan. 7, when he chaired another Politburo Standing Committee meeting. China first confirmed that the virus had passed from person-to-person and infected some medical staff on Jan. 20.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make a final determination on this matter,” it added. The cruise liner’s quarantine is set to end on Feb. 19.The cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, has been quarantined since arriving in Yokohama on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it travelled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus.At the time, it had some 3,500 passengers and crew on board, of whom 218 have tested positive for the coronavirus infection and are now in Japanese hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-evacuate-its-citizens-aboard-quarantined-cruise-ship-off-japan-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/story-sBCrpAcWKOm7dtoKEZFBxO.html

Referring to the Kashmir issue during a panel discussion, Senator Lindsey Graham said the best way to sell democracy will be to settle the Kashmir issue in a democratic way. “In India, you are moving forward, you got your problems like we do at home, but you’ve chosen the democratic path. When it comes to Kashmir, I don’t know how it ends, but let’s make sure that two democracies will end it differently. If you can prove that concept here, then I think that’s probably the best way to sell democracy,” the Republican leader said. To this, Jaishankar promptly responded, “Do not worry, Senator. One democracy will settle it and you know which one.” During the discussion Jaishankar also said that the United Nations is far less credible than it has been in history and “something” should be done about it. “The United Nations is far less credible than it has been in history, which is not entirely surprising because when you think about it, there are not too many things which are 75 years old and still as good as they were. Clearly there is something that needs to be done there.” He also spoke about “westlessness” and multilateralism at the panel discussion. “Clearly multilateralism has become weaker, and clearly westlessness is in evidence and I would suggest that there is a correlation between the two, It is not to say that multilateralism is solely dependent on the West, or that the West has been faithfully multilateral,” he said. He highlighted that the global political rebalancing is underway and made a case for greater western flexibility. “Multilateralism can today be strengthened by more creative diplomacy and plurilateral understanding,” he said. The Munich Security Conference, being held here from February 14-16, is the world’s leading forum for debate on international security policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-worry-one-democracy-will-settle-it-jaishankar-to-us-senator-on-kashmir/story-IRL5yexjAN683k0pZgf0uJ.html
15-02-2020||World||Mike Pompeo rejects claims that US has quit global role||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday rejected European pessimism about Washington’s retreat from the global stage, saying the death of the transatlantic bond had been “grossly overexaggerated”.“The West is winning and we’re winning together,” Pompeo told the Munich Security Conference.But he was immediately contradicted by French President Emmanuel Macron, who warned of “a weakening of the West”.The annual gathering of world leaders, generals and diplomats to discuss security challenges has been dominated by fears of diminishing Western influence in the face of a more assertive China and Russia.In his opening speech a day earlier, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier suggested that the United States rejected “even the idea of an international community” and was acting “at the expense of neighbours and partners”.“Those statements don’t reflect reality,” Pompeo retorted.“I’m happy to report that the death of the transatlantic alliance is grossly over-exaggerated,” he said, paraphrasing a famous Mark Twain quote.He said Washington was playing a key role in keeping Europe safe by reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank on the border with Russia, as well as leading a multinational effort to defeat the Islamic State jihadist group.“Is this an America that ‘rejects the international community’?” he asked.“The free West has a brighter future than illiberal alternatives,” Pompeo added, urging allies to have “confidence” in the transatlantic bond.He stressed the need to work together against threats posed by Russia’s territorial ambitions, China’s military buildup in the South China Sea and Iran’s “campaigns of terror” through proxy conflicts in the Middle East.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, who also took to the stage in Munich, joined Pompeo in voicing dismay at the gathering’s pessimistic tone.“There is a competition out there in so many areas, with so many different actors, but simply lamenting that we have lost our way will not provide us with a way forward,” Stoltenberg told the audience.“Europe and North America are indispensable partners -- two sides to the same coin. together, we are half of the world’s military might and half of the world’s economic might.”- Russian energy reliance -In a nod to concerns about European reliance on Russian natural gas, Pompeo also announced that the US would finance energy projects in eastern EU countries.“The United States -- through our International Development Finance Corporation, and with the support of the US Congress -- intends to provide up to $1 billion in financing to the Central and Eastern European countries of the Three Seas Initiative,” Pompeo told the conference.“Our aim is to galvanise private sector investment in their energy sectors.”The Three Seas Initiative is a club of 12 eastern and central EU countries who have grown increasingly concerned about over the Russian giant in their backyard since Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.At a Three Seas meeting in 2017, President Trump offered to supply the grouping with US liquefied natural gas so they would never be “hostage” to a single Russian supplier.Washington’s offer comes amid fierce US opposition to Russia’s controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, set to double the country’s gas shipments to Germany.Washington believes the pipeline will give Russia too much influence over security and economic issues in western Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-rejects-claims-that-us-has-quit-global-role/story-8PXmKaXJIxme0y8UxtLpBO.html

Those who meet the age requirement and have pre-existing conditions or are staying in rooms without balcony will be prioritised for disembarkation.No Indian national falls under this category, eligible for early disembarkation, the statement said on Friday.The death toll in China’s novel coronavirus epidemic climbed to 1,523 with 143 new fatalities reported mostly from the worst-affected Hubei province, while the confirmed cases jumped to over 66,000, health officials said on Saturday.More than 580 cases have been confirmed outside mainland China and three deaths, one each in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.The coronavirus outbreak originated in central China’s Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries, including India.Many countries have banned arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights to the country. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for the use of digital technology such as big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to better support epidemic monitoring and analysis, virus tracing, prevention and treatment, and resource allocation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-condition-of-3-indians-on-board-cruise-ship-improves-officials/story-tF5oGBwsjwvIDzeQFgPi8L.html

Kiir increased that in 2015 to 28, and then later 32.But on Saturday, a presidential statement confirmed that Kiir had “resolved to return the country to 10 states and their previous counties”.Kiir’s had repeatedly refused to back down on the number of states but had come under intense international pressure to compromise.Kiir and Machar are old rivals who have fought and made up multiple times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/s-sudan-president-offers-key-compromise-for-peace/story-buukRVkSIN2QXnwspmtCON.html

The central bank also ramped up measures to sanitize old money to reduce contagion risks and added 600 billion yuan ($85.9 billion) of new cash for Hubei, the epicenter of the coronavirus, he said.“Money from key virus-hit areas will be sanitized with ultraviolet rays or heated and locked up for at least 14 days, before it is distributed again,” Fan said at a press conference on Saturday. Money circulated in less riskier areas is subject to a week of quarantine and commercial lenders have been asked to separate cash from hospitals and food markets, he said.The share of cash in broad money supply has dropped steadily in recent years in China, with the rise of mobile payments largely replacing bank notes in daily life.

Those who refuse to accept home or centralised observation and other prevention and control measures will be held accountable under law.”Anyone returning to Beijing will be required to submit travel plans to their community in advance, the notice added.Beijing, a sprawling city of 21 million, has so far reported nearly 400 cases of Covid-19 and four deaths.As of Thursday midnight, 77 clusters of infection cases of novel coronavirus were reported in Beijing, the state-controlled China Daily reported.Among them, 70 cases were infected by family members, said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Diseases Prevention and Control.“Multiple family clusters of infection cases occurred in Beijing recently, and it’s vital to put every citizen under quarantine at home for protection,” she said.Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday urged an improvement in the preventive mechanism in response to major public health crises and the country’s public health emergency and management system. Xi also stressed the importance to roll out a biosecurity law as soon as possible.Xi, according to state media, encouraged the use of big data, AI, cloud computing and other digital technologies to support epidemic monitoring, analysis and resource allocation.More than two dozen countries have confirmed cases and several have suspended trade and travel links with China in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. So far, three deaths have been recorded outside mainland China - one each in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.Egypt reported its first case of the coronavirus on Friday, becoming the first country in the African continent to confirm a case, and the second in the Middle East region, after the United Arab Emirates diagnosed its first cases late last month, the Al Jazeera reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deaths-surge-beyond-1500-compulsory-quarantine-or-punishment-in-beijing/story-MTntXl847U0ihaIgexpRGK.html
15-02-2020||World||US, Taliban reach violence reduction pact that could lead to troops withdrawal from Afghanistan||The United States has reached agreement with the Taliban on a weeklong reduction of violence that could lead to a US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, a senior administration official said on Friday, while cautioning that the insurgents must honour commitments for the accord to stick.The deal was struck in protracted negotiations in the Qatari capital Doha and was announced after a meeting between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.The accord - if it holds - could pave the way for an agreement by the end of the month on a US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, a long-sought objective for US President Donald Trump, who has vowed to stop the “endless wars” as he seeks re-election in November.“It was violence that derailed the signing of the agreement in September. Now we have an agreement on the reduction of violence. And, should the Talibs implement what they’ve committed to doing, we will move forward with the agreement,” the senior administration official told reporters in Munich.The seven-day period has not yet started, but will go into effect soon, the official said.There were no immediate comments from Ghani’s government or the Taliban.There remains a long way to go to a peace settlement and end to the nearly two-decade-old US military presence that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks by al Qaeda. US officials have been clear that the 13,000 US troops will be cut to about 8,600 this year, with or without a withdrawal deal.The reduction in violence agreement “is a good step on a very long road,” said Ronald Neumann, a former US ambassador to Afghanistan.Long path to peace dealA US withdrawal agreement would be followed by negotiations on a political settlement between the Taliban and an Afghan delegation that would include government officials. One of the first issues would be a nationwide ceasefire.The so-called intra-Afghan dialogue, however, is likely to be difficult and protracted. The Taliban have refused to speak directly to the government, which they denounce as a US puppet. Kabul’s negotiating team has yet to be named, and there has been long wrangling over its composition.It also remained to be seen if the Taliban leadership has full control over all its fighters.The senior US official made clear that a full US withdrawal will depend on the Taliban fulfilling commitments to end their close ties with al Qaeda and other extremist groups.“Our commitment, in terms of reduction of forces which is both conditions-based and in phases, is very much tied to delivery on the commitments that they have made, and will be,” said the official. “There will be no hosting, no training, no recruitment, no fund-raising.” The official, however, noted that provision covered only Taliban-controlled territory, meaning it does not apply to Taliban sanctuaries in neighboring Pakistan, which US officials accuse of supporting the insurgents. Islamabad denies the allegation. The official said the reduction in violence agreement was very specific and covered all Afghan forces. The US military would monitor violence levels to verify whether the Taliban were honoring it.US and Taliban negotiators have been meeting in Doha since 2018 even as fighting has raged and hundreds of civilians and combatants have been killed as the insurgents have expanded their territorial control.Last month the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a US government agency, assessed that there were a record-high number of attacks by the Taliban and other anti-government forces in the last three months of 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taliban-reach-violence-reduction-pact-that-could-lead-to-troops-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/story-tVpu1OtQR5OZNHqNKnXAzH.html
15-02-2020||World||Global banks, govts may need to unite to fight coronavirus economic fallout: IMF||The head of the International Monetary Fund said global central banks and governments may need to unite to fight the economic fallout from the coronavirus.“From our perspective, it is very important to follow carefully what is going to happen in the next weeks,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Friday on a panel at a security conference in Munich. “There needs to be bottom-up analysis of the impact so we can then agree on synchronized, or even better, coordinated measures to protect the world economy from a more serious shock.”“Are we going to do it? I actually think that we will, because when we are pushed we actually come together,” she said.HSBC Holdings Plc this week became the latest bank to cut its outlook for global growth, reducing it to 2.3% from 2.5%. Central bankers and governments from the Group of 20 are scheduled to meet next week in Saudi Arabia.While the People’s Bank of China has provided liquidity and counterparts in the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia have cut interest rates, most major central banks have signalled an alertness to the virus yet not signalled an intention to ease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-banks-governments-may-need-to-unite-to-fight-coronavirus-economic-fallout-imf/story-xfbhBJRWANcuWOGmhj9TKP.html
15-02-2020||World||US official reveals details of Taliban deal||A US-Taliban deal for a seven-day reduction of violence in Afghanistan will apply across the country, a senior American official said Friday, unveiling details of the agreement Washington hopes will lead to a full peace accord.The weeklong period has not yet begun but will do so “really soon”, the official said, contradicting a Taliban suggestion it would start on Friday.The partial truce came after more than a year of gruelling talks between US officials and the jihadists as they seek an end to what has become the US’s longest war.“The reduction of violence agreement is very specific. And... it’s nationwide and it includes the Afghans,” the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.The US military, which has between 12,000 and 13,000 troops in Afghanistan, will monitor the reduction in violence to ensure the Taliban upholds its commitments, the official said at the Munich Security Conference.Some kind of communication channel between the US military and the Taliban is foreseen to address any problems that arise, including possible “false flag” attempts by outside actors to sabotage the accord.“We will be monitoring, there will be verification associated with it to see if the Taliban deliver -- if the Taliban deliver on their commitments we have commitments, in terms of reduction of forces that are also specific,” the official said.The Taliban has long demanded the complete withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan but the official said any reduction in numbers will depend on the militants sticking to their side of the deal.The official added that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a “very good meeting” to brief Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on the deal on the sidelines of the Munich conference.If the partial truce holds, the hope is that it could lead to a next stage of negotiations -- between the Taliban and the Kabul government, with an eventual comprehensive peace deal the ultimate goal.President Donald Trump hailed the reduction in violence as a sign that a fuller accord was “very close”.But there have been previous false dawns, with a deal all but complete in September before Trump nixed it at the last moment amid continued Taliban violence.Washington and its NATO allies have been adamant that they will not allow Afghanistan to become a launchpad for terror attacks in the West.Facing an election later this year, Trump last month renewed his vow to bring troops home from Afghanistan, more than 18 years after the US invaded to overthrow the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-official-reveals-details-of-taliban-deal/story-zmePayCqYBRxXnE7M2QVnI.html
15-02-2020||World||US killing of Qasem Soleimani was a ‘miscalculation’, says Iran||The US killing of a top Iranian general was a miscalculation that has had the effect of bolstering support in Iraq for the removal of American troops, a longtime goal of Tehran, Iran’s foreign minister said Friday.The US killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a January 3 drone strike as the commander of Iran’s expeditionary Quds Force was leaving Baghdad’s airport, saying he was planning attacks on Americans.Speaking to a group of reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said “the US miscalculated,” noting that since the killing, thousands of Iraqis have taken to the streets to protest against the presence of foreign troops in the country.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, in which Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed, a group of Iraqi lawmakers also passed a non-binding resolution to oust US troops and since then, the issue of American troops has monopolized Iraqi politics.“The martyr Soleimani is much more effective than Gen. Soleimani,” Zarif said. “We are seeing that in terms of demonstrations that are taking place in Iraq against the US presence.” Zarif is expected to meet on the sidelines of the conference with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas to talk about ongoing European efforts to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran.The deal provides Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program in an effort to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear bomb — something Iran insists it is not planning. Since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington unilaterally out of the deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran’s economy has been struggling.In an effort to pressure the other signatories to the deal — Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China — to provide economic incentives to offset the American sanctions, Iran has slowly been violating the deal’s restrictions on its nuclear program.The US has been pressuring other members of the deal to pull out as well, but Maas told the forum that Germany rejected the US tactic of “maximum pressure” on Iran.“We are sticking firmly to our course in the Middle East, and that is de-escalation instead of maximum pressure,” he said.Zarif reiterated Iran’s stance that all of its moves to ramp-up its nuclear program in the past few months are reversible, “providing that Europe takes steps that are meaningful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-killing-of-qasem-soleimani-was-a-miscalculation-says-iran/story-dXigTr5ccNleGi5I2f4bWM.html
15-02-2020||World||US refuses entry to Sri Lanka army chief over war crimes||The United States said Friday it would refuse entry to Sri Lanka’s army chief over what it called credible evidence of human rights violations in the 2009 finale to the civil war.Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, whose appointment last year drew widespread international criticism, will be ineligible to visit the United States, as will his immediate family, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.“The allegations of gross human rights violations against Shavendra Silva, documented by the United Nations and other organizations, are serious and credible,” Pompeo said in a statement.“We urge the Sri Lankan government to promote human rights, hold accountable individuals responsible for war crimes and human rights violations, advance security sector reform, and uphold its other commitments to pursue justice and reconciliation,” he said. Silva was the commanding officer of a key army division in the final months of the military offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009.Rights groups say some 40,000 ethnic Tamils were killed in mass atrocities as government forces seized Sri Lanka’s predominantly Tamil north. A UN report said Silva played a major role in orchestrating the war crimes.The Sri Lankan government said it took “strong objection” to the travel ban on Silva and asked the United States to reconsider.It reiterated its stance that there were “no substantiated or proven allegations of human rights violations against him.”“It is disappointing that a foreign government should question the prerogative of the democratically elected president to call upon persons with proven expertise to hold key positions on national security related matters,” the government said in a statement.The 2009 offensive delivered a death blow to the Tamil Tigers, whose nearly four-decade campaign for a separate homeland had killed 100,000 people and was characterized by rebel suicide attacks. - Message to other post-war states -Kate Cronin-Furman, an expert on mass atrocities and human rights at University College London (UCL), said a visa ban would be a “pretty small disincentive” if seeking to stop ongoing atrocities.“But if instead we think about this as an effort to get states like Sri Lanka to stop appointing war criminals to leadership positions, then the prospects look much rosier,” she said.Other nations’ post-war governments, seeing the visa ban on Silva, could conclude it is easiest “to just not promote a war criminal in the first place.”The Sri Lankan government “will likely get some domestic political mileage out of Shavendra Silva’s visa ban. But there’s no doubt that it’s embarrassing to have your army commander barred from entering the US,” she said.The Tamil diaspora in the United States has been active in pressing for action by President Donald Trump’s administration, which has often been low-key in addressing human rights with friendly countries.The action comes despite US efforts to woo Sri Lanka away from China, which has lavished money on the strategically placed island traditionally allied with nearby India and in 2017 assumed control of a port after the Colombo government could not repay loans.A State Department spokesperson said that the visa sanction against Silva “does not place additional restrictions on security assistance or military engagement in Sri Lanka.”In 2017, the United States provided $39 million to Sri Lanka to boost maritime security. The United States has also looked to step up counter-terrorism cooperation with Sri Lanka after last year’s Easter Sunday bombings carried out by Islamist extremists.“We deeply value our partnership with the Sri Lankan government and the long-standing democratic tradition we share with the Sri Lankan people,” Pompeo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-refuses-entry-to-sri-lanka-army-chief-over-war-crimes/story-neD2KFCcukIXFhgFKWGbCK.html

Most of the infections among health workers were in Hubei’s capital, Wuhan, where many have lacked proper masks and gear to protect themselves in hospitals dealing with a deluge of patients.The grim figures come a week after grief and public anger erupted over the death of a whistleblowing doctor who had been reprimanded and silenced by police in Wuhan after raising the alarm about the virus in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-coronavirus-death-toll-surges-past-1500/story-5HTctJzv2Dxwvf8HRbFDvO.html
15-02-2020||World||Pak PM Imran wants firebrand cleric Rehman tried for statements on toppling govt||Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday called for a treason case against his fierce political opponent and firebrand cleric Maulana Fazlur Rehman for remarks on toppling the government. The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief launched a major protest dubbed as ‘Azadi March’ against the PTI government in Islamabad in November and demanded the resignation of Khan. Rehman recently claimed that he ended his protest only after he was given an assurance that Prime Minister Khan will step down and the elections will be held in three months. “There should be a case under Article 6 against the maulana for his statement regarding the ousting of the government,” Khan said during an informal conversation with journalists. “The government will complete its term, it’s not going anywhere,” he said, adding that he enjoyed full support of the Pakistan Army. “I am supported by army since I am not corrupt,” he said. Khan also slammed the media for attacking his government’s policies, saying he had to face embarrassment in China due to false reports published by some news outlets. “I have suffered more media attacks in the past two years than anyone else,” he said. He said even his statements had been changed and false reports published which caused problems for his government. Khan said due to a false report about his visit to China, he “faced a lot of embarrassment in China”. He said the media reported that the visit was undertaken to review China-Pakistan Economic Corridor whereas it actually aimed to save the country from a default due to the deficit in balance of payments. The Prime Minister also defended his decision to seek aid from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and China, saying the country would have defaulted without the help from these countries. He said the government had reduced the current account deficit by 75 per cent in its first year, terming it a big achievement. Khan said the current account deficit was USD 2.5 billion. He also said a probe was going on to identify who was responsible for the shortage of wheat and sugar in the country. He said the government was committed not to further increase electricity prices. He also accused the government of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for gas price hike. He announced to introduce electoral laws to ensure transparent elections through technology to put an end to allegations of rigging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-wants-firebrand-cleric-rehman-tried-for-statements-on-toppling-govt/story-J1GmqN0pyp3rkruyUXTWeL.html
