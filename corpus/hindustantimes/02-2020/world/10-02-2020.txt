Also included are a host of related equipment and services, such as US government and contractor technical support; engineering and logistics support services; warranty services; Systems and Integration Checkout (SICO); field office support; and other related elements of logistics and programme support.The development comes after India’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat recently asked top officials of HQ Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) to prepare a proposal to create an Air Defence command to enhance military synergy and optimally utilise the resources of the armed forces. Rawat has set a June 30 deadline for the proposal to be submitted.India has stepped up defence purchases from the US in recent years as part of a growing defence relationship that includes greater interoperability and joint exercises. From nil in 2008, India-US defence trade has gone up to $17 billion, facilitated by the signing of key foundational agreements to enhance interoperability and changes in the US export regime. “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region,” the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a statement.The agency said India planned to use the system to “modernise its armed forces, and to expand its existing air defence architecture to counter threats posed by air attack”. It added that the proposed system will, on delivery, will be “further enhancing greater interoperability between India, the US, and other allies”.The system, with Raytheon Corporation and Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace as principal contractors, will not “alter the basic military balance in the region”.India and the US are expected to announce more defence deals during Trump’s proposed visit later this month, to the tune of $3 billion and could include more Apache helicopters and P8 maritime surveillance aircraft, according to people familiar with the discussions.A Reuters report released on Monday said India was set to give final approval to a $2.6-billion deal for military helicopters from US defence firm Lockheed Martin ahead of Trump’s proposed visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-clears-sale-of-1-9-billion-worth-air-defense-system-to-india/story-NxxpYJeMgrrnO0yMEWgrfM.html

Ma Guoqiang said the Wuhan government would, however, aim to test all suspected cases by Tuesday. There have been growing complaints that many patients in the city of 11 million have not been tested or admitted for full-time treatment due to the pressure on medical resources.Ma added that 1,499 patients in critical conditions who were not admitted for treatment before Feb. 8 have now been hospitalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wuhan-aims-to-test-all-suspected-cases-of-coronavirus-by-tomorrow/story-gjwkdPkbLyiSelwTXp5hdI.html

In a letter to Xi, Modi expressed solidarity with the president and people of China over the outbreak of the virus that has claimed over 900 lives in the neighbouring country. “We thank and appreciate India’s support for China’s fight against the NCP Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, the official name for coronavirus,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. “India’s acts of goodwill fully demonstrate its friendship with China,” Geng said during an online media briefing while replying to a question on Modi’s letter to Xi. Prime Minister Modi also offered India’s assistance to China to face the challenge, besides conveying condolences over the loss of lives due to the outbreak.The prime minister also conveyed to Xi his appreciation for facilitating evacuation of around 650 Indian citizens from the worst-affected Hubei province last week. A sizeable number of countries have evacuated their citizens from China and restricted movement of people and goods to and from China. India too has put restrictions on the movement of people to and from China as part of precautionary measures to contain the spread of the virus. “We stand ready to work with India and other members of the international community to jointly tackle fight the epidemic and safeguard regional and global public health security,” Geng said. Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri told the Indian media here on Monday that India was in touch with Chinese officials to find out the immediate requirements to deal with the epidemic. The death toll in China’s coronavirus outbreak has gone up to 908 with 97 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province and the confirmed cases of infection crossing 40,000, Chinese health officials said on Monday. A team of international experts led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) would arrive in China on Monday night to assist the Chinese health officials to contain the spread of coronavirus outbreak. “I’ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led 2019nCoV international expert mission to China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-praises-pm-modi-s-letter-to-xi-on-coronavirus-assistance/story-Kcescg869nq6tfGWt06P1I.html
10-02-2020||World||Britain declares coronavirus a serious and imminent threat to public health||Britain on Monday declared the new coronavirus a serious and imminent threat to public health, giving the government additional powers to isolate those suspected of being infected. Britain has recorded four cases of coronavirus so far while British nationals who have been flown back from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the epidemic broke out, are being quarantined for 14 days. The virus has killed more than 900 people, all but two in mainland China, and has spread to at least 27 countries and territories.Britain’s health ministry said new measures were aimed at delaying or preventing further transmission of the coronavirus.“We are strengthening our regulations so we can keep individuals in supported isolation for their own safety and if public health professionals consider they may be at risk of spreading the virus to other members of the public,” a health ministry spokesman said.Arrowe Park Hospital, near Liverpool in northern England, and Kents Hill Park, in Milton Keynes, have been designated as isolation facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-declares-coronavirus-a-serious-and-imminent-threat-to-public-health/story-Mnj6RzprAWUbK69IUvyDCL.html

But in these uncertain times of the new coronavirus, Wang and her family are the only occupants.The 35-year-old woman now spends her days disinfecting Yingfangyuan Farmhouse and its empty restaurant near Beijing, as millions of people across the country stay home, either under government orders or out of caution.As the virus claims more lives and infects thousands of people every day, it is also taking a toll on the country’s small businesses that rely on spending from China’s growing middle-class.“We used to be able to have up to 10 tables of guests a day during this period,” she told AFP. “There is no one now.” While she usually earns around 10,000 yuan (USD 1,400) during the Lunar New Year holiday, her business was closed this year.“We rely on this for our livelihood. We can only wait for the epidemic to pass,” she said, noting that she will face problems if the situation persists for more than two months.“I don’t have other (backup) plans.” Across Beijing’s rural outskirts, guesthouses, restaurants and tourist attractions have been deserted for almost two weeks.The Great Wall and Ming dynasty tombs remain closed and people are urged to stay home -- with many working remotely even after the Spring Festival break ended.Many bus and train services have been suspended across the country, and central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, has effectively been locked down.Supermarkets are struggling to sell their food as families have enough after stocking up for holiday gatherings that have not been held -- in line with officials’ advice.At the Shijihualian Supermarket in Heishanzhai village, boxes of Lunar New Year goods, including food items such as persimmons, remain stacked and unsold.“They are bought as gifts, but people have not been visiting their relatives this year,” said its shopkeeper surnamed Yang.“With no relatives to host this year, it will take time for them to deplete their supplies.” With analysts warning that the virus could cut into the country’s already slowing economy, China’s central bank has urged financial institutions to continue stepping up support for small and micro enterprises.But this has not stopped business owners from fretting over an uncertain future.Adding to the isolation of rural communities, villages have closed themselves off from “outsiders” in a bid to ensure the new coronavirus, which has claimed more than 900 lives, stays out.Bright red banners proclaiming the importance of epidemic prevention drape across the entrances of villages, and masked volunteers stand guard at each entry point.Residents who would have typically returned to work in cities after the Spring Festival break are still in their hometowns as well.In the Heishanzhai village north of Beijing, there are blockades on roads leading into its residential areas.“We stopped allowing people in from the second day of the Lunar New Year,” said Zhang Xinao, a 25-year-old volunteer manning one of the entrances.“We also disinfect the entire village every day in the mornings and afternoons,” he told AFP, as another volunteer walked around spraying a can of disinfectant.In the background, announcements blaring over loudspeakers remind residents of the importance of donning masks.Zhang added that he does not usually work in the village, but has a job with a railway-related business in nearby Changping district.But his company, like many others across the country, has yet to confirm when regular operations will resume.The absence of tourists is posing a different problem for some.Wang Jigang stands guard at the entrance to the Yanshou temple, which he said used to attract up to 1,000 visitors a day during peak periods.“On the first day of the Lunar New Year, there were still hawkers setting up stalls here. But the controls got more and more serious by the day and eventually we blocked off the area with stone blocks,” he said.This also means devotees, who would bring donations to the temple, are not visiting.While the temple does not lack resources for now, Wang is looking to local authorities for support in the near future.“People are understanding,” he said of the government’s response to the virus.“But they have paid a heavy price.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quarantine-efforts-against-coronavirus-harm-small-businesses-across-china/story-YBxaUzoxhmwtsTp7CTygDP.html
10-02-2020||World||India clears export of 2 consignments of masks to China, 6 more likely soon||India has allowed the immediate export of at least two large consignments of protective clothing including masks to China setting aside the ban on the export of personal protection equipment imposed on February 1 amid the ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak.Indian officials are also in the process of clearing at least half-a-dozen more such consignments specifically for China, official sources in Beijing told the Hindustan Times.These transactions will be done on a “commercial” basis between importers in China and manufacturers in India with the Indian government’s sanction.Separately, the Indian embassy in Beijing has also reached out to the Chinese government through China’s foreign ministry to offer assistance in containing the NCP outbreak which has claimed over 900 lives and infected more than 40000 people until Sunday midnight.This follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s letter to President Xi Jinping on Sunday in which he expressed solidarity with the Chinese people during the ongoing epidemic and offered New Delhi’s assistance to deal with the serious health emergency.India, official sources added had sent about 40 boxes of protective clothing in the second Air India flight which was dispatched from New Delhi to Wuhan to evacuate Indians from Hubei.The first two consignments which were “cleared on an ad hoc basis” contain at least 1.5 million masks.The central Chinese province of Hubei, and its capital, Wuhan, the outbreak epicentre, are facing a severe shortage of protective equipment like masks, gloves and protective clothing.Medical workers are facing a serious threat of being infected as a result.Chinese importers had placed orders for protective clothing from India towards the end of January as NCP rapidly spread across the country.The orders, however, were stalled after India banned the export of those goods on February 1.“Exports of all varieties of personal protection equipment including clothing and masks used to protect the wearer from airborne particles and/or any other respiratory masks or any other personal protective clothing (including coveralls and N95 masks)...is hereby prohibited with immediate effect till further orders,” the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) said in the February 1notification.No reason was given for the ban but it could have been a precautionary measure to ensure enough supplies if the infection spreads to India.At a subsequent meeting chaired by the Cabinet secretariat, it was decided to waive the ban in a “case by case” basis, with a focus on China’s shortage of protective clothing.A multi-member screening committee has been set up by India’s ministry of health to look into each such request before waiving the ban.It was learnt that the requests from Chinese importers were the first ones to be considered.Until late last week, China had publicly acknowledged that 21 countries and the United Nations Children’s Fund had donated epidemic prevention and control supplies to China.Those countries were South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Hungary, Belarus, Turkey, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand, as well as Trinidad and Tobago, spokesperson Hua Chunying said at an online press briefing.India wasn’t mentioned in the list.The US is said to have donated 18 tonnes and the EU around 12 tonnes of supplies to China so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-sets-aside-ban-allows-export-of-masks-gloves-for-medics-in-china/story-s1gJT0hXp7IvoFAKAqY2TP.html

In the capital, trees and scaffolding were toppled and some buildings damaged but there were no injuries.The whole Belgian offshore wind farm was shut down as powerful gusts caused the turbines to stop automatically for safety reasons.In Germany, mainline train services were suspended. The storm was so violent that “we are forced to completely stop mainline train traffic in Germany this Sunday evening,” Deutsche Bahn spokesman Achim Stauss told AFP.Several airports in Germany had to cancel flights as the storm swept in from the north. Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich, Cologne and Hanover were among those affected, while at Dusseldorf, 120 flights were scrapped on Sunday.About 240 flights to and from Amsterdam Schiphol, the third-busiest airport in Europe, were also cancelled, largely affecting KLM, British Airways, easyJet and Lufthansa services.- Sports events hit -Sports events were also hit.Sunday’s English Premier League fixture between Manchester City and West Ham was called off due to “extreme and escalating weather conditions”, City said in a statement.The entire Women’s Super League football programme was also called off, as was Sunday’s Scotland-England clash in the Women’s Six Nations rugby tournament. And for British Airways there was one upside to Storm Ciara -- the airline recorded its fastest-ever flight between New York and London, thanks to tailwinds from the storm.According to flight-tracking website Flightradar24, it completed the transatlantic crossing in a mere 4 hours 56 minutes, the fastest sub-sonic crossing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/storm-ciara-disrupts-flight-train-services-across-europe/story-wVPBJJT8foSApIH02T9TIN.html

It’s unclear whether Airbnb’s local rivals, including Tujia and Trip.com Group Ltd., are similarly suspending all bookings in the capital. In its mobile app, Ctrip said “some” apartment bookings in Beijing have been suspended and recommended users turn to hotels instead.“In light of the novel coronavirus outbreak and guidance from local authorities for the short-term rental industry during this public health emergency, bookings of all listings in Beijing with check-in from 7 February 2020 to 29 February 2020 have been suspended,” Airbnb said in its statement. The company “appreciates that disease control efforts are causing overall travel disruptions that also affect our community of guests and hosts.”Health authorities in China and around the world are trying to gauge whether the world’s largest known quarantine effort has been effective in containing the pneumonia-causing virus in central Hubei province, a landlocked region of 60 million people. Infections are rising elsewhere in the country and Beijing is one of its most popular tourist destinations. As of Sunday, Beijing’s health authorities have confirmed 337 cases, including two deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-causes-airbnb-to-freeze-beijing-check-ins-until-march/story-OmSK3Uuc7eeQv9Ru5jzDcL.html

But we are optimistic of signing these agreements as soon as the tourism industry in the world recovers,” he told the Daily Financial Times on Sunday.The Minister pointed out that such agreements would benefit Sri Lanka as well as other countries in the event disasters hit the world.Sri Lanka has already signed agreements for tourism promotion with 10 countries - India, Thailand, Seychelles, Poland, Tajikistan, Malaysia, Australia, Russia, South Korea and the Philippines.Accordingly, the implementation of the programmes will be coordinated through a Joint Working Group.Sri Lanka’s top tourist markets include India, the UK, China, Australia, Germany, the US, Maldives, France and Canada.He said the Government also intended to appoint destination marketing agencies based in India, Europe, China, the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine.In 2019, Sri Lanka received a little over 1.9 million tourists.

It will help save time in screening out potential patients.According to Global Times, Tianjin University developed the kit in collaboration with Beijing Biotech company. The kit is undergoing clinical trials and will be sent to the health regulator for approval.Earlier, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), Chinese health regulatory body, approved a kit developed by SunSure Biotech, which cut the screening time to 30 minutes.The NMPA approved four test kits on January 26.The coronavirus epidemic has claimed over 800 lives and infected more than 37,000 people in China. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, more than 750 people had died and 8,437 were infected across the world. SARS had spread from China’s southern province of Guanzhou, while the coronavirus has stemmed from the Wuhan seafood market in the eastern central province of Hubei.The disease has spread to around 20 countries. Around 99 per cent patients are in China.

10-02-2020||World||Pakistan to decide fate of its citizens in coronavirus-hit China soon: Official||Amid growing pressure to bring back its nationals, mostly students, from coronavirus-hit Hubei province, the Pakistan government has said it is closely monitoring the situation in China and will soon take a decision on their evacuation.Pakistan came under criticism after it said that Pakistani students should not be evacuated from Wuhan as medical facilities back home do not meet the standards required to treat a patient diagnosed with coronavirus.The Pakistani nationals stuck in areas affected by the novel virus have been making requests to the government on social media platforms to evacuate them.“The matter is being considered at the high level and best possible decision would be taken after considering all possible aspects. Rest assured that we care about you,” said Zafar Mirza, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health, on Sunday.Mirza said that the government has been keenly observing the situation in China, the Dawn newspaper reported.He said that all options were being explored and the government wanted to maintain a balance on the issue.“We have to consider all aspects including situation of the Pakistanis (in China), Chinese regulations and advisories of the World Health Organisation (WHO). All the stakeholders are involved over the issue and we have kept all options open,” he said.Addressing students in China in a tweet, Mirza said, “My very dear students in China and your respectable family members, we are intensely discussing the situation at highest level and will make the best decision in view of all factors with reference to devastating coronavirus potential global pandemic.” Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Naghmana Hashmi said that they could not reach the stranded Pakistani students in Wuhan due to the complete lockdown of the city, the capital of Hubei province.Pakistani officials are in contact with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing and Wuhan and will promptly reply to any query by a Pakistani citizen in China, she was quoted as saying by Geo News.However, Pakistani nationals vent out their anger on social media after Mirza’s tweet, the Dawn report said.“Dear sir, if you care about us then please spend at least one day with us in Wuhan, China at least one day please after this we will never say to evacuate us. Please consider my suggestion thanks,” a Pakistani national living in Wuhan tweeted.Another Pakistani student tweeted, “it is a humble request not to tweet if you won’t change things.” The death toll in China due to the novel coronavirus increased to 908 and the number of confirmed cases surged over 40,000, Chinese health officials said on Monday.Five persons with symptoms of coronavirus were reported from Pakistan on Sunday after they arrived from a flight from China.There were up to 800 Pakistanis studying in various universities in Wuhan - a city of 11 million people which has been quarantined by the Chinese authorities in an effort to stem the spread of the deadly virus.Earlier, Foreign Office said that there were 28,000 Pakistani students currently in China apart from hundreds of businessmen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-decide-fate-of-its-citizens-in-coronavirus-hit-china-soon-official/story-cfPcZB3BYIrZLHUg14YqIK.html
10-02-2020||World||Citizen journalist covering coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan goes missing||Over the past couple of weeks, Chinese citizen journalists Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin have served as the world’s eyes and ears inside the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, the city of Wuhan. Broadcasting via their mobile phones, they’ve offered a glimpse of how dire things have been. Many of those videos have been posted to Twitter and reposted on YouTube.Now one of them is missing.Chen has been out of reach for more than 20 hours. Fang, who was silent much of Friday until a video posted in the evening, was previously detained briefly by authorities for his video of corpses in a hospital. When he filmed the dramatic moment people in hazmat suits broke down his apartment door to take him into quarantine, it sparked hundreds of comments urging the authorities to release him.It’s no accident that their posts grew viral on American platforms. China’s internet watchdog has stepped up its policing efforts, announcing on Wednesday it would conduct “targeted supervision” on the largest social media platforms including Weibo, Tencent’s WeChat and ByteDance’s Douyin. The regulator has already frozen a raft of social media accounts, then stepped up online scrubbing to quiet a wave of confused outrage over the death of the doctor that first raised red flags about the disease.In this environment, US-based Twitter has emerged as the destination for locals seeking information about the spread of the virus. It’s officially banned in the country, but many people hop the Great Firewall and access the platform via virtual private networks.“There’s a lot more activity happening on Twitter compared with Weibo and WeChat,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. There has been a Chinese community on Jack Dorsey’s short-message platform since before President Xi Jinping rose to power, she added, but the recent crackdown has weakened that social circle.Chen, the most visible among scores of residents documenting the human disaster around them, has for many followers become the go-to source for real facts about the epidemic. Wuhan locals have filmed some of the most chilling videos during the outbreak, including images of untreated corpses, discontent among quarantined patients in hospitals and police knocking on doors to enforce censorship. Bloomberg News has not independently verified the authenticity of those videos.Twitter was becoming the last line of defense for people to gather information and record the trauma that thousands of families were experiencing.“After lifting the lid briefly to give the press and social media some freedom,” said Wang about China’s ruling Communist Party, the regime “is now reinstating its control over social media, fearing it could lead to a wider-spread panic.”Starting this week, scores of WeChat users complained that they were locked out of their personal accounts after people in their chat groups discussed issues around the virus outbreak. That’s meant losing access to all of their stored social contacts as well as the money in their WeChat wallets. Many others have gone into self-policing mode, reminding friends in their chat groups not to exchange information about the coronavirus.Read more: Latest News on the Coronavirus OutbreakChen has been out of contact for a prolonged period of time. His friends posted a message on his Twitter account saying he has been unreachable since 7 p.m. local time on Thursday. In a texted interview, Bloomberg News’s last question to Chen was whether he was concerned about his safety as he’s among the few people reporting the situation on the front lines.His response has yet to come back.To contact the reporter on this story: in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/citizen-journalist-covering-coronavirus-outbreak-from-wuhan-go-missing/story-y4cxYWvtrK5hv3Hhur8rjK.html
10-02-2020||World||British Airways makes a record flight, crosses Atlantic in less than 5 hours||For the first time in years, a commercial passenger plane has flown across the Atlantic in less than five hours. A British Airways flight landed early Sunday morning at Heathrow Airport in London after leaving John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York just four hours and 56 minutes earlier. That set a new speed record for subsonic — or slower than the speed of sound — commercial aircraft to fly between the two cities, according to Flightradar24, which tracks global flights. The previous record was held by a Norwegian Air flight, which flew between the two cities with a flight time of five hours and 13 minutes. The flight had been expected to take 102 minutes longer. The recent average flight time between New York and London is 6 hours and 13 minutes, according to Flightradar24. The wind and air currents were ideal for a fast flight, said Ian Petchenik, Flightradar24’s director of communications. “In the winter, the jet stream dips down a bit,” he said. “It’s kind of in a perfect spot for flights across the North Atlantic to take advantage of it.” British Airways just narrowly beat out a Virgin Atlantic flight, which arrived in London at around the same time but one minute slower. British Airways confirmed the flight time for the Boeing 747 plane, saying the company prioritizes safety over speed.

His shots struck a lieutenant in the arm and narrowly missed other police personnel before he ran out of bullets, lay down and tossed his pistol, officials said.That attack came just hours after the same man approached a patrol van in the same part of the Bronx and fired at two officers inside, wounding one before escaping on foot, police said.All of those shot are expected to recover, authorities said.“It is only by the grace of God and the heroic actions of those inside the building that took him into custody that we are not talking about police officers murdered inside a New York City police precinct,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news conference.Williams is being charged with attempted murder, criminal weapon possession and resisting arrest, police said in an email late Sunday identifying him as the suspect. He was hospitalized Sunday evening, the Bronx prosecutor’s office said. It wasn’t clear whether he had an attorney to speak for him.Williams had been upset since his own son died after being shot in the Bronx, the suspect’s grandmother told the New York Post.“He was depressed at times because his son got shot in the street,” Mary Williams, 80, told the newspaper. “That was his only child.”The officer injured in the first shooting, Paul Stroffolino, was released from the hospital Sunday to applause from colleagues. The officer, a bandage on his neck, gave a thumbs-up.Shea called Williams a “coward” and said he had a long criminal history, including a 2002 shooting and carjacking in which he fired a gun at police. He was paroled from prison in 2017 after an attempted murder conviction, Shea said.The commissioner also lashed out at criminal justice reform activists who have demonstrated in recent months against excessive force by police, including a large protest in Grand Central Terminal. The protests, he suggested, helped create an anti-police environment.“These things are not unrelated. We had people marching through the streets of New York City recently,” Shea said. “Words matter. And words affect people’s behavior.”Shea didn’t offer any evidence that Williams knew of those protests or was influenced by them.Mayor Bill de Blasio, who won office partly on a promise to reform overly aggressive policing of minority communities, also suggested that anti-police sentiment had gotten out of hand.“Anyone who spews hatred at our officers is aiding and abetting this kind of atmosphere; it is not acceptable,” de Blasio said. “You could protest for whatever you believe in, but you cannot vilely attack those who are here to protect us. It creates this kind of dynamic.”The attacks recalled other unprovoked assaults on police officers sitting in their patrol vehicles.In 2017, a gunman killed Officer Miosotis Familia as she sat in her patrol vehicle in the Bronx. In 2014, two officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn by a man upset about recent police killings of unarmed black men.The killings of Ramos and Liu had also followed large protests. Some officers blamed de Blasio for expressing solidarity with the demonstrations and turned their backs on the Democrat at the funerals.Robert Gangi, executive director of the Police Reform Organizing Project advocacy group, said it was “irresponsible” for Shea and de Blasio to link the weekend’s violence to recent demonstrations, which he said involved activists “protesting in a legitimate fashion.”There is “no defense for a lunatic who opens fire on police,” Gangi said.The first attack happened just before 8:30 p.m. Saturday, when the gunman walked up to the van asking the officers for directions and then fired shots, grazing Stroffolino, who was behind the wheel, in the chin and neck and narrowly missing an artery, authorities said.Stroffolino and his partner for eight years, Brian Hanlon, a friend since middle school, hit the gas to get away. Neither fired a shot.Police released a photo of the suspect and were combing the city for him when he walked into the police station coordinating the manhunt, strolled to the desk and pulled a gun, authorities said. The wounded lieutenant returned fire but missed, and police personnel dashed out of an adjoining room just in time to avoid the pursuing gunman.Two security cameras captured video of the chaotic scene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-ambushes-new-york-cops-twice-in-12-hours-spawns-outrage/story-LbLEkMpXefDGAeGZ3Oi91O.html
10-02-2020||World||Heaviest rain in decades brings Australia drought, fire relief||Torrential rains along Australia’s east coast caused widespread power outages and property damage at the weekend, and while the downpour has doused many wildfires there are now concerns that drinking water supplies will be contaminated by the flooding.Sydney experienced its wettest 24 hours since 1992, with 176 millimeters (7 inches) of rain falling in the city between Sunday and Monday morning, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. And the wild weather is not over yet with another 200 millimeters expected in some areas by next weekend.The deluge brought welcome inflows into dams in drought-stricken New South Wales state, with reservoirs now at about 64% capacity, up from 42% a week ago. About 206mm of rain fell in the Warragamba Dam catchment, which supplies the bulk of Sydney’s water, in the past week -- about 38% of the total fall for the past year.But there’s now concern that debris and ash from months of devastating wildfires is being swept into the water supply. The country is still grappling with the fallout from its worst fire season in generations, which saw more than 3,000 homes destroyed and claimed at least 31 lives.The water authority in NSW state said it is monitoring water quality to assess whether extra measures are needed to control ash and sediment. Water could be drawn from deeper in the dam or from elsewhere in the network if there were quality concerns.The rains extinguished the massive Currowan Fire on the NSW south coast. The blaze had burnt for 74 days and destroyed 499,621 hectares of land, including 312 homes.Drought PlansThe NSW government imposed level two water restrictions for Sydney in December and last year started planning to expand capacity at its desalination plant amid extended drought conditions, which had slashed water storage levels.It’s unclear whether the weekend’s downpours will affect the restrictions or planning for the plant expansion. State water minister Melinda Pavey was not immediately available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heaviest-rain-in-decades-brings-australia-drought-fire-relief/story-Fe43LCx4XCfwDaXQxRIyoK.html

10-02-2020||World||Donald Trump’s budget plan pushes back deficit target: Reports||The White House will unveil a budget proposal that drops the Republicans’ long-term goal of eliminating the federal deficit over the next 10 years, US media said Sunday.The budget proposal, expected to be released on Monday, will instead target closing the deficit by 2035, the Washington Post reported, citing an internal summary.President Donald Trump’s administration had sought to eliminate the fiscal gap over a decade, but the president has recently shown little interest in tackling growing government debt, the newspaper said.The budget plan is expected to request $2 billion in homeland security spending for the US-Mexico border wall, with the summary reportedly saying 400 miles (645 kilometers) of wall would be completed by the end of 2020.“We will not be touching your Social Security or Medicare in Fiscal 2021 Budget,” Trump, who faces a re-election battle in November, tweeted Saturday.“Only the Democrats will destroy them by destroying our Country’s greatest ever Economy!” he added.The proposed budget will go before Congress, which is not required to agree to the White House’s requests.According to Bloomberg News, the $4.8 trillion plan includes $740.5 billion for defense and a 5 percent cut in non-defense spending.The budget deficit is projected to breach $1 trillion by the end of September, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while government debt is expected to represent 81 percent of US GDP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-budget-plan-pushes-back-deficit-target-reports/story-Bs6269bhlNUSgEikEmD2vI.html
10-02-2020||World||Coronavirus deaths rise past 900, overtaking SARS fatalities in 2003||The death toll from the novel coronavirus surged past 900 in mainland China on Monday, overtaking global fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic, even as the World Health Organization said the outbreak appeared to be stabilising.With 91 more people dying in Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak, the toll is now higher than the 774 killed worldwide by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).The latest data came after the WHO said the last four days had seen “some stabilising” in Hubei, but warned the figures could still “shoot up”.At least 39,800 people in China have now been infected by the virus, believed to have emerged late last year in Hubei’s capital Wuhan, where residents are struggling to get daily supplies.The epidemic has prompted the government to lock down whole cities as anger mounts over its handling of the crisis -- especially after a whistleblowing doctor fell victim to the virus.With much of the country still not back at work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, cities including financial hub Shanghai ordered residents to wear masks in public.Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said the “stable period” of the outbreak “may reflect the impact of the control measures”.A WHO “international expert mission” left late Sunday for China, the agency’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter. The mission is led by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies.While the death toll has climbed steadily, new cases have declined since Wednesday’s single-day peak of nearly 3,900 people nationwide.- Public anger -Millions of people are under lockdown in Hubei in a bid to stop the virus spreading.“The local government asked people to stay at home as much as possible, but there are not enough goods in shops each time we get there, so we have to go out frequently,” a woman in Wuhan, surnamed Wei, told AFP.China’s central bank said from Monday it would make 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) available in special loans to banks to help businesses involved in fighting the epidemic.China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the SARS outbreak, whereas the WHO has praised measures it has taken this time.But anger erupted after the death of a Wuhan doctor who police silenced when he flagged the emerging virus in December.The doctor, 34, died early Friday, after contracting the virus from a patient.Chinese academics were among those angered by his death, with at least two open letters posted on social media demanding more freedoms.“Put an end to the restrictions on freedom of speech,” one letter demanded.- ‘Percolating along’ -Beijing responded by sending its anti-graft body to launch an investigation, attempting to ease the anger.But Ian Lipkin -- a professor at Columbia University who worked with China on the SARS outbreak -- said earlier intervention could have made a key difference.“This virus was percolating along without anyone realising it was there,” he said.If the quarantine measures have been effective, the epidemic should peak within the next fortnight, Lipkin added -- but he warned there is also the risk of a “bump” in numbers when people return to work.Wuhan has converted public buildings into makeshift medical centres, and built two new field hospitals.But Wuhan resident Chen Yiping told AFP her 61-year-old mother has severe symptoms and was still waiting for a hospital bed because “there are too many people in need of treatment”.The first foreign victim in China was confirmed when an American diagnosed with the virus died in Wuhan.The only fatalities outside the mainland have been a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong.Seventy people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan’s coast have tested positive, with all passengers told to stay inside their cabins to prevent further infection.Several countries have banned arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-deaths-rise-past-900-overtaking-sars-fatalities-in-2003/story-NL4ukbv5faMwQgpvcaSS1H.html
10-02-2020||World||Coronavirus death toll rises to 813, exceeds SARS fatalities in 2003||The number of people who have died after being infected by the novel coronavirus rose to 813 on Sunday, surpassing in less than two months the death toll during the eight-month-long outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003.Total infections from the coronavirus, which is similar to the SARS pathogen, reached around 37,500 on Sunday, and officials in Shanghai said they had observed a worrying new attribute in the new outbreak: the virus can infect new patients as an aerosol. SARS had claimed the lives of 774 people in 2002-03.Experts and officials said the coming week will be crucial as millions of Chinese return to their places of work after the Chinese New Year holidays, which were extended in an effort to curb the disease’s spread.The number of new cases logged over Saturday was 3,419 — slightly higher than the 3,205 seen the previous day but still lower than the peak of 3,925 reported on Wednesday.“That means the joint control mechanism of different regions and the strict prevention and control measures have worked,” a spokesman for the National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said at a news conference, according to news agency AP.Among the new infection cases were six more people diagnosed with the virus among the 3,700 passengers on a cruise ship quarantined in Japan, Reuters reported. The crew of the ship includes 136 Indians, who have appealed to the Indian government for help.The new cases are an American passenger in her 70s and five crew members — four Filipinos and a Ukrainian.The infections on Diamond Princess, now 70 in all, represents the single-largest cluster of patients outside of a hospital in China. Many of China’s usually teeming cities have almost become ghost towns during the past two weeks as the government ordered virtual lockdowns, cancelled flights, closed factories and shut schools. Even on Monday, a large number of workplaces and schools will remain closed and many white-collar employees will work from home — a level of restriction that is predicted to hit the Chinese as well as parts of the global economy.Financial markets in many countries have slumped and businesses in India are taking stock of inventories of raw materials and products they import from Chinese manufacturers. On Sunday, a fourth British citizen was confirmed to have been infected by the virus following a chain of contact that demonstrated how virulent the pathogen is. The latest patient is believed to have contracted it from another British citizen while they briefly shared lodging at a ski resort in France. Officials in Shanghai said the they have now confirmed a new transmission route for the virus: as aerosol. “Aerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which causes infection after inhalation, according to medical experts,” Chinese news outlet China Daily quoted Zeng Qun, deputy head of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, as saying.Aerosol transmission can potentially cause someone to be infected if a patient nearby sneezes. Till now, the virus is believed to have spread through direct transmission — through contact with blood or body fluids – or indirect transmissions, which include contact with a surface infected by a patient. As millions of Chinese prepared to go back to work, the public dismay and mistrust of official numbers was evident on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter.“What’s even more frustrating is that these are only the ‘official’ data,” said one user.“We all know we can’t purchase masks anywhere, why are we still going back to work?” said a second. “More than 20,000 doctors and nurses around the country have been sent to Hubei, but why are the numbers still rising?” asked a third.Authorities had told businesses to tack up to 10 extra days on to holidays that had been due to finish at the end of January and some restrictions continued. Among the latest 89 deaths, 81 were in Hubei.An American hospitalised in the provincial capital Wuhan, where the outbreak began, became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim. The Washington Post identified him as Hong Ling, a 53-year old geneticist who studied rare diseases at Berkeley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-813-exceeds-sars-fatalities-in-2003/story-i2uvd6ICH9zwUXVxdCQgAJ.html
