The report did not specify, however, any Indian intelligence operation or communication that may have been intercepted, and used, though it mention a few, such as Iranian and Egyptian messages.Countries spy on each other and this is not the first time US intelligence has been found snooping on India. In 2013, secret documents released by US whistleblower Edward Snowden had shown the National Security Agency of the US had accessed computers of the Indian embassy in Washington DC and the permanent mission to the UN in New York in a massive clandestine operation that had gone on till earlier that year. The joint CIA-BND operation was codenamed “Thesaurus” initially and then “Rubicon”. It ran from the 1970s to 2018 and has been called one of the most audacious of intelligence operations. “It was the intelligence coup of the century,” the CIA report said, according to Washington Post. “Foreign governments were paying good money to the US and West Germany for the privilege of having their most secret communications read by at least two (and possibly as many as five or six) foreign countries.”Crypto, the company, was founded by a man named Boris Hagelin, a Russian who fled first to Sweden and then to the United States. The United States and BND took over its control completely in early 1970s, controlled personnel decisions and and designed the compromised devices that also earned them millions of dollars, which they used to fund other operations.The Post said the CIA monitored the Iranians for years, specially during the hostage crisis, as they used Crypto devices. The US was able to quickly pin the blame for a 1986 bombing on a Berlin disco on Libya and passed Argentinian intelligence to the British during the Falklands War in 1982.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-bnd-made-coding-devices-that-india-other-countries-used-unwittingly/story-H29Db5fcZpY9TkvLjQDKPP.html
11-02-2020||World||No dishonesty, no prima facie case, Mallya tells UK court||The Westminster Magistrates Court that cleared businessman Vijay Mallya’s extradition in 2018 erred on several counts, his legal team told the high court of England and Wales on Tuesday in an appeal, insisting there had been no dishonesty on his part while securing loans.Justice Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing began a three-day appeal hearing against the magistrates court’s ruling that confirmed that there is a case for Mallya to answer in relation to multi crore rupee loans taken from IDBI in 2009.Mallya’s lawyer, Claire Montgomery, challenged several aspects of the magistrates court’s ruling delivered by judge Emma Arbuthnot, arguing that there are “multiple errors” of fact and understanding of documents in her judgement.Tuesday was allocated for Montgomery’s submission, to be responded to by the Crown Prosecution Service lawyer on behalf of India, Mark Summers, on Wednesday. A ruling is expected on Thursday.“There has been no misrepresentation, no concealments, nothing in documents to provide succour to the idea that there was dishonesty on the part of IDBI or Mallya, as alleged by the government if India”, she said.“There is no evidence that the bank lending was intended to fail”, she added, referring to India’s charge of conspiracy on the part of Mallya and sone ifficers of IDBI. Mallya and Indian officials were present in the court.According to Montgomery, the ruling by Arbuthnot is “flawed”, because she allegedly failed to consider all evidence. Moreover, she argued that the lower court’s judgement was replete with misconceptions and misunderstandings of documents submitted by India against Mallya.These, Montgomery submitted, related to figures mentioned in accounts of Kingfisher Airlines submitted as part of loan applications, as well as the admissibility of witness statements in the prosecution case. Arbuthnot “missed things” that would have altered her judgement, she contended.The defence’s argument remains that Mallya’s failure to repay loans was not due to an alleged conspiracy to defraud but due to “business failure and economic misfortune” that affected the aviation industry at the time.“Dr Mallya is not a fly-by-night operator”, Montgomery told the judges.Under the UK’s extradition law, a prima facie case needs to be established before a decision can be taken to extradite the requested person. The high court had allowed the appeal on the ground of prima facie case, but rejected others such as risk to his human rights in the Arthur Road jail, inability to get a fair trial in India, the claim that he is being punished for his political opinions, and that there would be a ‘breach of specialty’ if he were sent to India.Under the India-UK extradition treaty, ‘specialty’ is a rule that the person sought will be tried only for those offences mentioned in the extradition request, and not for others.Montgomery had argued that there would be a ‘breach of specialty’ if he is extradited, because over 40 cases are ongoing against him in India, many with non-bailable warrants. There is no assurance from New Delhi that the other cases would be dropped if he is extradited, she had argued.Mallya has been on bail since his arrest in London in April 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-dishonesty-no-prima-facie-case-mallya-tells-uk-court/story-RPrbAOeGdWZMfGwKdaSHuM.html
11-02-2020||World||It’s official: Donald Trump to start India visit Feb 24, with First lady Melania||US President Donald Trump will reach India February 24 for a two-day visit accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, the White House spokesperson said in a statement Monday. There was no word if a trade deal under discussion now will be ready for announcement during the visit.The final details of the visit appear to have been wrapped up in a phone call, which the White House said, took place between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi past weekend. The two leaders agreed on the call, according to the statement, the “trip will further strengthen the United States-India strategic partnership and highlight the strong and enduring bonds between the American and Indian people”.The White House said President Trump and the first lady will travel to New Delhi and Ahmedabad. Though it did not specify the order in which the visits will take place, people familiar with the planning of the visit said they will start the visit in Ahmedabad on February 24 and reach New Delhi the same night for the second leg of the visit, which takes place on February 25. Though there was no mention of Agra, the American president, who dislikes spending nights away from home, and his wife will stop by for a few hours to visit the Taj Mahal on their way home.There was also no reference in the statement to a public rally that Trump and Modi were supposed to have had addressed in Ahmedabad, mirroring the Howdy Modi event in Houston, Texas the two leaders had jointly attended in September 2019. The White House only said about the Ahmedabad visit that the city “is in Prime Minister Modi’s home state of Gujarat and played such an important role in Mahatma Gandhi’s life and leadership of the Indian independence movement”.A public reception appears to be on the president’s itinerary for Ahmedabad, though. The shape or size — a Howdy Modi-style event or not — is to be determined over the next few days, according to the people cited earlier. Details will be hard to come by for security reasons though, they cautioned, adding, advance teams from the US are on ground already.The visit, which was first reported by Hindustan Times in January, will be the first by President Trump to India and will cap efforts that started with India inviting the US president to attend the 2018 Republic Day parade as chief guest. The White House had begged off then citing scheduling issues.No details were available yet of officials who will accompany the president and the first lady and their agenda. There was no word in the statement, for instance, on one of the most anticipated parts of the visit: a trade deal ending some, and not all, of the outstanding differences bedeviling relations, such as Indian demand for the restoration of eligibility for a preferential duty-free trade regime withdrawn in the summer of 2019, and US push for more market access for its manufacturers of medical devices and dairy producers.Talks are under way and the two sides have “ironed out” most of their outstanding differences, according to the people cite earlier, and a deal may be ready for announcement during the visit.Some defence deals are also expected to be announced such as Indian request from more Apache helicopters and P8 maritime surveillance aircraft, together worth an estimated $3 billion.The Trump Organization, the family business the president has vowed to separate from the White House, has its largest overseas operations in India, according to The Washington Post. The Trump Organization has announced that it will be not expand overseas during the president’s tenure to avoid conflicts of interest.Earlier US presidential visits:January, 2015: President Barack Obama became the first US president to visit India twice while still in office, and the first US president to attend the January 26 Republic Day parade as chief guest. He had chewed a Nicorette gum probably the entire time, as many may remember, to curb his urge to smoke.November, 2010: President Obama travelled to India first with First Lady Michelle Obama fresh from a “shellacking” in a mid-term election in which his party lost control of the House of Representatives. He addressed parliament in New Delhi and got pulled to the dance floor at an event with the first lady in Mumbai.March, 2006: President George W Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a nuclear deal that ended India’s nuclear isolation, enabled it to acquire technology and material for civilian nuclear energy generation while retaining its nuclear weapons out of public sight and inspection. March 2000: But the foundation of that deal may have been laid six years before when President Bill Clinton visited India, ending a chill in relations — accompanied by US sanctions — that had set in in the aftermath of the Pokhran II nuclear tests conducted by the Vajpayee government in 1998.January, 1978: President Jimmy Carter visited New Delhi, where he met President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy and Prime Minister Morarji Desai and addressed Parliament. He also visited a small town outside Gurgaon called Daulatpur Nasirabad, which has since been named Carterpuri.July 1969: President Richard Nixon and met acting Mohammad President Hidayatullah. He would meet Prime Minister Indira Gandhi a more than a year later in 1971 in Washington DC. They went on to share the most acrimonious relationship yet between leaders of the two countries. Nixon had used insulting language for Gandhi in private conversations with this secretary of state Henry Kissinger, which were caught on Oval Office recordings the president had kept and that led eventually to his exit during the Watergate investigations.December 1959: Dwight Eisenhower became the first US president to visit India. Met President Rajendra Prasad and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and addressed a joint sitting of parliament. He also visited Agra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-official-donald-trump-to-start-india-visit-feb-24-with-first-lady-melania/story-ljG8VP8SH05NALEfdBNLuL.html

But for now, it’s only a spark. Our objective remains containment. We call on all countries to use the window of opportunity we have to prevent a bigger fire,” the WHO chief said.At a conference on the outbreak in Gevena held later on Tuesday, he said there were many aspects of the disease that scientists didn’t know about including the infection reservoirs, the transmission dynamics and the period of infectiousness.In China, the government’s top medical advisor on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan echoed Tedros, saying, for example, that it was difficult to predict when the disease will peak.It could be mid-to-late February depending on many variables like control measures, state media quoted him as saying.Zhong is a reputed respiratory expert who is credited by the Chinese government as having discovered the SARS coronavirus in 2003.A new study of 1000 Coronavirus patients led by Zhong has also said that the incubation period for the virus could be 24 days rather than 14 days as previously believed.The study added that fewer than half of the patients in the study showed fever symptoms when they first saw doctors.Besides Zhong, at least three dozen researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools were involved in the study.Echoing the WHO chief, the study too showed that much is unknown about the new virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outbreak-diary-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-1-017-xi-admits-shortcomings-in-disease-control/story-cXPgadbuZhBcACPYgstieP.html
11-02-2020||World||Coronavirus condoned as a ‘very grave’ global threat by WHO||The head of the World Health Organization on Tuesday warned the novel coronavirus was a “very grave threat” for the world as he opened a conference to combat the epidemic.“With 99% of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.Some 400 scientists will review how the virus is transmitted and possible vaccines at the two-day forum.“What matters most is stopping the outbreak and saving lives. With your support, that’s what we can do together,” Tedros said.The virus, first identified in China on December 31, has killed more than 1,000 people, infected over 42,000 and reached some 25 countries.Participants will also discuss the source of the virus, which is thought to have originated in bats and reached humans via another animal such as snakes or pangolins.There is no specific treatment or vaccine against the virus, which can cause respiratory failure.Tedros, who has repeatedly urged countries affected to share their data, called for global “solidarity”.“That is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences. To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity,” he said.“We hope that one of the outcomes of this meeting will be an agreed roadmap for research around which researchers and donors will align,” Tedros said.Several companies and institutes in Australia, China, France, Germany and the United States are racing to develop a vaccine -- a process that normally takes years.Asked whether scientists from Taiwan would be allowed to take part in this week’s Geneva conference, WHO officials said that they would do so but only online -- along with colleagues from other parts of China.While the WHO does not deal with Taiwan directly and only recognises Beijing, Taiwan was often allowed to attend annual assemblies and sideline meetings as an observer.But in recent years it has been frozen out as Beijing takes an increasingly combative stance towards democratic Taiwan, which it considers its own territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-condoned-as-a-very-grave-global-threat-by-who/story-zLbLJbylX8ah1pt4D3WfxO.html

Both of them are currently in a stable condition, Liu Ming, director of the medical administration department of the hospital said.On February 7, the woman was transferred from the central hospital of the city of Shangluo to the designated hospital where a workgroup consisting of medical experts came up with a series of treatment plans and made preparations to ensure the safety of the patient and her baby, according to Liu.Two obstetricians, two anesthesiologists, a midwife, three neonatologists and two nurses participated in the cesarean section.On Wednesday, a 30-hour-old infant born in a Wuhan hospital became the youngest person to catch the virus.CCTV reported the infected baby may be a case of “vertical transmission,” referring to infections passed from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or right after.On February 3, the news agency reported that a baby born in January to an infected mother had tested negative.The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly.The death toll in China’s novel coronavirus outbreak has gone up to 1,016 with 108 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province while the confirmed cases of infection have soared to 42,638, Chinese health officials said on Tuesday.Outside China, there have been more than 350 infections reported in almost 30 places with two deaths, one in the Philippines and the other in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-infected-mother-gives-birth-to-a-healthy-baby/story-6mdp9G2palIKKGWriQfMFK.html
11-02-2020||World||Xi warned officials that efforts to stop virus could hurt economy: Report||Chinese President Xi Jinping warned top officials last week that efforts to contain the new coronavirus had gone too far, threatening the country’s economy, sources told Reuters, days before Beijing rolled out measures to soften the blow.With growth at its slowest in nearly three decades, China’s leaders seem eager to strike a balance between protecting an already-slowing economy and stamping out an epidemic that has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000.After reviewing reports on the outbreak from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other economic departments, Xi told local officials during a Feb 3 meeting of the Politburo’s Standing Committee that some of the actions taken to contain the virus are harming the economy, said two people familiar with the meeting, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.He urged them to refrain from “more restrictive measures”, the two people said. Local authorities outside Wuhan - where the virus is thought to have first taken hold - have shut down schools and factories, sealed off roads and railways, banned public events and even locked down residential compounds. Xi said some of those steps have not been practical and have sown fear among the public, they said.China’s state council information office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The official Xinhua News Agency, reporting on the Politburo meeting last Monday, called the coronavirus outbreak “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.” It added, without details, that “party committees and governments of all levels were urged to achieve the targets of economic and social development this year.”Since the meeting, China’s central bank has vowed to step up support for the economy and prepared policy tools to offset the damage. The NDRC said at a weekend briefing that it was urging companies and factories to resume work, especially in “key industries” such as food and pharmaceuticals.“In the context of the epidemic and the downward pressure on the economy, it is more important to maintain economic growth,” Pan Gongsheng, vice-governor of China’s central bank, said on Friday.On Monday, Zhejiang province, an economic powerhouse in eastern China, ordered local authorities not to overreact by restricting everyday movement or shutting down “shops of chain stores and convenience stores that sell daily necessities such as vegetables, cooking oil as well as meat, eggs and dairy products,” according to a government release. China has unveiled new tax policies as it tries to reduce the burden on industries hit heavily by the epidemic.Reuters reported this month that policymakers in China are preparing measures, including more fiscal spending and interest rate cuts, amid expectations the outbreak will devastate first-quarter growth.Many in China returned to work on Monday after the Lunar New Year holiday was effectively extended for about 10 days, but morning commutes were far less crowded than usual and numerous factories remained shut.The ruling Communist Party’s propaganda department last week ordered state media to focus on “economic recovery”, according to a person with direct knowledge of the order, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.China’s official media has been trying to project calm. In a Monday editorial, the official People’s Daily urged the public to deal with the epidemic with a “positive mood”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-warned-officials-that-efforts-to-stop-virus-could-hurt-economy-report/story-AlBiu3tp5F2kcEwE5uhWbJ.html
11-02-2020||World||Trump associate Roger Stone may face up to 9 years in prison for lying to Congress||Longtime Republican operative Roger Stone deserves to spend as long as nine years in prison for lying to Congress to protect President Donald Trump and other crimes, U.S. prosecutors told a judge.Stone, 67, who was convicted in November, argues he’s been punished by his public trial and loss of professional standing. His age, health, and status as a first-time offender convicted of a non-violent crime don’t warrant a prison sentence, he said in a court filing Monday. He asked for probation.Stone is due to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington on Feb. 20.“Roger Stone obstructed Congress’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, lied under oath and tampered with a witness,” the U.S. said in its filing. “And when his crimes were revealed by the indictment in this case, he displayed contempt for this court and the rule of law.”If the government’s argument is accepted by the judge, Stone’s sentence would be the longest of those sent to prison as a result of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian meddling. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is serving 7 1/2 years for bank fraud and other crimes, and Michael Cohen, the president’s onetime personal lawyer, is doing three years behind bars.Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is also due to be sentenced after pleading guilty to lying to federal agents. He has asked for permission to withdraw that plea and his Feb. 27 sentencing date has been cancelled by the judge.The U.S. case against Stone -- the last person charged in Mueller’s 22-month probe -- included evidence that Trump knew about WikiLeaks’ plans to release emails damaging to his rival, Hillary Clinton. Stone lied to Congress to protect the president, prosecutors said.Stone’s lawyer, Bruce S. Rogow, didn’t return a call seeking comment on the government’s recommendation.The government said in its memorandum that Stone’s sentence should be consistent with federal sentencing guidelines for his crimes, a range of 87 to 108 months.Stone’s sentence should be enhanced because he used threats of violence in his campaign to keep a possible intermediary with WikiLeaks -- comedian and talk show host Randy Credico -- silent about the scheme, telling Credico in writing to “Prepare to die,” prosecutors said. It doesn’t matter whether Stone had a “serious plan” to harm him, the U.S. said.“Credico testified that Stone’s threats concerned him because he was worried that Stone’s words, if repeated in public, might make ‘other people get ideas,’” the government said.But Stone rejected the claim, saying Credico made it clear he didn’t consider anything Stone said as a threat.“Stone’s indecorous conversations with Randy Credico were many things, but here, in the circumstances of this nearly 20-year relationship between eccentric men, where crude language was the norm” weren’t threats of physical harm, his lawyers wrote.“Stone and Credico engaged in an ongoing dialogue in which each used harsh language as a matter of course and it was understood between them that, as Credico put it, it was ‘all bark and no bite,”’ the lawyers said.Federal prosecutors also argued that Stone’s sentence should be enhanced because after he was indicted he posted an image of the judge overseeing the case with a crosshair next to her head and violated a court order by repeatedly posting about the case on social media.Shortly after last year’s verdict, Trump complained about Stone’s conviction on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-associate-roger-stone-may-face-up-to-9-years-in-prison-for-lying-to-congress/story-SeNiTUEP7c6Ji0qgu2WduM.html
11-02-2020||World||US scientists develop realtime interactive map to scan coronavirus cases||Scientists in the US have developed an interactive map of the novel coronavirus spread, that allows users to see the number of cases worldwide, recoveries and deaths, as well as trends in realtime. The map updates every few hours with data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization (WHO), Chinese and other government agencies, including those in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. “Mapping is a powerful tool to tell social, cultural and political phenomena,” said Bo Zhao, an assistant professor at the University of Washington in the US. “As a geographer, and in what people call the ‘post-truth era,’ it’s important to weigh in with data sources to show people how things are happening,” Zhao said. By zooming in on various countries -- such as China -- users can see the number of cases, recoveries and deaths, as well as trends over time, according to the researchers. The outbreak of the coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China in December, has been declared a public health emergency by the WHO. Tens of thousands have been infected, and hundreds have died so far. Zhao recently produced an online atlas to illustrate the global refugee experience. The coronavirus, he said, is another societal issue that people can gain perspective on by seeing it on a map. According to Zhao, while the Chinese government has been criticised for its response to the crisis, and concerns have arisen about its transparency, China’s National Health Commission data is the most accurate available for the country. However, the outbreak is not just affecting China or the city of Wuhan, he added. “It is a global issue, and that’s the perspective users can gain from the map. The numbers on display are important, too, because there are more recoveries than deaths,” Zhao said. “That can give people encouragement,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-scientists-develop-realtime-interactive-map-to-scan-coronavirus-cases/story-Ejb8ykeZ9yObYXHwOtEa2I.html

He will visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib before returning to New York on February 19.In November last year, the UN Chief welcomed the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor between India and Pakistan, saying it paved the way for interfaith harmony and understanding.“We welcome #Pakistan and #India opening #KartarpurCorridor today connecting two key Sikh pilgrimage sites, paving way for interfaith harmony and understanding by facilitating visa-free cross border visits by pilgrims to holy shrines,” spokesperson for the Secretary-General had tweeted.The Kartarpur Corridor links Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan. It was opened by Prime Minister Khan on November 9 in a historic people-to-people initiative between the two countries.The Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib is located across the Ravi river in Pakistan and is about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district of Punjab. According to the agreement between Pakistan and India, 5,000 pilgrims from India can visit the shrine daily and the number can be increased in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-to-visit-gurdwara-kartarpur-sahib-during-trip-to-pakistan/story-RFIAQPXM7lVAsveb77eQUK.html

The White House presented the budget as a blueprint for the president’s policy priorities. It includes funding to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and fight the opioid crisis, but cuts billions of dollars from safety net programs under the banner of welfare reform.The budget is largely a political document that serves as a starting point for negotiations with Congress. With an eye toward reducing debt and deficits, Trump once again proposed steep cuts to housing, environmental, transportation and other programs that have been rejected by lawmakers in past years.“We’re going to keep proposing these types of budgets and hope that at some point Congress will have some sense of fiscal sanity and join us in trying to tackle our debt and deficits,” Russ Vought, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told reporters.Democrats said Trump’s proposal upended his promise in last week’s State of the Union speech to “always protect” the popular Social Security pension plan and the Medicare health plan for seniors.“Americans’ quality, affordable health care will never be safe with President Trump,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.“Everyone knows the latest Trump budget is dead on arrival in Congress,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.Trump’s budget would reduce Medicare spending by lowering drug costs and tightening eligibility requirements for Social Security’s disability program.It also would enact new work requirements for people who get food stamps or use the Medicaid health plan for the poor.Last year Trump signed a two-year budget deal with Congress that increased federal spending on defense and several other domestic programs, adding to a growing government debt. Trump’s proposed military spending adheres to that plan. But his proposed spending for domestic agencies, like the Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, is 6% below the $635 billion outlined in that agreement.Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi, a Republican, said earlier this year that he intends to stick to the spending levels in the congressional budget deal, which would in effect ignore Trump’s proposed domestic spending cuts.GROWTH PROJECTIONSTrump’s proposed budget for fiscal 2021 includes $2 billion to fund further construction on the border wall with Mexico, a project that is especially popular with his political base, and funding for an infrastructure bill that is unlikely to be passed by Democrats and Republicans in Congress.It forecasts $4.6 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years and assumes economic growth at an annual rate of roughly 3% for years to come. Vought said those figures were based on an assumption that Trump’s policies would be enacted.The economic projections are optimistic. The Congressional Budget Office predicts the U.S. economy will grow 2.2% in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, and grow less than 2.0% in future years. The economy grew 2.3% in calendar year 2019. Trump has taken credit for the strength of the U.S. economy thanks in part to tax cuts he championed and Congress passed earlier in his term. The White House proposal slashes spending by $4.4 trillion over 10 years, and aims to reduce the deficit by $4.6 trillion in that time period.While Trump campaigned on a promise of eventually eliminating the country’s huge debt, each year of his plan projects significant budget deficits that actually would add to the $22 trillion debt.This year’s deficit will hover at around $1 trillion and decline next year to $966 billion if his plan were to be enacted. Even so, over 10 years, deficits would add $5.6 trillion to the debt, not counting interest payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-slam-trump-s-4-8-tn-budget-over-cuts-in-affordable-healthcare/story-ZTjTKGHgvL9teANGKVgvBO.html
11-02-2020||World||Equifax data breach: US says Chinese military stole personal data of over 145 million Americans||Four members of the Chinese military have been charged with breaking into the computer networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and stealing the personal information of tens of millions of Americans, the Justice Department said Monday, blaming Beijing for one of the largest hacks in history to target consumer data.The hackers in the 2017 breach stole the personal information of roughly 145 million Americans, collecting names, addresses, Social Security and driver licence numbers and other data stored in the company’s databases. The intrusion damaged the company’s reputation and underscored China’s increasingly aggressive and sophisticated intelligence-gathering methods.“The scale of the theft was staggering,” Attorney General William Barr said Monday in announcing the indictment. “This theft not only caused significant financial damage to Equifax, but invaded the privacy of many millions of Americans, and imposed substantial costs and burdens on them as they have had to take measures to protect against identity theft.”The case is the latest U.S. accusation against Chinese hackers suspected of breaching networks of American corporations, including steel manufacturers, a hotel chain and a health insurer. It comes as the Trump administration has warned against what it sees as the growing political and economic influence of China, and efforts by Beijing to collect data for financial and intelligence purposes and to steal research and innovation.The indictment arrives at a delicate time in relations between Washington and Beijing. Even as President Donald Trump points to a preliminary trade pact with China as evidence of his ability to work with the Communist government, other members of his administration have been warning against cybersecurity and surveillance risks posed by China, especially as the tech giant Huawei seeks to become part of new, high-speed 5G wireless networks across the globe.Experts and U.S. officials say the Equifax theft is consistent with the Chinese government’s interest in accumulating as much information about Americans as possible.The data can be used by China to target U.S. government officials and ordinary citizens, including possible spies, and to find weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be exploited — such as for purposes of blackmail. The FBI has not seen that happen yet in this case, said Deputy Director David Bowdich, though he said it “doesn’t mean it will or will not happen in the future.”“We have to be able to recognize that as a counterintelligence issue, not a cyber issue,” Bill Evanina, the U.S. government’s top counterintelligence official, said of the Equifax case.The four accused hackers are suspected members of the People’s Liberation Army, an arm of the Chinese military that was blamed in 2014 for a series of intrusions into American corporations.Prosecutors say they exploited a software vulnerability to gain access to Equifax’s computers, obtaining log-in credentials that they used to navigate databases and review records. They also took steps to cover their tracks, the indictment says, wiping log files on a daily basis and routing traffic through about three dozen servers in nearly 20 countries.Besides stealing personal information, the hackers also made off with some of the company’s sensitive trade secrets, including database designs, law enforcement officials said.Equifax, headquartered in Atlanta, maintains a massive repository of consumer information that it sells to businesses looking to verify identities or assess creditworthiness. All told, the indictment says, the company holds information on hundreds of millions of people in America and abroad.None of the accused hackers is in U.S. custody. But officials nonetheless hope criminal charges can be a deterrent to foreign hackers and a warning to other countries that American law enforcement has the capability to pinpoint individual culprits. Even so, while China and the U.S. committed in 2015 to halt acts of cyber espionage against each other, the Equifax intrusion and others like it make clear that Beijing has continued its operations.A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return an email seeking comment Monday.The case resembles a 2014 indictment that accused five members of the PLA of hacking into American corporations to steal trade secrets. U.S. authorities also suspect China in the 2015 breach of the federal Office of Personnel Management and of intrusions into the Marriott hotel chain and health insurer Anthem.Such hacks “seem to deliberately cast a wide net” so that Chinese intelligence analysts can get deep insight into the lives of Americans, said Ben Buchanan, a Georgetown University scholar and author of the upcoming book “The Hacker and the State.”“This could be especially useful for counterintelligence purposes, like tracking American spies posted to Beijing,” Buchanan said.Barr, who at an event last week warned of Beijing’s aspirations of economic dominance, said Monday the U.S. has long “witnessed China’s voracious appetite for the personal data of Americans.”“This kind of attack on American industry is of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data,” Barr said.The criminal charges, which include conspiracy to commit computer fraud and conspiracy to commit economic espionage, were filed in federal court in Atlanta.Equifax last year reached a $700 million settlement over the data breach, with the bulk of the funds intended for consumers affected by it.Equifax officials told the Government Accountability Office the company made many mistakes, including having an outdated list of computer systems administrators. The company didn’t notice the intruders targeting its databases for more than six weeks. Hackers exploited a known security vulnerability that Equifax hadn’t fixed.While company stock has recovered, Equifax’s reputation has not fully. The company was dragged in front of Congress no less than four times to explain what happened.The company is about to start paying out claims on its $700 million settlement, of which more claimants have opted in to getting a cash settlement than accept credit counseling. So many claims have been made for the cash that the lawyers suing Equifax and the Federal Trade Commission have warned claimants that the chance of getting the full cash value of the settlement was unlikely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-chinese-military-stole-masses-of-americans-data/story-rGEVahjU5gnR0N1CryuKsJ.html

China’s bosses, they have at this time become a helpless and disadvantaged group. While usually strong, they also hope they can gain understanding and care.”He said the company would be left with around 4,000 employees, adding that about half of the workers being laid off were being asked to leave also because of poor performance.The senior management will take a 20% pay cut over the period, forgo performance bonuses, and have pledged to keep their monthly living expenses below 50,000 yuan, the CEO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-firm-xinchao-cuts-500-workers-in-bid-to-survive-coronavirus/story-ZlO4wyapX19ELrEbR97LKM.html

It’s like I’m trying to process Kobe being gone but my body refuses to accept my Gigi will never come back to me.”Bryant said she felt anger at losing both her husband and daughter and has to remind herself to be strong for the couple’s three surviving daughters.“God I wish they were here and this nightmare would be over,” she said. “Praying for all of the victims of this horrible tragedy. Please continue to pray for all.”The death of Bryant, an 18-time all-star in the National Basketball Association and one of the world’s most admired sports figures, prompted an outpouring of shock and grief from fans and fellow athletes around the globe.The retired Los Angeles Lakers forward had been on his way to a youth basketball tournament in which he was coaching and his daughter and two other girls aboard the luxury chopper were due to compete.Federal investigators have not yet determined a cause for the crash in Calabasas, California, outside Los Angeles, but have said the helicopter was flying in dense fog and that there was no evidence of engine failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kobe-bryant-s-wife-vanessa-wishes-this-nightmare-would-be-over/story-KU4NbxlLDQI6xovTaSGgqM.html

11-02-2020||World||Coronavirus death toll crosses 1000, kills more than a 100 in China in a day||China has recorded a new morbid highest with more than a 100 people dying of the novel coronavirus on Monday and the death toll crossing the 1000-mark. The number of dead from the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) stood at 1016 on the mainland at Monday midnight while as many as 42634 remain infected, health officials said on Tuesday morning.At least two persons have so far died outside the mainland: One each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 319 cases in 24 countries have been reported so far.The toll continued to rise as President Xi Jinping made a rare public appearance in Beijing amid the escalating public health crisis in China.Xi admitted – for the second time in two weeks – that the epidemic had “exposed shortcomings in China’s disease prevention and control system”.The state media released photos of a surgical mask-wearing Xi getting his temperature at a hospital in Beijing designated to treat NCP patients and interacting with medical workers.“Xi called for intensified efforts to reduce the impact, and help for affected businesses to prevent major layoffs,” the state media quoted him as saying.Xi’s second-in-command, Premier Li Keqiang is leading the high-level group overseeing national efforts to contain the epidemic, which has dealt a heavy blow to the Chinese economy and dampened spirits in the very first few weeks of the Chinese new year.The central Chinese province of Hubei continued to be the worst-hit: It reported 2,097 new NCP cases on February 10, with 103 new deaths and 427 recovered. Total infection number in the province increased to 31,728, with 974 dead and 2,222 recovered, officials updated on Monday.The city at the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province’s capital, Wuhan, has restricted the entry and exit of residents from residential buildings, health officials announced.Checkpoints have been set up outside apartment blocks to enhance prevention measures.Officials have claimed that 10.59 people in Wuhan have been checked for the virus.The WHO announced late on Monday that “…an advance team of WHO experts has just arrived in China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, to lay the groundwork for the larger international team”.“Bruce and his colleagues will be working with their Chinese counterparts to make sure we have the right expertise on the team to answer the right questions,” WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva.“In recent days we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the UK today,” Tedros said.“The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now, it’s only a spark. Our objective remains containment. We call on all countries to use the window of opportunity we have to prevent a bigger fire,” the WHO chief said.As many as 168 labs around the world with the right technology to diagnose coronavirus have been identified.The WHO has sent kits to Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, DRC, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Iran, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-crosses-1000-kills-more-than-a-100-in-china-in-a-day/story-EFgqkmfM5KyE2de8d0gUON.html

11-02-2020||World||Donald Trump expects coronavirus crisis to ‘go away’ in April||US President Donald Trump said Monday he expected the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 900 people to disappear in April due to hotter weather.“The virus... typically that will go away in April,” he told reporters at the White House, adding: “The heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus.”The SARS-like pathogen has infected 40,000 people since its emergence in China late last year, while the United States has seen 12 confirmed cases of varying severity.Trump praised China -- and its leader Xi Jinping -- for the Asian giant’s efforts in containing the spread.“(I) had a long talk with President Xi... two nights ago,” Trump said.“He feels very confident... (that) during the month of April, the heat, generally speaking, kills this type of virus. That would be a good thing.” For reasons that aren’t fully understood, flu-like viruses tend to thrive in colder, dryer seasons and the new coronavirus could follow suit -- putting a brake on the outbreak with the arrival of milder weather.But Trump’s prognosis is at odds with top US health officials who have cautioned against commenting on the trajectory of the epidemic.“The issue is, we don’t know,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters Friday. “And any kind of prediction would be ill-advised because we really have so many unknowns,” he added.He said that in the “best scenario” the Chinese would contain the outbreak and there would be a stop to its international spread.But he added that China could fail to control the outbreak or, even if it were successful, the virus could spread to a country without the resources to trace contacts and isolate new cases.A January 31 paper in British medical journal The Lancet warned that, even if the epidemic begins to recede at its epicenter in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in April, it could still grow globally into the second half of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-expects-coronavirus-crisis-to-go-away-in-april/story-UtGpWuDDhaHJJ8YihamZeN.html
11-02-2020||World||Advance team of WHO experts arrives in China to probe coronavirus||An advance team of World Health Organization medical experts arrived in China on Monday to help investigate the coronavirus outbreak, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.Tedros, who met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, returned with an agreement on sending an international mission. It took nearly two weeks to get the green light from the Chinese government on the team, led by Canadian emergency expert Dr. Bruce Aylward.“Bruce and his colleagues will be working with their Chinese counterparts to make sure we have the right expertise on the team to answer the right questions,” Tedros told a news conference.“We hope the rest of the team will join them as soon as possible. The team could range between 10 and 15,” he said, giving no details on their identities.There have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported in China and 909 deaths, he said.Tedros voiced concern at limited incidents, reported by European authorities at the weekend, of person-to-person spread of the virus by people with no history of travel to China.“In recent days, we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the United Kingdom today,” he said.“The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now it’s only a spark. Our objective remains containment.”Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergencies expert, asked about an international business meeting held at a Singapore hotel on Jan 20-22, said it did not appear to have spread the virus widely.“No, I think it is way too early and much more of an exaggeration to consider the Singapore conference event a ‘super-spreading event’,” Ryan said.There are about 40 confirmed cases in Singapore, including 21 associated with import from China and 19 locally acquired with no history of travel, he said.“The Singapore conference cluster has 12 cases associated with it. Those 5 in France, the 3 in Singapore itself, and then (South) Korea, Malaysia and the United Kingdom,” Ryan added, noting that those figures were in the single digits.“So are we not dealing here with a super-spreading event, people are comparing it to the Amoy Gardens or to the Metropole hotel,” he said, referring to the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003.Tedros urged countries to take public health measures to help “prevent a bigger fire”, adding: “This is a message for the whole world. This is a common enemy that we can only defeat if we do it in unison.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/advance-team-of-who-experts-arrives-in-china-to-probe-coronavirus/story-Oqm1g42oefnWTYcKleWm3I.html
11-02-2020||World||Ireland PM Leo Varadkar set to fade as Sinn Fein bids for power||The chances of Ireland Prime Minister Leo Varadkar heading the next government receded on Monday as Sinn Fein – long considered the political wing of the Irish Republic Army – won the largest of the first-preference votes following the February 8 election.The left-wing Sinn Fein, which shares power in Northern Ireland, has upset calculations with its remarkable performance in Ireland, even though it fielded only 42 candidates. The results so far point to a coalition government with an influential role for Sinn Fein.Varadkar’s Fine Gael party ended third with 21 per cent of the first-preference votes, behind 22 per cent for Fianna Fail and 24.5 per cent for Sinn Fein. The final results will be declared after the second and third preference votes are counted.An upbeat Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Féin president, said: “This vote for Sinn Féin is for Sinn Féin to be in government, for Sinn Féin to make a difference, for Sinn Féin to be tested, for Sinn Féin to deliver”.“There are very serious issues facing our society and we have a duty and feel that responsibility very keenly to deliver solutions. We want to talk to anyone who is interested in delivering a programme for government, that is about getting to grips with the housing crisis and solving it, getting to grips with the crisis in health and giving families and workers a break and giving a new lease of life to government”.Seeking reunification of Ireland and Northern Ireland (part of UK), Sinn Fein was controversially linked to IRA during the violent phase that ended with the signing of the Good Friday agreement in 1998.The Dublin-based McDonald does not have the IRA baggage, making her more acceptable in a country wracked by anger, particularly among the young, over rising rents, low housing stock and issues facing the health system.Now the third pole in Ireland politics, Sinn Fein remains toxic for Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, but post-election compulsions may lead to new linkages in coalition negotiations that are expected to last days, if not weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-pm-leo-varadkar-set-to-fade-as-sinn-fein-bids-for-power/story-NJdZCCuyfenym4BjyoLmjO.html

They will attract new businesses, spreading jobs, investment and opportunity to towns and cities up and down the country”.“This is all part of our mission as an open, outward-looking country, championing global free trade with vibrant Freeports that work for all of the UK”.Benefits of the freeports include goods brought in not attracting tariffs until they leave the freeport and enter the domestic market; no duty is payable if the goods are re-exported; when raw materials are imported and processed into a final good, duties are only paid on the final good.Freeports could be located inland as well as adjacent to ports, which can reduce relocation or investment costs for existing manufacturing sites near ports. A full customs declaration would also not be required to move goods into a Freeport, making it easier to import goods.Liz Truss, International Trade secretary, said: “We are taking back control of our trade policy, and opening every corner of the UK to opportunities across the world”.“Freeports will unleash the potential of our historic ports, creating jobs and regenerating communities across the UK. These hubs will also deepen partnerships around the world as we restore our economic and political independence”.After a 10-week consultation, the government will invite sea, air and rail ports to bid for freeport status on a competitive basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-freeports-coming-up-in-post-brexit-uk/story-bMvlPWYzMwEu8zut2GPRcO.html
11-02-2020||World||‘Biggest challenge’ was to collect data about Indians living in Hubei: Indian envoy on coronavirus||India’s efforts to evacuate its citizens from the coronavirus-hit Hubei province and its capital Wuhan were a logistical nightmare since the entire operation had to be done in a region sealed from all sides, Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri said on Monday.As the news of the outbreak began emerging in the middle of January, the Indian Embassy stepped up efforts to locate hundreds of Indians, mainly students, residing hundreds of kilometres apart in Hubei province and Wuhan - the epicentre of the virus outbreak, Misri said.Misri said the “biggest challenge” was to collect data about Indians living in Hubei.India issued its first travel advisory on January 17 which was followed by more stringent measures including cancellation of visas for Chinese and foreigners travelled to China as the virus grew more virulent.Misri said the embassy had to first locate the Indian citizens in Hubei province, establish contacts with them, receive their consent for a 14-day quarantine, followed by the most difficult part of the operation - to get approvals from China’s central, provincial and local governments as the city and province were locked down from January 23.Ahead of the first Air India flight on February 1, the mission sent two of its diplomats - Deepak Padma Kumar and M Balakrishnan - to Wuhan by road through Changsha city despite travel bans and fears of the virus.Then a large number of buses were hired, permits procured in areas under lock down to transport them to the airport which turned out to be a massive exercise. The airport was closed from January 23 besides all local transportation.The operations to get permission to operate buses and send them to 40 odd locations to pick up waiting Indians were coordinated by Acquino Vimal, the deputy ambassador, and Priyanka Sohoni, First Secretary (Political) in the mission.In some areas, roads were dug up to prevent people’s movement and entire operation to pick up the students on both the days had to be conducted from the control room in the embassy hundreds of miles away, Misri said.But 10 Indians could not make it to the flight as they were not allowed by the Chinese immigration officials to board the plane because they had high body temperatures.Air India’s B747 aircraft made two flights to Wuhan city - the ground zero of the coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 900 people, infected 40,000 others and spread to 25 countries, including India, the US and the UK.In the first flight, 324 Indians were evacuated and another 323 Indians and seven Maldivian citizens were flown back in the second flight.Sri Lanka and Bangladesh also evacuated their citizens through special flights. Several hundred Pakistani students are held up still in the virus-hit areas as their government has declined to evacuate them ignoring their pleas.Misri said that about 80 Indians were still in Hubei and the embassy is in touch with them through e-mail, social media and phone calls.The embassy has received 28,000 emails and receives about 100 calls a day from Indians who were stranded in Wuhan and Hubei province and has been coordinating with the Chinese officials to ensure proper supplies to them.About chances of their evacuation, Misri said the embassy is exploring all avenues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evacuation-of-indians-from-coronavirus-hit-wuhan-a-logistical-nightmare-says-indian-envoy/story-yKHs9w2ERrG01uWmYu2FSL.html
