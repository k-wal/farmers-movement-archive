The suspect was identified as Roshan Pandey, a native of Bihar. More than 20 cases are registered against the suspect in several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, police said, adding that he was living in Burari area of Delhi for the last one year. According to police, Vikesh Kumar Gupta, a native of Ranchi in Jharkhand who lives in a rented accommodation in Jharsa village in Gurugram, had filed a complaint at Sadar police station against the suspect last month. Gupta, who works at a private bank in Gurugram, said that he met the suspect through his colleague in January, said police. In his complaint, Gupta said that the suspect identified himself as Roshan Pandey, working as a joint secretary in the Union ministry of home affairs, and promised him to get him and his brother-in-law a job in the army and the DRDO through an IAS quota and took over ₹85,000 from him. Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that Gupta trusted the suspect as he had uploaded his picture on WhatsApp with a government ID card. “To gain his trust, the suspect had taken all relevant documents from Gupta and used to share the latest development, but never got him a job,” he said.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday said that the air quality over Delhi-NCR is likely to improve marginally in the next three days, but will remain in the ‘very poor’ category as mostly calm or slow winds during night are unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants. “Winds are likely to be relatively strong on Monday and Tuesday. The air quality is likely to remain in very poor category on both days,” the IMD said. According to the data shared by the air monitoring stations in Gurugram, an AQI of 380 was recorded at Vikas Sadan, Sector 51 station recorded an AQI of 349, while AQI readings at Teri Gram and Gwal Pahari were 367 and 338, respectively.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.On Saturday, the IMD recorded maximum and minimum temperatures for the city at 24.7°C and 10.8°C. A day earlier, the maximum temperature was 26°C while minimum was 10°C. Experts said that a dip in temperature complicates the situation in urban areas as high-rises in cities like Gurugram not only restrict the passage of air but the concrete also gets cold, which has a negative impact on dispersal of pollutants. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert, said, “There is strong thermal inversion and since concrete takes a lot of time to get warm, the dispersal of pollutants gets delayed in comparison to dispersion in open areas of rural belts. Smog formation will make it worse.”. Meanwhile, officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said that they are keeping a close watch on the situation and their teams are checking construction sites and industrial areas regularly. “Following strict actions in the last two days, there was better compliance to the pollution norms at construction sites and industrial areas today,” said Kuldip Singh, regional officer (north), HSPCB. Sandeep Singh, another HSPCB officer, said that they are working in close coordination with other government agencies in Gurugram to check violations. The town and country planning department said that its teams are also visiting private colonies and sensitising the contractors and plot owners to follow norms. “Enforcement is strict and people are taking precautions due to regular checks,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugrams-air-quality-in-very-poor-zone-for-fourth-consecutive-day-101638036780189.html

First, we apprehended two persons and then after grilling them nabbed the medical practitioner and a medical representative of Dr. Reddy's," he said. The doctor had provided his godown to store the CBCS while the medical representative had been coordinating the entire process, he said. The godown was an unlicensed one, the official added. Probe revealed that the contraband was supplied by 'Ram Medical Hall' in Barrackpore to a non-existent firm in the city's Mahisbathan (Dhapa) area, he said. Dhaka had earlier this year sought India's help in checking the smuggling of Myanmar origin `Yaba' tablets and Indian-made Codeine based syrups. While the syrup is legally manufactured in India, it is illegally smuggled to feed those prefer this cheap high in neighbouring Bangladesh. Liquor is not freely available in Bangladesh because of a partial prohibition. Tipplers consequently seek a high through various means. A bottle of Phensedyl, a popular cough remedy in India which costs less than ₹100 sells for as much as Taka 1,000 in Bangladesh in the illegal market, according to officials monitoring drug trafficking. Bangladesh Border Guards had at one time sought a ban on such medicines being imposed by India. However, as these are popular medical remedies in the country a blanket ban has not been possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/six-arrested-including-doctor-for-codeine-smuggling-to-bangladesh-101638035542015.html

Singh was addressing 30,000 BJP booth presidents, in Jaunpur, on Saturday, in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, UP BJP secretary organisation Sunil Bansal, state president Swatantra Dev Singh, and several other leaders. Singh said, “We consider farmers as God. The BJP government has always been sympathetic towards farmers. There was a movement against the three laws. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a decision to withdraw them. The day the Parliament session begins, the three farm laws will be withdrawn.” Recalling the terror attack on Mumbai on November 26, 2008, Singh accused the then Congress government of not taking effective action against terrorism to eliminate it. He said that even senior Congress leader Manish Tiwari accepted it in his book. He said that ever since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014, terrorism was being tackled regularly and effectively. After the terror incidents in Uri and Pulwama, by taking strict action against the terrorists, India sent a message to the entire world that it has strength to take action across the border to eliminate terror. India has become a powerful country in the eyes of the world. The entire world listens seriously whenever India speaks as India’s respect has increased across the world. India has been a country that has never occupied an inch of foreign land. Rather, India has given the message of Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam to the whole world from its soil, Singh said and added that “hum kisi ko chhedenge nahin, hame kisi ne chheda, to use chhodenge nahin. If someone captures even an inch piece of our land, the army will not leave it. PM Modi has given a free hand to the Army.” Slamming SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for his claim that the BJP government didn’t give permission for Jewar airport, Singh said, “I had passed the proposal of Jewar Airport in 2001 as chief minister of UP. Yogi ji is completing that work today.” Did anyone ever think that the BrahMos missile will be made inside Uttar Pradesh? But this missile is being made on the soil of Uttar Pradesh, Singh said. Slamming SP chief for his statement on Jinnah, Singh said, “What was the need to take out Jinnah. From which bottle, did you take out Jinnah?”Singh accused the opposition parties of indulging in politics of division just for the sake of power. BJP takes everyone along. Instead of achieving power by dividing society on the basis of caste and creed, he would rather stay away from such power, he added. Taking a jibe at the SP-BSP alliance in 2019, Singh said that Bua and Babua formed an alliance in UP. But that alliance was broken. UP neither needs Bua nor Babua, UP needs Baba once again in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rajnath-in-jaunpur-says-farm-laws-to-be-taken-back-the-day-parliament-convenes-101638035939127.html

Letters are being issued to hotels in the city of the Taj to keep a watch on visitors coming from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong. “Although the new cases of Covid-19 are at a minimal level in Uttar Pradesh, yet there are threats being posed globally due to the new Sars-CoV-2 variant, Omicron, traced in South Africa and formally known as B.1.1.529. It has been designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation,” said Dr AK Srivastava, chief medical officer (CMO), Agra.It was Agra which recorded the first case of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh on March 2, 2020. The city, with three monuments listed as world heritage structures in the Unesco list, attracts many tourists. Although international flights are yet to operate but Agra administration and health officials are not ready to take chances. “With a global threat looming large with the tracing of the new variant, precautionary steps are being mooted. Letters are being written to hotels in Agra that information be provided about any visitor coming from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong. There is a need for intense monitoring of such guests till they stay here in Agra,” the CMO said. “In a meeting, Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh has directed to closely monitor those coming from these nations, besides monitoring those coming in their contact. We are also to keep an eye on those who have recently travelled to these nations or are holding passports of these nations. They are being asked to inform the health department immediately,” he said. Meanwhile, the health authorities are reviewing health infrastructure in rural areas because the load of hospitalisation during the second wave had strained urban facilities. As such, the idea is to strengthen hospitals at community health centres in the rural belt, especially where oxygen plants have been set up and beds are available so that the load on city hospitals is lightened.“The health infrastructure at the District Hospital and SN Medical College in Agra is being updated. Mock drills are being conducted and oxygen plants are being checked for larger output if required.

The annual religious fair begins on January 14/15 (Makar Sankranti) and will conclude on March 1 (Mahashivratri).Following strict instructions of UP CM, preparations have begun in earnest for the next edition of the fair. Besides the Covid-19 protocol like social distancing and mandatory wearing of face masks, the CM’s orders would be enforced stringently, they added.Although the number of coronavirus-positive cases have substantially come down in the district as well as in the state, the CM is not willing to take any chances and therefore, has issued clear instructions in this regard, said a senior official aware of the development.“In the meeting, the CM made it very clear that only those devotees, who have taken both doses of the coronavirus vaccines will be allowed to enter the Magh Mela area. Besides, we have been told to follow all the protocols that were followed last year and not to take things lightly, and restrict the mela area,” said Sant Kumar Srivastava, SDM, Prayagraj Mela Pradhikaran. “In case a devotee has taken just the first dose of the vaccine, the second dose will be administered in the mela area itself,” said the official. Besides, random reserve transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen tests will also be conducted in all sectors of the Magh Mela, he added.Every kalpwasi or seer wishing to camp in the tent city for the month-long period of the fair will have to present proof of being fully vaccinated. Moreover, the Kalpwasis would be requested to minimise the number of visitors in their camps too. No one without a face mask would be allowed in the mela area, officials said.In the November 25 meeting with the CM, the Prayagraj administration led by the district magistrate, Prayagraj, Sanjay Kumar Khatri, made a detailed presentation regarding organising Magh Mela-2022. According to officials, the district administration had prepared a proposal requiring funds around ₹67 crore for the fair but the state government has sanctioned around ₹59 crore only for it. Reminding officials in the meeting that the threat of the pandemic was not yet over, the CM had also ordered that Covid-19 vaccination and testing centres be set up for the fair as a top priority.In Magh Mela 2021, the state government had made a three-day old RT-PCR report mandatory for every Kalpwasi and seer which was an effective deterrent in checking spread of the pandemic. In 2022, Kalpwas would commence on January 17 (Paush Purnima) and conclude on February 16 (Maghi Purnima). This will minimise the number of days of stay at the Magh Mela area. This year, Paush Purnima was on January 28 and Maghi Purnima on February 27, thus the stay had stretched far over one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/magh-mela-2022-only-fully-vaccinated-pilgrims-to-be-allowed-to-attend-camp-at-fair-101638034741301.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||Cases against kin cannot be ground for revoking arms licence: Bombay High Court||Observing that an arms licence cannot be revoked only on the ground of offences registered against the licence holder’s family members, the Bombay high court turned down the Daman district magistrate’s order, revoking the arms licence of Jignesh Patile, son of former Member of Parliament Dayabhai Patel. The district magistrate had on October 8, 2018 revoked the arms licence granted to Jignesh Patel and directed him to deposit his licensed weapon at Nani Daman police station. He moved high court last year, after the Administrator, Daman and Diu confirmed the order and dismissed his appeal. Advocate HS Venegavkar, who represented the Union Territory, opposed the petition stating that the orders could not be faulted since in the back-drop of the past criminal record of the petitioner and his family, it had become necessary in public interest to cancel the licence. Justice SK Shinde, however, refused to accept the contention. The single judge bench said under section 17(3) of the Arms Act, 1979, the licensing authority can suspend or revoke an arms licence only when it becomes necessary for security of the public or for public safety. However, the court said, the licensing authority – the district magistrate - cancelled Jignesh’s licence only on the ground that several offences had been registered against his father and brother. “In fact, there is no material on record to establish necessary connection between the petitioner and his brother and father qua the offences registered against them,” said Justice Shinde, adding that the registration of offences against family members of the licensee that by itself was not sufficient to revoke the licence of the petitioner. Regarding the criminal cases registered against Jignesh Patel, the court noted that the last criminal case was registered against him way back in 2010 and his arms licence had been renewed from time to time thereafter. “Neither the District Magistrate nor the Appellate Authority has taken into consideration provisions of Section 17 of the Arms Act, 1959 at all,” the court concluded and turned down the orders revoking Jignesh Patel’s arms licence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cases-against-kin-cannot-be-ground-for-revoking-arms-licence-bombay-high-court-101638034621708.html
27-11-2021||Noida||Greater Noida hospital lab readied for conducting Zika virus tests||The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida on Saturday said its Molecular Diagnostics and Research Laboratory (MDRL) has started conducting tests for Zika virus. The lab has been conducting Covid-19 tests since April last year. Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS, said a team of four members, under the guidance of Dr Vivek Gupta (in-charge of laboratory and principal investigator of Virus Research and Diagnostics Laboratory (VRDL), tested the kits provided for testing Zika virus. “The kits for Zika virus testing have been provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The lab has seven RT-PCR and five automated RNA extraction systems for conducting both Covid-19 and Zika virus tests. There is a separate testing facility for the two viruses in the same lab,” he said. Dr Vivek Gupta said the laboratory staff have been trained for conducting tests for both viruses. “The lab will function 24X7 and diagnose patients for free. The hospital will also treat patients suffering from Zika virus,” he said. Zika virus disease is caused by a virus transmitted primarily by the Aedes mosquitoes. Its symptoms are generally mild, lasting for about 2-7 days, and include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache. The WHO website states that during pregnancy, this virus can cause congenital abnormalities in the developing foetus and newborn. Dr Vivek Gupta said if a patient suffers from such symptoms, he/she first gets tested for dengue and chikungunya. “If these test reports come negative, then the patient is tested for Zika virus,” he said adding that the test reports come in 8-12 hours. Dr Sunil Kumar, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said no case of Zika virus has been reported in the district. “Earlier this month, some cases were reported in Kanpur; the cases are decreasing there too. I have not received information about this lab from GIMS. This may be a preparatory measure in case Zika virus cases emerge here,” he said. In a press statement, the GIMS also said it has been selected as a regional resource training centre for strengthening of first referral units (FRU) from Uttar Pradesh. The programme is running under the Uttar Pradesh Technical Support Unit (UP-TSU) since 2017 and is funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The aim, through this programme, is to strengthen the maternal and child health services to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-hospital-lab-readied-for-conducting-zika-virus-tests-101638034620329.html
27-11-2021||Noida||Most pollution complaints in Noida, Gzb go unresolved amid air hazard||Authorities responsible for managing the pollution levels in both Noida and Ghaziabad have been receiving a number of complaints related to air pollution this season as the two cities are reeling under ‘very poor’ air for days together. However, authorities have been able to solve less than half the complaints registered this year, shows records available with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). According to CPCB records, around 32% of the complaints registered by CPCB teams and the general public were resolved while about 38% of the complaints related to hotspots and areas other than hotspots, where CPCB teams paid a visit and found alleged violation of pollution norms, were resolved. Data available with the CPCB shows that its teams lodged 105 complaints in ‘hotspots’ and ‘other than hotspot areas’ between October 20 and November 25, of which only 40 complaints were resolved till November 25. With regard to complaints lodged by the CPCB teams and the general public in Delhi-NCR, 258 such complaints were registered, of which only 83 were resolved between October 15 and November 25. The complaints reported in Uttar Pradesh are mostly from NCR areas of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida and involves different agencies in the three cities. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said the complaints received this season are mostly related to burning of waste and road dust. “We are regularly resolving the complaints; the complaint registered against different agencies are immediately forwarded to the respective departments. They have been asked to update the records once the complaints are resolved. There is also regular monitoring of complaints by the district administration,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. In Noida, UPPCB officials said that they are taking up the complaints on priority basis, which go through different levels of monitoring up to the additional chief secretary level. “The complaints need to be resolved within 48 to 72 hours. Sometimes, we receive complaints which are not directly related to air pollution, such as instances of traffic jams and use of pressure horns in vehicles. Still, efforts are taken up for resolution of the complaints through different agencies. In Noida, there were many pending complaints; the respective agencies were asked to address them at the earliest,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida. Environmentalists said air pollution levels have mostly been in the “severe” to “very poor” category this season. “It is important to resolve the complaints on a priority basis given the high levels of air pollution. Speedy resolution will help in reducing the pollution and curbing the source. Instances of garbage burning and road dust are regular features in the three cities and strict ground level enforcement is needed,” said Akash Vashishtha, an environmentalist from Ghaziabad. On Saturday, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida ended up with ‘very poor’ air with AQI readings of 368, 322 and 381 respectively. A forecast by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) indicated that the air quality is likely to remain same on Sunday. “Local surface winds are likely to increase moderately on 29th and 30th (November) that increases dispersion of pollutants leading to slight improvement but AQI remains in ‘very poor’ category. Low mixing layer height and low winds are preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants. The percentage share of stubble burning related pollutants in Delhi’s PM2.5 is 6%,” said the Safar forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/only-32-of-pollution-related-complaints-resolved-in-noida-ghaziabad-101638034500140.html
27-11-2021||Noida||Noida authority takes measures to curb pollution as ‘very poor’ air plagues city||With the air quality in Noida showing no signs of improvement and hovering in the ‘very poor’ category for quite a number of days, the Noida authority has started taking measures to control pollution in the city. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI of Noida was 381 while Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 352 in the ‘very poor’ category on Saturday. Avinash Tripathi, Noida authority’s officer on special duty (OSD), said the measures listed under the graded response action plan (Grap) have been enforced in the city. “We sprinkle water on total 134.93km of road and also on the plants and trees on the roadside using 77 tankers. Some developers were also fined on Friday for violating construction norms; we collected a fine of ₹3.35 lakh fine from them,” said Tripathi. Tripathi said that the Noida Authority also collected 449.87 tonne of construction and demolition (C&D) waste from different sites and sent it to the C&D processing plant in Sector 80. “We also conduct mechanical sweeping of 243 km of roads on 67 routes in Noida,” he said. On November 17, the Noida authority also inaugurated city’s first anti-smog tower along DND flyway with the aim of mitigating air pollution. The tower was built using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds arranged from the central government’s public sector undertakings (PSUs).Vikrant Tongad, an environmentalist, said the smog towers or outdoor air purifiers may not be effective in open areas. “Outdoor air is dynamic; the moment air is released from air purifier, the detoxified air mixes with the dense air in the surroundings, thus nullifying the overall impact,” he said. Tongad said he visited some areas with a portable air monitoring device on Wednesday and prima facie, found that the air quality index near the anti-smog tower was no better than other parts of the city. “Some effective long-term and short-term measures are needed to check pollution,” said Tongad. Tripathi said the anti-smog tower was set up by a private firm. “There are studies that show these measures (anti-smog tower) do have an impact on air quality. There are four pollution monitoring stations in Noida – Sector 1, Sector 62, Section 116 and Sector 125. Since there is no weather station in the tower’s neighbourhood, we do not have the readings of the air quality around it,” he said. Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77 and a member of Progressive Community Foundation (PCF), said he filed an RTI and got a response from CPCB on Friday that it received 114 pollution related complaints from Noida in the last four years. “People had complained to the CPCB on Sameer App, Twitter, and through other medium. This shows the board is serious about the pollution problem in Noida,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-takes-measures-to-curb-pollution-as-very-poor-air-plagues-city-101638034498912.html

27-11-2021||Delhi||Nine arrested for oxygen cylinder fraud during Delhi’s fourth Covid wave||New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Saturday said they have arrested nine people, from West Bengal and Bihar, for allegedly cheating several Delhi residents to the tune of over ₹1 crore after promising to deliver oxygen cylinders when the city was battling the fourth wave of Covid-19 infections.Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) KPS Malhotra said the nine arrested include two men who allegedly ran the gang’s operation and seven others who had allegedly shared their bank account details to collect the money deposited by the victims. Police said the gang also hired telecallers to make their racket seem genuine to potential victims.Police had registered the case after a city resident, Vinod Kumar, informed police that he had deposited ₹25,000 to the gang’s account to procure an oxygen cylinder for his wife who had contracted Covid-19.DCP Malhotra said that the gang switched off their contact number after Kumar paid the money. “He had filed a complaint. Unfortunately, his wife also passed away because of the infection. We had registered a case and started tracking the money trail,” he said.Earlier this year, the national Capital endured a punishing fourth wave of Covid-19 infections between April and May that left health infrastructure overrun, overwhelmed medical workers, and led to crematoriums running out of space. Over 760,000 people were infected in that period, and over 13,000 died of the infection between April and May alone.When the city was reporting over 20,000 cases daily and hospital beds were full, citizens had started posting SOS messages for oxygen cylinders.Delhi police said that many fraudsters from across the country took advantage of the crisis and circulated their phone numbers and bank account details while promising to deliver oxygen cylinders. DCP Malhotra said that the two alleged leaders of the gang -- PhD student Pawan alias Pravin Kumar (26), and an MCA degree holder Kamal Kant Sinha (31), both residents of Bihar’s Nalanda -- allegedly took control of the bank accounts of different people after paying them a small fee. Simultaneously, police said, they allegedly shared the bank account details on social media and asked people to deposit money for home delivery of oxygen cylinders.Police suspect the two men are involved in other types of cyber fraud too and are probing the identity of their gang members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nine-arrested-for-oxygen-cylinder-fraud-during-delhi-s-fourth-covid-wave-101638034199812.html
27-11-2021||Lucknow||District committee headed by Smriti Irani passes resolution hailing PM Modi in Sonia Gandhi’s Rae Bareli||Nearly a month after she hurled the “Rae Bareli has two MPs” barb at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Union minister and Amethi MP Smriti Irani arrived in Rae Bareli to chair a meeting of the District Development and Coordination Monitoring Committee which passed a resolution hailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and thanking him for a variety of reasons. Sonia Gandhi, who was replaced as the head of the government panel in July, is the co-chairperson of the committee, whose resolution praising Modi was shared by Smriti Irani after the meeting, the first in nearly three years. This is the first time since replacing Sonia Gandhi to the government panel that is reconstituted after each Lok Sabha election that Smriti Irani chaired the committee meeting in Rae Bareli which till now was presided by Gandhi, the Lok Sabha MP since 2004. “DISHA Rae Bareli passed a resolution thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Covid vaccination, Rae Bareli AIIMS, free ration, piped water in rural areas and Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) dispensary,” Smriti Irani tweeted on Saturday. “Though as per protocol and convention, the Lok Sabha MP usually chairs the DISHA meeting, but since a part of Salon assembly segment of Rae Bareli is part of Amethi Lok Sabha constituency, hence technically, Smriti Irani too could head the government panel in Rae Bareli,” an official said. The official explained that government panel in Rae Bareli hadn’t met for around three years. Since its win in Amethi in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP has been eyeing Rae Bareli where its political clout has been growing. Only a couple of days back, rebel Congress lawmaker Aditi Singh from Rae Bareli (Sadar) assembly segment joined the BJP and expressed her faith in the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Five assembly segments make up Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat. The Congress could win just two of these assembly seats in the 2017 UP assembly polls. Since then, the MLA from one of them has now joined the BJP and the other Congress MLA from Harchandpur, Rakesh Pratap Singh has been openly praising the BJP leadership. Rakesh’s brother Dinesh Pratap Singh, a former Sonia aide and local MLC, had joined the party ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and contested against the Congress chief. Though he lost, Dinesh subsequently played a part in the Congress defeat in the region in the panchayat polls earlier this year. In October, during a visit to Salon, Smriti Irani had said that Rae Bareli had two Lok Sabha MPs. “One of them is here in front of you and can confidently state knowledge of each and every problem you face but what about your other MP?” she had asked. Before that she had said, “Amethi, BJP would take Rae Bareli too, if harassment of BJP workers continued.” “Since becoming Amethi MP, Smriti has missed no opportunity to connect with those areas of Rae Bareli that are part of Amethi,” a party leader admitted and said that BJP was developing constituencies where it had lost. Congress spokesman Zishan Haider on Saturday said, “As a political party, our leaders have always maintained a certain dignity. They have never stooped to a level that is being displayed these days. Our leaders are beyond such petty politics. The Congress has been in power for decades and will again return to power by the blessings of the people. As for a government panel praising Prime Minister, well, that isn’t surprising anymore.” Earlier in the day, Smriti Irani inaugurated the ESI dispensary and branch office at Pragati Puram, Rae Bareli, a move that is expected to benefit 60,000 ESI beneficiaries of Rae Bareli. “This dispensary will help many get better facilities,” she said adding that several workers would also be able to get cash benefits from the ESIC branch office that so far was operating from a rented building since 1978. The new 933 square metre ESI campus has been built at a cost of Rs. 2.27 crore. Union minister of state for labour and employment and petroleum and natural gas Rameshwar Teli and Rae Bareli municipality chairperson Purnima Shrivastava were also present. Irani also handed over monthly pension approval letters to the beneficiaries under the ‘Covid-19 Relief Scheme’, a measure by ESIC towards strengthening financial condition of the families affected by the pandemic. Teli said that through the Atal Bimit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana, if an insured person loses job, they are eligible for relief of 50% of the average daily earnings during the last four contribution periods. “The largest share of workers is of unorganised workers and for the first time under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi a National Database has been prepared for the unorganized workers,” Teli said while appealing to people to get registered on the ‘e-shram’ portal at the earliest. One gets an insurance cover of ₹2 lakh after registration and around 9.5 crore people have been registered on this portal so far. ESI is operational in 41 districts of UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/district-committee-headed-by-smriti-irani-passes-resolution-hailing-pm-modi-in-sonia-gandhi-s-rae-bareli-101638034198758.html
27-11-2021||Lucknow||Yogi attacks opposition, exhorts people not to fall for their promises||Launching a scathing attack on opposition parties, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday exhorted people to not fall for their promises as they keep changing their statements. He also claimed that there had been no riot, farmer suicides, or deaths due to starvation after BJP came to power in the state.The CM said this while laying the foundation stone of an ethanol plant, to be set up on 65.61 acres of land at Balrampur Sugar Mills Complex, in Gonda’s Maijapur, at a cost of ₹450 crore.The CM once again raked up Akhilesh’s ‘Jinnah’ comment to say that those who believed in the founder of Pakistan engaged in attacking faith and “instigate riots” in their tenure. “Before 2017, the governments used to take back cases against those who attacked the Ramjanam Bhoomi in Ayodhya. These people are rioters and followers of Jinnah and they won’t be able to understand the sweetness of sugarcane. Since the BJP government came to power in the state, festivals were celebrated peacefully. This is the picture of new Uttar Pradesh and we made the state riot-free as not even a single riot has taken place in the last 4 years. BJP killed the terrorists after entering into their den,” the chief minister said.In 2013, the then SP-ruled UP government had issued an order for withdrawal of cases against Ayodhya serial blast accused as it believed them to be “innocent Muslims” implicated in false cases. The order was stayed by the Allahabad Court.He also warned people of being misled by opposition and claimed that they have dual character and change colour fast.“The Congress, Bua (referring to BSP chief Mayawati) and Babua (referring to Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav) got enough chance to do development but very less work was done,” he said. Speaking about the ethanol plant, Yogi said it was going to be the biggest in Asia once completed.He added that with the setting up of the plant the money that used to go to foreign countries for diesel and petrol will directly reach farmers.“With this farmers will be able to extract diesel and petrol along with sugarcane in their fields and the money which used to go abroad will land in their pockets. When farmers will be happy, prosperity will come. With ethanol plants job opportunities will also be created,” the CM said.He also said better connectivity was required for the plant and investment in the area will open the gate for employment opportunities and business.(with PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-attacks-opposition-exhorts-people-not-to-fall-for-their-promises-101638033844547.html

The complainant alleged that the team was taken to Khan’s office nearby where they were forced to squat and assaulted.Khan, former Congress MLA from the Okhla constituency between 2009 and 2013, has been booked under Indian Penal Code sections related to stopping public servants from doing their duty, using criminal force and hurting them. SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan too confirmed that Khan assaulted the civic staff who were removing illegal banner hoardings. “I have directed the department to file FIR against the former MLA and take legal action against him. I will soon visit the site where the harassment took place. The corporation will remove all the encroachments in the area. I want to appeal to all SDMC officials not to be intimidated by such people and keep working,” Suryan said.A senior SDMC official said police have contacted the corporation and asked the four employees to join investigation. “We will fully cooperate with the police,” he said.Delhi Congress did not respond to requests seeking comment.According to the Delhi Outdoor Advertising Policy, 2017, no advertisement is allowed in residential areas. Further, according to the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property (DPDC) Act, defacement is a punishable offence with imprisonment for up to six months or a fine up to ₹50,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiexcongress-mla-held-after-video-shows-him-beating-up-civic-staff-101638033418604.html

A government official said that the event will be held from 7.30am to 10.30am on the stretch near R C Institute of Technology, Najafgarh, leading towards Mitraon. “A range of activities such as walking, running, cycling, skating, street games, dancing, performing arts, yoga, aerobics and zumba etc. will be organised. This is the second of six Raahgiri days being hosted in Delhi over three months to raise awareness about pollution,” said the official. The previous Raahgiri day was held in Patparganj on November 14 and was inaugurated by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who said that the initiative also helps spread awareness about pollution.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) was 402 in the ‘severe’ category, as per the bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 4pm on Saturday.The Raahgiri event comes even as the sub-committee on the graded response action plan (Grap) has already issued several advisories, including limiting outdoor activities, amid the worsening air quality in the city.The government officials argue that the central idea of ‘Raahgiri day’ is to allow people to experience a street without cars and creating open streets and public spaces for activities that promote public health. Noting that the city’s roads belong to all, Gahlot said that the idea is to give back to pedestrians and cyclists by creating accessible and safe public spaces. “Projects like ‘tactical urbanism’ and the redesigning of Delhi roads are already underway. Areas like Najafgarh still have a village quality to them and the sense of community is very strong,” Gahlot said.Jasmine Shah, DDC vice-chairperson, said that reducing pollution by promoting sustainable mobility is a core aspect of the anti-pollution campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhikailash-gahlot-to-inaugurate-raahgiri-day-in-najafgarh-101638033118563.html

27-11-2021||Lucknow||Hathras gang rape and murder: Victim’s kin want to relocate to Noida||Family members of 19-year-old dalit girl, who was gangraped in a Hathras village and died later during treatment last year, want to relocate to Noida as “living in the same village was next to impossible for them”, said the family’s lawyer. To note, the girl was raped by four persons in Hathras on September 14, 2020 when she had gone to collect fodder for cattle. She was partially paralysed in the attack. As her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29. The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court took suo- motu cognizance of the incident on October 1, 2020Lawyer Seema Khushwaha, who is representing the victim’s family in Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court, said “The family wants to relocate to Noida but the state government has refused to accept their demand. The government has instead offered them a house in Hathras city. They want the state government to reconsider their demand as living in the same village is next to impossible for them. We have apprised the court about this issue.” The matter came up during a two-day hearing of the case on November 25 and 26. A division bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice Jaspreet Singh has reserved the order for November 29.Khushwaha had also raised the issue of compensation and job to a family member of the victim. “The state government has provided ₹25 lakh compensation to the family. But this amount has been clubbed with the compensation that has to be provided under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989,” she said. “The family is yet to receive a house, land for farming, monthly pension of ₹5000 and a job to one member of the family,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hathras-gang-rape-and-murder-victim-s-kin-want-to-relocate-to-noida-101638032398563.html

Before this, he had participated just once in a local competition organised in Nerul.A Class 4 student of Goldcrest High School, Deshmukh has been training for the last two-and-a-half years at Nerul skatepark.“When I was in Canada, I had seen students carrying skateboards to schools and colleges. Skateboarding there is a means of transportation too. Hence, once when I found a skateboard in a toy shop on sale, I asked if he would be interested in having it. Since then, he has always been skateboarding, doing various tricks,” his father, Vishlesh Deskmukh, who is a social media marketing professional, said.In the beginning, when he got the skateboard, he managed the basics all alone at the age of eight, and later started training under a coach to learn the new tricks.“The thrill, the jumps and the stunts attached to the sport is what I like the most. The sport in itself is very exciting. While my building friends prefer to play cricket, I choose this sport and go to the skate park every day for one hour for practice,” Shiok said.This is the first year wherein the Olympics included skateboarding as a sport and hence his father feels that the sport has now got recognition and credibility. “He intends to take up a career as well on this sport,” his father said.On December 16, he would be representing Maharashtra in the under-11 age group category at the National Championship organised by Roller Skating Federation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/10yearold-navi-mumbai-resident-wins-gold-at-state-level-skateboard-meet-101638031498574.html

27-11-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh corruption case: Sanjeev Palande monitored collection from Mumbai bars, ED tells HC||Former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s personal secretary, deputy collector Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde jointly passed on the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader’s instructions to the dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze about the collection to be made from bars and restaurants in the city, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has claimed in its affidavit filed in Bombay high court (HC). ED added that the duo also monitored the collection. ED has registered the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against Deshmukh and others on May 11, 2021, based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Deshmukh on April 21. The CBI FIR, in turn, is based on the allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. In a letter written to the chief minister and others on March 20, Singh alleged that Deshmukh had instructed some Mumbai police officers, including dismissed assistant inspector Sachin Vaze, to collect an amount of ₹100 crore every month from bar owners in the city. ED has arrested both, Palande and Shinde, on June 26 in the money laundering case. Palande has since moved the high court for quashing of the ECIR on various grounds. The affidavit filed by investigating officer of the case, assistant director Tassine Sultan, opposed the petition, stating that Palande and Shinde used to pass on Deshmukh’s instructions to Vaze and other Mumbai Police officers, who were entrusted to collect bribe amounts from bars and restaurants. It adds that the duo also used to monitor the work of bribe collection from Mumbai bars and the facts were corroborated by Vaze, arrested by the National Investigation Agency in connection with the Antilia explosive scare and connected murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, in his statements given to ED. In his statements to ED, Vaze has said that on Deshmukh’s instructions he held a meeting with some bar owners in his erstwhile office at the Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai crime branch and between December 2020 and February 2021, collected an amount of ₹4.70 crore from orchestra bars in Mumbai and handed over the cash to Shinde in two instalments. ED said its investigation revealed that Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh had subsequently got an amount of ₹4.18 crore routed through Delhi-based shell entities as donations to a Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, Nagpur, controlled by the Deshmukh family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-corruption-case-sanjeev-palande-monitored-collection-from-mumbai-bars-ed-tells-hc-101638031318586.html

27-11-2021||Bhopal||Congress taught wrong history by claiming…: Shivraj Singh Chouhan||The Congress has taught the wrong history to the people by claiming that the country became independent only due to the contributions of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan alleged on Saturday. Addressing a gathering at Baroda Aheer, the birthplace of tribal revolutionary Tantya Bhil aka Tantya mama to mark the launch of Gaurav Kalash Yatra, Chouhan said, "We were not taught the right history. We were told that only Mahatma Gandhi ji, Nehru and Indiraji got Independence for us. I salute Mahatma Gandhi. He is a vishwa bandhu (universal brother) but the Congress taught us the wrong history". He said the life and role of revolutionaries who laid their lives for the country such as Tantya mama, Rani Laxmibai, Nana Saheb Peshwa, Bhima Nayak, Raghunath Shah, Shankar Shah, Birsa Munda and several others were never taught to the people. Chouhan thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for declaring 'Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas' to mark the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda, a tribal icon. He said Tantya mama had fought against the exploitation by money lenders and led an armed battle against the British. Tantya mama used to loot treasuries of the British government and distribute the wealth among the poor, the chief minister said. Tantya mama was caught by deception and hanged by the British in the Jabalpur jail, he said, adding that the BJP government will teach the right history of Tantya mama. Chouhan said that it was painful to note that Congress had named a tribal university in the name of (ex-prime minister) Indira Gandhi and not after revolutionaries hailing from tribal communities. “They (Congress) glorified only one family while the rest of the martyrs were forgotten. But we (BJP) are rectifying this historical mistake,” he said. On the occasion, the CM honoured the descendants of Tantya Bhil and also announced the installation of Bhil's statue. Gaurav Kalash Yatra will conclude on December 4, the martyrdom day of Tantya Bhil, at Patalpani after passing through various parts of MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/congress-taught-wrong-history-by-claiming-shivraj-singh-chouhan-101638030289130.html
27-11-2021||Pune||Pune receives rains 11 months of this year||Pune: As weather patterns have changed, Pune city has reported rainfall every month this year starting from January, with more rainy days compared to past years. As per the weather department, the rainfall has been in excess for the city along with pre and post-monsoon rains this year. According to weather scientists, it is not unusual to receive rainfall during pre and post-monsoon season though more rainy days were reported in these 11 months. Dr DS Pai, who heads climate research and services at India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune said that due to regular low-pressure areas over the state and country, there has been rainfall almost throughout every year. “In the pre-monsoon season, there has been frequent low-pressure areas which have originated due to Easterly waves. These low-pressure belts either were present over Maharashtra or passed through the state which resulted in rainfall,” said Pai. He said rainfall in July and August during monsoon were comparatively below normal. Whereas in September and October, the rainfall received in Pune city was above normal. In January this year, IMD reported 32.5 mm rainfall at Shivajinagar in just 24 hours which was the highest rainfall in 52 years. The all-time record for rainfall in January so far has been 14.7 mm. February saw traces of rainfall along with hailstorm reported in parts of the city. Between March and May, Pune city has received at least 131 per cent more rain in comparison to the normal rainfall as per IMD. In May, Pune city witnessed more than two intense rainfall events. In May, Pune reported over 30 mm rainfall in just three hours causing waterlogging in streets. He added that due to climate change, weather overall has been less predictable. “Due to climate change, there has been more intense rainfall events and extreme weather events have also increased. However, this climate variability and rainfall in every month so far may or may not occur next year. This may not be a regular event,” said Pai. Monsoon withdrawal this year was reported in October but rains continued in November as well. From October to November 27, Pune district has reported 38 per cent excess rainfall. In November alone, Pune district has reported 93 per cent excess rainfall. Senior IMD scientist KS Hosalikar, who also heads the surface instruments division at the Climate Research and Services at IMD, said the climatology of Pune states that rainfall may occur in each month. “However, this year due to various weather systems there has been rainfall in Pune and many parts of the state. In April, May, October and November there were thunderstorms and lightning along with rainfall. The climatology suggests that there is a probability for rainfall every month as this data is for 30 years. Pre and post-monsoon rainfall was very good this year,” Hosalikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-receives-rains-11-months-of-this-year-101638030238419.html

27-11-2021||Mumbai||Amendment clauses of Unified DCPR to allow for high-rises, redevelopment of buildings in old Thane||The amendment in some of the clauses of the Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) will now pave the way for high-rises and redevelopment of buildings in congested areas of Naupada and Uthalsar in old Thane.The state had approved the Unified DCPR for the entire State excluding Mumbai last December. On Friday, Urban Development Minister, Eknath Shinde, released the amendments to this Unified DCPR in Thane.The permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) for old buildings, which was 50% earlier, was reduced to 10 % last year. The amendment has now restored the original 50% FSI. The restriction of 24m height is also now increased to 70m, thus paving the way for high-rises in old Thane.Most redevelopment projects are stalled in this part of the city owing to the demand for extra FSI or TDR for congested areas. With the narrow roads that are merely 6m to 8m, this FSI was not permissible. The cap on 2 FSI is removed as per the new amendment and FSI as high as 4.16 can be permitted.Shinde said, “The Unified DCPR approved last year did not resolve the issue of Thane residents. As per the revised rules, for general redevelopment, approved FSI (1.1) + 0.5 Premium FSI + Permissible TDR + 60% ancillary FSI will be given, while for redevelopment of dangerous building, approved FSI (1.1) + 0.5 Premium FSI + 50% Incentive FSI + Permissible TDR + 60% ancillary FSI will be given. Also the narrow 9m roads will be considered as 12m and the building height will be approved up to 70m.”This means that buildings can be as high as 22m to 23m in the old part of the city. Moreover, if the road is narrower than 9m, the corporation can widen it to 9m and the constructions along it can get the benefits of 9m road.Shinde has also appealed to the developers in the city to participate in the cluster development scheme as it is aimed to resolve the issue of old and dilapidated buildings in the city.As per the existing clauses of Unified DCPR, parking space was not adequately available. Therefore, the existing provision of parking space in UDCPR is further relaxed by 20%. The provision of having more space for two-wheeler parking is revised. Also, earlier a ramp and lift was compulsory for the basement. With the amendment, car lift is now permitted. The parking tower can also be around 1.5m from the redeveloped plot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amendment-clauses-of-unified-dcpr-to-allow-for-high-rises-redevelopment-of-buildings-in-old-thane-101638029582826.html

We are scanning the CCTV footage of the area and the videos provided by the complaints. As far as the allegation of religious chanting is concerned, that is yet to be established. We will proceed further as per findings,” said Ranjan.The incident occurred near Kadru railway overbridge under Doranda police station limits, said police.In their complaint with Doranda police station, the three men, Riyaz Ahmed Wani (34), Sartaj Ahmed and Tanveer Ahmed (in their 20s), have alleged they were attacked by a group of around 20-25 people without provocation and forced to chant Hindu religious slogans. “I was hit on my head with a rod. I escaped injury due to my helmet that got badly damaged. We have submitted the broken helmet to the police. Our scooty was also damaged badly. It was clear we were targeted in a planned manner as the group was already present there. A similar incident had happened earlier this month with our boys who had filed a complaint with Doranda police station,” Wani said. The three detained accused have been identified as Deepak Jha, Tarun Kumar and Arvind Kumar. Ranjan said one person was arrested and sent to jail in the previous incident that happened on November 11.“We are also taking corrective measures to ensure safety for these groups of traders.

27-11-2021||Other||Bibi Jagir Kaur, president SGPC: My tenure was about reconnecting with people||With the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) House assembling on November 29 (Monday) to choose its office-bearers, including the president, incumbent chief Bibi Jagir Kaur tells HT that reaching a consensus over the calendar issue will be an important challenge for her successor. She adds that she moved cautiously during her one-year tenure as the SGPC needed to reach stability and reconnect with people.ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE? WHAT ARE THE INITIATIVES YOU TOOK?A year is a short time; many tasks are pending. I devoted myself, full-time, to serve as the president and am satisfied. I started the ‘Ghar Ghar Andar Dharamsaal’ (sacred shrine within every home) drive. I will be happy if my successor takes it forward. Work on two serais has started; the new building of Guru Granth Sahib Bhawan is near completion.YOU HOSTED MODERN SIKH MISSIONARIES, ANNOYING TRADITIONAL SEMINARIES LIKE THE DAMDAMI TAKSAL. HOW DID YOU TACKLE THIS?I never compromised on principles, and there were no direct attempts to pressure me; the media might have been used. Modern Sikh Missionary institutions were happy that the SGPC had invited them, for the first time, and allowed them to share views from the stage at Sri Darbar Sahib. Globally, the community hailed the move. YOU SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL NANAKSHAHI CALENDAR, BUT THE ROW COULD NOT BE SETTLED. WHY?The community must reach a consensus. I did not want to create confusion. The SGPC was under fire when I joined and I aimed to bring stability and then reconnect with people. My successor must address the calendar issue and bridge rifts within the community.YOU FAILED TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN BE ALLOWED TO PERFORM KIRTAN AT THE GOLDEN TEMPLE.The Sikh faith, unequivocally, grants equality to women. Hence, Sikh women perform kirtan at the Manji Sahib Diwan Hall on the Golden Temple premises. They don’t do it at the sanctum sanctorum, which has its own protocol. During recruitment, ‘ragis’ take a tough exam and fulfil some conditions. We have not produced eligible women ragi jathas. Only politicians, activists, intellectuals or journalists raise this demand, not women ragi jathas. THIS WAS YOUR FOURTH TERM. HOW WAS IT DIFFERENT?There is dip in the quality of employees at the SGPC. The system has weakened, and will take 2-3 years to be set right. The president has to be strict.ARE YOU HINTING THAT THE ONE-YEAR TENURE IS TOO SHORT?If the SGPC House is elected for five years, the president should also be there for five years. Till the Sikh Gurdwara Act is amended in Parliament, this is not possible.WILL YOU CONTESTS ASSEMBLY POLLS?I will abide by the party decision. I am more satisfied when I do ‘sewa’ though, serving as an MLA or a minister is also important. THE PERCEPTION IS THAT THE SGPC PRESIDENT BATTLES POLITICAL PRESSURE. IS IT TRUE?Not at all. The Badals have never asked anything from me. Sukhbir has expressed satisfaction at my performance.THE PLAN TO RAZE THE HISTORIC GURU RAM DAS SERAI HAS INVITED PUBLIC WRATH. HAS IT BEEN SCRAPPED?No. It has been delayed, as we don’t have a place to accommodate devotees, when renovation or construction starts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bibi-jagir-kaur-president-sgpc-my-tenure-was-about-reconnecting-with-people-101638029278317.html

27-11-2021||Patna||Biometric voter identification in Bihar panchayat polls draws praise, likely in Delhi civic polls||The biometric system for voter identification introduced in the ongoing panchayat polls in Bihar is not only getting praise from various election bodies, but is also likely to be adopted in the upcoming municipal polls in New Delhi early next year. State Election Commissioner of Delhi and Chandigarh, S K Srivastava, who was in Bihar from November 24 to 26, visited several booths during the eighth round of panchayat polls at Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur and also took an update on the latest digital system adopted in the counting process from his State Election Commissioner Bihar, Dr Deepak Prasad. “The biometric system of voter identification adopted by the State Election Commission (SEC), Bihar, is unique and has proved to be an effective tool in checking bogus voting and rigging. We are impressed by it and are contemplating of using the same in the upcoming municipal polls in New Delhi. I did visit booths and saw the system,” Srivastava told reporters before returning to Delhi on Friday evening.The SEC, Delhi, who is also chairman of standing committee of state election commissioners across the country, said advanced electronic voting machines (EVMs) being used for assembly polls and parliamentary polls should be provided by the Election Commission of India ( ECI) to SECs for maintaining a synergy in conduct of the polls. He said the SECs should also get the permission for procuring multi-post and single-post EVMs for civic polls and panchayat polls as per need from the manufacturing agencies like BEL (Bharat Electronics Limited) and ECIL. “We are soon going to write to the law ministry in this regard. The concept of ‘one nation, one election’ requires that we use same medium for all elections with similar type of EVMs,” Srivatasa said. Before the panchayat polls in Bihar, there was some controversy over procurement of multi post EVMs from ECIL. The SEC had moved Patna High Court over delay in grant of permission to ECIL from the ECI to provide requisite number of multi-post EVMs. Later, the matter was resolved with the ECI providing single post EVMs to the state poll panel from various states. Bihar panchayat polls are being held both with EVMs and ballot papers for six posts in the three tier rural local bodies. Bihar SEC Deepak Prasad emphasized that cameras put over all counting tables and OCR (optical character recognition) to capture images of votes secured by candidates in the EVMs and put on server was also a new step adopted in the panchayat polls and its impact has been positive. “Complaints of manipulation in counting process has been negligible from candidates.

The CM has written to the Governor for probe into the allegations and a copy was also sent to the department. The Governor listened to everything patiently and assured to get the matter thoroughly examined so that action could be taken against the guilty,” Choudhary said. The minister said he was satisfied with the assurance from the Governor that “proper legal action would be taken against whoever is found guilty in the probe”.A Raj Bhawan communique said the minister called on the Governor for a courtesy visit. “During the meeting, the discussions revolved around development of higher education and qualitative improvement,” it said.The meeting is significant, as the entire education department had stayed away from the maiden function to present Chancellor’s awards in the wake of controversies surrounding LNMU VC SP Singh due to serious corruption charges levelled against him by a contemporary VC last week. Earlier, vigilance sleuths also carried out raid at the office and Magadh University VC Rajendra Prasad.Later, the CM met the Governor and two long-pending appointments of VC and Pro-VC were cleared before the Governor went to Delhi. There are several vacancies still existing in varsities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/education-minister-meets-guv-amid-flying-graft-charges-against-vcs-101638028858190.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai school ropes in parents to chalk out SOPs of physical classes||Weeks after the state government announced the physical reopening of schools for classes 8-12, several parents shared their angst about putting their child’s health in danger by sending them for physical classes. In such confusing times, a city school found an innovative way to tackle this fear. Campion School in Cooperage brought together a team of parents of students studying in their school to form a committee to put together the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for school reopening. The parents, mainly doctors, attended school for a few days and inspected key areas—washrooms, corridors, playground, school gate, etc, where students need to maintain social distance and other protocols. Speaking to HT, Cyril D’Souza, vice-principal of the school said, “We invited a group of parents to form a committee and asked them, along with a few more willing parents, to help us put together SOPs to follow once school reopens for students. This group of parents spent time in the school premises for some days and inspected every nook and corner of the institute before working on the SOPs.”Essentially, six parents divided the task among themselves to pull together SOPs for six important departments. They wrote separate protocols and compiled their ideas.Dr Farah Mistri, a physiotherapist by profession and mother to a grade 4 and grade 8 student of Campion School shared, “We wanted to make sure that we have a robust system in place before students return to school. Once the SOPs were ready, we invited more parents to attend school to ensure the practicality of implementation of the SOPs is done.”As part of the inspection, parents also attended school while students were around and checked every place from classrooms to washrooms to ensure that students are following Covid protocols at all times. “We realised during these inspections that at the school gate, students would maintain better distance if a teacher was at the gate other than the security,” added Fr Francis Swamy, school principal. In October, once the state education department released the order to reopen schools for classes 8 to 10, the school management as well as the parents were ready. A series of trial runs helped, eventually convincing nearly 60% of parents to give consent forms for physical classes. “The involvement of parents since the very beginning ensured many apprehensions were resolved. With the guidelines in hand, parents also managed to prepare the children before sending them off for physical classes,” said Mistri, and added that apart from students, the teaching and non-teaching staff of the institute also attended a workshop on Covid appropriate behaviour and how to conduct hybrid classes, starting October this year.“With the SOP in place, reopening school for students from higher grades became easier for us and at the same time, parents as well as students were more aware and at ease. We hope to re-work the SOPs and guidelines once the younger grade students start coming to school. We are planning to run the school in two shifts if needed,” added Fr Swamy.Some rules under SOP put together by the school-Upon entering the school, each student must sanitise their hands and move along the designated path to their respective class. The same will apply during the exit from the school. Entry and exit protocols should be followed strictly at all times.-No sharing of books, stationery or any other personal items will be permitted. Water bottles or sharing of snacks will not be permitted.-If any child leaving school on their own or with the driver, must bring along their parent’s consent letter in two copies. -Wearing a fresh, triple-layered mask as well as hand sanitisation from home is mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-school-ropes-in-parents-to-chalk-out-sops-of-physical-classes-101638028798536.html
27-11-2021||Kolkata||First enemy property sealed in West Bengal to keep away alleged illegal occupants||An eight-storey building in central Kolkata, which is an enemy property, was sealed off by officials from the Custodian of Enemy Property for India (CEPI) on Saturday. This is the first time that an enemy property has been sealed in the state, officials said.“We sealed off the building at Ganesh Chandra Avenue after some people tried to occupy it illegally. They had also undertaken some reconstruction work inside the building. The owner of the building moved to Pakistan after the 1971 war. This is the first time that an enemy property has been sealed off,” said a senior official of the CEPI. West Bengal accounts for the second-highest number of such enemy properties in India, according to data placed in the Lok Sabha earlier this year. While Uttar Pradesh has 5936 enemy properties, West Bengal has 4301. “We have received information that a section of these properties is being illegally occupied. We are looking into these. More buildings may be sealed in the next few weeks,” said the official. The owners of the enemy properties are those who have left India and settled in Pakistan or China after the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971 and the 1962 Sino-Indian war. The government has vested these properties in the Custodian of Enemy Property for India, an office instituted under the central government. At least enemy shares of 302 companies and 12426 immovable enemy properties are vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property for India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/first-enemy-property-sealed-in-west-bengal-to-keep-away-alleged-illegal-occupants-101638028677516.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra CID to question Param Bir Singh next week||The state crime investigation department (CID) will question former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh next week in multiple rounds, as the agency is probing three separate first information reports (FIRs) against him. Singh is currently posted as the commandant general of Maharashtra home guards. After hiding for months, the 1988-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer resurfaced in his hometown Chandigarh on Wednesday, two days after the Supreme Court gave him protection from arrest by Maharashtra Police and directed him to join investigations in the cases against him. Singh will appear before investigators at CID’s regional office in CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai, on Tuesday and Wednesday, sources said. “Three investigation officers of the three cases will separately question Singh next week. The questioning may go on for two-three consecutive days,” said a senior CID officer, adding that they have prepared three separate questionnaires for Singh’s interrogation, which will be supervised by MN Jagtap, superintendent of police, CID, and CID chief Retesh Kumaarr. One of the three cases was registered against Singh at Kalyan on April 28 on the basis of a complaint by serving inspector Bhimrao Ghadge. The inspector has alleged that Singh, during his tenure as Thane Police commissioner, put pressure on him to drop corruption charges against three Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) commissioners and other civic officials. The other two cases being investigated by CID are pertaining to the extortion complaints registered by Bhayander-based developer Shyamsunder Agrawal against Singh and some other police officers. The first FIR based on Agarwal’s complaint was registered at Marine Drive police station, in which the builder had alleged that Singh and his subordinates extorted money from him at the behest of his former partner Sanjay Punamiya, by registering false cases against him. Another FIR against Singh was registered at Kopri police station in Thane. The FIR is on the basis of a complaint lodged by Agarwal’s nephew Sharad, alleging that former top cop, a deputy commission of police and others threatened him at Singh’s official residence in Thane and extorted money from him by threatening to frame his uncle in more criminal cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cid-to-question-param-bir-singh-next-week-101638026524375.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||More than 30% in Kalyan Dombivli civic body limits not taken first vaccination dose against Covid||More than 4.12 lakh people out of the total eligible population of 13.59 lakh are yet to get their first vaccination dose, reveals the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) data.The KDMC has so far vaccinated 69.63% of its 13.59 lakh listed beneficiaries. Among these, 9.46 lakh people have taken their first dose. In the 18-44 years category, 94.75% of the listed 5.57 lakh beneficiaries have taken their first dose. Meanwhile, 59.11%, which amounts to 3.23 lakh of those who have taken the first dose, have taken their second dose too.In a door-to-door survey initiated recently, the civic body surveyed 2.81 lakh homes through their 18 health centres and found that 57,492 residents had not taken even a single dose. The vaccinators managed to convince 15,271 residents to take the first dose while 25,241 were either out of station or assured that they would soon take the dose. However, the remaining 16,980 residents, who despite the vaccinators going to their doorstep, refused to get vaccinated. Of these 16,980 residents, 10,130 are from the Ansari Chowk area.The door-to-door survey initiated by the KDMC earlier this month has seen several such cases where the entire family has not taken the dose while some have taken their first dose and are due for second dose but have failed to take it, and some others who refuse to take the dose at all.“There are 16,980 individuals who are not willing to take the dose at all. They are either scared of the side effects or have some other myths. We try to convince them, take their contact details and keep following up with them. The civic body is also holding vaccination camps in such areas so that people can come to the nearest place and get the dose,” said Vidya Talekar, a nurse at Kolsewadi health post.The 25,241 who have not taken their single dose are being mobilised to the nearest vaccination centres as they have agreed to get it. KDMC claimed to be following up with them on a regular basis. “In case any resident who cannot go to the centre, we give the dose at their house by deciding a day for such residents,” said Talekar.“There are certain places in the city wherein the minority community is reluctant to come out and take the dose. They directly refuse to take the dose. We are talking to their general practitioners requesting them to convince the people,” said Ganesh Doiphode, in-charge of the vaccination drive in KDMC.The survey will be conducted in a total of 4.66 lakh houses in the city. Apart from 57,492 due for the first dose, the surveyors also found 1.33 lakh due for the second dose out of which 40,036 were administered the second dose on the spot. KDMC has plans to increase the number of health posts by adding 18 new centres to help increase the door-to-door survey and reach out to maximum people in the KDMC limits.Three members of the Sangle family from Karpewadi in Kalyan (E) – Vandana Vilas Sangle, 40, her husband and 20-year-old son – have not taken their single dose of Covid vaccine.“I was in my native place for a month recently and before that, we did not think about taking the dose. We thought we would take it later but never took the initiative. This doesn’t mean we will not take the dose. We will soon take it,” said Vandana.The health department of KDMC reached out to the Sangle family on Thursday. “Since the nurses have told us the dose is available in a nearby clinic, we will take it without hesitation and delay. I will also tell my husband and son the same,” said Vandana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/more-than-30-in-kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-limits-not-taken-first-vaccination-dose-against-covid-101638026523094.html
27-11-2021||Patna||Delhi municipal polls next year likely to see biometric voters verification system||The biometric system for voter identification introduced in the ongoing panchayat polls in Bihar is not only getting praise from various election bodies but is also likely to be adopted in the upcoming municipal polls in New Delhi early next year, State Election Commissioner, Delhi and Chandigarh, SK Srivastava said.Srivastava, who was in Bihar from November 24 to 26, visited several booths during the eighth round of panchayat polls at Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur and took an update on the latest digital system adopted in the counting process from State Election Commissioner Bihar, Dr Deepak Prasad.“The biometric system of voter identification adopted by the State Election Commission (SEC), Bihar, is unique and has proved to be an effective tool in checking bogus voting and rigging. We are impressed by it and are contemplating using the same in the upcoming municipal polls in New Delhi. I did visit booths and saw the system,” Srivastava told reporters before returning to Delhi on Friday evening.The SEC, Delhi, who is also chairman of the standing committee of state election commissioners across the country, said, advanced electronic voting machines (EVMs) being used for assembly polls and parliamentary polls should be provided by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to SECs for maintaining synergy in the conduct of the polls.He said the SECs should also get permission to procure multi-post and single-post EVMs for civic polls and panchayat polls as per need from the manufacturing agencies like BEL (Bharat Electronics Limited) and ECIL. “We are soon going to write to the law ministry in this regard. The concept of ‘one nation, one election’ requires that we use the same medium for all elections with a similar type of EVMs,” Srivatasa said.Before the panchayat polls in Bihar, there was some controversy over the procurement of multi-post EVMs from the ECIL. The SEC moved Patna High Court over delay in grant of permission to the ECIL from the ECI to provide the requisite number of multi-posts EVMs. Later, the matter was resolved with the ECI providing single post EVMs to the state poll panel from various states.Bihar panchayat polls are being held both with EVMs and ballot papers for six posts in the three-tier rural local bodies.Bihar SEC Deepak Prasad emphasized that cameras put over all counting tables and OCR (optical character recognition) to capture images of votes secured by candidates in the EVMs and put on the server was also a new step adopted in the panchayat polls and its impact has been positive. “Complaints of manipulation in counting process has been negligible from candidates. The human interface in the counting process has been reduced and there is more artificial intelligence(AI) in the system,” he said.Bihar’s 11-phase panchayat polls will conclude on December 12 with the election of 2.55 panchayat representatives, from ward members to district board members in the three-tier local bodies. Panch and sarpanch in gram kutcheries are also being elected at the village panchayat level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/delhi-municipal-polls-next-year-likely-to-see-biometric-voters-verification-system-101638025859874.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||NMMC to keep an eye on international travellers||Navi Mumbai The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has started keeping a track of international travellers in order to ensure that the new strain does not become the cause of the third wave. From Saturday onwards, the travellers from the countries categorised as risky by the government and also the transit travellers are being tracked. “We get a list of travellers to Navi Mumbai from the airport authorities. They conduct the RTPCR there and if found positive, they are isolated there itself. If negative, they are sent here. The list is circulated to the Urban Health Primary Centre (UHPC) heads of Navi Mumbai as per the area,” said NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar.He further added that the list is also forwarded to the call centres set up for Covid-related work by NMMC. The travellers will be tracked daily by the UHPC as well as the call centre asking if they face any discomfort or symptoms. “On the eighth day after they reach, we would be conducting their RTPCR test as per the protocol,” Bangar added. He also said that the task force is thinking about conducting alternate days testing of high-risk travellers as it may take a few days for the virus to show its symptoms. “The decision on the alternate testing is yet not finalised,” Bangar added. As per the notification issued, there are 10 countries with high risk and other 98 countries with whom there is a mutual agreement on recognising vaccination certificates. “As of now, we have been able to delay the third wave due to our testing ratio and higher number of testing.

27-11-2021||Mumbai||BMC ready with revised boundaries for 236 seats, 8 seats to increase in suburbs, 1 in south Mumbai||While the state government is yet to issue final notification paving the way to increase electoral seats for upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, from the current seat strength of 227 to 236, the civic body has said it is ready with the revised ward boundaries for the 236 seats. According to BMC officials, the nine additional seats are being added as five extra seats in western suburbs, three in eastern suburbs and one seat in the island city.According to BMC officials, the 2011 census was considered for the redrawing of the ward boundaries for taking the count to 236 seats. The BMC officials have said it will forward the revised ward boundaries for its approval to the state election commission once the final notification is issued by the urban development department. The current composition of the civic body’s electoral ward has been unchanged since 2001. The state government did not increase the number of corporators in 2012 even when the population rose by 3.87% since 2001. Hence, the 2011 census has been used as the base as the 2021 census has been delayed owing to the Covid pandemic.The state cabinet, earlier this month, had cleared a proposal to increase the strength of the Mumbai civic body from 227 to 236 members. Following the decision, the urban development department will amend the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, to change the composition of the corporation. The state government said that the move was necessary owing to the growth in the city’s population in the past two decades.A senior BMC official from the election department of the BMC, said, “We are ready with ward boundaries for both 227 and 236 seats, and are in a position to submit to the state election commission for scrutiny. However, we are waiting for final notification from the state government. Once the notification is issued, we will send the revised ward boundaries, in which, we have changed boundaries of the existing 227 electoral wards, and not of the 24 administrative wards.”The BMC official added, “As per the revised boundaries, we are increasing around five electoral wards in western suburbs, three in eastern suburbs and one in the island city. We have calculated the average voting population in each ward to balance out while increasing the electoral seats.”According to the procedure, once the BMC submits the list of 236 seats to the state election commission, it will scrutinise the proposal and call for suggestions and objections from the general public.Post this, the BMC will conduct a lottery for deciding the reservation status of the administrative wards. The tentative dates for elections are expected to be in the last week of February or the first week of March, considering the term of current corporators ends on March 7, 2022. In the current upcoming polls, the BMC is also going to increase polling booths from the current 8,500 booths to around 11,000 polling booths.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We are well-prepared to conduct polls as per schedule. We are in the process of completing the administrative work for it.”Further, in the city, during the 2017 BMC elections, there were around 9.2 million voters, which went up to around 9.6 million in 2019 during the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The number is now expected to have crossed the 10-million mark. Meanwhile, currently, in the civic house of 227 seats, the Shiv Sena has 97 seats while the Bharatiya Janata Party has 83, Congress 29, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 8, Samajwadi Party (SP) six seats, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen two seats and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-ready-with-revised-boundaries-for-236-seats-8-seats-to-increase-in-suburbs-1-in-south-mumbai-101638024778492.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||More than 3,000 complain against arrested VGN Jewellers owners of cheating to the tune of Rs90 crore||The number of complainants against the owners of the VGN Jewellers chain has crossed 3,000 in less than two months of their arrest. The value of the money that is alleged to have been swindled by them has gone beyond ₹90Cr, investigating officers said on Saturday.The accused, Virithgopalan Nair and his wife Valsala, were arrested on October 5 by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Thane Police Crime Branch for allegedly running a Ponzi scheme.Initially, 13 people from all over the Thane district had registered complaints with the Kolsewadi police station in Kalyan, alleging that they had collectively been cheated to the tune of ₹7.99Cr. The EOW had subsequently taken over the probe and arrested the couple.“We are still conducting further investigations into the matter. In the meantime, we have now recorded statements from more than 3,000 people who have all been cheated by the accused. The total value of the money that the accused have fraudulently obtained from the victims is more than ₹90Cr. A large number of the victims are senior citizens with many being above 75 years,” ACP (EOW), SN Patil, said.Following the arrest of the accused, the EOW had instructed all police stations in the Thane city commissionerate to direct any and all pertinent complaints to them. People who were reaching out through social media were also contacted and asked to register formal complaints.According to the EOW officials, from 2006 to 2021, the accused lured their customers into investing money in a variety of schemes promising impossibly high returns. The accused had jewellery stores in Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Mulund as well as a finance company in Kalyan, which were all allegedly used in the offence and the accused allegedly used the money received from new investors to pay the old ones.The EOW has invoked the Maharashtra Protection of Interests of Depositors Act in the case, which empowers the investigating agency to attach the assets of the accused. These assets, with due permission from the court, are auctioned off and the proceeds are used to reimburse the victims.“We have already started the process of evaluating the movable as well as immovable assets of the accused, and will take further action in this regard soon,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/more-than-3-000-complain-against-arrested-vgn-jewellers-owners-of-cheating-to-the-tune-of-rs90-crore-101638024717892.html

Now after three years, the High Court has directed Foreigners Tribunal-4 of Cachar to hear the case again on December 24 and give them a chance to prove their identity again.Rajendra Das, along with his wife Renubala Das and three kids (all minors), was declared foreigner on January 18, 2018, by FT-4 of Cachar district. It was an ex-parte judgement, issued after they failed to appear before the court. They are residents of Mahadevpur village under Katigorah police station of Cachar district and the court is almost 60 kilometres far.The 2018 order was recently challenged at Guwahati High Court by lawyer Swati Bidhan Baruah on behalf of Rajendra Das and his family. The High Court found that the family has documents that can prove their Indian identity.In their order, Justice N Kotiswar Singh and justice Malashri Nandi mentioned that Rajendra Das’s father’s name appeared in the voters’ list of 1965 and was regular in upcoming years as well.They wrote, “The voters’ list of 1965 has the names of one Gandhi Lal Das and Sumurta Bala Das are shown, who the petitioner No.1 (Rajendra Das) claims to be his parents. Similarly, the petitioners have also annexed one photocopy of the voters’ list of 1970, where the aforesaid names of the parents of the petitioner are shown.”“They have also referred to a certificate issued by the Mahadevpur Gaon Panchayat which shows that the petitioner No.2 (Renubala Das) is married to the petitioner No.1 (Rajendra Das). And we believe that the petitioners have sufficient materials to show. We are of the view that if the petitioners are able to prove the aforesaid documents, they may have a legitimate claim that they are Indians and not foreigners,” the order stated.The High Court also observed that Rajendra Das could not appear before the FT-4 in 2018 due to his physical illness and he deserves another chance.“Lawyer of petitioners submitted documents which shows that because of his ill health, he, along with his family members, could not appear before the Tribunal resulting in the passing of the ex-parte order,” they wrote.High Court feels even if the order of the Tribunal is merely quasi-judicial in nature, it has huge implications for the right of a person.“We are conscious of the fact that ex-parte orders cannot be interfered with in a routine manner. But the present case pertains to a very important right of a person, which is citizenship. If the person could not appear before the learned Tribunal and ex-parte order was passed, it would have a cascading effect on other members of his family, as the rest of the family members are dependent on him,” they said.The order further states that, if the petitioners are not able to engage any counsel on their own and of their choice, the petitioners may approach the Cachar District Legal Services Authority for providing a legal aid counsel.However, since the citizenship of the petitioners has come under a cloud, they will remain on bail during the proceedings for which they will appear before the Superintendent of Police, Cachar, within 15 days from today by furnishing a bail bond of 5,000/- each with one local surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the said authority.The concerned Superintendent of Police shall also take necessary steps for capturing the fingerprints and biometrics of the iris of the petitioners. It is also made clear that the petitioners shall not leave the jurisdiction of the Cachar district without obtaining permission from the Superintendent of Police, Cachar.It is to be mentioned that the FT-4 is located in Silchar town which is almost 60 kilometres away from the residence of Rajendra Das. Some lawyers (without revealing their names) mentioned that the petitioners appear before the court but the members (judges) keep delaying the hearing.“In most of the courts, either there are no government lawyers or they are absent. The petitioners keep returning and if they miss any date, members declare them foreigners. This has become a process of harassing common Indians and the victims are mostly financially backward,” a lawyer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gauhati-hc-allows-five-declared-foreigners-to-prove-their-indian-identity-101638023819849.html

I escaped injury due to my helmet that got badly damaged. We have submitted the broken helmet to the police. Our scooter was also damaged badly. It was clear we were targeted in a planned manner as the group seems to have been stationed there. A similar incident took place earlier this month with our boys who filed a complaint at the Doranda police station,” Wani told Hindustan Times.Prabhat Ranjan, Deputy Superintendent of Police, (Ranchi Sadar), said, a case has been registered and investigation is on.“We have detained three persons who were named in the complaint and are questioning them. We are scanning the CCTV footage of the area and the videos provided by the complaints. As far as the allegation of religious chanting is concerned, that is yet to be established. We will proceed further as per our findings,” said Ranjan.Those named as accused in the complaint include Deepak Jha, Tarun Kumar and Arvind Kumar.On such an incident being repeated under the same Doranada police station limits twice in a month in the state capital, Ranjan said one person was arrested and sent to jail in the previous incident (on November 11) as well.“We are also taking corrective measures to ensure safety for these groups of traders. We have sought details of all such men staying here and areas where they practise their trade so that we can devise some mechanism for their safety. Be it increasing security or patrolling, we will take corrective measures accordingly,” said Ranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/3-kashmiri-blanket-traders-allegedly-attacked-in-ranchi-3-detained-101638022558859.html
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Pak using drones to drop explosives, Indian drones meant to serve humanity: Union minister Jitendra Singh||Unlike Pakistan which uses drones to drop weapons and further terrorism in Indian territory, India uses its drones to serve humanity, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Saturday at the launch of operations of an unmanned aerial vehicle to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to areas along the international border in Jammu and Kashmir. The indigenously built medium-class multicopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) took off from the CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Complex here and successfully delivered 50 vials of Covid-19 vaccines along with syringes to a public health centre in Jammu’s Marh area near the India-Pakistan border. “Pakistan is using drones to drop explosives to cause harm to human life and further terrorism, but our drone will act as a carrier of ‘Sanjeevani Boti’ for the betterment of humanity and is going with a message of peace,” Singh said.He said health workers engaged in Covid-19 vaccination are facing problems in reaching families in remote and mountainous regions, and difficult terrains of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and elsewhere. The use of this type of drones will be of great help and also aid in fulfilling the government’s resolve of 100% vaccination, Singh said.The GPS-guided beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) Octacopter UAV has been developed by the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), a constituent of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and has a range of 55 kilometres, an official said, adding that it can carry a payload of 20 kilograms.The UAV is integrated with a powerful on board embedded computer and latest generation sensors for versatile applications like agricultural pesticide spraying, crop monitoring, mining survey and magnetic geo-survey mapping, he said. On restrictions on use of drones in Jammu and Kashmir, the minister said there is no need to be concerned as all necessary security measures have been taken and permissions sought from authorities concerned. The civil aviation ministry had granted conditional permission to CSIR-NAL for conducting BVLOS flight trials on September 13.Jammu and Kashmir witnessed a spurt in drone activities from Pakistan over the past one year with terrorists using the technology to drop bombs at an Indian Air Force (IAF) station in Jammu in June. Following the bombing, authorities ordered ban on storage, sale or possession, use and transport of the flying machines in various districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pak-using-drones-to-drop-explosives-indian-drones-meant-to-serve-humanity-union-minister-jitendra-singh-101638021838925.html
27-11-2021||Patna||Bihar winter session likely to be stormy, speaker appeals for smooth conduct||Ahead of the winter session of the Bihar Legislature, Assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha appealed to all the parties to ensure its smooth conduct so that maximum issues of public importance could be taken up.The session, starting November 29 and ending December 3, could witness at least one or two bills - one related to the Bihar technical service commission and another related to private universities.During an all-party meeting prior to the start of the session, Sinha said that more and more discussions on the issues of public importance on the floor of the House would increase people’s faith in democracy and add to the state’s progress. “In a democratic system, the opposition is also part of the government and therefore both treasury and opposition benches have to contribute in making the session meaningful,” he added.All the leaders of the political parties assured the Speaker in one voice of their positive cooperation toward smooth conduct of the House but sought timely availability of logical answers to the questions asked in the public interest.After the ugly scenes in the House during the Budget session, the brief monsoon session was much smoother, with the smooth run of the question hour and nearly 99% submission of replies to questions.The Speaker said that the target was to get 100% online replies to questions from different departments and concerned officers have been given necessary instruction in this regard. “I have asked the chief secretary to ensure that nodal officers are nominated in the departments concerned for the coordination so that the answers to the questions asked by legislators are submitted in time,” he added.The Speaker also asked the officials about the action taken on complaints on misbehaviour by district officials with legislators and asked the chief secretary to take it seriously, else the House would have to use its privilege in this regard.Earlier this month, the general administration department also issued detailed guidelines for officials regarding their conduct while dealing with elected representatives to give them the utmost respect.He said that after the winter session, an orientation programme would also be organised for legislators after consultation with the CM. “We will like Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to be there for the orientation programme. The days will be finalised later,” he added.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief whip Lalit Yadav said that the party’s strategy for the forthcoming session would be decided at the legislature party meeting on the first day of the session.“But our approach has been consistent and clear all through and we would keep raising the issues of public importance and expect the government to give a pointed reply,” he added.Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma said that the party, as well as the entire opposition, would expose multiple failures of the government, which is solely engaged in reviewing prohibition that has failed on the ground but the government refused to accept what is apparent to all.“Corruption is another issue, as it is not confined to universities alone. Ask a common man and he will narrate the woes, which does not get attention even from the media. Prohibition is now a sham. Young boys and girls are engaged in ferrying liquor bottles as there is unemployment. Development has taken a backseat and the Opposition will raise the issues and seek proper replies. It will like the House to function,” he added.Senior Janata Dal-United (JDU) leader and parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said that the government would be ready to face any challenge posed by the opposition as its work was transparent and for inclusive growth.“We are confident about our bona fide. Bihar government’s zero tolerance to corruption has been apparent right through. Even in the case of universities, the CM, as well as the education department, has demanded a probe. Elsewhere, those indulging in corruption are facing action. As far as prohibition is concerned, the government is serious about it. Those opposing it should say liquor is good. Spurious liquor causes death because people drink it. The opposition should call for stricter enforcement, else it would appear they were supporting illegal legal trade,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-winter-session-likely-to-be-stormy-speaker-appeals-for-smooth-conduct-101638021539631.html

Pradip Debroy, the accused, was arrested and would be forwarded to court on Saturday. Police said that the accused neither has any past criminal record nor history of psychological problems as per their preliminary investigation. “We registered a case. The motive behind the incident is still unclear. Our investigation is on,” said a senior police official. According to people familiar with the matter, Pradip went out of control in a fit of aggression at around 11:30 pm on Friday and allegedly killed his daughters - Aditi Debroy (one-year-old) and Mandira Debroy, 7, with an iron shovel and also injured his wife, who managed to escape from the house. Pradip later attacked and killed his brother Amalesh, who asked him to open the door and then moved out of the house and attacked a passer-by Krishna Das, who died on the spot, according to police. Krishna’s son received injuries from the attack and is currently admitted at Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) hospital in Agartala. He is known to be stable. After getting reports, a duty officer of Khowai Police Station, Satyajit Mallick, came to the spot and tried to stop Pradip but the latter hit the officer on the head.

27-11-2021||Mumbai||Cases against family members can’t be grounds for revoking arms license: HC||Mumbai Observing that an arms license cannot be revoked only on the ground of offences registered against the license holder’s family members, the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday struck down Daman district magistrate’s order, revoking arms license of Jignesh Patel, son of former Member of Parliament Dayabhai Patel. The district magistrate had on October 8, 2018, revoked the arms license granted to Jignesh Patel and directed him to deposit his licensed weapon at Nani Daman police station. He moved the HC last year, after the Administrator, Daman and Diu confirmed the order and dismissed his appeal. Advocate HS Venegavkar, who represented the Union territory, opposed the petition stating that the orders could not be faulted with since, in the backdrop of the past criminal record of the petitioner and his family, it had become necessary in the public interest to cancel the license. Justice SK Shinde, however, refused to accept the contention. The single-judge bench said under Section 17(3) of the Arms Act, 1979, the licensing authority can suspend or revoke an arms license only when it becomes necessary for the security of the public peace or for public safety. However, the court said, the licensing authority – the district magistrate - cancelled Jignesh’s license only on the ground that several offences had been registered against his father and brother. “In fact, there is no material on record to establish a necessary connection between the petitioner and his brother and father qua the offences registered against them,” said Justice Shinde, adding that the registration of offences against family members of the licensee that by itself was not sufficient to revoke license of the petitioner. As regards the criminal cases registered against Jignesh Patel himself, HC noted that the last criminal case was registered against him way back in 2010 and his arms license had been renewed from time to time thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cases-against-family-members-can-t-be-grounds-for-revoking-arms-license-hc-101638017638310.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan RTO approves hike in auto fares||Commuters in and around Kalyan will have to pay more for auto rickshaws as the Kalyan Regional Transport Office (RTO) has approved the revised fares proposed by the auto unions.The fare for the nearest route is the same as before while the fare for long routes has been hiked by ₹1- ₹3.“This hike was introduced last year by the state transport ministry. However, due to the lockdown, it was not imposed then. Now, since the transportation is back to normal, the revised fares will be imposed in Kalyan RTO jurisdiction,” Tanaji Chavan, regional transport officer, Kalyan.Cities like Kalyan, Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, Badlapur, Murbad and Titwala fall under Kalyan RTO. The revised fares would be applicable for all these cities. Meanwhile, the RTO has also invited suggestions and objections before December 4.Although the auto rickshaw unions have approved the hike for long distances, some are not satisfied with the decision for short distances.“There is no hike for short distances, and this has led to disagreement among several auto drivers. A meeting will be held with the RTO on Monday to discuss the same,” said Santosh Navale, representative of Kalyan auto rickshaw driver and owner union.The new fare for auto rickshaw, for instance, from Ganpathi Chowk to Katemanivali Naka, which is around 0.9km is ₹9 by share auto and by meter is ₹21. Earlier, it was ₹10 by share auto and ₹18 by meter for the same route.“Now, when the fare by share auto is ₹9, there will be a conflict between the passenger and auto driver for ₹1 change. The RTO should also consider a hike for the short rates as, in Kalyan, most people opt for share autos and no meter autos ply in the city,” said Rakesh Gupta, 29, an auto driver from Kalyan (E).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-rto-approves-hike-in-auto-fares-101638017039156.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||To reduce traffic congestion, 2 new bridges to come up on Vashi creek by Oct ’23||People travelling via the Sion-Panvel Highway will soon have a traffic-free commute near the Vashi creek as the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has started developing two new bridges on the creek.Heavy machinery has been mobilised in the creek water over the past two weeks and both the bridges would be ready by October 2023.At present, there are two bridges for vehicles on the Vashi creek. The first bridge was developed in 1973 but due to its poor condition, it was declared unfit for heavy vehicles nearly two decades ago. The second bridge was developed in the early 1990s. Now the light vehicles are diverted to the first bridge only when maintenance work is conducted on the second bridge.A senior officer from MSRDC said, “The Sion-Panvel Highway has a total of 10 lanes both in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. However, the second bridge, which is located on that highway, has only six lanes. Therefore, the area of that bridge has turned into a bottleneck and it sees heavy traffic congestion during the peak hours. Taking the gravity of the issue into consideration, we have now started developing two new bridges on either side of the second bridge.”The officer added that each of the new bridges would have three lanes, each 1.837km long and the total budget for the two bridges is ₹775Cr.“With the new bridges in place, we will have a total of 12 lanes (three each on the new bridges and six on the second bridge) on the bridges,” he said. In view of frequent cases of suicide or attempt to suicide, MSRDC has also decided to install suicide barriers on the sides of the existing bridges and the tendering process of that project is now on.The officer said, “In the upcoming bridges, we will develop 1.5m-tall concrete walls on the sides and hence there will be no need for such suicide barriers. Once we are done with the new bridges, we will also repair and do asphalt coating on the first bridge (developed in 1973) so that it can also be used when the situation demands.”Purushottam Karad, DCP (traffic), Navi Mumbai, said, “With the new bridges, the number of lanes will be doubled on the creek. So, there will be no chance of a traffic jam near the Vashi toll plaza.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/to-reduce-traffic-congestion-2-new-bridges-to-come-up-on-vashi-creek-by-oct-23-101638016802463.html

Last month, the average number of daily cases in J&K stood at 91.Even though the number of average daily tests in the union territory went up by 14 per cent in the past 10 days than the period of November 1-16, the lieutenant governor on Friday urged officials to further increase the testing rate. Sinha reviewed the Covid situation with deputy commissioners, superintendents of police and health officials at Raj Bhavan.“During the meeting, the Lt Governor directed the health department and district administrations to increase testing with a minimum 30% share of RT-PCR tests,” the government’s information department said in an emailed statement.An analysis of the government’s daily health data on Covid-19 reveals that Jammu and Kashmir recorded 3,988 infections from November 1 to 26 of which 1805 cases or 45 per cent were reported in the past 10 days (November 17 to 26). Most of the cases in the Union territory this month came from the Kashmir valley with 3,377 infections. The month has already crossed October’s 2,819 cases mark and is almost equal to September’s 4,011 cases and August’s 3,957 cases.The month is also taking a heavy toll in terms of deaths due to Covid-19. So far, 38 people – 29 in Kashmir and nine in Jammu – have lost their lives between November 1 and 26, the highest monthly fatalities in the past four months. There were 30 fatalities due to Covid in August and 10 each in September and October.Experts are sounding the alarm over the increasing cases and higher hospital admissions, particularly in Kashmir.Professor Dr Mohammad Salim Khan, head of the department of community medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar and nodal officer Covid attributed the rise to uninhibited social gatherings and lack of Covid appropriate behaviour.“Majority of infected persons attributed their source of infection to social gatherings like marriages, condolences, get-togethers where you find almost everyone without masks and never suspect any Covid-19 cases around when you have a majority of cases without any symptoms who roam around without masks,” said Khan in a social media post.“Kindly wear a mask, maintain social distance and break the chain of Covid-19 transmission,” he said. L-G Sinha also expressed dismay over the flouting of permitted limit rules on social gatherings.“The L-G asked the respective DCs and SPs to ensure that Covid protocols and measures put in place to prevent the spread of the virus are followed in letter and spirit,” the government statement said.Sinha impressed upon the Deputy Commissioners and health teams to ensure rapid vaccination, covid appropriate behaviour, community awareness, and quick execution of micro-containment zones to tackle the surge in certain districts.“We can effectively prevent the spread and recurrence of the pandemic only by strict implementation of Covid guidelines,” he said and asked the DCs to complete the pendency of the second vaccination dose, wherever due, at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-j-k-to-up-testing-101638016438324.html

The charging point is kept outside the Jewel of Navi Mumbai in Nerul.“By August 2022, the plan is to have 20 charging places in the city with six points at each location that will make it 120 charging points in the city. Even the one in Nerul will have six points, but as of now we would be starting with two points as an introduction to the public. The idea is to encourage people to go for electric bikes that would help in reducing carbon footprints in the city,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.NMMC has been taking initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint in the city. One such initiative that has clicked well is of the Yulu bikes and cycles. Even as the corporation has been promoting the ‘go green’ concept, there were no charging stations in the city and hence the plan to have charging stations came up.Of the 20 places planned, six would be in Nerul, four in Belapur while Koparkhairane, Ghansoli, Sanpada and Vashi would have one each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/first-e-charging-point-in-navi-mumbai-at-nerul-ready-with-eye-on-reducing-carbon-footprints-101638013202505.html

27-11-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: SaaS ‘Lego bricks’ re-create a smarter workplace||The Pune-based enterprise SaaS platform Zvolv is an intelligent no-code, or low-code, platform for automating business processes. In the words of Zvolv’s co-founders Hardik Gandhi and Sujoy Chakravarty, it’s the “Lego Bricks” version of application development with the best combination of features, flexibility and price. Every technology component that you need to build a complex enterprise application is pre-build, pre-tested and available for you to configure and stitch together as you want in this intelligent process automation platform for enterprises. In the beginning…Gandhi and Chakravarty share a lot of things in common. They studied in St Vincent’s school and later went to the College of Engineering Pune (COEP). Post-graduation they both moved to Bengaluru and joined Texas Instruments. Gandhi later moved to the USA to pursue his higher education and Chakravarty stayed in Bengaluru to build a new start-up. Says Gandhi, “After working at TI and Apple and observing other companies too, we had a few ideas about improving the employee experience at workplaces. Companies still work with tools that were designed years ago. Employees are using state-of-the-art applications in their daily lives, but when it comes to work applications, those are large antiquated applications which are cumbersome to use. So, we thought why not build applications to manage the employee work-life?”“We started to build a proof-of-concept to validate our ideas. We wanted this to be an enterprise product. We hired some IITians and did some experiments. In 2018 we had something worthy to show,” Gandhi added.Proof of concept (POC)After the POC was ready, Gandhi decided to move back to India in 2018. Chakravarty, a repeat entrepreneur, too moved from Bengaluru to Pune. The duo considered Pune over Bengaluru to start their venture as the tech-talent pool was much better in Pune and that they also could leverage their connects. Says Gandhi, “When I was in the US during the initial days, we had setup a team here to run the initial experiments. There were four to five people at that time in the team. Chakravarty and I thought these engineers can start building a product. In 2018 we decided to actually start setting up and running a company. We were around 12 people at that time. Chakravarty actually did the initial hiring mostly through the contacts that we had. Later on, very senior people took pay cuts to join us. As founders we were very liberal and open about distributing equity and ESOPs to our employees.”Customers ring inGandhi believes it’s the value of connections when you are a startup in the early stages. “The connection at Future Group happened through a banker who was a part of the team which was evaluating us for their use case. It’s all about demonstrating value to anyone that you meet and work with, and eventually that leads to some connect or other. The other two big customers - Dominos and Titan – came through a public event and during our participation in the Wadhwani accelerator respectively. These first three customers were acquired even before we formally launched a product. We didn’t really build a sales team in the early stage. We got all this organic growth. Now we have to have proper sales team to generate leads from scratch,” Gandhi said.“The first 20 customers are still with us. We had the writing on the wall that we will make sure we never lose our first 10 customers and we have ensured that. A lot of our success is because of them. Now we have a total of 35 enterprise customers of which a third are large companies, and others are mid-sized companies,” he added. Seed fundingSays Gandhi, “Three big enterprises using our product gave us confidence and hence, we decided to raise a seed funding round of $0.5 million. I had put in around $0.5 million while we were bootstrapped. Angel investors, CEOs and CIOs of companies joined this round and we used that money to hire a stronger engineering team. We were focussed on India as a base and we ‘stress-tested’ our product as India has a varied set of users, with finicky demands of customers which pushed us to build all kinds of flexibility into the product.”“During Covid we decided to double down on the accumulated customers. Our focus this year was what we can do in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Middle East market. Earlier in the year we got Srivatsan Srinivasan, a veteran from Salesforce, who wanted to be part of our team. It was a great validation for us. He joined as board advisor and then took an executive role as chief revenue officer. He became a part of our leadership team which gave us confidence to expand. In the last two years we have got clients like Swiggy, Lenskart and partners like KPMG and Accenture. Now we are a 30-member strong team and continuing to hire as much as we can,” added Gandhi.Employee churn“Today, hiring is one of the biggest challenges for a young company,” says Gandhi. “We are lucky that lot of our early employees are excited about the platform and its future potential and that they are all still around us. With a solid leadership base, we can keep on hiring younger people underneath and thus handling churn in the right way.”On ESOP, Gandhi says, “In today’s day and age it can be your life changing event if you have enough equity in a company that is fast growing and goes through an exit. That’s what excites a lot of employees joining. Your return on equity can be multi-fold compared to the salary you are losing out by working with a younger startup. A lot of our employees are in our ESOP pool and are getting more and more equity. We have demonstrated every year that the value of the equity keeps on growing as we are raising funding at higher and higher valuations. They see the growth and future potential roadmap and that’s what motivates them to stick on.”Funding and expansionElaborating on the expansion plans, Gandhi said, “Our India operations are now self-sustainable, but not enough to expand in other geographies. So we raised just enough money to run the experiments in APAC and the Middle East. JSW Ventures, a tech focused venture capital fund and Riso Capital, a Silicon Valley- based VC fund that invests in India-based startups solving global problems at scale, had showed an interest and we started engaging with them. We raised $1.5million this month and now we are aggressively building out a proper global sales infrastructure and process.”“JSW brings a lot of large industry exposure for us while Riso Capital brings us the Silicon Valley connection, where they can help us in all aspects of migrating our company to US at some point. We also have individual advisors who have reinvested and who come from the ‘large industry’ background,” he stated.Impact of CovidThe impact of Covid-19 was positive for platforms like Zvolv. “A lot of enterprises saw the need for evolving their legacy applications to modern no-code or low-code platforms. IT teams were backlogged during the outbreak and hence, building apps was least priority for them. So, the natural alternative was the no-code, low-code platforms.”“As a platform, Zvolv reduces or eliminates dependence on developers for developing enterprise applications. It is designed for business users to conceptualise, experiment and build applications by themselves. Some support is needed to ensure IT security and scalability and compliance aspects,” claims Gandhi. Future plansWith its international expansion in the offing, Zvolv will now compete with global giants on their turf. Says Gandhi, “There are a very few enterprise companies from India that have become global success stories. Along with a focus on customer success and on the products’ UI/UX, we are expanding in APAC and Middle East and will generate a few million-dollar revenues from those geographies in addition to India. We will also be raising a Series A from US based investors towards end of next year. We want to utilise that money specifically to make an entry into the US market and to make any meaningful entry to the US enterprise market you need to raise about $10 million dollars to have enough of a presence there.”“In the next three years we want to be at a $50 million revenue run rate. And in five years we want to be a $1 billion revenue company and not a $1 billion valuation company,” said Gandhi. CompetitorsExplaining the market potential for no-code, low-code platforms Gandhi says: This is a $30 billion dollar market in the next four years and this number has increased significantly post-Covid.”“It’s a crowded space from the competition perspective. There are three categories of players in this segment. Large enterprise legacy players like Pegasystems, Apian and Servicenow; Rapid application development platforms like Outsystem or Mendix; and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) players like UIPath. We consider all as competitors because the boundaries between these three segments is blurred. Everyone wants to offer end-to-end integrated solutions and the industry is consolidating,” stated Gandhi.Investor speak“Zvolv’s intelligent no-code platform is creating immense value for their customers. We are seeing accelerated demand for platforms like Zvolv that empower businesses to rapidly design and implement secure applications. We are excited to partner with Zvolv to help in fuelling their growth, product innovation, and expanding the global footprint. We believe that Zvolv is well positioned to become a global leader in the no-code intelligent business process automation marke,” says Sachin Tagra, Partner, JSW Ventures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-saas-lego-bricks-re-create-a-smarter-workplace-101638010977093.html
27-11-2021||Pune||Pune theatres to operate at 100% capacity, cultural programs permitted in open spaces||Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar announced fresh relaxations in Pune on Saturday after conducting a Covid-19 review meeting after a gap of over a month. Pawar announced that the restrictions of only 50% capacity in establishments such theatres, auditoriums would be eased from December 1. Offering relief to the organisers of cultural programmes, Pawar announced that events, and musical festivals would be allowed on open grounds in adherence with Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. “Schools are reopening so there is no point in keeping this 50% limit. Currently, the Covid-19 situation is under control but a new variant has put everyone on alert. Regarding the new variant, we will follow whatever instructions are given by the Union government. In Pune, from December, the restriction of 50% occupancy is being removed in establishments like theatres but the adherences to Covid-19 protocols are a must,” said Ajit Pawar while addressing a press conference after the review meeting. The Maharashtra government, after a gap of five months, had allowed theatres and auditoriums to reopen with 50% seating capacity from October 22, though cinema hall owners and film personalities have been complaining about its adverse impact on business. Pawar did not specify anything about restaurants, but Pune Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar said eateries will also be allowed to function with 100% capacity. “Will issue the orders soon,” Vikram Kumar told Hindustan Times over a text message. On Friday, Pune district reported 231 fresh Covid-19 cases with three fatalities. In the past two weeks, the number of active Covid-19 cases in Pune city alone has jumped from 647 to 823. While the number of critical cases has not shown any drastic change due to patients resorting to temporary solutions and over-the-counter medication according to doctors, the surge in active cases has prompted the civic body not to shut down jumbo centres, yet. According to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data, in the past two weeks between November 8 and 24, the number of active Covid-19 cases has risen by 176. However, the number of critical cases has not changed during that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-theatres-to-operate-at-100-capacity-cultural-programs-permitted-in-open-spaces-101638010796573.html

Also read: Shiromani Akali Dal leaders arrested outside Punjab CM Channi’s houseSidhu’s statement came even as Badal and senior SAD leaders courted arrest outside chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s official residence in Chandigarh to protest the alleged plan of the state government to arrest former minister Bikram Singh Majithia in a fake drugs case. Sidhu, who was in Amritsar to preside over public meetings in his constituency, said the SAD president has been lying to the media that he (Sidhu) had met the DGP. “I don’t backstab. He (Sukhbir) should prove that I met Sahota, the blue-eyed boy of former police chief Sumedh Singh Saini. I have been against him (Sahota) since the day he was appointed. I have been raising the issue of sacrilege since the first cabinet meeting. When I meet him, I will tell the world. It is your job to meet stealthily at your farmhouses,” Sidhu said at a press conference after the public meetings. He said unlike the Badals, he did not own any transport, sand mine or hotel. “You are in fear that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is conducting raids. The raids are being conducted on Fastway (cable network) against which I had been raising a voice. Those who held monopoly are being found to have transactions with the accounts owned by you and your men,” he said. Sidhu said the Badals had looted the people of the state for their personal benefits, besides working as puppets in the hands of the central government. “Now the people’s government will be elected and the benefits will go back to the people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-dares-sukhbir-to-prove-he-met-punjab-dgp-against-majithia-101638010256372.html

Thanks to the Allahabad high court who did not allow this intention of the previous government to succeed,” he said.In 2013, the then SP-ruled UP government issued an order for withdrawal of cases against the Ayodhya serial blast accused as it believed them to be “innocent Muslims” implicated in false cases. The order was stayed by the Allahabad high court.Elections to 403 assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh are due early next year.

He will be visiting various places in Punjab over the next month and announce the party’s programmes for the state and its people. Addressing a press conference in Punjab during his last visit, Kejriwal had said, “We will improve Punjab government schools just like we have improved Delhi government schools; only we know how to do it, no other party does. I guarantee to resolve multiple issues of teachers on an emergency basis.” He also announced an eight-point poll plank to transform the education sector in the state, including regularising the services of contractual teachers. He had also promised to implement a transfer policy for teachers and assured them cashless medical treatment facilities if the party comes to power.

27-11-2021||Delhi||RML, Lady Hardinge resident doctors protest over delayed NEET counseling||Resident doctors of three central hospitals – RML, Safdarjung, and Lady Hardinge - on Saturday suspended OPD services in protest against the repeated delay in conducting NEET-PG 2021 counseling.The move was following a nationwide call by the Federation of Resident Doctors' Association (FORDA) for suspension of out-patient department (OPD) services at hospitals from November 27."Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, admission to various courses in NEET PG 2021 has been delayed indefinitely. The residents are carrying both Covid and non-Covid services tirelessly in the last one-and-a-half years and exhausted both physically and mentally."They have been waiting patiently till date for some positive outcome of the Supreme Court proceedings in the matter of already delayed NEET PG 2021 counselling. However, there seems no respite to their physical and mental distress, with the next court hearing scheduled on January 6, 2022.“To mark our protest against these repeated delays and postponement in counseling, we the residents of ABVIMS and RML hospital decide to withdraw OPD services on Saturday, 27 November 2021 onwards, including Sunday OPDS," RML RDA said in a letter to the hospital administration.The doctors' associations demanded the government and the top court to take necessary measures to expedite the NEET PG counseling and admission process and to fast-track the court proceedings.Issuing support, AIIMS RDA also urged the Government of India to actively intervene in this matter urgently and expedite the counseling process, stating it is extremely unfortunate that NEET-PG 2021 counseling is being delayed indefinitely despite the fact that nearly two months have passed since the results of the entrance test were announced.The entrance exam that usually happens in the first quarter of the calendar year was already delayed by many months as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. This extreme delay has led to a shortage of manpower in medical colleges all across India, the AIIMS RDA said in a statement."Thousands of postgraduate seats will remain unfilled this year if the counselling remains postponed. As Covid-19 cases are increasing in many countries across the world, it is prudent that our nation remains prepared for another wave of the pandemic.“The current working pool of resident doctors are already overburdened, which can have an adverse impact on optimum delivery of healthcare services. The admission process of the new batch of residents should therefore be completed without any further delay," the statement said.In a letter to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, the FORDA had on Friday said the "already over-burdened and exhausted" resident doctors of the nation fighting at the frontline since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, waited patiently till November 25 for some positive outcome of the ongoing Supreme Court proceedings over NEET-PG 2021 counselling."However, there seems to be no respite to their physical and mental distress with the next court hearing scheduled on January 6, 2022."To mark our protest against these repeated delays and postponements of counselling, following discussion with representatives of multiple Resident Doctors Associations (RDA) across the nation, we have decided to withdraw from Out Patient Department (OPD) services, Saturday, November 27 onwards," FORDA said.They urged the Union Government and the Supreme Court of India to take note of the grievance of resident doctors of the nation and to take necessary measures for expediting the NEET-PG 2021 counseling as well as the admission process and to fast-track the court proceedings on an urgent basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rml-lady-hardinge-resident-doctors-protest-over-delayed-neet-counseling-101638000316011.html

27-11-2021||Chandigarh||JP Nadda rules out change of guard after BJP debacle in Himachal byelections||BJP national president JP Nadda on Friday put to rest all speculations about a possible change of guard in Himachal Pradesh. “I’ve heard the speculation, but a party doesn’t function on what’s being said on social media,” Nadda said while virtually addressing the state executive meeting of the Himachal Pradesh BJP. In his 44-minute speech, he made every attempt to boost the party’s morale. “I’m confident that party workers will put in united efforts to strengthen the BJP in the state and the Jai Ram Thakur government to ensure victory in the assembly elections,” he said. After the BJP’s defeat in the recently held byelections, rumours were rife that the party may change its chief minister. Instead, Nadda heaped praises on the CM and his government for their performance despite the challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic. Targets dynastic politics During the three-day meeting of the BJP state executive, he said a roadmap would have been laid out to strengthen the party and the government. “Today, the BJP is the only party in which a person coming from a common man’s family can become a chief minister, state party president and national president. All other parties are family-based, including the Congress. For them, the family is the party, but in the BJP, the party is the family,” he said. Nadda said the BJP has cultural nationalism as its principle and works for the downtrodden. “I want to remind you that we are not for a position but to change the destiny of society, state and the country. Therefore, we are associated with the principle of integral-humanism. Antyodaya is our mantra and empowerment of the poorest of the poor our objective,” he said, adding Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expanded the ambit of Antyodaya with his “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas aur Sabka Prayas”. Become agent of change, workers told Stressing on the self-introspection from time to time, Nadda said, every party worker should improve their competence and skill and become an agent of change in society. “Those who don’t change cannot be agents of change. When you are in a political party, you have to work hard and change with the time. It will benefit the party and the governments,” he said. He said the BJP has grown rapidly in Himachal and has a presence in all 7,792 polling booths besides the party implemented Vistarak and e-Vistarak programmes, the model which is being now implemented across the country. He said Himachal Pradesh has progressed in every sphere, including health, education and road transport. “Due to the benevolence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the state has premiere institutes coming up, including AIIMS, Bilaspur, four medical colleges and a PGI satellite centre,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jp-nadda-rules-out-change-of-guard-after-bjp-debacle-in-himachal-byelections-101637980313151.html

The slain guide was identified as Mohammad Arif of Matrian village in Khuiratta area of Pak-occupied-Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “Late Thursday, Pakistani terrorists attempted an infiltration bid along the LoC in the Bhimber Gali sector. However, the alert Indian troops successfully foiled the infiltration attempt and killed a terrorist.” The body of the terrorist along with weapon and ammunition was recovered, he added. Intelligence officials said the slain terrorist was actually a notorious guide of the terrorists. “He used to guide Pakistani terrorists in small groups into this side of the LoC. Late Thursday, he was again guiding a group of three to four terrorists into Poonch when alert soldiers noticed the movement and opened fire killing him on the spot. The group immediately fled back to the PoJK,” said an intelligence official. He informed that Arif was responsible for the successful infiltration of small groups of terrorists into J&K for nearly two decades. Pakistan’s ISI had been actively supporting him, he added. It may be recalled here that the Army lost nine soldiers, including two JCOs, on October 11 and 14 at the Chamrer and Nar Khas forests in Poonch district in two separate encounters with terrorists. These were the worst casualties suffered by the Army in the recent years.DGP Dilbag Singh suspected them to be part of the freshly infiltrated group of terrorists and hoped that the RR troops will account for them.Since October 11, the Army has launched a massive search and combing operation in Nar Khas, Bhata Dhurian and Chamrer areas of the district.Intelligence sources said the slain guide was earlier a havildar in the Pakistan army and after retirement was commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba launch pads located in Dharkundi-Khuraitta. “He was well versed with the terrain and guided Pakistan’s Special Services Group (SSG) into the Indian territory in Nowshera in October 2018 where BAT action was carried out. On his retirement from the Pakistan army, Arif was given land in Khuraitta where he raised some structure and housed terrorists before launching them into India,” they said. “He was the main conduit between the ISI and terror outfits and received big money from the Pakistan army. His family is settled in Dubai,” they said. “Arif was the main guide for the LeT in the area and was in-charge of terror launch pads in Tarakundi area. He has two sons who are settled in Dubai. After retirement from the Pakistan army, he was working for the ISI,” said sources. On October 22, 2018, Pakistan’s BAT had ambushed an Indian Army patrol along the LoC in the Sunderbani area of the Nowshera sector killing Havildar Kaushal Kumar of Nowshera, Lance Naik Ranjeet Singh of Doda and Rifleman Rajat Kumar Basan of Pallanwala. The intruders had come inside the Indian territory and ambushed the patrol. The soldiers had also retaliated eliminating two BAT members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/army-foils-intrusion-bid-on-loc-in-poonch-pakistani-guide-killed-101637960028996.html

27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Shimla: Will launch drive to propagate govt’s policies among masses, says BJP state chief Suresh Kashyap||Owning the responsibility for the party’s defeat in the recently concluded bypolls to three assemblies and one parliamentary seat, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state chief Suresh Kashyap admitted the party was not able to propagate the policies and programmes of the government at the ground level.“The party will work hard and launch a state-wide programme to propagate the policies of the Jai Ram Thakur government among the people,” said Kashyap while addressing mediapersons in Shimla. Kashyap admitted that shortcomings in the party, complacent cadres, overconfidence and sympathy in favour of deceased Congress leaders, including former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, led to the party’s defeat in the elections. However, he repeatedly parried questions when asked about infighting in the party. “I accept the responsibility for the defeat. The party will work on the shortcomings and infuse a new strength in the cadres,” he said. However, he did not come clear whether changes in the organisation was on the cards. Discuss shortcomings with state leadership, Dhumal tells party workersFormer chief minister Prof Prem Kumar Dhumal on Friday said programmes that the BJP would decide as its future strategy would have to be implemented on the ground and the public welfare schemes of the Centre and state government must also be propagated by the workers among the common man. The BJP veteran was addressing the party executive committee meeting in Shimla. He said the party would listen to all its workers and form the government again in 2022 by taking the workers along. Dhumal said if the BJP had become the biggest party today, it was due to its workers who toiled hard for many years. “If a worker finds any shortcoming in the functioning of the party or otherwise, he or she must discuss it with the state leadership,” he said. “Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done a lot for the country and the state and it really makes a difference as the country has been strengthened under his leadership. “We all have to think in the interest of the party, think about the workers and work in a positive direction. Lotus will bloom once again in Himachal,” said Dhumal. He said the BJP does not enjoy the power but serve the people of the state, especially unprivileged and downtrodden sections of society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shimla-will-launch-drive-to-propagate-govt-s-policies-among-masses-says-bjp-state-chief-suresh-kashyap-101637959249779.html
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||What is stopping Punjab govt from acting against drug mafia, asks Navjot Sidhu||Intensifying his attack on the Charanjit Singh Channi-led government on drugs and sacrilege issues, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday asked under whose fear it was not taking action against those running the drug business in the state. It came a day after Sidhu threatened to fast unto death if the Congress government did not make the report of the special task force (STF) on drugs public and justice was not delivered in the sacrilege cases.Addressing a press conference in Amritsar, the cricketer-turned-politician said, “Being the PPCC president, I have met lakhs of party workers. There are two core issues for them — the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and the drug smuggling. Raising these issues is my duty.”The government, he added, should at least follow the directions of the high court which this year underlined that drug suppliers were enjoying political patronage while small fish were being made scapegoat. Citing the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) figures, the Congress leader said Punjab topped the chart in drug-related crimes. Referring to former CM Amarinder Singh, he said, “People who have been removed now had promised to end these crimes in four weeks. A report the Enforcement Directorate (ED) was handed over to the Punjab Police’s STF in November 2017 on direction of the high court. The STF’s report was submitted to the court in February 2018. On both occasions, the HC ordered to take action as per the law. But what stops them from acting is beyond my comprehension.” On the sacrilege issue, Sidhu said the court had asked the government to file chargesheet within six months. “Six months have passed now but the chargesheet is nowhere. How can we get justice when you ensure blanket bail to former DGP Sumedh Saini who is a prime accused?” he asked. Casting aspersions on the intent of the government, he said, “If Saini was granted this bail, why has the government not filed a special leave petition (SLP) against the move in court even after two-and-a-half months?”Replying to a query, he said, “Some of the measures taken by the Channi government recently came only after I raised the issue. There is no lack of coordination between the government and the party.”Taking a jibe against his predecessor Sunil Jakhar, he said, “The previous president is active posting tweets. Has he ever raised his voice?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/what-is-stopping-punjab-govt-from-acting-against-drug-mafia-asks-navjot-sidhu-101637959128862.html
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Month after Deep Nagar road cave-in, shopkeepers agitate over slow pace of repair work||A month after the Deep Nagar Road had to be cordoned off due to a cave-in on October 28, shopkeepers in the area staged a protest against the municipal corporation alleging that the slow pace of the repair work had hit their business. The shopkeepers also blocked the main road near the Dandi Swami Chowk for around half-an-hour, disturbing the movement of traffic. The protesting shopkeepers said that it had been a month since the road had caved-in, but the civic body had till not installed new sewer and water lines. “A stretch of around 200ft has been dug up, leaving no space for movement of traffic, due to which there is meagre footfall in the market,” said the traders, who were protesting under the banner of the Deep Nagar Shopkeepers Association. Around 100 shops have been hit due to the road cave-in, and subsequent repair work. Shopkeepers’ association president Tarun Kumar said no business was seen in the area even on Diwali. “The shopkeepers are a harried lot and are struggling to make ends meet. The MC officials are not paying heed, which has forced us to stage a protest,” said Kumar. One of the shopkeepers Narinder said, “Tenants are the worst affected, as they are struggling to make rent. Business was already in a slump after the pandemic broke out last year, and this has added to the woes of the shopkeepers. The MC officials have failed to expedite work, despite repeated complaints, said Narindr, a shopkeeper.MC sub-divisional officer (SDO) Anshul Garcha said, “It is difficult to lay sewer and water supply lines in the area as it is a narrow street, and work has to be done very carefully so that the foundations of the houses and shops are not damaged. Most of the work has been done, and repair work will be completed in four to five days.”Mayor Balkar Sandhu said he had also directed officials to expedite work. Two students and a woman had a narrow escape after a major portion of the Deep Nagar main road had caved-in on October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-month-after-deep-nagar-road-cave-in-shopkeepers-agitate-over-slow-pace-of-repair-work-101637959008962.html

Meanwhile, hundreds of vehicles were stuck in a jam in areas surrounding Jagraon Bridge. Alleging police inaction, Punjab Shiv Sena (Bal Thakeray) spokesperson Chandarkant Chadha said that two days had passed since the carcasses had been found in the plot. However, the police did not take any action, apart from lodging an FIR. “Cows are sacred to the Hindus, but someone had deliberately thrown their carcasses in the plot to hurt the community’s sentiments.” “Today’s protest was symbolic, and only held for an hour. However, if the police do not arrest the accused within two days, protests will erupt across Punjab,” he said. Detours and diversions With protesters blocking the Jagraon Bridge, traffic from the Jalandhar Bypass was diverted to Samrala Chowk to avoid traffic jams. Similarly, traffic coming from Sahnewal was also diverted on Gill Road from Vishwakarma Chowk. Some vehicles were also diverted from Lakkar Bridge.Ashish Arora, a resident of Gill road, said “I was en route to pick up my daughter from school, but was stuck in a jam on Jagraon Bridge. I had to request her teacher to keep an eye on her, till I reached school. Protesting is our right, but protestors should not harass people by blocking roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/killing-of-bovines-shiv-sena-blocks-traffic-at-jagraon-bridge-in-ludhiana-101637958588622.html
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Will contest against minister Mohindra, says suspended Patiala mayor Bittu||Sanjiv Sharma Bittu, who was suspended on Thursday from the post of Patiala mayor by the municipal corporation (MC) general house, announced to contest the assembly elections against local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, who, according to him, orchestred the plan to remove him. “To promote his son, Mohindra misused government machinery against me and my supporters. Now, I will contest against him from the Patiala (Rural) assembly seat. I will ensure his defeat as he did all this to remove me as mayor,” said Bittu. He will contest from his party of former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s newly floated outfit, Punjab Lok Congress. In 2020, Mohindra had tasked the Patiala Improvement Trust to undertake development works in the Patiala (Rural) segment by taking it out of mayor’s purview. The civic body on Friday made public the general house proceeding of mayor’s suspension signed by senior deputy mayor Yoginder Yogi. With this, the commissioner asked Bittu to return the official vehicle. The orders for vacating the official accommodation will be issued the next working day, it is learnt. Amarinder, who participated in the proceedings, said he will approach the Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday against the move. “Whatever happened in the general house was illegal. There is no provision of suspension of mayor in the Municipal Corporation Act. One can only remove a mayor by passing no-confidence motion with two third-majority of the house, which they didn’t have. I have asked my lawyers to prepare the case against this illegality of the state government,” said Amarinder.Of the 30 councillors from his assembly segment, 25 are with him, he said. “Even two councillors from Mohindra’s segment are with me. The government used police to threaten my supporters which I will not tolerate,” he added.Yoginder Yogi held meetings of councillors to speed up development works. “Bittu had stalled development works as he was incompetent. Now, the process has been reinitiated to complete the majority of works before elections,” said Harvinder Nippy, who led a group of councillors against the suspended mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-contest-against-minister-mohindra-says-suspended-patiala-mayor-bittu-101637958172253.html
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana mayor gives green light to ₹5 hike in bus fare||The mayor and municipal commissioner gave the nod to increase the bus fare by ₹5 and extend the route of city buses to 5km beyond the city limits on Friday.The decision was taken during an all-party meeting held at the mayor’s office near the Rose Garden. Leader of opposition SAD councillor Jaspal Giaspura, BJP councillor Sunita Rani, and LIP councillor Swarandeep Chahal were among those who attended the meeting. The resolution will be tabled before the Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited board of directors for final approval. At present, the contractor charges ₹5 for the first 5km, ₹10 for 10km, ₹15 for 15km and an additional 75 paisa per kilometre beyond it. The rates have been increased by ₹5 under all the categories.The fare has been increased on the condition that the contractor will run all the 83 buses handed over to him, service will be provided on more city routes, and he will withdraw the case filed against the MC seeking fare revision. Service to extend to 7 routes Around 12 buses are operational on two city routes at present. It has been proposed that the service will be extended to at least seven more routes after the fare is increased.In the wake of the rising diesel prices, the contractor had warned the MC that he would surrender the contract, if the fare was not increased. The contractor had said that diesel was being sold at ₹48 per litre when the contract was signed in 2015, but diesel rates have almost doubled, due to which it was difficult to run the buses without increasing the fare.The city bus service, which provided the only public transport facility in the district, has been in deep waters for a long time. Of the 120 buses purchased under the project, 83 have been handed over to the contractor, but only 12 are being plied, while others gather dust at depot. The remaining 37 buses in the civic body’s possession are also not in use.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said nod was given to increase the fare due to the increase in prices of fuel, and after considering the Chandigarh model. Officials have been directed to finalise more routes where the service will be resumed in the coming days.Political implications An MC official, requesting anonymity, said that the Congress party also has vested interest in resolving the issue as the assembly polls are in the offing, and the city bus service is usually a hot-button issue. The Opposition, too, has been taking digs at the Congress party, saying that its leaders had been protesting to improve the city bus service during the SAD-BJP regime in the state, but had themselves failed on the front.In a nutshellMayor Balkar Sandhu said nod was given to increase the fare due to the increase in prices of fuel, and after considering the Chandigarh model.

27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab sets fresh Covid testing target after Centre flags low sample collection||With the central government flagging low testing in Punjab and some other states, the state health department on Friday set a daily target of collecting at least 60,000 samples in all districts. Punjab’s average testing in November remained around 23,000 tests a day. In the past around one week, the state carried out nearly 17,500 tests a day. The state’s highest daily testing was recorded at 82,000 during the second wave of the pandemic. According to the Centre’s directions, Punjab should be conducting minimum 50,000 tests a day despite low positivity rate, a senior health department official said. The Centre’s fresh concern comes in the wake of reports of third and fourth wave hitting different countries. The Punjab health department claims that the state’s 2,400 tests a day per million is much better than what the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s recommendation of 150 tests per million. The state’s data reveals that 51,674 tests per every lakh population are being conducted. “Since our positivity rate is low, so are the follow-up samples. Moreover, a change has been witnessed in the behaviour of people as well. The threat of Covid has decreased because of sharp decline in cases and people are now staying away from testing,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. Of a total of 6,15,351 tests conducted by the health department in November, 753 persons were found positive with a positivity rate of 0.12%. A senior official said both testing and the vaccination were hit badly due to the strike by various employee unions demanding job regularisation ahead of the assembly polls. With the state bracing for the assembly polls early next year, gatherings of people are going to increase with each passing day. “This is why we have directed all the district health administrations to increase their testing to collect 60,000 samples a day. Directions have been issued to the civil surgeons,” the nodal officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sets-fresh-covid-testing-target-after-centre-flags-low-sample-collection-101637957631244.html
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||ED freezes ₹7-cr bank deposits; I-T raids Fastway cable owner’s properties||A day after raiding properties belonging to Fastway Cable Network owner Gurdeep Singh Jujhar and his contacts, including former Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) chief engineer Surinder Pal Singh alias Pehalwan, in Punjab and Chandigarh, the enforcement directorate (ED) froze the fixed deposits totalling around ₹6.70 crore and five lockers in connection with a money laundering case, the central agency said on Friday. The ED officials said the fixed deposits belong to Gurmesh Singh Gill, who is also one of the accused in the case.Also, income tax officials on Friday raided about a dozen properties linked to Jujhar in Ludhiana, Mohali and Haryana. A team of around 100 income tax officials searched Jujhar’s properties and offices in Ludhiana. The ED had raided properties of Jujhar, Pehalwan and his kin, Tarandeep Sangha and Gurmesh Singh Gill at eight locations in Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Mohali, Banga (SBS Nagar) on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday and seized more than ₹10 lakh in cash, some foreign currency, documents and cell phones. An official said the ED launched money laundering investigations in April 2021 in consequence to an FIR and charge sheet filed by the Punjab Vigilance Bureau against Pehalwan and his associates in 2017 for allegedly misusing his official position and favoured some companies in allotting multi-crore projects. It is alleged that the proceeds of illegal income was invested in bogus firms in the name of Pehalwan’s family members and his close associates. The VB had arrested Pehalwan, who is reportedly close to the Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, on June 9, 2017, after it found he allotted works totalling ₹1,200 crore at exorbitant rates to favour some private companies. He was accused of parking his black money in accounts of bogus firms and family members. According to the VB probe, Pehalwan had registered three fake companies in the name of family members and made transactions of hundreds of crores. During his GMADA stint, he allegedly formed a fake construction company, Ek Onkar Builders and Construction Pvt. Ltd., and illegally allotted tenders, thereby amassing ill-gotten money to the tune of ₹400 crore. Pehalwan had joined the Punjab Mandi Board as a junior engineer in 1993. He became a superintending engineer in GMADA in 2014 and officiated as a chief engineer there from 2016. In September 2019, the VB attached 59 properties of the former GMADA chief engineer, amounting to ₹26 crore on the orders of a Mohali court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ed-freezes-7-cr-bank-deposits-i-t-raids-fastway-cable-owner-s-properties-101637957508362.html

27-11-2021||Chandigarh||HT Readers’ take| Ghaggar choking on a stream of toxic waste||Use treated water for cleaning roads, bus standsWe as a community must explore new technology that can help us control pollution. At the outset, the waste water from hospitals and factories must be properly treated before being released into water bodies. Better still, the treated water must be used for gardening and cleaning of roads, bus stands, railway stations etc. Sensors must be installed in rivers and other water bodies so that these can send alerts in case the pollution levels go beyond permissible limits. The cleaning agents used in homes, such as detergents, should also be environment friendly so as to reduce toxic waste. Deepak Kanojia, ChandigarhHuman activities harming the environmentPollution is one of the most pressing issues of our times. It is sad that humans are themselves engaging in activities harmful for their health. Apart from untreated factory waste and sewage, religious offerings wrapped in plastic and idol immersions also pollute the water bodies. Authorities should work to the stop all kinds of non-biodegradable waste from contaminating the water bodies. Krrish Madaan, AmbalaReduce use of toxic chemicalsWe should cut down on the use of toxic chemicals, which come in the form of daily use items such as cleaning agents, fertilizers and pesticides, which ultimately pollute our water bodies and enter our food chain. Other steps, such as planting more trees to stop erosion into the water bodies and having fauna that control the pH-levels of the water body will also. It is shameful that the rivulets flowing through Chandigarh, a city that boasts of being one of the cleanest and well-planned cities of the country, are polluted. Vineet Gandhi, ChandigarhLay sewer lines in periphery villagesProper treatment of waste water can go a long way in controlling the Ghaggar river pollution. Villages in the periphery that are still devoid of a proper sewerage system would do well to take corrective measures. We need to make the general public aware of the harmful activities that cause pollution and sensitise them to stop such activities. It is on our generation to act when we can, or the subsequent generations will pay the price for our negligence. We need to get innovative to plug all pollution points , impose penalty on those causing pollution and create a common platform to address the issue.Anju Mohan, PanchkulaTricity authorities must work togetherThe authorities of Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali must work together to plug sewage and other waste water from mixing with the water bodies. Sewage and waste water, especially those coming from industries, must be treated and used for gardening, cleaning etc. The centre must take the lead in the cleaning of the Ghaggar river and frame laws to ensure that environmental norms are not violated. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliA wake up call for authorities More than the effluents from industrial units , it is the untreated sewage and open defecation in in villages and colonies located close to the banks of Sukna and N-Choe that make polluted the Ghaggar river near Zirakpu. The authorities concerned must take immediate steps to provide a proper sewerage system with septic tanks to stop the sewage from flowing into these choes and ultimately the Ghaggar river. Chandigarh has lost its reputation of a clean city with its sanitation ranking going lower every year just because authorities appear to be in deep slumber. SC Luthra, ChandigarhStrict ban on dumping waste in streamsOne of the main reasons for pollution in tricity is dumping of waste along the open nullah’s and sewage water getting into nullah. The not only causes pollution but also becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes, which lead to spread of diseases such as dengue and malaria. Residents living in sectors through which the N-choe passes often complain of foul smell. The authorities have not been able to clean the nullah even though this has been an old problem. Authorities should strictly ban the dumping of waste in nullah as a first step. Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliStop flow of untreated sewage into GhaggarStop the discharge of untreated sewage into seasonal rivulets passing through the city. Pollution of Sukhna choe and N-choe, which ultimately merge into the Ghaggar river, must be checked. Sewage must not discharged into the rivulets and the municipal corporation has the responsibility of ensuring this. Residents of colonies living on the banks of Ghaggar and in areas from where the two streams flow, must be sensitised about their responsibility of ensuring that the water bodies are not polluted. For this, they must stop dumping garbage into it and ensure that their localities have a proper sewerage system.Vijay Malia, ChandigarhHuman malice causing environmental degradationEarlier, residents used to treat the water bodies as sacrosanct and refrain from polluting these in any form. But over the years, malice crept in and residents started violating the environment for their own selfish reasons. The n-choe, which passes through Chandigarh and subsequently merges into the Ghaggar, is one of the best examples of how selfish human activities can lead to environmental degradation. The n-choe is polluted even by irresponsible hospital and clinic owners who discharge their biomedical waste into this season stream while authorities turn a blind eye to it. While authorities must bring in strict enforcement measures, such a fines, for checking such as activities, non-governmental organisations and religious bodies can also play a role in sensitising the public. Kundan Lal Sharma, MohaliAct before it’s too latePollution of all forms—air, water and soil—is increasing at a rapid rate. To check this, authorities must take strict action against all activities that lead to pollution. It is important so that our future generations don’t pay the price for our selfish activities. Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurLeave no stone unturned to check pollutionOn matters related to the environment, the administrations of the three cities that form the tricity—Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali – must work as a unit. It is due to the lack of coordination between the authorities of the three cities that pollution of the water bodies goes unchecked. A special body must be constituted to ensure that sewer lines are laid in all colonies in the tricity so that the mixing of sewage into water bodies can be checked. Special budget must also be sanctioned for the laying of sewer lines in all areas devoid of it. Industries near the Ghaggar river must be shifted to some other place and waste water from such units must be properly treated. Strict action must be taken against all units discharging untreated water into the rivulets.Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhLackadaisical attitude of authorities to be blamedDuring ancient times, the rivers were considered sacred. No one was allowed to pollute the water resources and there were death penalties for polluting water. Even during the wars, ethics and rules specified that no army would pollute the water with poisonous substances to harm the enemies. Today, we have multiple agencies to check pollution but are still not able to check the menace. This is only because of the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities. In the name of development, all the natural sources of water have been blocked. Agricultural land is also being used for habitation, and that too without the proper sewerage. Industrial units have been allowed to operate without any checks. These in turn pollute the water bodies with toxic and chemical waste, which ultimately prove harmful to human beings and animals. Even if there are protests by locals or villagers against sewage or hazardous waste flowing into rivers or streams, the protests are crushed by authorities. Suresh Verma, ChandigarhBe the change you wish to seeNature nurtures. We are a threat to it. We as responsible citizens need to work in unison to conserve it. Rivulets are choked with waste and we are responsible for this. Treat water, create awareness and support positive actions in this direction. How can we expect any improvement or change when our own bureaucrats are seen using plastic bottles while holding meetings on Swachh Survekshan. Change will not take place on its own, we need to work on that. Garv Bhupesh, PanchkulaVerification before nod Discharge of industrial effluents into water bodies lower down BOD (biological oxygen demand) levels. Harmful chemicals and metals in waste water pollute the water bodies, making it unfit for human use. Animals roaming around such water bodies can drink the polluted water and get sick. Untreated polluted water can harm the crops in nearby fields too. It is laxity on the part of the government that is leading to such widespread pollution. While giving approvals to industries, the authorities must first check if it has all the environmental clearances.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliSmall changes for big impactSmall changes in our everyday lives can help us conserve the environment. Household solvents, pesticides, and cleaners might not seem that bad. But, bleach, paint, paint thinner, ammonia, and such chemical can leave a long-term impact on the environment. We should cut down on the use of such items as much as possible. Besides, using phosphate free detergents and dish cleaners is advised. We should also stop using plastic as much as possible. Ishita Nara, via emailNGT warnings fell on deaf earsEven after several warnings from the National Green Tribunal, the pollution of Ghaggar river has gone unchecked. Stricter action must be taken against the states and UTs that allow environmentally harmful activities to continue unabated. Besides, a platform must be created for those willing to work towards conserving the environment. Subhash Chugh, via emailFailure on the part of authoritiesThe failure on the part of authorities in Punjab and Chandigarh to install necessary sewage treatment plants (STP), resulting in the discharge of polluted water into Ghaggar, in appalling. The polluted water is used to farmers for cultivation of crops and washing of vegetables which are consumed by residents, ultimately affecting the food chain and public health. Despite the enactment of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which makes discharge of untreated effluents into a water body a criminal offence, the states are still struggling to prevent untreated sewage from mixing into water bodies. NGT has been passing repeated orders but to no avail. Stringent action must be taken against authorities who let such harmful activities go unchecked.Sanjay Chopra, Mohali Don’t let rivulets turn into toxic dumping groundsPollution of the tricity rivulets is serious problem, which is an outcome of the ever-growing population. Administration must take proper preventive steps to stop these rivulets from becoming toxic dumping grounds. Due to the increasing pollution, the aquatic flora and fauna have either shifted their habitats or have become extinct. CCTV cameras should be installed along the banks of these rivulets to apprehend those who are dumping garbage into these. Submersion of idols of religious festivals should be prohibited in these water bodies. Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhReader of the weekPlug the pollution pointsThe seasonal rivulets passing through Chandigarh carry sewage and industrial waste to the Ghaggar river. The administration must plug the discharge points that release polluted water into the rivulets and also punish those responsible for this. Residents must also be made aware of their responsibility towards the environment. Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd), ChandigarhExpert takeCombined effortWe (monitoring committee) had made several recommendations on Ghaggar river pollution through these choes. The three authorities should work in coordination to stop this. Justice Pritam Pal, chairman Monitoring Committee (now disbanded) of National Green TribunalSTPsWe are coming up with new sewage treatment plants and also upgrading the existing ones. Directions have already been given to the dept concerned to make sure that sewage is not discharged into any choe. Isha Kalia, Mohali deputy commissioner PhytomediationAs per the directions of the UT adviser, we have plugged most leakage points in all three choes. In Sukhna choe at Faidan village near Punjab border, the admn is planning a solution through phytomediation. NP Sharma, chief engineer, Chandigarh municipal corporation Health impactThe concentration of heavy metals such as nickel and lead cadmium are quite high in the vegetables grown in sewage water, which can harm the human body, especially lungs, kidney and liver. Waste water which contains urine and faeces lead to water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and diarrhoea.Dr Sonu Goel, professor, School of Public Health, PGIMER Residents’ roleCamps must be held to motivate residents to keep the rivulets clean. Our staff will also visit the area to clean the rivulets.

Channi, who was in Kharar to lay the foundation stone of a slew of projects worth around ₹130 crore, said: “I have been brought up in Kharar and will make it a model town.” In an earlier address at the municipal council office, the chief minister (CM) described his visit as a “homecoming”. “I started my political journey from here itself. I know every nook and corner of the city. The people of Kharar have showered immense love upon me as my voting percentage increased every time during the three times when I got elected from here as municipal councillor and also served as its president,” said Channi, adding that he would remain indebted to the people of the city. He also exhorted the councillors to work diligently and go strict especially on the illegal encroachments. ‘Latest projects will transform Kharar’The new projects include a sewerage treatment plant ( ₹59.06 crore), water treatment plant at Kajauli ( ₹47.06 crore), beautification project for both the Ajj Sarovar ( ₹4.83 crore) and Pandusar Sarovar ( ₹3.14 crore) and a Government Model Senior Secondary School at Badali village ( ₹13.47 crore). Describing the water treatment plant a “game-changer”, the CM said it would ensure clean drinking water for both Morinda and Kharar. He also highlighted the Ajj Sarovar beautification project as a long-standing dream, adding that an additional sum of ₹10 crore would be allotted for sprucing up the infrastructure in the vicinity. A development board has been constituted for it, he said.Channi earmarked ₹5 crore for the infrastructural development of the Government Model Senior Secondary School at Badali, on the condition that the village panchayat adds another three-acre land for the construction of a stadium in addition to the five acres allocated for the school. He said the school would benefit the people of as many as 37 surrounding villages.The CM also announced ₹10 and ₹2.5 crore, respectively, for laying an Astroturf at the Khalsa school and providing water supply at Gharuan village . In his address, Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu said that it is a matter of pride that a representative of the people has risen to become the CM. Lauding him for his pro-people and pro-development approach, Sandhu expressed hope that the region would undergo further development under Channi’s leadership. Protests force CM’s cavalcade to change routeChanni’s cavalcade was forced to take an alternative route due to a road blockade put up by protesters in Kharar. Holding black flags, the unions of PSPCL contractual employees and Punjab State Aides Control Society staffers had blocked the national highway under the flyover from where the cavalcade had to return after visiting Kharar. Police had to resort to mild lathicharge to stop the protesters from marching towards the function venue.

27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Neha Shoree murder: Father says SIT closed case in ‘tainted manner’||Captain Kailash Shoree, 70, father of drug officer Neha Shoree who was shot dead at her office in Kharar in 2019, has approached the Punjab and Haryana high court alleging that special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab Police closed the case in a “tainted manner “ without looking into the facts. Balwinder Singh, 49, a Morinda resident, had opened fire at Neha, zonal licensing authority of Food and Drug Administration, before shooting himself on March 29, 2019. Singh, a chemist, was nursing a grudge against Shoree for suspension of his drug licence, according to police. The fresh application has been filed in a November 13, 2019, plea in which Neha’s parents had demanded that police be asked to submit a final report before the court. In January 2020, police had filed a closure report, and subsequently, the CBI and NIA were made party on the request of petitioners. The case could not be taken up due to pandemic since April 6, 2020. Acting on the fresh application on Friday, the HC bench of justice Jaishree Thakur has advanced the hearing from April 26 to January 18, 2022. The court also asked the CBI to file a reply by then. The NIA has filed its reply and expressed inability to take over the case due to workload. While the parents allege Neha was murdered due to her honest working as she had become an irritant to drug cartels, the police probe denied the role of drug smugglers in the murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/neha-shoree-murder-father-says-sit-closed-case-in-tainted-manner-101637956131796.html
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Overflowing drains rile up residents in Ward 20||Ward No. 20 comprises Hallomajra, a semi-urban locality that was earlier a part of Ward No. 23, and Behlana village, which came under the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) in 2018 and will elect a councillor for the first time.Residents of both these localities, situated on the outskirts of the city, say they have been neglected by the MC.In Behlana, residents expected better facilities after coming under the MC, but say nothing much has changed so far. Dilapidated streets, blocked stormwater drainage, low water pressure, lack of lighting on streets and electricity wires hanging loosely on the narrow lanes are among the key irritants. Balkar Singh, 44, a Behlana resident, says: “We face water blockage very often due to lack of maintenance of drains. The surroundings used to be cleaned when the village was under a panchayat, but the things have deteriorated now.”Residents also complain of lack of parking spaces and poorly maintained public spaces, and demand a park for recreational activities.“The condition has not improved over the past two years in the village. There is no maintenance of roads and the cleanliness level has gone down,” says Rajinder Kumar, 65, who retired from the Indian Air Force and lives in the locality.The situation is even worse in Hallomajra, where residents face a plethora of civic issues. The most common among them are choked sewerage lines, blocked drains and dirty drinking water. Many also face parking issues.Kuldeep Singh, a 39-year-old resident of Hallomajra, says: “The situation here is extremely poor. Sewerage lines remain blocked and the water supply is mostly dirty.

27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Road rage: SUV driver beats up elderly pedestrian in Panchkula||In a case of road rage, an elderly man was beaten up mercilessly in Sector 11, Panchkula, after his walking stick reportedly touched and left a scratch on a new SUV.The accused, a 43-year-old insurance surveyor who lives in the same sector, has been arrested. He has been identified as Manoj Kumar. A video shot by another resident shows him hitting the senior citizen – who is visually impaired in one eye – with the latter’s walking stick. The accused repeatedly slapped and hit the victim and abused him while he kept pleading for him to stop.The victim, Ram Sarup Kalra, 69, who also resides in Sector 11, submitted a written complaint to the Haryana director general of police (DGP) on Friday. He stated that on November 22, when he was returning to his house from a nearby park, he spotted a speeding Toyota Innova car approaching him on the narrow street. He reportedly signalled the car to slow down, but it did not. “The car crushed my foot, following which I lost balance and fell on the road. The accused picked up my walking stick and started beating me mercilessly. Other senior citizens from the locality requested him to stop, but he kept on beating and abusing me,” he stated in the complaint.According to Kalra, the accused threatened him with dire consequences if he sees him again. A few senior citizens tried to save him, and one of the neighbours shot the incident. In the video, children can be heard crying and women screaming with fear as the accused hit the old man with sticks.In trauma, victim hid incident from family“I got so scared that I did not tell my family about this incident. However, later they got to know and my son informed the local police about the incident on Thursday,” Kalra stated in the FIR.Kalra’s son Jitender, who runs the family business, said: “Although the incident happened on Monday, my father didn’t share it with us. He has been in a trauma. I received the video on WhatsApp, and realised what had happened.”While Jitender reported the matter to the local police station on Thursday, Kalra submitted a complaint to the DGP on Friday morning and an FIR was registered. Pleading for his safety, the elderly man stated in his complaint: “A senior citizen has been beaten mercilessly on the road and threatened to death with dire consequences in front of many residents, which has duly been videographed. You are requested to protect my life and liberty which is at imminent danger at the behest of the accused, who is a criminal in the society. You are requested to take stern action against the accused after registering the FIR against him (sic).”After arresting the accused, the Panchkula police shared his picture on their Twitter account, promising to take “strictest action” against him.“The accused had bought a new car and at the turn, the elderly man’s stick touched it, leading to a scratch. It was unintentional, but it angered him. He got down and started arguing and beating the old man,” said assistant sub-inspector Desraj, who is the investigating official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/road-rage-suv-driver-beats-up-elderly-pedestrian-in-panchkula-101637956129530.html

Police have denied the allegations.Hours after the family, which resides in Sector 29, moved a habeas corpus writ petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday, the youth returned home.In the petition moved by Sunita Rani, through her counsel advocate Padamkant Dwivedi, she sought the production of her son, Nitin, who she alleged had been picked up by the CIA Staff, Sector 26, in front of his fiancee from the market in Sector 29 around 8pm on November 24. Sunita alleged the uniformed cops had slapped Nitin multiple times and then stashed him in a police vehicle. According to the petition, the male cops also slapped Nitin’s fiancee when she tried to intervene.The petitioner alleged that when she and other family member went to the police station in Sector 26, the cops claimed that Nitin had been detained for some inquiry and he would return home in the morning. “Instead, about 10-12 police officials entered and searched our house the next morning. The police also checked footage of CCTV cameras installed in the house besides our car parked outside and took away its keys,” alleged the mother.After Nitin returned home on Friday afternoon, the family alleged he was limping and had injury marks on his body. “He was being pressurised to confess to the armed robbery,” alleged Sunita while talking over the phone. Police deny, HC seeks affidavitsEarlier, additional public prosecutor Parampreet Singh Paul on Friday submitted before the high court (HC) that “Nitin has never been illegally detained, nor is confined in any of the police stations falling within the jurisdiction of Chandigarh”. The HC has asked station house officers of both Sector 26 and the Industrial Area to submit affidavits in this regard within one week. The court also directed both SHOs to ensure Nitin’s production before the court on November 30.Superintendent of police (SP, operations) Ketan Bansal, said: “We have been questioning a few youths but no one was detained by the operation cell.” Police have been questioning drug addicts, history-sheeters and other suspects in connection to the armed loot near the mango orchard in Sector 28 on November 18 . The person who executed the robbery is suspected to have fired at a home guards volunteer on November 23.Sources in the police, privy to the investigation, claim that half a dozen youths were rounded up by different teams for questioning. All were reportedly let off on Friday after the robbery victim failed to identify them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-family-alleges-youth-s-illegal-detention-by-police-101637956128262.html
27-11-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand village has begun sliding downhill due to construction, seepage, warn geologists||Dar, the first village of Darma valley in Dharchula area of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district is gradually sliding down, endangering the lives of people living in the area, according to a team of geologists who surveyed the area. Pradeep Kumar, district geologist and leader of the team that surveyed the village on orders of the district administration said 35 families living in the village should be immediately shifted to a safer area as all the houses are slowly sliding down the hillside posing a risk to residents of the village. Kumar said the reason for this is the widening work on the road stretch from Sobla to Tidang and underground water sources that are seeping into the landmass beneath the village, weakening it and resulting in slow sliding of the land.“The village is already situated on an old landslide area and has fragile terrain, with weak soil, having no hard rocks beneath,” said Kumar. Savita Devi, gram pradhan of Dar village had written to the administration, complaining that some houses in the village were sliding from their positions and many houses had been damaged and developed big cracks. “On my complaint, the district administration sent a team of geologists to our village. We want families in our area be immediately shifted to safer places as a disaster is just waiting to happen,” said Savita Devi. AK Shukla, sub-divisional magistrate Dharchula said on receiving the complaint of houses sliding in the area, he immediately sent a team of geologists, led by chief district geologist Pradeep Kumar. “We will take further action in the matter after we receive the survey report of the team of geologists,” said Shukla. Kumar said that the landmass of the village is continuously sliding as it is located on the debris of landslides that took place in the surrounding hills nearly 200 years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-village-has-begun-sliding-downhill-due-to-construction-seepage-warn-geologists-101637955948196.html

Later, interacting with newspersons, Priyanka expressed shock and anger over the murders. She said that women in the family had told her that policemen used to mock them whenever they approached the police to take action against the accused. The police openly sided with them instead of taking action. The accused assaulted the family twice earlier but the police failed to provide security to them, she added.Priyanka said that there is no justice for dalits, women, farmers and minorities in Uttar Pradesh. Justice is only available to those who have connections with ruling parties, industrialists and the powerful.“I have been working in the state for two years and I have again and again witnessed that the Constitution is under threat here. I am with anyone who is denied justice and the media should also not sit silent on the harassment of dalits and repeated attempts to cause damage to the samvidhan in the state,” she added.“The brother of the deceased, Phulchandra, is in the SSB and is posted in Naxal-infested area in Jharkhand. He is fighting for the country’s security but the family was still denied justice. The women in the family are living in terror and are scared that they may face harassment again. It is shocking that a young girl and differently-abled 10-year-old boy were killed in a brutal manner. The family was under constant threat but the officials remained silent despite the grave situation.“The country is celebrating ‘samvidhan diwas’ but it is unfortunate that the constitution is not followed in such incidents while it is clearly written in it that justice should prevail. There is no sense in celebrating samvidhan diwas when dalits are being harassed and oppressed,” Priyanka said. “Repeated harassment of dalits is taking place whether it is in Hathras and Agra or now in Prayagraj. I am coming again and again to meet families of persons who are subjected to harassment. We cannot sit silent on harassment of dalits anywhere and must stand with them,” she added.During the visit, senior Congress leaders including UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu, national secretary Bajirao Khade and former MLA Anugrah Narayan Singh among others accompanied Priyanka Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-justice-for-dalits-women-farmers-and-minorities-in-up-priyanka-101637955888345.html

Sharma, who is an accused in the 2015 police firing case, filed an application under Section 223 (persons accused of the same offence committed in the course same transaction) of CrPC for framing of joint charges against all the accused in person, including Saini, to defer the proceedings against him till February 2022. Sharma said that as per law all the accused are to be tried together for the offences charged. “When all the accused are jointly facing trial, in the absence of one of the accused legally charges against remaining accused cannot be framed. Even section 223 of CrPC provides that a person may be charged and tried jointly if such persons committed the offence in the course of the same transaction. Meaning thereby the accused appearing before this court are to be charged and tried jointly. In the absence of Saini, it impermissible to charge and all accused. Furthermore, the trial of one of the accused cannot be split,” he added. Sharma asked the court to adjourn the matter till February 2022 in the interest of justice, adding that “the framing of charges against the accused in person may also be deferred till then”. Additional district and session judge Harbans Singh Lekhi issued a notice to the state to file a reply on December 3. Hearing another application of Sharma, the court directed the special investigation team (SIT) to assist the court by providing details of the status of the investigation in the FIR no. 129 registered at the Bajakahan police station against protestors for attacking cops on October 14, 2015. Last month, Sharma had filed a plea seeking directions to Punjab Police to conduct further investigation with regard to the injuries suffered by the cops as well as damage to the public property during the Behbal Kalan firing incident of October 14, 2015. Two Sikh protesters were killed in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-firing-ex-ssp-wants-framing-of-charges-against-accused-deferred-till-feb-101637955288069.html

The decision to constitute the committee was taken with an aim to work on a joint strategy to solve the problem,” said a senior UT official privy to the development.“In Chandigarh, the leakages come from Faidan colony in Faidan village. The colony is located on a private land. Sewer lines cannot be laid in unauthorised colonies. Also, there are multi-point entry leakages, and the geography is such that one cannot stop the follow by blocking one entry point,” said the UT official.N-Choe flows from Faidan village and then enters the Jagatpura village in Mohali. The leakages are on both sides.Notably, on the Chandigarh-end, on the directions of the UT adviser Dharam Pal, the MC, after an extensive survey, had suggested to employ the technique of phytoremediation (using living plants to clean up water, air etc) at Faidan village.“All the options will be considered by the joint committee. We will have to now see whether the administration will go ahead with the phytoremediation method,” officials said.Dhaka colony near Raipur Khurd is the only remaining outlet from where untreated water is entering the Sukhna Choe.The MC, under a short-term measure, diverted the sewage from the village to a sewage treatment plant in Raipur Khurd after providing a gate at one of the manholes. The work is expected to be completed by year-end.Under a permanent solution, a sewer line will be laid outside the Dhaka colony which will be used for carrying waste water of the colony to the Raipur Khurd STP. The expenditure involved is about ₹1 crore. The work will be completed by December 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhna-choe-pollution-combined-chandigarh-punjab-panel-to-plug-sewage-disposal-points-101637954627947.html

The government order (GO) restricts the time period to claim compensation for government employees, who died due to Covid-19 after being allotted election duty, to 30 days. A single judge bench of justice Manish Mathur on November 24, said: “It is submitted that paragraph 12 of the government order dated 01.06.2012 however has restricted this time period to merely 30 days for such government employees who were allotted work in election duty.“And provides that compensation would be granted only in case death has occurred within 30 days of the person being found Covid positive. It is submitted that such fixation of time period is completely arbitrary and unreasonable and is also in the teeth of directions issued by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” added the court. “The high court has taken serious note of the issue. Accepting the petition, the court has granted three weeks- time to the state government to file a counter affidavit,” said advocate Sharad Pathak, who represented the petitioner in court. Dileep Kumar Yadav, a primary teacher in Ambedkar Nagar district, died on the 31st day due to Covid-19 after being allotted election duty. Kushlawati, wife of the deceased, was denied compensation, as the GO had restricted the time period to 30 days to be eligible for compensation. Govt stats say...According to the state government, 2,128 government employees died during election duty of which 2,097 succumbed to Covid-19 while 31 others died of other causes.In Uttar Pradesh, the Panchayati Raj elections were held in four phases this year from April 15 to 29. The counting of votes was carried out on May 2.Almost 95% of government employees assigned election duty and who died due to Covid-19 were teachers. The government initially made a provision for ₹30 lakh ex gratia but this covered only the day the employee was on election duty. By this criterion, only 74 personnel died (40 due to Covid-19 and 34 for other reasons) during election duty.The government later changed the definition of election duty to accommodate more personnel by increasing the duty period to 30 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/election-duty-death-go-restricting-time-period-to-30-days-challenged-hc-seeks-reply-from-govt-101637954449511.html

Therefore, exact number of cases is not known but studies mention that around 14% men suffer from OAB whereas around 12% women have some type of urinary incontinence issue,” said Prof Diwakar Dalela, senior faculty, department of urology at King George’s Medical University (KGMU). According to him, when suffering with OAB one feels the need to pass urine many times during the day and night, and may also experience unintentional loss of urine. OAB is embarrassing and is potentially debilitating. “It’s a condition that can be treated, but most patients do not consult doctors. If left untreated, OAB can negatively impact life by interfering in daily activities such as work, social activities, exercise, and sleep. Women who have gone through menopause and men who have had prostate problems are more likely to get OAB,” said Prof Dalela. “Management of OAB involves an escalatory or stepping up the ladder approach. The first step is lifestyle changes, and next are oral medicines, progressing further to injections into the bladder wall, electrical stimulation of bladder-related nerves, and finally but very rarely, surgery,” he said. Avoiding bladder irritants such as coffee, tea, carbonated beverages and spicy foods would also yield good results, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-don-t-ignore-overactive-bladder-may-impact-your-life-says-doctor-101637954267794.html

In his mid-30s, he has been working as a “kalai wale” for 20 years. “I bring shine to copper or brass utensils by coating them with a layer of tin.” Sonu sits on the pavement, beside the aforementioned haveli. His establishment is five or six steps away from the spot where the wall collapsed. The rubble is still piled up on the street, with pedestrians going past it as if it were just another novelty to adjust to. “Walid Saheb was a kalai wale, too, he would sit on this same spot,” Sonu says of his father, Muhammed Saleem, who lies buried in the Dilli Gate graveyard. Sonu’s grandfather, Nawab Ali, was a weaver and worked in a “mill” in Bara Hindu Rao.The coppersmith’s stall is modest, and consists of a set of basic tools (such as punkha machine, bhatti, sandasi, pan, tin), and a few stacks of cotton wool. But one thing is standing out immodestly in its exquisite beauty — a copper bucket, embossed with flowers. “It’s a customer’s balti.” Sonu looks unimpressed with the object. “It’s part of a would-be bride’s dowry.”During the course of this brief chat, Sonu reveals that his name was given to him by his customers “because my real name, Ashqeen Ansari, can be difficult to pronounce”.It’s nearly evening. Two of Sonu’s three daughters run up to his stall; his house is just around the corner. Afifa is too shy to speak in the presence of a stranger, but Sumaiya, a 7th standard student, graciously agrees to pose with her father for a portrait. Sonu now starts to work on the sculpted bucket. The stall is open daily from 11am to 7pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-living-landmark-in-lambi-walli-101637953898139.html

Demanding the regularisation of their services, protesters gathered at the event site and raised slogans against the Punjab minister. Addressing protesters, Verka said the file related to regularisation of these health workers has been cleared and is with the finance department for approval. “Their grievances will be resolved soon,” said Verka, adding that the state government was committed to provide all highly equipped and updated medical facilities to the people visiting the Rajindra Hospital.

27-11-2021||Lucknow||Nirmala Sitharaman says advance instalment of tax devolution to states will remove hindrances in infra development||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the Central government had released two instalments of tax devolution to states, including an advance instalment, to ensure that no hindrances were caused in the way of infrastructure development.Nirmala Sitharaman also said the number of income tax returns filed in the east UP region (spread over 44 districts of Uttar Part and a part of the Kumaon area of Uttarakhand) went up nearly six fold in about five years, from 3.80 lakh in 2016 to 21.83 lakh on March 31, 2021. She quoted data for the east UP region of the income tax department in this connection.The Union finance minister said this was an indication of increasing economic activity and the money thus collected was provided for development work being carried out in the stateShe was addressing a gathering after inaugurating, along with chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the income tax department’s new building Pratyaksha Kar Bhawan (Direct Tax Building) in Lucknow.About tax devolution to the states, Nirmala Sitharaman said, “Whatever the states used to get on the 20th of every month through devolution, the Union government has released double the amount (two instalments). The amount for instalment to be paid in March (2022) has been paid in advance to the states so that no hindrance is caused to the expenditure on infrastructure.”“We have front-rolled whatever was to be paid in March 2022,” Nirmala Sitharaman said, referring to the Union government’s move to release two instalments of tax devolution of ₹95,082 crore to the states a few days ago.Commenting on her observations about the release of funds for infrastructure development, Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the department of economics at Lucknow University, said, “The Centre’s advance payment of UP’s share in taxes will complement the state government’s efforts to give a push to developmental activities, especially infrastructure projects, ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in the state.”Nirmala Sitharaman said the land for the new building of the income tax department was bought in 2002 but the construction work started in 2017.Without naming them, Nirmala Sitharaman referred to the delay to target the previous regimes in the state and said the new building has been constructed in just three yearsFor 15 years before that, no steps were taken to get the building constructed and rent was being paid for running the department’s office elsewhere, she said.Yogi Adityanath, who also addressed the audience, used the occasion to point out how investment of more than ₹3 lakh crore had flown in after the state organised the Uttar Pradesh Investors’ Summit in February 2018. He also referred to an improvement in the law and order situation in the state and the Centre sanctioning the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor.Listing the development projects being implemented in the state, he said next month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would lay the foundation stone of the Ganga Expressway project for which over 86% land has been acquired. Nirmala Sitharaman lauded the Yogi Adityanath government’s efforts to build health infrastructure, put up additional Covid-19 beds and laboratories, provide oxygen and set up new medical colleges. She said facilities had been provided to the people even during the second wave of Covid-19.“There was no shortage even during the second wave in Uttar Pradesh.

27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana speaker wants Panchkula to be added to Chandigarh railway station’s name||Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta wants the name of Chandigarh Railway Station to be changed to Panchkula and Chandigarh Railway Station. Gupta, who also represents Panchkula in the state assembly, submitted a proposal regarding this to Passenger Services Committee (PSC) chairman Ramesh Chandra Ratn, who visited the railway station for an inspection on Friday.The PSC is a statutory body under Railway Board (Ministry of Railways) and is tasked with resolving grievances of passengers for the ease of railway transport in India.“Though there is a limited availability of land towards the Chandigarh side, more development has taken place there. There are around 4,000 acres of land available for expansion towards Panchkula side, and since both cities share the same railway station, it should be named after both,” said Gupta, adding that Ratn has assured him that the proposal will be taken up at the PSC meeting on November 29.Sub-inspector Vilayati Saini, who is the in-charge of the government railway police station here, requested the visiting team to set up a beat box towards the Panchkula side “to make people feel safe”. He claimed that many passengers have fallen prey to snatchers after exiting the railway station on the Panchkula side.World-class makeover delayed furtherMeanwhile, the railway station’s wait to get a “world-class makeover” is likely to get prolonged. The project, which was delayed till at least December 2022 because of Covid-19, is expected to face further delays. “Earlier IRSDC was looking after the railway station, but now it is directly under the ministry. At the November 29 meeting, we will discuss how to go about this. The positive thing here is that work has started and tendering will be started soon too,” said Ratn. However, he didn’t share any time frame.Other pending works were also discussed. It was announced that a railway underpass will be built at Baltana, Zirakpur, within six months to ease traffic congestion. ‘Start Shatabdi Express from Mohali’Ratn also visited the Mohali railway station, where the local BJP unit urged him to get Shatabdi Express’ route extended to Mohali.The BJP team led by Sanjeev Vashisht also requested that the Amritsar-Lalkuan Express be extended to Haldwani in Uttarakhand as many businessmen go there for work from Mohali, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, and other nearby places. Ratn also announced a reward of ₹10,000 for the Chandigarh railway station and ₹5,000 for the Mohali station for their cleanliness and housekeeping services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-speaker-wants-panchkula-to-be-added-to-chandigarh-railway-station-s-name-101637953067749.html

27-11-2021||Delhi||Man jailed, fined ₹2,000 for disobeying court orders in matrimonial dispute||Taking exception to an attempt “to act over smart”, the Delhi high court on Thursday sentenced a man to simple imprisonment for three months and also fined him of ₹2,000 for disobeying repeated directions of the court in a matrimonial dispute. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said that the man has concealed his true income and expenditure, and said that his actions or omissions in choosing to show complete disregard to its orders, if permitted, would “lead to anarchy”.The order was passed on a contempt petition filed by the man’s wife in connection with an order in September directing him to pay maintenance and also disclose his income. The family court had earlier directed that the wife be granted a monthly maintenance of ₹35,000 and ordered clearance of arrears through instalments in six months. The high court had directed the man to comply with the interim maintenance order passed by the family court.In its latest order, the court said that the rule of law would become a casualty and orders of the court would be taken lightly and breached at will by individuals. “We have considered the aspect that mere imposition of a fine of ₹2,000 would not meet the ends of justice, and that a sentence of imprisonment is necessary considering the fact that the arrears owed by him are far in excess of the fine imposed, and the fact that he has deliberately, wilfully, intentionally and defiantly disobeyed the directions issued to him by the family court and by this court despite grant of opportunities,” the court directed.It, however, said that it would consider recalling the punishment provided that the man complies with the aforesaid direction within a period of two weeks and exhibits his apology by complying with the orders.In its order, the court noted that the man had suppressed his true income only with a view to evade orders passed by the family court and the high court requiring him to pay maintenance to his wife.“The situation is that the respondent has stubbornly and obstinately refused to comply with the said orders on completely false premise of his financial inability. Despite our repeated orders, he has failed to make a clean breast of all his accounts, incomes and expenditures,” the court said.It said that the man has shown no remorse or regret for non-compliance of the orders.“If there is wilful disobedience to any judgment, decree direction, order writ or other process of a court, or wilful breach of undertaking given to the court, the contempt court shall take note of such violation, that needs to be punished. The willful disobedience by the contemnor undermines the dignity and authority of the Courts and outrages the majesty of law.”The court said that the judiciary as an institution has garnered faith of the common masses as a trusted institution only because judicial orders are enforced, in an appropriate case, even at the pain of contempt. The faith posed by the people in the judiciary has to be protected in the interest of society, and also to meet the ends of justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-jailed-fined-2-000-for-disobeying-court-orders-in-matrimonial-dispute-101637952888929.html

To bring in developmental reforms in southern Haryana, including Rewari, the present government has worked on the mantra of ‘Haryana Ek, Haryanvi Ek’,” the CM added.‘Ensure transparency in recruitments’Addressing the Pragati rally at Bawal in Rewari, Khattar said his government has ensured transparency in government jobs and recruitments are done on merit basis.“During the tenure of the previous governments, interests of the youth were being neglected. The court had to intervene with regard to recruitments during the previous governments and many recruitments were cancelled. However, not a single recruitment was cancelled during our government,” he said.“Whenever there was a complaint of a paper leak, the state government had cancelled examinations. During the tenure of the present government, 48 people have been arrested for violating the sanctity of recruitments. Our vision is clear regarding making recruitments on merit, violators will not be spared at any cost,” the CM added.Khattar invites PM Modi to Gita Mahotsav

27-11-2021||Delhi||DDMA to meet on Monday to act against Covid variant: CM||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he has called a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Monday to take steps that need to be taken against the new coronavirus variant detected in South Africa.“In view of the threat from new COVID variant from African countries, we have requested experts to make a presentation to DDMA on Mon and suggest what steps we shud take. We will take all steps necessary to protect u and ur family,” the chief minister tweeted. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday classified it as a “variant of concern”, and renamed it Omicron. The Union health ministry on Thursday directed all states and union territories to strictly screen and test international travellers from Botswana, South Africa, and Hong Kong where infections with the new variant were detected. The states were also asked to send the samples of any of these international travellers found to be positive for genomic sequencing. In May this year, as the second wave of Covid-19 was subsiding in the city, there was a diplomatic embarrassment after the Delhi CM had said that a new variant from Singapore affected children more. At present, delta and its sub-lineage continue to be the dominant variant. “Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY.x) continues to be the main VOC in India.

27-11-2021||Noida||Rakesh Tikait: MSP our key demand, govt has time to think till winter session||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Friday said the ongoing farmers’ protest will continue and that the government has time to think about their demands, especially guaranteeing the minimum support price (MSP) for a range of crops, till the winter session of the Parliament. Tikait was addressing a gathering of farmers at the UP Gate protest site in Ghaziabad on Friday (November 26) on completion of one year of the farmers’ protest against the three controversial agri laws passed by the Parliament. On November 26 last year, farmers arrived at the UP Gate, among other borders around the Capital, and occupied the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of National Highway 9 to press their demand for the roll back of the three farm laws. “The roll back of the three laws was beneficial for the common man. Our demand is for a law guaranteeing MSP for a range of crops. The government has time to think and understand our demands till the winter session goes on in the Parliament. The winter session will decide the future course of our agitation,” said Tikait while addressing the farmers at the UP Gate. “Our main demand is the MSP; this issue will also impact the upcoming elections. If this demand is not met, we will oppose the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The future course of action will be decided by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM),” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader and spokesperson for SKM at the UP-Gate protest site. On November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the three farm laws will be withdrawn. On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet approved the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 – a draft legislation to repeal the three controversial farm laws. The development comes ahead of the state assembly elections due to be held in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab early next year. “A meeting by SKM is scheduled on November 27 while a tractor march will be taken out by farmers on November 29,” said Tikait adding that 500 farmers in 30 tractors will proceed to the Parliament from UP-Gate to press their demands.Asking farmers to exercise caution, Tikait added that “a game will be played” over the course of the next 10-15 days, where questions will be directed at farmers as to why they are still continuing with their protest despite the Prime Minister announcing the repeal of the three farm laws. “The government too will issue a statement in this regard once the three laws are rolled back (in the Parliament),” he said. Calling the three farm laws a ‘disease’ which came along with Covid-19, Tikait said, “The three laws and Covid came together in 2019-20 and farmers fought both of them...the three laws were sort of a disease and it got treated. In fact, the fight against the three laws delayed our demands by one and half years,” said Tikait. Farmer leaders said an open letter was sent to the Prime Minister in which they have reiterated the following demands-- MSP for their entire crop; withdrawal of Electricity Amendment Bill 2020/2021, removal of penal provisions for farmers in pollution law; withdrawal of cases lodged against farmers; compensation for families of farmers who lost their lives during the course of the agitation and resignation and arrest of Union minister of state (home) Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son is the prime suspect in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3. Social activist Yogendra Yadav, who also addressed the farmers at UP-Gate, said it is not a question of when will the farmers get up or vacate the areas. “The issue is about when their demands will be fulfilled. Till then, the agitation will go on and the future course of action will be decided in SKM’s meeting on November 27,” Yadav said. Chandra Mohan, spokesperson and state secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Uttar Pradesh, said both the state and the Centre have done their best for farmers. “Our governments have done the best in terms of getting the highest price for the farmers’ crops or making record purchase of their crops. For some people, it is just an agitation ,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rakesh-tikait-msp-our-key-demand-govt-has-time-to-think-till-winter-session-101637952587791.html

27-11-2021||Delhi||Residents’ groups to keep watch on air pollution hot spots in Delhi||The United Residents’ Joint Action (URJA) of Delhi, a consortium of over 2,500 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in the Capital, on Friday launched a citizen-driven monitoring campaign against air pollution.As part of the campaign, representatives from Delhi’s 13 pollution hotspots will be working closely with Delhi’s corporations to help report incidents of waste burning, debris dumping and other pollution-related violations in their respective areas.In 2019, The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee identified Rohini, Dwarka, Okhla Phase-2, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, RK Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela and Mayapuri as pollution hotspots in the city. These locations have an annual average PM10 concentration exceeding 300μg/m3 and PM2.5 concentration of over 100μg/m3. While the CPCB safe standards annually are 60μg/m3 and 40μg/m3 for PM10 and PM2.5 respectively.PM10 are coarse pollution particles and PM 2.5 are fine, inhalable particulate matter.“The air pollution in these hotspots is consistently high and there is a need to ensure implementation of the government’s action plans. Residents in these hotspots are affected by the high levels of pollution and can be instrumental in changing things on ground,” Atul Goyal, president, URJA said.“The representatives could be community leaders, RWA or market trader association members. Those with a background in education and health can be appointed as coordinators. We need to establish the state government’s accountability to its citizens and demand a roadmap for reducing 12% pollution annually, to begin with, and two-thirds by 2025, as was committed by them during Delhi elections,” he added.Jasbir Chaddha, general secretary, URJA, said open waste burning has emerged as an important local source of pollution, and their campaign will focus on empowering citizens to report such instances.“There needs to be a plan for the protection of vacant land near these pollution hotspots, which will ensure no fresh waste is dumped, which in turn can be set on fire,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/residents-groups-to-keep-watch-on-air-pollution-hot-spots-in-delhi-101637952347599.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots cases: No distinction between police and prosecutor, Govt tells HC||Trials in cases filed in connection with northeast Delhi riots that took place in February 2020 and the Republic Day farmers’ violence cases this year are a “mockery”, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government told the Delhi high court on Friday.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the AAP government, submitted that there is no distinction between the prosecution and investigation in these cases, because all the Special Public Prosecutors (SPPs) were chosen by the Delhi Police and appointed by the Lieutenant Governor (L-G).“There is no difference between the police and prosecution today. The entire trial is a mockery. If the investigating agency is allowed to enter the domain of the prosecution, what is the fairness left in the entire criminal procedure? This is a basic principle,” Mehra told the bench comprising chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh.The court was hearing a plea by the Delhi government challenging the L-G’s July 23 order appointing lawyers chosen by Delhi Police as SPPs in cases related to violence during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 this year and the northeast Delhi riots cases of February 2020.“The police obviously want that people should be tried and they should be punished, but a prosecutor is the officer of the court. He is not bloodthirsty. Prosecution’s only allegiance is to the truth and to the majesty of the court and today, with these orders, the prosecution and the investigating agency, there is complete synergy between them,” Mehra said.He stated that the appointment of prosecutors was the government’s domain, and the L-G was supposed to be aided and advised of the council of ministers.“The constitutional bench of the Supreme Court also said it is purely in the domain of the state government and L-G is bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers. L-G has gone completely contrary to that and appointed prosecutors based on the suggestion of Delhi Police,” Mehra contended.Highlighting that the matter is of “great urgency”, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, also appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that the respondents—L-G and Centre—were yet to file their responses.“This is a matter of great urgency. The court gave four weeks to file counters. [It has been] more than nine weeks and no counter is filed. We are in grave urgency. This is an uncertainty that can be avoided,” Singhvi said, urging the court to close the respondents’ right to file counters if it is not done before the next date of hearing.The court, however, granted more time to the Centre and L-G to file their responses and posted the matter for hearing on January 28, 2022.AAP’s petition also challenged L-G’s July 26 notificationon the appointment of the SPPs as well as the Centre’s August 4 order endorsing the L-G’s view and approving the appointments.The plea said that it is contrary to established legal principles and violates the Constitutional guarantee of a fair trial. It said the SPPs are taking charge of the matters by displacing the regular public prosecutors and, therefore, urgent directions are required from the court to enable them to continue so as to not jeopardise fair trial in the cases.The Delhi government added that “appointment of SPPs is a routine matter and not an exceptional matter for which reference to the President can be made” and that the L-G had “no sound reason for referring the matter to the President when the government had agreed to appoint independent SPPs”.As reported by HT on Friday, of the total 758 cases registered in connection with communal riots in northeast Delhi in February last year, the Delhi Police has completed the investigation and filed charge sheets only in 361 (42%) cases as of October 4, the Delhi high court was informed on Thursday. Even in cases where the charge sheet has been filed, the trial has begun in just over 67 cases (18%), Delhi Police told the court Thursday while submitting a status report in a batch of petitions related to last year’s violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-cases-no-distinction-between-police-and-prosecutor-govt-tells-hc-101637952287661.html
27-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Phones, wallets stolen at Sector 65 concert, case filed||Unidentified persons were booked on Thursday for allegedly stealing mobile phones and wallets during a live concert in Sector 65 on Wednesday night. More than 2,500 people attended the event, police said, adding that they received at least 36 complaints from people who lost their valuables at the event. Nitika Sood, a college student from Delhi, said that she and another friend lost their mobile phones during the concert. “While we were coming out, I wanted to book a cab and was shocked that my phone was missing from my jeans’ back pocket. My friends called on my number, but the phone was switched off,” said Sood, who went to the concert with six friends. Another victim alleged that his mobile phone was stolen while he was dancing with his friends. “Many people were complaining that their wallets and mobile phones were missing. We had approached the policemen deployed there, but to no avail,” said Shamsher Singh, a resident of Saket in Delhi. Gaurvit Mehta, a resident of Devi Lal Colony in Gurugram, said that his mobile phone and wallet were stolen while he was standing in a queue outside the concert venue. “I was standing in a queue with my friend when I realised that someone had taken out my mobile phone and wallet containing ₹9,500 cash. I attended the concert half-heartedly,” he said. Deepak Kumar, station house officer, Sector 65 police station, said the complaints were clubbed and six cases were registered under Section 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code.“Some miscreants took advantage of the gathering and stole mobile phones and wallets of several people. We have put the stolen mobile phones on surveillance,” the SHO said. Kumar said they have shared IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers with the cyber police station teams while the local teams are checking footage to identify the suspects. Police said IMEI is a unique 15-digit code that precisely identifies a device with SIM card input, and many times thieves try to change IMEI code before selling it. Some victims also alleged that the location of the police station on Google map was not updated and it took them more than an hour to find it.Police officials said earlier the police station was at Kadipur and recently shifted to Golf Course Extension Road, but the location has not been updated yet on Google map.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-phones-wallets-stolen-at-sector-65-concert-case-filed-101637952168782.html
27-11-2021||Noida||Noida: ₹15.54cr fine imposed for violation of pollution norms, shows RTI reply||A reply to an RTI (Right to Information) query filed by a Noida resident has revealed that the regional office of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), Noida, has imposed penalties amounting to ₹5.75 crore on 1,054 individuals and establishments for violating pollution norms in the last four years. In the same RTI, the Noida authority said it has imposed a penalty of ₹9.69 crore during the same period. If the figures are taken into consideration together, then the state pollution control board and the Noida authority have collectively imposed penalties to the tune of ₹15.44 crore for violation of pollution norms in the last four years. Amit Gupta, a resident of Sector 77, filed an RTI on October 5 asking the regional office of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, Noida, and the Noida authority the quantum of fines imposed on those who were caught violating pollution norms in the city in the last four years. “The purpose of filing the RTI was to understand whether rules and regulations made to control pollution in the city are being enforced or not. If yes, then how much fine has been imposed by the board and the authority in the last four years,” said Gupta, who is a member of the Progressive Community Foundation, a citizens’ group in Noida.According to the reply filed by the pollution control board, it has received 939 complaints of dust and air pollution on social media and ‘Sameer’ app between 2017 and 2020, for which they have taken action. The board further shared that till November 17 this year, it has addressed 106 complaints of pollution. The maximum fine imposed was ₹1.80 crore in 2019 on the back of 390 complaints. This year alone, fines of ₹69.9 lakh have been imposed, the board said.“On the directions of the district magistrate, the pollution department recommends imposition of penalties to the office of city magistrate, which then issues the fine on violators,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB.When asked as to how much amount has been realised, Kumar added, “Almost all the fines imposed on violators are usually collected”. The official data on the amount collected was unavailable.According to the reply filed by Noida authority, ₹9.69 crore penalty has been imposed on violators in the city from November 25, 2016 to November 11, 2021. Of this, ₹5.70 crore penalty has been imposed on building construction work and ₹1.19 crore has been imposed for solid waste management and garbage burning. In addition to this, ₹2.11 crore was imposed for hot mix plants, stone crushers and use of polythene attracted a fine of ₹68 lakh from violators.Of the total penalty ( ₹9.69 crore) imposed by the Noida authority in the last four years, the authority has been able to recover ₹5.86 crore.“Pollution norms are being enforced across the city strictly and our staff deployed across the city are taking necessary action. Besides this, sprinkling of water and mechanical sweeping are being carried out to control dust pollution,” said an official of Noida Authority.Gupta said he will file another RTI to get details on how much of the total penalty imposed in the last four years has the pollution control board been able to recover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-15-54cr-fine-imposed-for-violation-of-pollution-norms-shows-rti-reply-101637952167645.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Woman abducted, raped in Sarita Vihar; auto driver arrested||A 26-year-old woman and a 12-year-old girl were allegedly abducted and raped in two separate cases registered in southeast Delhi -- in Sarita Vihar and Govindpuri.In the first case, police said an autorickshaw driver allegedly abducted a woman passenger and raped her before stealing her phone and dropping her off at an unknown place in Sarita Vihar.Deputy commissioner of police (south-east) Esha Pandey said that a case of abduction and sexual assault was registered after the victim approached the Sarita Vihar police station. The woman alleged that the suspect thrashed her when she resisted the rape.Police said an FIR was registered under IPC sections 376 (rape), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 356 (assault or criminal force in attempt to commit theft of property carried by a person) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt).“The suspect was traced through CCTV footage from the spots,” said an senior police officer who did not want to named.Police identified the suspect as Vajid (34) and claimed that they recovered the woman’s mobile phone and the autorickshaw used in the crime from him. Police said he allegedly admitted to the crime during questioning.Investigators said the accused, who is married and has two daughters aged five and two, came to Delhi in 2010 and has been driving an autorickshaw since then.In the second incident, a rickshaw puller allegedly lured the 12-year-old girl when she was playing with friends outside her house in Govindpuri on Monday. He allegedly took her to his rented room in nearby Sarita Vihar and sexually assaulted her.According to police, though the suspect allegedly threatened her against talking about the incident to anyone, the girl confided in her mother, who approached the police on Wednesday.“An FIR was registered under IPC sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 377 (unnatural offenses), and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,” said DCP Pandey.Police arrested the suspect, identified as Mohommad Akub (57), on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwoman-abducted-raped-in-sarita-vihar-auto-driver-arrested-101637952108729.html

27-11-2021||Lucknow||More than law, expansion of MSP coverage needed: Experts||Experts differ on the issue of demand for an MSP (minimum support price) law and the need for a free market economy for agriculture even as the official data for the last five years in Uttar Pradesh show that the average open market prices of paddy and wheat have been always below MSP, except for in 2015-16 when the open market wheat price was marginally above it.This is the situation when farm unions, which are far from ending their stir despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s categorical announcement on November 19 that his government would repeal of the three contentious agriculture laws, are now exerting pressure on the Centre to make a law guaranteeing that no crop in the market is purchased below the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government. They want such a law so that farmers could get a remunerative price for their produce. MSP is a threshold price that acts as a safety net for farmers when they sell particular crops. These crops are procured by government agencies at a promised price to farmers and MSP, once declared, cannot be changed to the farmers’ disadvantage in that particular season. However, MSP that the Centre fixes every crop season is not binding on private traders.Though Centre declared MSP for 23 crops, in Uttar Pradesh wheat and paddy are the two prominent crops that the state government buys from farmers at MSP to meet its public distribution system (PDS) requirement. But official reports reveal only a very small number of farmers in Uttar Pradesh, like in the rest of the country, sell their produce to the government agencies, using the MSP route. A majority of them end up selling the same in the open market—often below MSP and sometimes at a price that does not even recover the production cost.“It is true only a very small number of farmers are able to avail of MSP benefits in the country,” agriculture expert Ajit Kumar Singh said.“The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data show that only 6% farmers in the country get to sell their crops at MSP because of reasons like lack of awareness among farmers, corruption at government procurement centres and delayed payments,” he added. Niti Aayog also found the same in its “Evaluation Study of Efficacy of Minimum Support Price on Farmers”. The sample study published in 2016 with a reference period between 2007-08 and 2010-11 covered farmers of 36 districts (six in UP) in 14 states.“It is observed that 28% of the farmers in UP sold their grains under MSP, 63% sold their grains in the open market and the remaining 8% kept for their self-consumption. It has also been observed during the course of study that 82% of the farmers reported to have faced various limitations in selling their food grains/crops at MSP,” the study found.A senior official posted in the UP Council of Agriculture Research said the fact that most of the farmers were compelled to sell their crops to traders in the open market at a price that was often below the government-determined MSP lends legitimacy to farmers’ demand for a law that ensures that even private agencies did not buy their produce below MSP. “Many people may romanticize the idea of free market economy for agriculture but we have seen how farmers feel compelled to sell their crops in the market below MSP because they cannot afford the difficulties they face in carrying their crops to government procurement centres,” he said.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) state president Rajveer Singh Jadun said the market prices of paddy and wheat, the two main MSP crops in UP, were always below the government’s threshold price. Most of the farmers, he claimed, had to sell their produce in the open market only below the MSP or at a loss. He questioned as to why prices of wheat, maida (flour) and rice, for example, were not lower in the market. “This is why we have been demanding an MSP law so that no agency could buy any crop below MSP saving farmers from selling their produce at a loss,” he said. Ajit Kumar Singh said there was no denying the fact that farmers did need minimum income guarantee like workers, who enjoyed a statutory minimum wage guarantee. He also agreed that the prevailing MSP system certainly helped keep the open market prices at a certain level and in the absence of MSP mechanism market prices could further dip.“But whether making a law for MSP will be the right choice to achieve the objective remains a big question,” he said. “I do not think it is possible to make such as law as it does not exist anywhere in the world. Moreover, the enforcement of such a law and compelling private buyers not to buy below the MSP will be a huge challenge,” he said.Ram Saran Verma, a progressive farmer and Padma Shri awardee, had a different take on the issue.“I am not sure if making an MSP law will be a desirable move at all. But what I genuinely feel is that government must ensure that farmers’ produce is not sold below the cultivation cost under any given situation,” he stressed. “During the current season only, a lot of farmers in the state are compelled to sell paddy for ₹1200 per quintal in the open market against MSP of ₹1,940 per quintal. The cultivation cost of paddy is ₹1200-1300 per quintal and it pains to see farmers sell paddy at a loss,” he said.The solution, according to Singh, lies not in making an MSP law but in expanding the present MSP coverage to more crops and making arrangements that ensure that government procurement centres buy crops from a maximum number of farmers. The government, according to him, must think of giving MSP benefits to more farmers by making fundamental changes in the current system of procurement, he said.“To make this possible, it can start an additional system of buying crops from farmers’ doors or fields because distance to procurement centres and the transportation cost involved, apart from many other difficulties, act as a major deterrent to farmers in selling their produce to the government agencies,” he suggested.Verma has advice for farmers too.“Farmers should also think of diversifying and lowering their dependence on paddy and wheat. They should adopt a rotational pattern of cropping by growing crops like pulses and oilseeds that are in scarcity in the state while the Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) godowns overflowed with rice and wheat,” he said. The demand-supply situation, he pointed out, also determined prices.“This is why currently the oilseeds prices in the open market are much above the government’s MSP in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/more-than-law-expansion-of-msp-coverage-needed-experts-101637952047633.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt adds Kartarpur and Velankanni under free pilgrimage scheme||New Delhi: The Delhi government will add two more sites—Kartarpur Sahib and Velankanni Church—to the list of routes under the Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana.Kailash Gahlot, the revenue minister, said on Friday that the first train under this scheme to Ayodhya is scheduled to be flagged off on December 3 and the government has decided to add two more routes for Sikh and Christian devotees in addition to the existing 13 routes. Gahlot reviewed the preparations for the launch of the scheme on the Delhi-Ayodhya-Delhi route on Friday. Senior officers from the revenue department, IT department, Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) and the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) took part in the review.A senior government official said that the devotees will be provided berths in AC-III tier trains on the Delhi-Velankanni-Delhi route whereas they will be given seats in deluxe AC buses for the Kartarpur Sahib route. “The first batch of yatris to Kartarpur Sahib will depart on January 5, 2022, and the first train for Delhi-Velankanni-Delhi will depart on January 7, 2022,” Gahlot informed.He added that the 15,000 applicants who had applied to take part in the yatra under the scheme in 2019 but could not avail of the facility due to the Covid-19 pandemic will be contacted by the government regarding the option of amending their applications and uploading vaccination certificates. “The Delhi government will also provide doctors and paramedical staff to accompany the applicants,” Gahlot stated.Under the Mukhya Mantri Teerth Yatra Yojna, Hindu pilgrims who are over 60 years of age can also visit Vaishno Devi, Shirdi, Rameswaram, Dwarka, Puri, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Mathura, Vrindavan, among others and Sikh residents have the option to do a Delhi-Amritsar-Wagah Border-Anandpur Sahib-Delhi tour for four days.Senior citizens availing of the free pilgrimage scheme are issued certificates by the MLAs of their respective areas, ministers of the Delhi government, or the chairman of the Tirth Yatra Vikas Samiti. The Delhi government bears all the expenses on the pilgrimage, including travel, food and accommodation. Facilities such as paramedical staff and attendants are also provided during the journeyThe scheme was approved by the Kejriwal government in 2018, but no visit could be organised in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. So far, over 36,000 people have availed of the scheme. The Delhi-Ayodhya-Delhi tour is the 13th route. With the addition of Ayodhya, Kartarpur Sahib and Velankanni Church, the total number of routes under the scheme is now 15.A total of 1,100 residents per assembly constituency can avail of this facility in a year subject to the cap of total of 77,000 beneficiaries per year, according to Delhi government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-adds-kartarpur-and-velankanni-under-free-pilgrimage-scheme-101637951867351.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||Services may be hit as several docs at govt, MCD hospitals go on strike||Senior doctors from the north corporation-run hospitals, dispensaries, maternity centres, and TB facilities will go on an indefinite strike from Monday to protest against not receiving salaries, along with arrears and allowances, for nearly three months, said the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association on Friday. The doctors wrote to the authorities over a week ago, demanding that their pending salaries be paid or they will go on a strike. “It is now nearly three months since we received our salaries. We have given ample notice to authorities but all we keep hearing is that they have no funds. We are just asking for what we are owed. All routine services will be stopped from Monday onwards; however, we will keep the emergency running,” said Dr RR Gautam, president, Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association. “Patients who can be discharged will be sent home, and those who can be moved will be referred elsewhere. Only the most critical patients will remain in the hospital,” he said. With resident doctors, who manage most wards and clinics, going on strike from Saturday (November 27), as part of a nationwide call given to protest the delay in carrying out NEET-PG counselling, 2021, services in most municipal hospitals are likely to be severely affected from Monday, hospital sources said. In addition to monthly salaries, doctors are also asking for the increased dearness allowance that was given to all employees of central government hospitals and also those of facilities run by east and south Delhi corporations. “Doctors in our sister organisations are already receiving the increased DA, and that too a significant increase. Also, the north corporation has still not implemented the seventh pay commission and are yet to give us arrears of various components,” said Dr Maruti Sinha, general secretary of the organisation. The north corporation did not comment on the announced strike.Meanwhile, the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) has called for a nationwide strike from November 27 over the delay in NEET-PG counselling, 2021. Resident doctors in government hospitals across the country will withdraw from outpatient department (OPD) services from Saturday. FORDA, in a letter to Union health minister Dr Mansukh Mandaviya, said, “The already overburdened and exhausted Resident Doctors of the nation fighting at the frontline since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, have been waiting patiently till date for some positive outcome of Supreme Court proceedings in the matter of already delayed NEET-PG 2021 counselling. However, there seems to be no respite to their physical and mental distress, with the next court hearing scheduled on 6th January 2022.”The ministry did not comment on the letter. Although doctors will continue with emergency services and routine work of surgeries, they will stop working in OPD. The full impact of the strike will be visible Monday when OPDs run at full strength; Saturday OPD is run for half day and on Sunday, the clinics are shut at all hospitals other than Centre-run hospitals. In addition, all doctors from corporation-run hospitals and clinics will also go on a strike from Monday over delay in NEET counselling. “For now, we will not work in the OPDs, but if nothing happens, we will stop all routine services. The NEET examinations were delayed since May, due to the pandemic, and was conducted in September. But someone filed a petition about the economic reservation policy and the next date of hearing is on January 6; we don’t know when there will be a decision,” said Dr Manish Kumar, president, FORDA. Supreme Court on Thursday deferred the hearing of the ongoing case in NEET counselling till January. The same day the Centre requested a time of four weeks since it has decided to revisit the criteria of ₹8 lakh annual income limit for economically weaker sections(EWS) category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-civic-body-doctors-to-strike-from-monday-resident-doctors-in-all-hospitals-from-today-101637951687516.html
27-11-2021||Mumbai||Lessons from 26/11: Triage and equitable distribution of victims is a must||When a mass disaster, like the November 26, 2008 terror attacks strikes, it is vital for the city’s administration to distribute victims across nearby hospitals without overloading any one. This requires thorough triage at the site of the disaster. These are some of the learnings from the attacks that shook the city 13 years ago, which were published in a study last year. The study, conducted by a team of JJ hospital doctors and published in the Journal of Disaster Risk Studies in August 2020 analysed the medical response after the 26/11 Mumbai attack. The study stated that a majority of victims — 166 persons died and 238 were injured — were taken to the state-run JJ Hospital in Byculla overloading the hospital within a short period of time (271 victims were admitted to this hospital, the study said). The JJ Hospital is about 3.5 km from the main disaster sites, including the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus station, Leopold Cafe and Chabad House in Colaba, Trident-Oberoi in Nariman Point and the Taj Palace hotel in Apollo Bunder. Other hospitals which were closer to these sites, like the state-run St George Hospital, the state-run GT Hospital and the privately-run Bombay Hospital, received fewer victims by comparison (38, 30 and 79, respectively).“An equitable distribution of patients is crucial in any disaster, and this did not happen during 26/11,” said Dr Dhiraj Sonawane, an orthopaedic surgeon from JJ Hospital and co-author of the study. The study also highlighted that the city lacked the means to provide emergency medical care at a pre-hospital level. While disaster protocols were immediately activated at the hospitals, the absence of a robust on-site triage — a team of trained medics at the disaster site stabilise then shift patients to hospitals depending on the nature of their injuries and proximity of the hospital — led to an unnecessary overburdening of the hospital’s resource.Disaster protocol at the hospital level include triage at the entry point, activating beds, operation theatres, summoning back-up doctors and other staff, among other things.“There was an unequitable distribution of patients amongst the major public hospitals. Had there been a comprehensive disaster module, involving triage, field teams and transport teams, the number of casualties could have been reduced,” the study noted. After the attacks, a majority of patients were brought to the hospitals by Samaritans using taxis and private vehicles. Some were even taken to the hospitals on handcarts. Since the terror strike, the most important addition to the city’s disaster preparedness has been the ambulances under the Maharashtra Emergency Medical Services (MEMS), known as the 108 ambulances. A fleet of 937 ambulances was introduced in the state in 2014. Of these 93 are in Mumbai. The 108 ambulances are on standby for any kind of disaster — floods, fire, building collapse or terror attack — and were used extensively during the Covid pandemic in 2020. The ambulances are dispatched through an automated response mechanism based on the estimated number of people affected by a disaster. “We are linked with the BMC’s main control room, police control as well as fire control rooms,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Shelke, chief operating officer, MEMS. “For triaging, we label patients as yellow and red. Yellow are the ones who are injured yet stable, while red are the ones who are critical,” he said.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the civic body has a comprehensive disaster management protocol, which is refined every year. “Our protocol includes activating all the nearby public hospitals, summoning doctors residing in the area, cordoning off the area around the hospitals to allow movement of emergency vehicles and activating blood banks in the area.” “It is an internal document, circulated among doctors and stakeholders,” he said, adding that it held the contact information of various hospitals and authorities to be contacted in case of a disaster. The study authors however proposed a comprehensive disaster module for the city, including the formation of a central medical control committee (CMCC) comprising of experts trained in handling trauma and mass casualties. They also proposed forming field disaster teams, grading health facilities for basic and advanced trauma care and training health care staff in protocol. In developed countries, emergency medical services during mass disasters are offered free of cost,” health activist Dr Abhijit More of not-for-profit Jan Arogya Abhiyan said. “Here, patients have to be taken to public hospitals for free treatment. There is a tendency to avoid rushing patients of mass disasters to private hospitals even if they are closer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lessons-from-26-11-triage-and-equitable-distribution-of-victims-is-a-must-101637951567547.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Slow winds, fog keep air pollution in severe zone||Delhi’s air quality has deteriorated to the “severe” category once again, with the Capital’s average air quality index (AQI) hitting 406, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily 4pm bulletin on Friday. The city’s air had already deteriorated to the brink of the “severe” category by Thursday afternoon, before slipping into deep red later that evening. While the Delhi government had banned construction activities in the Capital from Thursday on the orders of the Supreme Court, calm winds and low temperatures trapped pollutants. Delhi also saw shallow fog in the morning, which mixed with pollutants to cause smog, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said calm winds were recorded over Delhi till 1pm, with wind speeds only picking up between 1pm and 4pm. “From 4pm onwards, they dipped again. Visibility at Safdarjung [airport] remained between 300 and 500 metres till 10am, after which it marginally improved to 800 to 1,000 metres. This can be attributed to smog coverage and after the November 11-13 smog spell, this is the second such spell this month where such poor visibility has been recorded at the airport,” he said.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), relief is expected from November 29 onwards, when surface winds touch 15-20 km/hr. “Local surface winds are likely to increase slightly for the next two days, which will increase dispersion of pollutants, leading to slight improvement, but AQI will still remain in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category. Mixing layer height and wind are the dominant factors controlling air quality, but from 29th, significant improvement in AQI is expected due to high wind speed,” it said.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 27.6 degrees Celsius on Friday, while the minimum was 11 degrees. Temperatures are expected to dip below 10 degrees once again only after November 30, when cold northwesterly winds start blowing towards the Capital. Saturday’s forecast shows a maximum and minimum of 27 and 10 degrees Celsius respectively, with shallow fog expected in the early hours.Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said forecasts need to be considered while announcing mitigation measures and relaxing them.“The air quality in Delhi has dipped to ‘severe’ category over the last two days, especially during the morning and evening time. This is primarily due to lower wind speed and temperature, which prevent the dispersion of pollutants. According to forecasts, the transport sector is the leading local contributor to Delhi’s air pollution. Just like the Delhi government has restricted the entry of diesel commercial vehicles, it should continue to actively consider forecasts before relaxing restrictions within the city,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhislow-winds-fog-keep-air-pollution-in-severe-zone-101637951509606.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||With end of farmers’ protest in sight after a year, gloom gives way to relief||Delhi’s three border points – Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- were chock-a-block with people and tractors on Friday as protesting farmers marked the one-year anniversary of the protest against three farm laws that the government has announced it will repeal in the upcoming Parliament session.The scene at the border points -- which led to jams and blockades for commuters -- was festive. Punjabi music was blaring, vendors were selling flags and memorabilia, and there were performances by artistes and speeches by protesters who have camped at these spots for months, refusing to budge despite appeals by the government and local authorities.Jeet Singh and Sukhwant Singh, two elderly farmers from Amritsar, who stayed at Singhu site for the entire year, said the place was like home for them now, but they longed to go back to the real homes. “It will feel strange when we do leave, but we hope this moment comes soon. We hope the Prime Minister will stick to his word and repeal the three laws,” Jeet, 80 At langar (community food) services in the area, the menu was beyond the regular -- with jalebi, kheer and sweetened rice among the delicacies. Gurnam Singh, a volunteer at one such service said the dishes were decided based on the demand over the past one year. “Jalebi stalls would particularly get a lot of people, so we decided to make them for the occasion,” he said.Avtar Singh, a vendor selling bags, badges and flags, said he earned several thousand rupees on Friday, much more than his usual collection, with people wanting to take something back home. “Not just farmers, but Delhi locals have also come today,” he said. Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait earlier this week said 30 tractors will head to Parliament on November 29, to coincide with the first day of the winter session, to press for a law guaranteeing minimum support price (the price at which the government buys agricultural produce). However, senior farm leaders said protesting groups had called for a meeting on Saturday to take a call on the tractor march.“We have planned a march towards Delhi on November 29, but SKM [Samyukt Kisan Morcha] will take a call about it on Saturday,” Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Saurabh Upadhyay said.At the Tikri border protest site, farmers were seen crowding around the main stage to cheer performers and speakers. Rajbir Singh, a farmer from Batala who made his way to Delhi on November 27 last year after crossing multiple barricades at the state crossings said: “We did not bow down. For days, our body would ache and our eyes would constantly be watering, but this only made our resolve stronger.”Last year, thousands of farmers reached Delhi’s borders to protest against the three laws brought by the Centre, that aimed to reform farm the trade. While several mini protests broke out, Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur emerged as the ground zero for the farm protests. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the government will repeal the three laws in the winter session of the Parliament, beginning from November 29. Most farmers say they will leave once the repeal is official, while some they want to hold on for other related demands, including a law guaranteeing minimum support prices (MSPs).Farmers at the Ghazipur border (which connects Delhi and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh) said their protest had grown in strength over the past year, and said they will hold out till their remaining demands are met.“I left my two children and family behind to come here in November last year. I thought the agitation will go on for two or three years... We will continue to serve here till all our demands are met,” said Pawan Deep Singh, who hails from Bijnor in UP. Officers of the Ghaziabad police said the Ghazipur protest site saw between 3,000 and 3,500 people on Friday, up many fold from the usual attendance of around 500.“The numbers don’t matter. At a single call, hundreds of farmers can arrive here from their areas,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, an SKM member and spokesperson of the Ghazipur protest site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-end-of-farmers-protest-in-sight-after-a-year-gloom-gives-way-to-relief-101637951148646.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||Concretisation of trees is worst kind of human rights abuse: Delhi HC||Coming down heavily on the concretisation of trees and rampant construction in the national capital, the Delhi high court on Friday said these activities were changing neighbourhoods and making people feel like aliens in their own environment. It is the “worst kind of human rights abuse”, the court said. “You are changing people’s neighbourhoods. They become alien in their own environment and that is the worst kind of human rights abuse. Citizens will not be pushed back because the corporation is not working on it. Every day, it is the same position in every colony,” justice Najmi Waziri said, while hearing a plea against the concretisation of hundreds of trees in Vasant Vihar.The judge said a fully grown tree “is worth a crore”, but for the citizens a tree is greater than its monetary value.Stating that the absence of trees changes the neighbourhood, Waziri narrated an anecdote, “Ordinary citizen, or a lady who has lived in a colony for 50 years…She used to get up and see the tree every day. But it gets chopped off, or becomes ill because some contractor of the MCD comes and concretes it up to the tree trunk.There is no water, no air, no nitrogen...the tree dries up and in one aandhi (storm), it is blown away. That neighbourhood is not the same for the lady; for the children.”“This is no more a joke. The symbiotic relationship is far too extensive. We can’t do without it (trees). We don’t want only to concretise the city. You can’t take care, you tell us. RWA will take care. I am confident that any number of RWAs is ready to take it up,” the court said.The court was hearing a plea by a resident against the concreting of hundreds of trees in Vasant Vihar and alleged inaction on the part of the authorities to preserve trees. The plea also cited non-compliance of earlier orders passed by the high court as well as the National Green Tribunal.HT reported in December last year that of the total 4,993 trees on the streets of Vasant Vihar, 3,859 were heavily concretised. A tree census conducted by local residents showed over 450 trees had nails, tree guards, barbed wires etc. in or around them, 764 trees were lopped off and at least 793 trees were infested with termites. Based on HT’s report a complaint was filed with the Delhi forest department by environmental activists, and a petition was also filed at the Delhi high court. The report has also been quoted in the petition.The counsels for the authorities on Friday said they have taken several steps for the de-concretisation of trees.During the hearing, the court also pulled up the authorities after it perused pictures of trees given by the authorities. It took strong exception to cars parked on the pavement and said pavements are for citizens to walk on. “Is the car not an obstacle, sir? Then what were you doing? Give me an answer which is worthy of making a submission in the court...You have done nothing, therefore you are in contempt... You are an officer of the government? Law officer? Is this the answer you want to give us that we will not comply with the court’s orders,” Justice Waziri told the corporation counsel.Asking whether there is no sense of urgency for citizens rights, the judge said, “Look at the condition. Do you have no concern for your immediate neighbour, elderly gentleman who wants to go for a walk. How will he go for the walk? Look at the footpath... Every portion of it has been just concretised... Who comes first? Citizens and their rights, not the gadiwalas.”A court passed a slew of directions but a detailed copy of the order is yet to be uploaded on the high court’s website.The matter will next be heard on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/concretisation-of-trees-is-worst-kind-of-human-rights-abuse-delhi-hc-101637950728591.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi Assembly resolution seeks compensation for farmers’ families, MSP law||The Delhi assembly on Friday passed a resolution seeking compensation for families of farmers who lost their lives during the protest against the farm laws, withdrawal of cases against farmers, assurance of minimum support price (MSP) for crops, and removal of Union minister of state (home) Ajay Mishra over the deaths of farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri.The resolution, which was proposed by Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai during a special assembly session, demanded compensation for families of over 700 farmers who died during the protest.Speaking at the session, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal lauded the farmers for their patience and peaceful protest despite being called “anti-nationals”.“In my understanding, this is the longest farmers’ protest in the world. Over 700 farmers were martyred while fighting against their own government. Never thought farmers would be subjected to filthy abuses like anti-national, Khalistani, agents of China-Pakistan... The ruling party didn’t leave any chance to instigate them,” he said.The CM also noted that measures such as use of water cannons and nails drilled onto the roads to stop farmers at the Delhi borders couldn’t break their spirit.“This is not just farmers’ victory; it is the victory of democracy. In the past few years, people had started losing faith in the democratic system ever since they (BJP) came to power with a majority. But this has restored people’s faith in democracy,” said Kejriwal.He added that the government will support the farmers till the time they want to continue their protest at Delhi borders.The Bharatiya Janata Party, which is the main opposition in the Delhi assembly, said that the special session on farm laws was unnecessary, as the Centre has already initiated the process to repeal them. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the government will repeal the three contentious laws against which farmers have been protesting on Delhi’s borders for the past one year.BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the Opposition in the Delhi assembly, said, “There was no need to convene this session as the Centre has said that the laws will be withdrawn. There should have been discussion on the increasing pollution levels in Delhi, the new liquor policy which several residents are opposing, the need to reduce tax on diesel, and the plight of Delhi’s farmers.”The AAP, which is gearing up for elections in Punjab where it is the principal opposition party, has supported the farmers from the start and the CM even visited the protest site in Singhu in December last year to review the arrangements made there.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia noted that Kejriwal didn’t allow Delhi Police to use stadiums as temporary detention centres to keep protesting farmers. “Initially, the Central government took their protest lightly. They thought that they would be able to handle it, as Delhi Police is under them. But Kejriwal took a courageous decision to not allow stadiums to be used as jails to keep the farmers,” he said.While the Centre has initiated the process to repeal the farm laws in the upcoming winter session, Rai said that the government should consult farmers and provide a guarantee on MSP. “The laws were prepared and passed without any discussion with the farmers. This is not good for democracy. Even now, the government is not talking to farmers,” he said.Kejriwal also called for immediate sacking of Union minister Ajay Mishra: “I do not know what is their compulsion, but the entire country wants him (Mishra) to be removed.”Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra, who is currently in jail, is the prime accused in the October 3 Tikunia violence at Lakhimpur Kheri where eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed.BJP leader suspendedMeanwhile, Delhi assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel suspended BJP MLA Jitender Mahajan from the day-long special session, and also marshalled out BJP MLAs Mohan Singh Bisht and Anil Bajpai, for disrupting the proceedings and demanding discussion on issues such as the rising pollution level and the new liquor policy.Though the other BJP MLAs walked out of the House and protested outside, some of them later came back to participate in the discussion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-resolution-seeks-compensation-for-farmers-families-msplaw-101637949887766.html
27-11-2021||Delhi||SC seeks Centre, Delhi police reply on petition challenging Asthana appointment||The Supreme Court on Friday sought replies from the Union government and Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on petitions challenging the latter’s appointment as head of the police force for the national capital.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna issued notices to the Centre and the 1984-batch IPS officer on the petitions filed by an NGO, CPIL, which has alleged several irregularities and violation of the Supreme Court’s directives in appointing Asthana as the city police commissioner on July 27.As soon as the matter was taken up, the bench told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for CPIL, that it was issuing notice. Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for the Centre and Asthana respectively. The case is likely to be listed in the second week of December.The bench was considering two petitions by CPIL. The first was a writ petition against the Union home ministry’s July 27 order appointing Asthana and granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him. The second petition is an appeal against the Delhi high court’s October 12 judgment affirming Asthana’s appointment.On August 25, the top court asked the Delhi high court to decide within two weeks the petition filed before it by a lawyer, Sadre Alam, challenging Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police commissioner, observing that “time is of the essence”.That direction came when CPIL’s writ petition came up for a hearing for the first time before a bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, and the bench asked Bhushan to first argue his case before the high court so that the top court could have the benefit of a judgment.CJI Ramana also expressed his reservations in hearing the petition, pointing out he had conveyed his views about Asthana when the officer was being considered for the post of chief of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).In May, CJI Ramana, while participating in the high-powered committee for the selection of the CBI director (the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha were the other members), flagged a landmark 2006 Supreme Court ruling in Prakash Singh case that required a police chief to have a minimum residual tenure of six months, resulting in the disqualification of Asthana from being considered for the post of CBI director.The petition by advocate Alam and CPIL’s intervention application before the high court demanded quashing of MHA’s July 27 order appointing Asthana the Delhi Police commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Union Territory) cadre, and extension of service to him. They also argued that Asthana’s appointment was in flagrant violation of the apex court’s direction in Prakash Singh case.Rejecting the pleas on October 12, the Delhi high court upheld Asthana’s appointment holding that the Union government has a free hand in deciding who is best for the job of the top cop in the national capital, especially when the officer concerned does not have a blemish in his entire service career.The high court further noted that the requirement of a minimum six months of service left (as articulated in the Prakash Singh order) is confined only to the selection of the DGPs of the state and is not applicable in Delhi.“The executive, which is responsible for the law-and-order situation in the national capital, must have a reasonable discretion to select an officer it finds more suitable, based upon the career graph of such an officer, unless there is anything adverse in the service career of such an officer,” said the high court.It added there was no violation of the statutory rules and that the central government had the powers to give extension as well as of inter-cadre transfer to Asthana for appointing him to deal with the complexities and sensitivities in the city.The bench, while dismissing the PIL as well as the intervention application, also said that no officer with appropriate seniority and requisite experience was available in the AGMUT Cadre.“It ought to be kept in mind that Delhi, being the capital of India, has a unique, special and specific requirement. It has witnessed several untoward incidences and extremely challenging law and order situations/riots/crimes, which have an international implication, which in the wisdom of the Central Government necessitated appointment of an experienced officer possessing diverse and multifarious experience of heading a large para-military security force apart from other factors,” the bench said.Affirming the appointment, the high court also accepted the Centre’s submission that most of the appropriate level of officers of AGMUT (cadre of IPS officers for Union territories) did not have the sufficient balance of experience and policing for appointment as a top cop of the city. It also agreed to the submissions that following the same procedure, eight commissioners have thus far been appointed for the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-seeks-centre-delhi-police-reply-on-petition-challenging-asthana-appointment-101637949409006.html
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Acclaimed Punjabi short story writer Mohan Bhandari passes away at 84||The news of the death of acclaimed Punjabi short story writer Mohan Bhandari travelled in Chandigarh’s literary circles in no time on Friday. Ailing for some years, the writer breathed his last at his Sector 34 home. He was 84. A recipient of several awards, Bhandari, besides being a prolific writer of short fiction, was also a translator. He had to his credit five collections of short stories and as many books of stories translated from Hindi and Urdu. Apart from that, he edited a number of books. He won the Sahitya Akademi award for his collection of stories ‘Moon di Akh’ in 1997. He, however, returned the award in 2015 in solidarity with the nationwide protest by writers against alleged growing intolerance. “It pains me to see growing intolerance and communalism against which we writers have always raised a strong voice in our writings. Returning the award is a way of bringing attention to the disturbing conditions prevailing in the country today,” he had said. Early life Bhandari was born in Banbhaura village of Punjab’s Sangrur district to unlettered parents on February 14, 1937. His father had a small shop which he gambled away along with the little land he owned. Bhandari grew up in tough times but the village landscape and life influenced him richly and he wrote his first short story in Class 9 and there was no looking back since. The story that made him famous, which I had the privilege of translating into English was ‘Mainu Tagore Bana de, Ma’. It is a tale of love and longing of a bright village schoolboy with a flair for writing and has to give up schooling for want of resources. Poverty forces the teen to become a daily-wage labourer. The story had a great impact and Bhandari was counted among one of the progressive writers of Punjabi language.Chandigarh, the second homeVery much the life and soul of the Coffee House culture in Sector 17, Chandigarh, he worked in the Punjab education department. The city was home to him since the 1960s. Usually, he would spend his lunch time with friends such as late writers Bhushan and Amar Giri, painter Raj Kumar among others. The motley group would hold deep discussion on life and literature over coffee and cigarettes (there was no ban on public smoking back then).The writer is survived by his wife Nirmal and three sons, Sanjeev, Rajiv and Rahul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/acclaimed-punjabi-short-story-writer-mohan-bhandari-passes-away-at-84-101637937105782.html
