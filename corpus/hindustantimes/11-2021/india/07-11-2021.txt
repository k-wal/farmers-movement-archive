07-11-2021||India||HT This Day: Nov 8, 1975 — Mrs Gandhi’s election upheld, unanimous verdict of Supreme Court||The Supreme Court today (November 7) unanimously upheld the election of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in 1971 and reversed the judgment of the Allahabad High Court setting aside her election and disqualifying her.The judgment of the five-member constitution bench of the court was handed down today. In five separate judgments, the court upheld the validity of the amendments to the election laws made in 1974 and in 1975. They ruled that Mrs Gandhi had committed no corrupt practice and had not exceeded the ceiling in her election expenses.The five judges - Chief Justice A. N. Ray, and Justices H. R. Khanna, K. K. Wathew, M. H. Beg and Y. V. Chandrachud gave varying reasons for their conclusions.Chief Justice Ray, Mr Khanna and Mr Mathew have upheld the changes in the Constitution, barring one part, and election laws amendments in 1974 and 1975.The three were unanimous in holding as bad the new Clause 4 of Article 329A of the Constitution which validated Mrs Gandhi’s election.The Chief Justice, whose ruling was first handed down, upheld the validity of the changes in the election law made in 1974 and 1975 to decide, the High Court finding that Mrs Gandhi’s election was in valid because of the corrupt practices of using Government servants for advancing her election prospects.He also upheld the Allahabad High Court judgment rejecting Mr Raj Narain’s contentions that the ‘cow and calf’used by Mrs Gandhi was a religious symbol and that she had exceeded the prescribed celling on election expenses.The Chief Justice struck down Article 329-A(4) because it was “declaratory judgment and not a law”. The “constituent power” (legislature) could exercise judicial power “but it has to apply law”, he affirmed.(Clause 4 of Article 329(A) lays down that the election to Parliament of the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha cannot be void under any law or court order made before the 30th Constitutes Amendment).Mr Khanna struck down this clause on the ground that it “violates the principle of free and fair elections which is an essential postulate of Democracy and is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.He said the validity of the other provisions of the 39th Amendment could not be assailed on the ground either of the wisdom of the legislature or the propriety or of the detention of some MPs at the time of its passage.The court was filled to capacity by the time the five judges entered at 10.30 a.m.Mr A K Sen and Mr J. B Dadachandji for the Prime Minister and Mr J P Goel and V Khandooja for Mr Raj Narain were among the counsels present. Mr Shanti Bhushan, chief counsel for Mr Narain, was not in the court.Mr Ray took 50 minutes to reed extracts from his 90-page judgement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-nov-8-1975-mrs-gandhi-s-election-upheld-unanimous-verdict-of-supreme-court-101636308049920.html

"Crude oil prices were 105 US dollars in 2014 and now it is 83 US dollars. BJP lied to the public saying that prices of petrol and diesel have increased internationally," news agency ANI quoted Chandrashekhar Rao as saying in Hyderabad on Sunday."What has BJP done in the last 7 years? India’s GDP is less than Bangladesh, Pakistan and Centre has increased taxes unnecessarily," KCR, as the Chief Minister is popularly known, said.The Telangana CM also demanded the Central government to remove the cess on petrol and fuel. “We will continue to fight...and we will hold dharna for withdrawing cess on petrol and diesel,” he said.He also raked up a report given by the Pentagon to the US Congress confirming that China has intruded 4.5 km within the territory of Arunachal Pradesh. “China is attacking us in Arunachal Pradesh but Centre hasn't taken any action,” the Telangana CM said, continuing his tirade against the Centre.Also read | Andhra Pradesh rules out reducing VAT on petrol, clarifies stance via adAlleging that the Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are claiming they would file cases against him and send him to prison, KCR dared the leaders to touch him. “We'll cut your tongues if you pass unnecessary comments on us,” KCR warned.We'll cut your (TS BJP leaders) tongues if you pass unnecessary comments on us.

07-11-2021||India||Andhra Pradesh rules out reducing VAT on petrol, clarifies stance via ad||The Andhra Pradesh government ruled out reducing value-added tax on petrol and diesel on Sunday and also took out an ad in several newspapers clarifying its stand on the issue.The AP government justified its move by saying that the Centre did not adequately compensate the state government despite collecting ₹3.35 lakh crore as central excise. The ads published by the government came after the opposition parties protested against the state government for not reducing VAT on petrol and diesel.“Although the central government collected ₹3.35 lakh crore as Central Excise on petrol and diesel, it distributed only ₹19,475 crore as state’s share, which is just 5.80%. The Centre has to distribute 41% of taxes collected to the states,” the Andhra government said in its ad.It also published a table in the ad where it showed excise duty collected (by the Centre) as only ₹47,500 crore, of which 41% ( ₹19,475 crore) was given away as the state’s share while also claiming that Centre collected ₹2.87 lakh crore in the form of cess and surcharges to avoid a divisible pool of petro income and thereby reduced the state’s share of petro revenue.The ad which was issued by the Andhra Pradesh government was issued under the name of minister Buggana Rajendranth who further added that the state government was collecting an additional VAT of ₹4 and a cess of Re 1, apart from the 31% and 22.5% VAT, on a litre of petrol and diesel respectively.“The very same people who have increased the price of a litre petrol and diesel beyond ₹100 and reduced it now by just ₹5 and 10 are protesting on roads for political mileage,” the state government said via the ad while claiming that it imposed a special duty of “just one rupee” per litre as development and repair of 8,970 km of roads was undertaken.“The ad is full of lies. How could the state government make false claims based on all-India revenue? It should clearly state how much share it has received from the Centre,” BJP Andhra Pradesh president Somu Veerraju said and claimed that the information in the ad was misleading. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) also criticized the government and said that it revealed the state government’s true intentions regarding the reduction in fuel prices. It also called the advertisement “fake”.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-rules-out-reducing-vat-on-petrol-clarifies-stance-via-ad-101636303208304.html

Kejriwal was responding to allegations of indulging in “soft Hindutva” before assembly elections commenced in five states.“Do you not go to temple? There is nothing wrong with visiting temples... I am a Hindu, I visit Ram temple, Hanuman temple.. why would anyone have a problem with it?...Why are they accusing me? Let people say,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener told reporters in Panaji.AAP, which is looking to make in-roads in Uttar Pradesh in next year’s assembly elections, announced a tiranga yatra in Ayodhya last month, in a bid to woo upper caste voters. The party had failed to make any headway in UP in the previous assembly election and lost their deposit in 76 of the 77 seats it contested.The yatra was launched by Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and AAP’s UP in-charge Sanjay Singh. Both of them also visited the Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanumangarhi temple in Ayodhya.Kejriwal, who is on a tour of poll-bound Goa, became the first Delhi chief minister to visit the head office of the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj in Panaji on Sunday."Goa is the land of Lord Parashurama. On this land, the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj was established in the city of Panaji in 1962. Delhi CM Kejriwal has come to meet the people of the Bhandari community. It is a matter of pride for us. This is the first time that the Chief Minister of Delhi has come to meet the people of the Gomantak Bhandari community," Ashok Naik, the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj president, told news agency ANI.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant hit out at Kejriwal over the latter’s pilgrimage scheme, claiming that the Delhi-based party was copying his government’s policies. Kejriwal in turn accused Sawant of copying him.Alleging that Pramod Sawant is copying AAP, he said, "When I said we will give electricity free, he gave water free. When I said we will provide employment allowance, he announced about 10,000 jobs, and when I spoke about pilgrimages, he announced his scheme.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-visit-ram-temple-because-i-am-a-hindu-arvind-kejriwal-on-allegations-of-peddling-soft-hindutva-101636302113604.html

Yadav, who also inducted senior BSP leaders Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar in the Samajwadi Party, said that the ‘triple-engine’ of the BJP will not allow farmers to get justice.Yadav’s ‘triple-engine’ jibe was apparently a reference to Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra’s car allegedly mowing down 4 protesters in Lakhimpur Kheri last month, with the double engine being the BJP-run governments at the centre and in Uttar Pradesh. He said if the BJP remains in power in the state farmers will not get justice.“The farmers are our backbone, who give support to the economy, and are our 'annadata', but the BJP government has cheated them and has done injustice to them,” Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Yadav also attacked the Centre’s scheme aimed at distribution of LPG cylinders to poor households, the ‘Ujjwala Yojana’.“Due to price rise, the 'Ujjwala Yojana' has become 'bujwalla' (a damp squib)yojana. And our 'Baba Chief Minister' sometimes is afraid of red colour. Our CM in order to reduce the price rise can change the colour of the cylinder or its name,” Yadav was quoted as saying.He also claimed that the recent slashing of fuel prices by reducing taxes was a byproduct of the BJP’s performance in the bypolls adding that the prices will drop further if BJP loses the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. The Samajwadi Party leader also claimed that India’s earned a bad reputation due ‘poor handling of the Covid-19 pandemic’.Yadav sharpened his attack against Yogi Adityanath using the UP government’s promise to distribute laptops to students. He said that ‘the world has moved on since and people are carrying computers in their pockets in the form of phones’. In an apparent reference to the CM, Yadav asked people not to ‘look up to a leader who doesn’t know how to operate a laptop’ while challenging the government to reveal the figures for the number of laptops distributed in the last four and half years the BJP has been in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-triple-engine-govt-will-not-give-justice-to-farmers-akhilesh-101636297823721.html
07-11-2021||India||Delhi HC dissolves marriage, says husband viewed his wife only as a 'cash cow'||The Delhi High Court has granted divorce to a couple and dissolved the marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, setting aside a family court's order which rejected the wife's divorce plea.Citing the husband's materialistic attitude, the court observed that the husband viewed his wife as a "cash cow" and became interested in her only after she got a job with the Delhi Police, said a report by news agency PTI on Sunday.A bench headed by Justice Vipin Sanghi said the relationship would have brought mental agony and trauma to the wife as the husband did not have any emotional ties with her.The bench, also comprising Justice Jasmeet Singh, observed that the husband appeared to be "not interested in nurturing the marriage but only interested in the wife's income"."The continued distance between the parties even after the appellant (wife) attained majority would, in itself, have caused trauma and resulted in cruelty to the appellant apart from everything else... (the) circumstance probabalises the stand of the appellant, that the respondent (husband) harassed the appellant to pocket her income, since he was himself unemployed,” PTI quoted the court as saying."The respondent, it appears, viewed the appellant as a cash cow and became interested in her only after she got the job with the Delhi Police. Such brazenly materialistic attitude of the respondent, with no emotional ties, would have in itself caused mental agony and trauma to the appellant sufficient to constitute cruelty to her,” the court added.The woman sought a divorce on the grounds that the husband was unemployed, an alcoholic and used to physically abuse her and demand money.According to the PTI report, the marriage was solemnised when the husband and the wife were 19 years old and 13 years old, respectively. The wife was not taken to the matrimonial home until November 2014, that is, when she secured a job with the Delhi Police, said the report further.The husband opposed the dissolution of marriage on the ground that he funded the woman's education because of which she secured the job.The court observed that since the wife was living with her parents till 2014, it was "obvious that all her expenses for living and upbringing would have been borne by her parents" and there was nothing to show the contrary.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-dissolves-marriage-says-husband-viewed-his-wife-only-as-a-cash-cow-101636295790620.html

The attack added to tensions over the refusal by Iran-backed militias to accept last month’s parliamentary election results.Seven security guards were injured in the attack by at least three drones in the heavily fortified Green Zone. There was no claim for the attack, but suspicion immediately fell on the Iran-backed militias that have publicly attacked Al-Kadhimi and issued threats.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi responded to the attack by condemning it and expressing concern over the casualties.“We strongly condemn the assassination attempt by drone attack [on Sunday] morning on the Iraqi Prime Minister, Mr Mustafa al-Kadhimi,” he said.“Terrorism and violence have no place in any civilised society. They cannot be allowed to undermine peace and stability in Iraq,” he added.Bagchi also expressed India’s concerns for the casualties caused by the attack and reiterated the country’s “support for the democratic process in Iraq”.Troops deployed around Baghdad following the failed assassination attempt. Al-Kadhimi was unharmed and later appeared on Iraqi television, his left hand wrapped in a bandage. An aide confirmed a light cut.“Cowardly rocket and drone attacks don’t build homelands and don’t build a future,” he said. He called for calm and constructive dialogue “for the sake of Iraq and the future of Iraq”.Iraqi interior ministry spokesman Gen Saad Maan, speaking to a state-run media outlet, said security forces were able to down two of the three drones used for the attack. The US state department also condemned what it said was an “apparent act of terrorism”. Spokesperson Ned Price said, “We are in close touch with the Iraqi security forces charged with upholding Iraq’s sovereignty and independence and have offered our assistance as they investigate this attack.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-attempt-on-life-of-iraqi-pm-101636296589116.html

The issue came to light after Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin sent a letter to his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday thanking him for the permission to cut trees near the baby dam in Mullaperiyar reservoir.The letter triggered a big controversy in the state and opposition Congress and BJP alleged that the CM’s office gave permission bypassing concerned ministries. They said the decision will weaken the state’s long-pending demand for a new dam. “The CM should clarify his position on TN’s decision to raise the water level to 152 feet. He said in the assembly recently that TN has shown a favourable approach to Kerala’s growing concern. But this is not a favourable move,” said former water resources minister NK Premachandran MP. The opposition said officials can’t decide on their own and the government is searching for scapegoats now. The CM is yet to react to the issue. The TN CM’s letter came at a time when TN minister Dorai Murugan’s statement, that the state will raise the water level to 152 feet after strengthening the baby dam, triggered a big protest in downstream areas of the dam. There are reports that chief wildlife warden Bennichan Thomas prepared the order after a meeting of concerned secretaries. But once the issue snowballed into a big controversy, officials disowned the controversial decision and blamed the political leadership. Two states have been fighting over the water level in the 126 -year-old Mullaperiyar dam for more than two decades. While Kerala wants the water level to be reduced to 138 feet and build a new dam, TN favours water level should be raised to 152 feet saying it was strong enough to withstand any pressure.Idukki district, where Mullaperiyar is situated, has around 20 small and big dams. Four are major ones and include Mullaperiyar, Idukki, Gavi and Kaki. Dam experts fear a chain reaction in case of a disaster that will affect 3.5 million people living downstream. Tamil Nadu, however, dismisses it saying it is strong enough and every year it carries out regular maintenance. While Kerala insists on a new dam, Tamil Nadu is opposing it fearing it may lose control over the dam which is the lifeline of five districts in southern TN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mullaperiyar-dam-kerala-revokes-controversial-order-on-tree-felling-101636295150303.html

Malik, however, taunted the Delhi 'netas' saying they express condolences even when an animal dies, but no condolences were offered when 600 people died during the farmers' protest, he claimed.“600 people have died in this farm movement... Even when an animal dies, Delhi 'netas' express condolences, but they could not pass the proposal of 600 farmers in Lok Sabha..,” news agency ANI quoted Malik as saying in Jaipur, in an apparent swipe at the Union government.Malik added that he would leave the governor's post if he's asked to do so by 'Delhi people'.“If I say something on farm issues, it will become a controversy. I wait for weeks for a call from Delhi...A Guv can't be removed but my well-wishers wait for me to say something... The day I am told by Delhi people to leave, I will do so,” Malik, who was also the governor of Jammu and Kashmir, said further.#WATCH | 600 people have died in this farm movement... Even when an animal dies, Delhi 'netas' express condolences, but they could not pass the proposal of 600 farmers in Lok Sabha..: Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik, in Jaipur pic.twitter.com/Mz8RiaCScCThis comes days after Satya Pal Malik said the Bharatiya Janata Party will not return to power unless the government listens to the farmers agitating over the farm laws. In March, Malik extended his support to the farmers' agitation and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to not offend the protesters.Farmers have been protesting at different sites since November 26 last year against the three farm laws.In October, Mailk accused the Pramod Sawant-led Goa government of corruption.“There was corruption in everything the Goa government did (during the Covid-19 pandemic). I was removed for my allegation of corruption against the Goa government,” Malik alleged.This led to opposition parties demanding the sacking of Promod Sawant. “You must immediately seek resignation from the chief minister and announce investigation by an independent agency,” the AITC's memorandum to the governor P S Sridharan Pillai said.Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said Malik's interview endorsed the corruption allegations leveled by the Congress, and demanded dismissal of the Sawant-led cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/even-when-an-animal-dies-satya-pal-malik-s-swipe-at-centre-over-farm-laws-101636290032239.html

News agency ANI reported Arbaaz Merchant and Achit Kumar already reached the NCB office on Sunday. Reports claimed that Aryan was asked to be present before the SIT on Sunday but because of a slight fever, he could not come on Sunday. Since Aryan's case is not the only case that has been transferred to this Delhi team, Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan is also likely to be summoned as his case has also been transferred from NCB Mumbai to NCB SIT. The transfer of the case came at a time NCB Mumbai chief Sameer Wankhede is facing a vigilance probe. The central agency, however, said the cases have been shifted because of the national importance of the cases.Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant, friends from childhood, were arrested from a Goa-bound cruise party on allegations of doing drugs. Achit Kumar was arrested later based on the information given by Aryan and Arbaaz who told investigators that Achit got them drugs. All three of them are now out on bail. According to Aryan and Arbaaz's bail conditions, they have to visit the NCB office every Friday. In addition, they will have to be present at the NCB as and when required for the investigation.The Aryan Khan case is now under Deputy Director-General Sanjay Kumar Singh who is heading the SIT. Sameer Wankhede will assist in the investigation, he said.Apart from the Aryan Khan case, the other five cases that now lie with the SIT include the Samir Khan case (son-in-law of Nawab Malik), the Mumbra case, Jogeshwari case, Dongri case and Armaan Kohli case.The cruise case took a bigger political turn because of the involvement of Shah Rukh Khan's son as the Nationalist Congress Party and the BJP are now trading barbs over the case. Meanwhile, some reports claimed Shah Rukh Khan visited Delhi at the weekend and was seen at a private airport in Mumbai as he returned on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-aryan-khan-arbaaz-merchant-achit-kumar-have-been-summoned-by-ncb-again-101636291326252.html

Governments cannot use stringent laws like UAPA to suppress reporting on such incidents,” it said.ALSO READ | Tripura violence: Cong, CPI(M) condemn police action against lawyers, othersThe EGI demanded that the state government conduct an objective and fair investigation into the circumstances of the rights instead of penalising journalists and civil society activists.“Further, the Guild reiterates its earlier demand to the Supreme Court of India to take cognisance of the manner in which such laws are unjustifiably used against freedom of speech, and to issue stringent guidelines on charging journalist under them, so that these laws don't become an easy tool for suppressing press freedom,” it said.A mosque was vandalised and two shops were set ablaze at Chamtilla in Tripura during a rally by Vishva Hindu Parishad on October 26, called to protest against the communal violence in neighbouring Bangladesh.Three houses and a few shops, reportedly owned by Muslims, were also ransacked in nearby Rowa Bazar, according to police.The state government had on October 29 alleged that a group from outside with vested interests had hatched a conspiracy against the administration to create unrest in Tripura and malign its image by uploading fake photographs of a burning mosque on social media after the October 26 incident.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/editors-guild-condemns-police-action-against-journalists-in-tripura-under-uapa-101636286346781.html

The ED moved the HC on Saturday night after the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court refused additional custody of Deshmukh to ED and sent him to 14-day judicial custody. ED argued before the single judge bench of justice Madhav Jamdar that the money laundering case probe was at a crucial stage and refusal to extend Deshmukh’s custody will hamper the entire investigation.Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri and advocate Aniket Nikam, representing Deshmukh, said they were not opposing ED’s application and were willing to cooperate since the day the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader visited ED’s office on November 2 and was subsequently arrested after 12 hours of interrogation.

In January 2020, we got the first [Covid-19] positive case and nowhere in the world did anyone know what to do; within nine months task forces were step up, the PM visited the labs and encouraged the scientists and the result is that 30% of the population has been given both doses [of anti- Covid vaccines] and the [World Health Organization] WHO has given its nod to the India-made COVAXIN,” he said.BJP’s NEC is meeting after two years. It is the key decision making body of the party comprising chief ministers of BJP ruled states, state unit presidents and other functionaries. “Whenever there has been a tragedy of this scale, economy is disrupted, transportation is affected and hunger strikes, the biggest challenge is to meet the need for food, but because of the PM’s foresight, we rolled out the biggest food programme which gave 80 crore people ration every month including 5 kgs of grain and pulses,” he said.He said the decisions taken by the Union government helped bring the economy back on rails and businesses were growing. “The biggest example is the increase in the collection of GST,” Pradhan said .Pradhan said party had used technological platforms for the first time, allowing 218 of the 342 members to be present at the NEC meeting virtually. Party veterans LK Advani and MM Joshi too had joined from their respective residences.The NEC also thanked the PM for repealing article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.“When CAA was passed; people said all kinds of things. …when the Taliban took over Afghanistan, PM’s foresight was proved right. The categories [of eligible people under the law] we had planned to help, have been given security within the constitutional framework,” he said. India has committed to fast tracking citizenship for persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries which includes Sikhs from Afghanistan.Also Read | New story in Bengal: Nadda’s message to party workers at key BJP meetWhile the government has been unable to break the deadlock over the three contentious farm laws that have resulted in over a year long farmers’ protest, and may impact its electoral fortunes in states such as Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, Pradhan said the government has been sensitive to the Sikh community as well as the farmers.“People say many things about the farmers’ agitation. In 2014, farmers used to get ₹23,000 crore in the budget, however, in the last budget, the amount reached ₹123,000 crore. The MSP [minimum support price] of all agricultural commodities has been increased and the government has demonstrated the highest responsibility,” he said.Talking about the steps taken to address the concerns of Sikhs in particular; Pradhan said the Modi government did four major things, the gurudwara were allowed FCRA grant; the langars have been exempt from GST, and ₹120 crore had been spent for the Kartarpur corridor completion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-thanks-pm-modi-for-steps-taken-to-revive-economy-101636278826158.html
07-11-2021||India||BJP sets new targets for expansion||The Bharatiya Janata Party has set three targets for expansion of base in poll-bound states and in regions where its organisational structure is weak. The party aims to set up booth committees in all the 104,000 polling stations in the country by December 25; appoint panna pramukhs ( voter list in charge) in all states by April 6, 2022; and ensure broadcast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio programme ‘Man Ki Baat’ by May 2022 across all polling booths in the country.Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said the targets were set at the ongoing meeting of the national executive committee in the Capital.“In Gujarat, the party carried out an experiment, where apart from booth committees, page committees were also set up. By December 25, all booth committees will be ready, at present about 85% have been completed. Now, we will also have the target of [appointing] panna pramukhs in all the polling station[s],” he said.The BJP relies on these organisational units on the ground to increase people to people contact, and increase the scope of its election campaign, the leader said.The institutionalised broadcast of the PM’s monthly radio show Man Ki Baat is aimed at enhancing the reach of Narendra Modi’s message to the people. “The PM speaks directly to the people, through Mann ki Baat and at the booth level it will be institutionalised by making arrangement by May 2022 for its relay,” Pradhan said.He added that party president JP Nadda quoted his predecessor Amit Shah at the NEC meet while exhorting BJP members to increase the party’s foot print and said that its “peak was yet to come”.Also Read | New story in Bengal: Nadda’s message to party workers at key BJP meet“In 2014, Shah had set targets, many of which we achieved such as (winning) Assam, Tripura and other states in the NE. He had said that Uttkarsh Aana Baki Hai, Nadda repeated it,” Pradhan said.“There are many challenges ahead still. We will review the past, draw up the future plans,” Pradhan said. The party has set its sights on becoming a dominant political force in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Telengana and Andhra Pradesh.“In Telangana, the party has already made an impact, it has won in two by polls indicating that the party is emerging as an alternative to the ruling TRS,” Pradhan said .He also cited the BJP’s increased vote share in West Bengal between 2016 to 2021 as an example of exponential growth. “ Only NT Rama Rao had accomplished such a feat when he defeated the Congress,” Pradhan said .Pradhan, who is also in charge of party’s UP election campaign, said party leaders expressed gratitude towards the PM at the NEC meet for his foresight and efforts in bringing the country back on track after the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-sets-new-targets-for-expansion-101636276485820.html

Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Sunday claimed that Aryan Khan was actually kidnapped and BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya was the mastermind of the entire plot of 'kidnapping' Aryan Khan.BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya on Saturday claimed KP Gosavi, Sam D'Souza actually worked for NCP strongman Sunil Patil and without naming Nawab Malik, Mohit said NCP leaders staged Aryan Khan's arrest to extort money from Shah Rukh Khan.Countering these allegations, Nawab Malik Kashiff Khan, the head of Fashion TV, forced Maharashtra minister Aslam Shaikh to come to the party and was also planning to bring children of various ministers of the Maharashtra government to the party. "If Aslam Shaikh had gone there it would have been Udta Maharashtra after Udta Punjab," Nawab Malik said, alleging that as Aryan Khan was invited to the party and did not buy the tickets himself, it was a case of kidnapping.Citing a witness in the case, Vijay Pagare, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik said the plan of 'kidnapping' Aryan Khan was hatched in the Lalit hotel for the last seven months.Using Nawab Malik's statement of Kashiff Khan forcing Aslam Shaikh, BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya said, "Nawab Malik confirmed that Aslam Shaikh has relations with Kashiff Khan and that the children of NCP leaders, ministers are in contact with drug peddlers. Sunil Patil and Nawab Malik are friends for the last 20 years. When Sunil Patil used to have parties in Lalit Hotel, Nawab Malik used to go there. Today Nawab Malik has confirmed his relations with him and it's a conspiracy set up by the NCP along with Sunil Patil," the BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nawab-malik-confirmed-that-bjp-leader-on-aryan-was-kidnapped-allegation-101636275273766.html

07-11-2021||India||Nawab Malik claims BJP leader behind Aryan Khan’s ‘kidnapping & ransom’ plot||Maharashtra minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik on Sunday alleged that the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede was part of a plot to “kidnap” Aryan Khan, the son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, for ransom, and former BJP Yuva Morcha president in Mumbai, Mohit Bharatiya was the “mastermind” . Aryan Khan was held on October 3 last month on the charges of drug consumption and involvement in international drug trade following the alleged recovery of drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast in a raid by a NCB team led by Wankhede. However, Malik, in a series of press conferences, has alleged that Wankhede ran a drugs and extortion racket and Bhartiya too was involved in the fake raid to “frame” Aryan Khan. On Sunday, Malik also alleged that Aryan’s father Shahrukh Khan and his private secretary Pooja Dadlani were threatened that they will be falsely framed for giving bribe. Malik alleged that Mohit Kamboj Bhartiya was part of a “private army” operated by Wankhede and had met him at a graveyard in suburban Oshiwara regarding the plot. The minister further said that Aryan Khan was trapped and made to come to the cruise party through Kamboj’s brother-in-law and two others. He also claimed that the people associated with the cruise party including Sam D’souza and Manish Bhanushali were putting up at Hotel Lalit since September 27. Kamboj had earlier on October 9, asked Malik to desist from making defamatory statements and filed a defamation case on October 26.On Sunday, Malik also refuted Bhartiya’s allegation that Sunil Patilwas a NCP worker who had orchestrated the cruise drugs case and instead alleged that Patil’s many pictures with BJP leaders including with a Union minister were circulating on social media, suggesting otherwise. “Mohit Kamboj has said that Sunil Patil is associated with NCP and its leaders. I would like to clarify that I have never met him. Patil is a fraud and an action needs to be taken against him, but it is not true that he is associated with us.In fact his pictures with many top BJP leaders are making rounds in social media,” he said. Malik also released an audio clip of a conversation between Sanville D’souza and NCB officer VV Singh.Sam D’souza’s real name is Sanville D’souza and he is an accused in a weed bakery case. Malik asked why NCB had not arrested him in the last four months. Bharatiya on Saturday alleged that Sunil Patil was an NCP member and had given the number of Kiran Gosavi, an independent witness in the cruise drugs case, to Sam D’Souza and told him that Gosavi will co-ordinate with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Also Read: Bombay HC remands ex-Maha minister Anil Deshmukh in ED custody till November 12Malik on Sunday said that his cabinet colleague and Congress leader Aslam Shaikh and a few children related to the ruling party leaders were invited to the Cordelia cruise ship party with the intention of framing them. BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar has demanded an FIR against Sunil Patil and a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the entire matter. “The daily press conferences by Nawab Malik are an attempt to shield people involved in drug racket and police transfers. Patil is part of an inter state racket which needs to be investigated by an agency like CBI,” he said. BJP leader and law maker Ram Kadam claimed that Nawab Malik was on the back foot after realising that the ruling party’s link to the drug case had been exposed. “...In fact the ruling party leaders were involved in extortion from Shah Rukh Khan through Kiran Gosavi. The extortion racket was being run by the ruling party leaders and it was part-2 of ‘Vaze Vasuligate’. Now, the state government should seek a CBI inquiry in the drug case. It should also conduct a narco test on Kiran Gosavi and others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nawab-malik-claims-bjp-leader-behind-aryan-khan-s-kidnapping-ransom-plot-101636274025876.html

It was Pratik Gaba and Amir Furniturewala who brought him there. It's a matter of kidnapping and ransom. Mohit Kamboj is the mastermind and partner of Sameer Wankhede in demanding ransom.”2. “Mohit Kamboj and Sameer Wankhede met outside the Oshiwara graveyard on October 7, after which Wankhede panicked and complained to the police that they were being chased. They were lucky that the nearby CCTV camera was not working and we couldn't get the feed.”3. “A paper roll that was a brand of Fashion TV was seized in the case and it is being said the drug is consumed through that roll. Why was the owner not arrested? The owner of this brand is Kashiff Khan. He is a partner of Wankhede and was present at the party.”4. “Kashiff Khan forced our minister Aslam Shaikh to come to the party and was also planning to bring the children of various ministers of our government to the party. Had Aslam Shaikh gone there it would have been ‘Udta Maharashtra’ after ‘Udta Punjab’.”5. “Vijay Pagare told me that they were staying in the Lalit hotel for the last seven months. Manish, Vilas Bhanushali, and Sam D'Souza used to go visit them. Girls were also known to frequent the place; drugs were consumed and the money was also exchanged there.”Pagare is the Mumbai-based businessman who earlier made the sensational claim that the October 2 cruise raid was “pre-planned” and that there was a long line of political games being played in the backdrop of Maharashtra that resulted in such a raid.Pagare recorded his statement with the Mumbai Police earlier this week, where he said that he personally knew people involved with the raid, including NCB’s independent witness Kiran Gosavi, whose selfie with Aryan Khan went viral on the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wouldve-been-udta-maharashtra-nawab-malik-s-latest-claims-on-drugs-bust-in-5-points-101636265039682.html

07-11-2021||India||Maharashtra logs lowest single-day Covid infections since April 2020||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 661 new Covid cases, which was the lowest in the last 558 days when 522 fresh cases were registered on April 27, 2020. The current dip in daily cases was partly due to the lower number of tests conducted owing to the festive season. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 70,179 samples, and on Friday, it conducted 57,290 tests. In comparison, the 522 cases registered on April 27 last year resulted from 5,217 tests at a high positivity rate of 10.01%, over 9% more than the 0.94% registered on Friday. Maharashtra reported 10 Covid related fatalities on Saturday, taking the statewide death toll to 140,372. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 176 new Covid cases and 4 related deaths, pushing the toll to 16,273. Mumbai’s active caseload dropped to 3,819. The number of active cases in the state stood at 14,714.For the past few months, Maharashtra has seen a downward trend in the number of new infections. The state health department officials said that even when the number of tests go up again, daily Covid cases in the state were likely to remain under 1000. “There is no significant increase or spurt anywhere in the past few weeks. We expect the state to maintain around 1,000 fresh cases daily,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Also Read: Two dead after blaze at a residential building in MumbaiPune rural reported 134 new cases on Saturday but Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad reported no fresh cases, the state’s daily bulletin showed.“In many districts, the testing centres, including private ones, were shut due to Diwali.

Taking to Twitter, the actor explained he made the appeal as a citizen and not as an actor, adding that he raised the issue so that nobody has to face a similar problem in the near future.“What if the food doesn't get delivered but (the app) shows it has been delivered? Should people stay hungry? It is not about delivering new clothes, when one can wait. It is about food,” Chatterjee tweeted. He added that though some people might still laugh at him, he only wanted to make people aware that employees from the service industry should be more responsible.“I have no personal grudge against anyone. In fact, I have ordered food against through this very food delivery app. I'm sure there are people who have faced similar issues. I just want that this never happens to anyone of us,” the 62-year-old further said. https://t.co/ef7BQHd3A4 pic.twitter.com/hgh4RWR9VBOn Saturday, Chatterjee tagged both PM Modi and CM Mamata in a tweet in which he described an issue he recently faced with Swiggy. “On 3rd November, I placed an order. After some time the status of the order changed to delivered, but I never received the food. After raising the issue with Swiggy, they refunded me the money since the order was prepaid,” he wrote.Though he clarified in the same tweet the reason behind tagging the two politicians, it still invited ridicule and derision from social media users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wrote-as-a-citizen-actor-prosenjit-explains-why-he-tagged-pm-modi-cm-mamata-in-tweet-on-swiggy-101636261458913.html

Charges explained||Six leaders of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) terror outfit, founded by Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) chief and 26/11 Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed, were acquitted by a Pakistan court on Saturday in a terror-financing case. The Lahore high court set aside a trial court's conviction and acquitted the six leaders of the banned outfit, the front organisation for the Lashkar outfit.In April this year, an anti-terrorism court in Lahore had handed a nine-year imprisonment term to each of the five top JuD leaders – Malik Zafar Iqbal, Yahya Mujahid (JuD spokesperson), Nasarullah, Samiullah, and Umar Bahadur. A six-month jail term was also handed to JuD chief Hafiz Saeed's brother-in-law Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, following up on an FIR registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of the Punjab Police.What were the charges?The notorious leaders were found guilty of terror financing, specifically for collecting funds and channeling them to LeT accounts, thereby, unlawfully financing the proscribed terror outfit. The trial court convicted the JuD leaders of terror financing-related charges and also ordered the confiscation of assets made from funds collected through terrorism financing.However, the Lahore high court on Saturday set aside the trial court's conviction in the case against the six JuD leaders after noting that the prosecution “failed to prove the charge against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt”.A court official told news agency PTI that the Lahore high court division bench, comprising Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, allowed the petition of the JuD leaders after observing that “the statement of the ‘star prosecution witness’ is not reliable as there is no corroboratory evidence”.The defence counsel, representing the JuD leaders, told the high court that the Al-Anfaal Trust, of which the petitioners were members, has no “nexus with the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).” Although the prosecution argued that the trust in question was working as a “proxy for the LeT” and that the appellants were office-bearers of the trust, the allegations were dismissed by the court.Hafiz Saeed has been named by the United States as a specially designated global terrorist, offering a $10-million reward for information since 2012. Earlier, Saeed was listed as a terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-court-acquits-6-leaders-of-hafiz-saeed-s-banned-jud-outfit-the-charges-explained-101636257785236.html
07-11-2021||India||National Cancer Awareness Day 2021: History and significance of November 7||November 7 is observed annually as National Cancer Awareness Day in India to raise awareness about cancer, of which 1.1 million cases are reported in the country each year. National Cancer Awareness Day was first announced in September 2014 by then Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, with November 7 chosen for the occasion to coincide with the birth anniversary of Nobel laureate Marie Curie, who was born on this date in 1867, and whose works led to the development of radiotherapy to treat cancer.An important step in the country's fight against this deadly disease began in 1975, with the launch of National Cancer Control Programme, which was rolled out to provide cancer treatment facilities in the nation. 10 years later, in 1984-85, the scheme's vision was revised to focus on early detection and prevention of cancer.Hence, on November 7 every year, people are encouraged to visit hospitals, Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) centres, and municipal clinics for free cancer screening. The day also sees circulation of booklets and leaflets to raise awareness among the masses on detection of early symptoms and prevention of cancer.In India, the need for early detection of this disease stems from the fact that a large number of cases are those in which it is detected in the patient when it is already at an advanced stage, thus reducing the chances of survival. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is a leading cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 10 million fatalities in 2020. Cancer in lungs, colon and rectum, liver, stomach and breast, respectively, was the most common cause of death due to the disease, last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-cancer-awareness-day-history-and-significance-of-november-7-101636255735691.html

07-11-2021||India||TDP plans protests over rising fuel prices across Andhra on November 9||Telugu Desam Party, the main opposition party in Andhra Pradesh, will hold dharnas at all petrol bunks in the state on November 9 demanding that the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy reduce the Value Added Tax on petrol and diesel in the state.“The party cadres will take part in a one-hour dharna at all petrol bunks in the state from 12 noon to 1 pm on November 9, demanding that the state government cut the fuel prices in the state. The chief minister should fulfil his pre-election promise to make petrol and diesel prices in the state lowest in the country,” TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu told reporters on Friday.At present, the Andhra Pradesh government has been collecting a VAT of 31 per cent and 22.25 per cent on petrol and diesel respectively, besides fixed charges of ₹3.07 on petrol and ₹2.76 on diesel.The TDP chief said the Central government had reduced fuel prices by ₹5 on petrol and ₹10 on diesel. Later, many other states positively responded by cutting rates from their share to offer relief to the people. “But the Jagan government is not at all responding,” he said.Naidu recalled that during the last assembly elections, Jagan had promised to bring down the prices of petrol and diesel and make them the lowest in the country. “He had misled the people during the pre-election meetings saying that the people were crossing the border to buy cheaper petrol in Karnataka. Now, there is clear proof to show that the fuel in AP is costlier by ₹10.42 on petrol and ₹12 on diesel per litre, when compared with Bengaluru,” he pointed out.Comparing the fuel rates in AP with other major cities, he said the price was higher by ₹16.75 per litre on petrol and ₹16.10 in Andhra when compared with Chandigarh, and by ₹15.70 on petrol and ₹10.20 on diesel when compared with Lucknow.“Jagan now owes an explanation to the public why the fuel rates are still the highest in the country,” he said and demanded that the government should now cut the fuel rates by ₹16 to ₹17 per litre on both petrol and diesel to make the prices in the state the lowest in the country.The TDP chief said his party would also highlight the problems faced by the people due to bad roads and lack of road safety. “The road conditions in the state are so bad that it takes five to six hours to cover a certain distance, which could be normally covered in an hour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-plans-protests-over-rising-fuel-prices-across-andhra-on-november-9-101636224389018.html

She alleged that she was supposed to complete her PhD in 2015, but it was prolonged due to the intervention of Nandakumar. She also alleged that he often verbally abused her and behaved rudely, and was singled out because she was the only Dalit among PhD students.The action was taken by university vice-chancellor Sabu Thomas after the intervention of Kerala higher education minister R Bindhu. Earlier, the minister said the government will look into allegations raised by the scholar. Mohanan had joined MG University for a doctorate ten years ago after completing her masters in medical microbiology.“We will help her complete the PhD. She will be given a fee concession, and a lab facility will be available to her. She will also be provided with a new guide. The research centre’s authority will be taken away from Nandakumar, and it will be vested with the VC,” the university said in a statement.The statement also said Dr Nandakumar, who is abroad now, denied all charges and said she was making wild allegations after she failed to meet mandatory provisions of a research scholar. “Her period was extended twice still she failed to finish it on time,” it said. But Mohanan said she was denied access to the lab and other facilities deliberately, which delayed the whole process. Many Dalit bodies have extended support to her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varsity-head-of-dept-removed-amid-casteist-slur-allegations-in-kerala-101636224387767.html
07-11-2021||India||BJP MLA’s proposal to name circle after Savarkar stirs row||A proposal by Karnataka BJP MLA Bharath Shetty to rename a well-known circle in Mangaluru after Savarkar has stirred controversy as the Opposition has strongly opposed the idea. The proposal was made by the MLA from Mangaluru North constituency before the committee on town planning and during a city council meeting. While he has gathered support from his party, the Opposition has been up in arms, with the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) warning the MLA of district-wide protests if the proposal goes through. Talking to the media, Shetty defended his decision claiming that he is unable to understand why naming a circle after a freedom fighter should be a matter of concern. “Savarkar was a freedom fighter who fought for our freedom and dedicated his life for this cause. I don’t understand why he is a controversial figure, even the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had said good things about him,” said the MLA. Adding that Savarkar was an inspiration from many other freedom fighters, Shetty said that Savarkar was the only freedom fighter, who spent time in Kalapani prisons twice. “He lived his entire life for us, not for himself. We cannot forget people who lived their life only for us,” Shetty said. He accused the SDPI and Congress of having a prejudice against the leader. “Their opposition is politically motivated and because of wrong preconceptions. The proposal (to rename the circle) is going as per the legal process, and we will go ahead with it,” he said. The Opposition leaders however claimed that naming the junction after someone who is involved in the conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi will not be tolerated. Congress compotator AC Vinayaraj said that BJP leaders need to refer to the history books. “Savarkar was part of the conspiracy to murder Gandhiji. We will also accept a person who helped Godse kill the father of the nation. He also wrote three letters to the British apologizing for an early release,” said the corporator. SDPI corporator Muneeb Bengre told the media: “We have already discussed the issue in the party meeting. If the Surthkal junction is named after Savarkar, we will take legal action against it. We will also hold district-wide protests. I will also oppose this in the next town planning standing committee meeting.” On September 8, 2020, then Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa inaugurated a flyover in the city named Savarkar, despite opposition from the Congress and JD(S) to name it after him. The 400-meter long flyover, constructed for ₹34 crores by city civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, is on the Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan Road at Yelahanka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpmlas-proposal-to-name-circle-after-savarkar-stirs-row-101636224331254.html
07-11-2021||India||Bitcoin fraud accused detained in Bengaluru||Bengaluru police on Saturday detained Sri Krishna, a hacker and prime accused in the Karnataka Bitcoin scam after he was involved in a brawl inside a five-star hotel in the city, an official said. Sri Krishna was arrested in November 2018 in the cryptocurrency case, and two months ago, was released on bail by the sessions court. The police said that as per the information they got, Sri Krishna was found quarrelling with one Vishnu Bhat and a security guard at the hotel. Police further said that statements from the complainants are being recorded, and further action will be taken based on them. The 26-year-old was caught from Bengaluru on November 18 after the police arrested a couple of drug dealers to whom Sri Krishna had allegedly sold drugs procured from the dark web. A senior police officer said that Sri Krishna graduated in computer science from a college in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in 2017 and would encrypt data and demand payment from owners to unlock the site. “After returning from Amsterdam, he could not find any job in Bengaluru. Then, he started hacking gaming websites and other websites to steal data. He also used to create mirror sites and get information on credit or debit cards used by people who accessed the sites to steal money,” an official said. The police said Sai Krishna used online gaming platforms with chat boxes to communicate with buyers of data, but most times, Sri Krishna allegedly walked up to people on the road and asked them if he could use their phone as he had lost his. “He would tell them he had to get in touch with someone urgently and download the Wickr app on the stranger’s phone.” Wickr is an encrypted messaging app, which also has a ‘burn-on-read’ setting, where the recipient will have access to the message only for a limited time. While it seemed like another cyber-crime case, an Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe into the case 11 months after his arrest snowballed into a political controversy, with the Opposition accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of a cover-up. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah told the media that two influential politicians were involved in the case, and there was an attempt to cover up their role in the case. “There is information about the involvement of influential politicians of Karnataka in Drugs and Bitcoin scam. It is concerning that the investigating officers are trying to close the case to help those politicians,” Siddaramaiah tweeted on October 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bitcoin-fraud-accused-detained-in-bengaluru-101636224327792.html

The Sringeri Math, personally for me, has been a refined symbol of inter-faith harmony,” Gowda noted. The 12 feet tall statue, weighing 28 tons, has been installed on a rebuilt samadhi of Sankaracharya at Kedarnath, an important Hindu pilgrimage centre in the Himalayas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-pm-gowda-lauds-modi-for-new-statue-at-kedarnath-101636224267698.html
07-11-2021||India||Kerala gold smuggling case accused Suresh walks out of jail after 16 months||Main accused of the Kerala gold smuggling case Swapna Suresh on Saturday walked out of the women’s prison here on bail after spending 16 months behind bars. Swapna wasn’t available for an immediate comment as her mother, Prabha S Suresh, told reporters that she wasn’t keeping well. “Swapna is not keeping well. She will meet you all on another day,” said Prabha, after journalists waited outside the jail and then her home expecting Swapna to speak. Earlier, Prabha had said the former United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram was innocent and “influential people made her a pawn in their scheme of things”. The Kerala high court granted bail to Swapna on November 2 after it held that the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) can’t be applied in the smuggling case filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Her release was delayed due to strict bail provisions. Earlier, she was granted bail in cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in December 2020 and Customs in March this year. The high court also quashed Cofeposa (Conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities act 1974) imposed on her on October 10. She is currently facing six charges, including one for allegedly forging her educational qualifications. The gold smuggling case surfaced in July 2020 after the seizure of 30kg gold worth ₹15 crores hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments camouflaged as diplomatic baggage in the UAE consulate here. NIA took over the case a week laterand arrested Suresh along with her accomplice Sandeep Nair from their hideout in Bengaluru. Five central agencies are probing the case now -- NIA, ED, DRI, Customs and Income Tax. When the case surfaced, Swapna was employed at the Space Park of the government-controlled Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited. Before this, she was employed at the consulate as the secretary of the consulate in charge and became close to many political leaders during this tenure. After smuggling cases came up, her B Com degree was also found to be fake, and police registered a separate forgery case against her. The smuggling case invited enough embarrassment to the left front government after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was arrested by the ED due to his alleged closeness to Swapna, and the dollar smuggling case surfaced. Later, he secured bail from the high court. The Union and state governments locked horns on several occasions over the case, and the latter even constituted a judicial commission against the ED in May 2020, a first of its sort, alleging a bid to implicate many, including CM Vijayan. In August this year, the high court stayed the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-accused-suresh-walks-out-of-jail-after-16-months-101636224208069.html

With the inclusion of the districts from erstwhile Nizam’s Hyderabad and Bombay presidency, many had felt the need to change the state’s name since districts from Mysore were just a part of the new state. It was then, in a large ceremony, Urs announced the new name. One of the strongest arguments regarding the name Karnataka is around the Vijayanagara Empire. Even though the Vijayanagara Empire is known as one of the largest empires in the state, historians argue that it was known as the ‘Karnataka Desha’. According to historian Vasundhara Filliozat’s works, several inscriptions show that the Karnataka Empire was founded in 1336. It was part of an attempt to bring all of south India together. The efforts began during the Hoysala ruler, Ballala III era, and by the time of king Harihara I, it started becoming a reality. It was eventually known as the Vijayanagara Empire, according to the colonial historical accounts. “Based on inscriptions and iconography I studied for nearly a decade, the kingdom then was called Karnataka Desha. It is unclear why colonial historians glossed over the fact that the region was known as Karnataka and why post-Independence historians blindly followed these accounts,” Filliozat said. Many historians argue that the empire was never called Vijayanagara. Even though the kingdom was known as Karnataka Desha, historians chose to follow the colonial accounts. They argue that there is a need to start referring to the Vijayanagara empire as Karnataka Desha.Late Jnanpith Awardee and playwright Girish Karnad refers to the Vijayanagara region as “Karnataka Desha” in his play ‘Rakshasa-Tangadi’, which is based on A Social History of the Deccan, 1300-1761 by Richard M Eaton of the University of Arizona. Historians argue that while recognizing the name Karnataka Desha for the Vijayanagara Empire wouldn’t be a hard task for the government, the question is how much of the state’s history, which is based on colonial accounts, needs a relook. “This is not just about recognizing the fact that name Karnataka is an extension of the state’s heritage of having one of the largest and prosperous empires of the state, but there must be a need to have accurate history presented to the people, without the burden of the colonial history. The question is that if the state was not named Karnataka in 1973, would we have forgotten the name Karnataka, which once stood for one of the most prosperous empires in the country?” asked a senior history professor with a major university, who didn’t want to be named. There are several other arguments regarding the derivation of the Karnataka, with one group suggesting the name was derived from words ‘Karu and Nadu’, which mean elevated land. Another group of scholars has argued that the name came from ‘Karu Nadu’, which means the land of black soil. It is even argued that the name came from ‘Kabu Nadu’, which means the land of sugarcanes. While epidemiology remains a contested topic, the name Karnataka existing for centuries is not contested. Late author UR Ananthamurthy, in his writings, said that the word ‘Kannada Desha’ (the land of Kannada) is written in the Kavirajamarga, which is the earliest known literary work in Kannada. According to Ananthamurthy, who studied Kavirajamarga extensively, from Cauvery to the Godavari, where Kannada was spoken extensively, the land was termed as ‘Kannada Desha’. It was probably one of the earliest instances of defining a land by the language spoken by the locals. Kannada Desha eventually became Karnataka Desha, he argues. “If you go beyond historic data, the mythological epics have the name Karnataka mentioned it. The earliest mention of Karnataka can be found in the great Sanskrit work Mahabharata. The name Karnataka could be found in Bhishma Parva and Sabha Parva. Also, ancient Sanskrit plays like Mrcchakatika by Shudraka cite the word Karnataka,” said Pradeep Koppal, a researcher on Karnataka history. He also added that in the 5th century, astrologer Varaha Mihira used the term Karnataka in his work Brihatkath, and the Birur copper plate inscription of Kadamba dynasty king Vishnuvarma called king Shantivarma “the master of the entire Karnataka region”. “In the 7th century, Rashtrakuta inscriptions refer to the armies of Chalukyas of Badami as ‘Karnatakabala’,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-a-name-centuries-in-the-making-stamped-in-73-101636224147642.html
07-11-2021||India||Many parents reluctant to get children vaccinated against Covid: Study||Only 33.5% parents were willing to vaccinate their children for Covid-19, according to a pre-print study based on an online survey by researchers from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER-Chandigarh) and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER-Puducherry) among others. The key reasons for reluctance among parents were concerns about safety and effectiveness (86.4%) and side effects (78.2%), and the fact children tend to have a milder disease (52.8%), according to the responses of 770 parents from across the country. The findingers were uploaded on the pre-print medical research server medRxiv. The researchers also found that the parents’ willingness to get their child vaccinated was linked to their own willingness to get it and their level of education, according to the study. “Factors such as newness of vaccine, their rapid development and unknown long-term side effects influence parent’s perception of vaccine safety and their intention to get themselves and their children vaccinated. Health care providers play a key role in influencing decision of parents towards vaccine acceptance and uptake,” the study said. India has so far approved the a DNA vaccine ZyCoV-D -- which is the first coronavirus vaccine using this vector -- for children between the ages of 12 to 18 years. An expert committee has also cleared the indigenously developed Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for use in children between the ages of 2 to 18 years. But ZyCoV-D is yet to be rolled out, and Covaxin’s use in children us yet to be cleared by the apex drug controller. “It is an online survey-based study and it shows that parents are apprehensive about vaccination. Besides, children have mild symptoms and the mortality is low. The vaccines are to prevent even the one death that might happen,” said Dr Ritesh Singh from the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Kalyani. Experts, however, say that it is not essential to vaccinate the very young children against the infection. Dr Suneela Garg, professor in the department of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and a member of the Lancet Commission on Covid-19 in India, said: “This is probably a reflection of what experts have always been saying – It is not necessary to vaccinate the very young children. It should be given only to those between the ages of 12 to 18 years, especially those with co-morbidities. The young children have less ACEII receptors (which is used by the Sars-CoV-2 virus to enter human cells) and hence have only mild disease when infected.” She said, “Now, through sero-surveys we know that children are infected at the same rate as adults. And, the natural infection provides much better immunity than vaccines. What is worth noting is that parents have already started sending their children to schools, which means they have accepted the risk of a mild infection. The fear has gone down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-parents-reluctant-to-get-children-vaccinated-against-covid-study-101636223908079.html
07-11-2021||India||‘Will chop off hands’: BJP MP to Congress after Haryana protesters hold ex-minister hostage||Attacking the Congress over some of his party leaders being held hostage in Rohtak district, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Arvind Sharma on Saturday threatened to “gouge out the eyes and chop off the hands” of anyone who opposed party colleague and former Haryana minister Manish Grover. The Rohtak MP’s remarks came a day after Grover, who is also the vice-president of the state BJP, and 42 others were confined for at least five hours to a temple as farmers staged a protest outside. The BJP on Saturday held a protest in the district against the Congress, blaming it for the Friday incident. Addressing the gathering, Sharma attacked Congress leaders Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son, Deepender Hooda, alleging that Grover was being targeted as Deepender lost the Lok Sabha elections because of him.“Congress workers held our leaders hostage yesterday. This is a frustration of Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son, Deepender, for losing the Lok Sabha polls. I can say that we won the Rohtak Lok Sabha seat due to Manish Grover,” he said. “The Congress and Deepender Hooda should listen that if anyone dares to look towards Manish Grover, then we will take their eyes out. If they try to put their hands on him, their hands will be chopped off,” he added. Continuing his attack on the Hooda family, Sharma said: “The days of the Hooda family are gone and they are confined in some areas of Rohtak and Jhajjar. Some people of these areas are backing them with a hope that he will become the chief minister again but this is not going to happen because the BJP will rule in Haryana for the next 25 years.” Recalling Friday’s incident, Grover alleged that he was sitting in the temple complex to watch the live telecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech at Kedarnath temple around 11 am when he was approached by three youths. “The youths said this is Manish Grover, who is responsible for Deepender Hooda’s defeat in the Lok Sabha polls and this is a right time to teach him a lesson. My colleagues and party workers asked me to leave the temple as the situation got tense but I refused. With the support of my party workers and Khap representatives, we returned home safely,” he alleged.Criticising the BJP MP’s remarks, Congress’ chief whip in Haryana assembly and Rohtak MLA BB Batra said: “How can an elected MP threaten people to chop-off their hands? This is clearly a violation of law and order and the police should take cognisance of the matter. The BJP leaders’ low-level statement shows that they have no faith in democracy and if anyone tried to take them hostage, they should file a complaint before the police. The BJP leaders want to rule with sticks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-chop-off-hands-bjp-mp-to-congress-after-haryana-protesters-hold-ex-minister-hostage-101636223736520.html

07-11-2021||India||Anil Deshmukh sent to 14-day judicial custody in money laundering case||A special holiday court on Saturday remanded former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in 14-day judicial custody in connection with an alleged money laundering case. The move came after the court rejected a plea of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to extend the custody of the 72-year-old National Congress Party (NCP) leader with them by nine more days. Deshmukh was arrested by the central agency, under provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on November 2, after 12 hours of questioning. A court had remanded him in ED custody till November 6, following which he was sent to Arthur Road jail in south central Mumbai. Shortly after his medical check-up, the former minister was produced before the court on Saturday -- the last day of his ED custody.Appearing for the agency, additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted that a probe into the matter so far revealed that Deshmukh and his family had direct or indirect control over 27 companies, and used them to launder money by creating a complex web of transactions. The ED’s court application, seeking further custody of the former minister, alleged that money was transferred from bank accounts of Deshmukh’s family to accounts belonging to these companies, and that an amount of ₹9.8 crore was laundered to one these entities – M/s Zodiac Dealcom – through 18 Kolkata-based shell companies.Singh also pointed out that Deshmukh, who they believed was involved in the money laundering, was not cooperating in the probe and was “evasive during questioning”. Opposing the probe agency’s plea, defence counsels Vikram Chaudhri and Aniket Nikam said: “The present remand application is a photocopy of the first remand application. The investigation by the agency seems to not have progressed at all... the same grounds are shown to seek further custody of Deshmukh. Besides, the grounds are vague.” The two lawyers also pointed out that Deshmukh had appeared before the agency to prove his bona fide. The agency has attached some of his assets purchased in 2005 and 2006, alleging that they were purchased while Deshmukh was the home minister, they said. The ED was stretching its probe “way beyond the scope of the allegations against him”, they added. The central agency had registered the money-laundering case against Deshmukh on May 11 on the basis of an First Information Report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 21 following allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.In a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh alleged that Deshmukh had instructed certain Mumbai Police officers to collect an amount of ₹100 crore every month from restaurants and bars in the state capital. The probe agency claimed that the money was sent to Delhi-based Jain brothers who reportedly operated bogus companies using hawala channels. The Jain brothers reportedly diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the Deshmukh family. The ED suspects that the Jain brothers were acting on the instructions of Deshmukh’s son, Hrishikesh, who has also been summoned for questioning in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-maharashtra-minister-anil-deshmukh-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-in-money-laundering-case-101636223427749.html

The move came after four Delhi-based advocates were booked under UAPA and some other charges of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly sharing fake information on social media. In a letter written to Twitter recently, the state police requested to block at least 68 accounts for posting allegedly distorted and objectionable news on the platform regarding communal violence in the state. The police claimed in the letter that some of the published news items or posts on these social media handles had some photographs or videos of some other incidents or fabricated statements to promote enmity between religious communities through a criminal conspiracy. A case was lodged in this regard at West Agartala Police Station under Section 153A, 153B, 469,471,503,504,120B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. “ ...some persons/ organization are publishing/ posting distorted and objectionable news items / statements in Twitter regarding the recent clash and alleged attack upon mosques of Muslim communities in the state. In publishing these news items/ posts, the persons / organizations have been found using photographs / videos of some other incidents, fabricated statements / commentary for promoting enmity between religious groups / communities in presence of criminal conspiracy, “ the letter said. On the issue, a senior police official on the condition of anonymity said that the letter was written following registration of a case against these posts. These cases have been forwarded to the Crime Branch for investigation. “ 102 social media account holders were booked and we sent letters to these platforms to block after some distorted news items on Tripura incidents were posted on these platforms. There might be 68 profiles on Twitter but there are accounts on other platforms where such distorted posts were shared, “ said the official. Police earlier booked 71 persons for allegedly spreading rumours on social media on communal violence incidents in the state days after a mosque and a few houses and shops were vandalised and two shops were burnt at two separate places in Panisagar of North district. Police arrested at least four persons involved in the incident and said that no mosque was burnt and pictures of a burning mosque uploaded on social media were not from Tripura. The police appealed to people to refrain from retweeting or liking any provocative posts as it amounts to rumour mongering. Some allegedly fake news were circulated on social media regarding vandalism of a mosque at Kakraban area in Gomati district. On the issue, the police tweeted, “This is a complete misrepresentation of facts. The mosque in Dargabazar area of Kakraban is completely fine & Gomati police is working to maintain peace and tranquillity.” The National Human Rights Commission sought an action taken report from the state government regarding the violence in Panisagar following a complaint filed by All India Trinamool Congress national spokesperson Saket Gokhale. The Tripura high court has also taken suo motu cognisance and sought a detailed report from the state by November 10.CPM veteran leader Pabitra Kar said, “One should not share any controversial posts on social media that can flare up communal tension. But the government cannot ask to block someone’s social media handles.”BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said, “ If they are guilty, police will take action against them. Freedom of speech and expression is a must in the country but the freedom has some restrictions or else, it will be misused.”The Chief Minister’s Office declined to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-police-book-102-social-media-accounts-under-uapa-after-violence-101636223313873.html

07-11-2021||India||During Covid, urban poor hit most by inflation, show studies||Inflation, often described as the cruellest tax because it erodes income, has been falling in recent months, but average price rise during and following the peak of the pandemic has been higher and more broad-based than in previous years, hitting the urban poor harder, two recent studies have shown.Three components of inflation — food, fuel and core inflation i.e. price in all items minus food and fuel — have moved divergently. Food inflation fell significantly from above 5% at the start of the current financial year to 0.7% in September. During the same period, fuel inflation rose from 8% to 13.6%. Core inflation, which leaves out volatile items such as food and fuel, remained sticky near 6%.“Not only did they (inflation in various components) diverge, but their burden also varied by income group, primarily because the share of spending on each of these commodity groups differs across income classes,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.The bottom line of this is that although broadly everyone experienced the same inflation numbers, some groups – especially the urban poor – felt inflation’s heat more because they spend a larger share of their budgets on items that got costlier, such as fuel.According to the Reserve Bank’s bi-annual Monetary Policy Report for October, mean or average inflation this year has been higher and more broad-based. It has also been very volatile.“These indicate high dispersion of inflation rates in the consumer price index basket, along with a larger number of items experiencing higher inflation rates than in the pre-pandemic period,” the RBI report said.Crisil’s researchers engaged in an interesting study to disaggregate the impact of inflation on different income groups.They segregated the population into three broad groups by expenditure — the bottom 20%, the middle 60% and the top 20% for urban and rural — using data from the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).Then, the expenditure share of each commodity group was mapped with the relevant inflation during the last and this fiscal up to September 2021. They then used these weights to calculate the overall inflation for each class.“We find that the urban poor felt the heat of inflation the most,” Joshi said.While overall inflation declined for all income classes in FY2021-22 compared with the last fiscal year, urban poor (bottom 20%) bore the heaviest brunt in both time periods.The key culprits were fuel and food costs, which have the highest weights for the bottom 20% of the urban poor. Urban inflation in these two commodity components was higher than that in rural areas.The researchers used the NSSO’s Consumer Expenditure Survey of 2011-12, which offers the latest available data on monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) across income classes. This data have also been used to calculate weights for the latest consumer price index 2011-12 series.“The relatively higher food and fuel inflation in urban areas have meant the poor in that geography are facing more heat than their rural counterparts,” according to the Crisil Ltd’s study.The rural poor did face considerable inflationary pressures too, the study shows. Cereals, fuel and vegetables are the top three spending categories within food for both rural and urban dwellers. The pressure from high fuel inflation may have been offset by lower price rise in food.However, six out of the 10 commodities have seen inflation above 6% in rural areas this fiscal, Crisil observed. In urban areas, there are five such commodities. “This implies inflationary pressures are still significant for the poor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/during-covid-urban-poor-hit-most-by-inflation-show-studies-101636222647378.html
07-11-2021||India||At Dubai Expo, SBI chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara hails India’s vaccination drive||India is ready to move into the next orbit of growth with the hugely successful implementation of the Covid-19 vaccination programme, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said on Saturday.“Actually, it [the vaccination drive] has enhanced the confidence level of the common man as well as the economy,” he said at the India Pavilion of EXPO2020 Dubai. In a historic achievement on October 21, India achieved administering over one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses. On November 6, the cumulative number of vaccinations jumped to 1,079,219,546.Khara said the kind of vaccine drive India has seen makes all Indians proud, especially because the country is using the domestically produced vaccine in a big way, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said, quoting him. Ficci is one of the partners in the India Pavilion.The chairman of India’s largest bank said the country has lived through one of the most challenging times and has come out of it in a very successful manner that gives the confidence that going forward, the journey should be rather easy and there will be huge opportunity for growth in the country.In its latest edition of Economy Watch, EY India chief policy adviser DK Srivastava said: “As per the October 2021 issue of IMF’s World Economic Outlook, the Indian economy is poised to become the global growth leader FY22 onwards. Not only does it overtake China among major economies in FY22 but it is projected to retain this position for the next five years.”High-frequency indicators confirm that economic recovery is gathering momentum, he said. India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections, a weathervane of business activities, soared to ₹1.3 lakh crore in the month of October, the second highest ever. Latest data also shows the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in the month of October at 55.9, the highest since February.Speaking about the growth prospects, Khara said he is sure that the confidence in the Indian economy would go a long way in terms of meeting the common man’s aspirations.While visiting the India Pavilion at EXPO2020 Dubai, the SBI chairman said the pavilion is presenting the real India, which is full of opportunities, to the whole world in an impressive manner.He said that the pandemic had a devastating impact on businesses, but the Indian economy is witnessing rapid recovery. “The credit growth in the economy was quite muted for almost two years. I am sure now with this confidence, the capacity utilisation will improve, and with the capacity utilisation improving, there will be a revival of investment demand for the corporate sector,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-vaccination-drive-makes-all-citizens-proud-sbi-chairman-dinesh-kumar-khara-at-dubai-expo-101636221216045.html
