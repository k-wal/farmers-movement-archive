29-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: DMRC refurbishing old Metro trains with modern facilities||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has started refurbishing 70 old trains, which were procured before 2007, with modern amenities such as LCD route maps, charging points and CCTV cameras midway through their life cycle. Officials said 10 trains, each of which is around two decades old, will be completely refurbished by September 2022.DMRC managing director Mangu Singh on Monday unveiled the first train refurbished as part of this project. The train, officials said, was procured in 2002 as part of the first Metro network phase. The Delhi Metro currently has around 350 trains, including the 70 which are over 14-years-old.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said the trains have a lifespan of 30 years, and that refurbishments are necessary midway through this period.A bulk of the overhaul will involve retrofit the floors, which have developed cracks, bulges and uneven surfaces.Dayal said, “Passengers often complain about uneven surfaces as well as poor aesthetics inside the coaches. The floors have now been replaced by modern fibre composite boards in order to enhance passenger safety, comfort and improve the aesthetics of the interiors coaches,” said Dayal.Each coach will now have charging points, LCD maps with real-time information, CCTV cameras, among the new features. New fire detection systems have been installed, along with provisions for the air-conditioning and ventilation system to operate on an emergency basis.Officials said each train will cost roughly ₹4 crore to refurbish, and the entire project will cost ₹280 crore. DMRC officials said that it takes around a month to complete the upgrade for each train.While the retrofitting and refurbishing work on nine other trains is on and will be completed by September 2022, DMRC officials said work on the remaining 60 will begin soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhidmrc-refurbishing-old-metro-trains-with-modern-facilities-101638210568540.html
29-11-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh privately meets Sachin Vaze for about an hour||MUMBAI Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Monday met dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and privately spoke to him for about an hour at Old Secretariat Building in Fort, south Mumbai, from where the Justice K U Chandiwal commission is conducting its enquiry proceedings. The Chandiwal commission was set up on March 30 this year by the Maharashtra government to inquire into the allegations by Singh against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh accusing him of running an extortion racket using Mumbai Police. At around 10.30am on Monday, Singh, who is named as an accused in five FIRs, including cases of four extortion and one case under the Atrocities Act, attended his office – located on the first floor of the same building – in his capacity as commandant general of Maharashtra Home Guards. Around 11 am, he appeared before the Chandiwal Commission on an upper floor of the same building, and got a bailable warrant against him cancelled. Singh simultaneously filed an affidavit explaining that he could not appear before the commission earlier on account of health issues. He also sought exemption from physical appearance before the Chandiwal commission. Close to 10 minutes later, Singh went to the adjoining room, according to those familiar with the matter. As the commission completed formalities of cancelling the bailable warrant against Singh, the 56-year-old IPS officer met Vaze in an adjoining room. Vaze, arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and lodged in Taloja jail in connection with the Antilia explosives scare and the connected murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, was brought to the commission’s office for cross examination. A lawyer familiar with the matter said the meeting between Singh and Vaze occurred with prior permission of the commission. However, the commission’s lawyer, Advocate Shishir Hiray, rubbished the claim. “As per my knowledge, no permission was taken from the special NIA court for any such meeting,” Hiray said, adding that Vaze is currently in judicial custody of the NIA court. Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s lawyers, however, took strong objection to the meeting and informed Justice (retired) KU Chandiwal about this. They pointed out that both of them face serious criminal charges, and should not be allowed to meet privately. A money-laundering case against Deshmukh was registered on May 11 this year on the basis of the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI’s) FIR of April 21. The CBI FIR was, in turn, based on allegations of corruption levelled by Singh. Justice Chandiwal, a former Bombay high court judge, said, “How can I keep watch on everything and stop them from meeting. But, to avoid such situation in the future, it is better that he (Vaze) sits in this room (where the commission is functioning from).” Taking note of the meeting between the two accused, Mumbai police on Monday conducted a quick enquiry. “An assistant commissioner of police (ACP) conducted a preliminary inquiry into the apparent lapse,” said Dr Hari Balaji N, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1. “After recording statements of the police escort party – a sub-inspector and three constables – the inquiry report was handed over to Navi Mumbai police for further action, as the escort party personnel are attached to Navi Mumbai police.” After being incommunicado for several months, Singh – a 1988-batch IPS officer – had resurfaced in his hometown Chandigarh on November 24, two days after the Supreme Court gave him protection from arrest by Maharashtra police and directed him to join investigations in the pending cases against him. He came to Mumbai last week and joined the investigations conducted by the Mumbai Police crime branch and Thane police, and is expected to appear before the state CID in three cases this week. The 56-year-old IPS officer was shunted out from the post of Mumbai police commissioner this year on March 17 and was transferred to the Home Guards after Vaze was arrested in Antilia security scare and Hiran murder case. Three days later, on March 20, Singh wrote a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, claiming that Deshmukh had been running an extortion racket using some Mumbai police officials, including Vaze, amounting to ₹100 crore a month. This accusation eventually resulted in an FIR by the CBI against Deshmukh and the initiation of money-laundering proceedings by the Enforcement Directorate. Noted criminal lawyer and former Rajya Sabha MP Majeed Memon said this meeting will be considered illegal. “If such an event (meeting) has occurred, it’s absolutely illegal as no one can meet an accused who is in judicial custody and that too when someone facing charges of heinous crimes without the permission of the concerned court,” he said. “Moreover, in this case, the person (Singh) who met the accused is himself an accused in several cases.” He added, “There are certain rules and procedures that need to be followed in such cases, and if it is not followed then the concerned court can take appropriate action, if a complaint is made.” Former IPS officer turned lawyer YP Singh said, “In such cases, the concerned court can take initiate contempt of court proceedings against the person involved in violation of legal procedures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-privately-meets-sachin-vaze-for-about-an-hour-101638210090046.html

The plaza was developed as an interactive space to showcase and encourage local art and craft, for exhibitions and displays of art, photography, landscaping, demonstrations and awareness programmes. Now, overgrown weeds and dust beyond the gates mark this space. Civic activist Qaneez Sukhrani has appealed twice under Right to Information (RTI) Act to know why this place is still under lock and key. “Under RTI I found that ₹1.32 crore was spent at the behest of political party Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The project started in December 2014 and was completed in February 2017. Before spending the amount, no survey was done if an open-air bridge in the middle of heavy traffic is the correct place to hold exhibitions.” The art plaza was built to preserve the 100-year-old heritage bridge, built by the British in 1867, under the heritage sites mission of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Sukhrani found out that after being completed by PMC heritage cell, there was no formal handover to any PMC department. “It has never been cleaned, maintained, secured. Overgrown grass and shrubs give ideal location for illegal incidents to take place. No audit has been done by any department of PMC to see the deteriorating state of the place after ₹1.32 crores of public funds were spent.” The heritage department, Pune Municipal Corporation, confirmed of receiving two RTI complaints and clarified that the plaza was kept closed due to Covid and lack of funds. “The RTI activist has been writing to us, but we faced fund shortage. Work to clear the overgrown weeds and restore the place has started. We request art lovers to come forward and hold events at this place on weekends,” said Harshada Shinde, heritage department, PMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-spends-rs-1-32-crore-public-fund-on-art-plaza-still-remains-unused-101638210088626.html
29-11-2021||Lucknow||Question paper leaks: Specific law proposed in UP in 2005, no action yet||Despite frequent instances of leakage of question papers or attempts in that direction, successive state governments have not implemented the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission’s recommendation to enact a law specifically to check the menace and provide for stringent punishment as a deterrent in such cases. The commission had made the recommendation in 2005.The commission had proposed imprisonment for not less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life for those guilty of question paper leaks. It had also proposed imprisonment of three years to 10 years for those attempting to leak the question papers.In its third report to the state government on September 10, 2005, the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission had submitted the draft of the proposed law “The Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Leakage in Examination Papers Act, 2005.”The state government had cancelled the Uttar Pradesh Teachers’ Eligibility Test (UP TET) on Sunday after authorities recovered question papers from at least 28 people who were subsequently arrested. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath warned of invoking provisions of the National Security Act (NSA) and using bulldozer against those accused of leaking the question paper.Apart from the current government, the regimes of Samajwadi Party (SP) patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, SP president Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati have been in office in Uttar Pradesh since 2005.“Yes, there is a need for a specific law to check leakage of question papers and punish those responsible for the same. The candidates prepare and travel long distances to appear for the competitive examinations. They are left in agony, suffering a lot physically and mentally. There are provisions in existing laws to deal with the menace. A separate law will, however, be better,” said Justice (retired) AN Mittal, chairman of the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission.“The candidates come well prepared for the examination. But for the second attempt, they are not left with the same zeal,” said Justice Mittal.“Leakage of question papers in examination is becoming rampant. It badly affects the examinees and leads to additional expenditure on the state government. This can be averted with the implementation of the report of the commission that dealt into various aspects of the issue,” said Justice (retired) Vishnu Sahai, who headed the commission in 2005 with Justice (retired) IS Mathur, the then director Allah Rahman (who also became HC judge later) and Balraj Chauhan as its members.“Of late, leakage in examination papers is becoming increasingly rampant in our state, resulting not only in a big dent in the credibility of examination system, but also lot of valuable time of students (sometimes denying them chances of appearing in competition) as papers in respect of which there has been a leakage have to be reset. On account of leakage of examination papers, enormous hardship is caused to the students and image of our state smeared,” the commission had observed in 2005.“…. The Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Leakage in Examination Papers Act, 2005 be enacted by the state of UP, wherein deterrent punishment be provided for those who either themselves commit the offence of leakage in Examination Papers or abet the commission of such an offence or are a part of criminal conspiracy to commit such an offence,” it had said.It had also recommended, “Imprisonment which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall be liable to pay a fine which shall not be less than rupees ten thousand but which may extend to rupees one lakh.”The commission had said the state government, with concurrence of the chief justice of the Allahabad High Court, should constitute special courts to be presided over by a judge/additional judge who has the experience of working as sessions judge/ additional sessions judge.“The Commission is of considered view that if this is done (recommendations are implemented) there is every likelihood of decrease in leakage of examination papers,” the commission had observed in its report in 2005.Uttar Pradesh minister for law and justice Brajesh Pathak was not available for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/question-paper-leaks-specific-law-proposed-in-up-in-2005-no-action-yet-101638210028541.html

29-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt accepts Chakraborty report against Param Bir Singh, suspension likely this week||Maharashtra government has accepted Debashish Chakraborty committee report on departmental inquiry against former Mumbai police commissioner and senior IPS officer Param Bir Singh. The committee held him responsible for dereliction of duty in the Antilia explosive scare case. The suspension of the IPS officer is now expected to be done by the state government in the next few days.Senior IAS officer Chakraborty, in October, submitted the report holding Singh responsible for the violation of the All India Civil Services Rules. The committee has pointed at serious lapses in the handling of the Antilia case and has said that the officer, who was serving as Mumbai police chief, kept the government in the dark in the case. The committee also held him responsible for shielding officers like Sachin Waze. The report also had suggested appropriate action against Singh for violation of the services rules.According to the Mantralaya officials, Singh is expected to be suspended in the next couple of days. “His suspension has been recommended by the director-general of police for various reasons including the criminal cases registered against him. He had also remained untraceable and did not report to the duty for more than six months without informing the state government. The process of his suspension is almost complete. After acceptance of the report, the case of his suspension became stronger,” said an official.Chakraborty was asked to conduct a departmental inquiry in June on the basis of the preliminary report submitted by Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale. After the suspension, there could be a further probe. The state government cannot dismiss IAS/IPS officers since it comes under the purview of the central government. However, it can suspend the officers for a specific period. Response from Singh is awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-accepts-chakraborty-report-against-param-bir-singh-suspension-likely-this-week-101638209733059.html

29-11-2021||Mumbai||Shopkeepers express shock over state’s new penalty order||Mumbai The Maharashtra government’s guidelines of imposing a fine of ₹10,000 on shopkeepers whose customers don’t wear masks or violate Covid rules have not gone down well with them. They said that this rule will lead to unnecessary fights and harassment. However, authorities point out that this is necessary as shopkeepers need to ensure that people they cater to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. They also said that they have also noticed that shopkeepers also hardly wear masks.The order issued on Saturday states that any shop, establishment, mall, event or gathering ‘where a member of public has a right to come and get services’ must be manned by fully vaccinated persons. All visitors and customers to such places should also be fully vaccinated.With regards to the violations, it imposes a fine of ₹500 for the erring individual while the establishments where the violations occur will be fined ₹10,000. It also warns that frequent violations will lead to the closure of the establishment till notification of Covid-19 as a disaster remains in force.Mohan Gurnani, chairman, Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT) which represents traders, said it is an absurd order. “The shopkeepers cannot force anyone to wear a mask. At the most, he can request the consumer. We don’t have statutory authority to enforce the rule. This will only lead to fights and harassment of the shopkeepers,” said Gurnani. Sachin Shah, who owns a garment shop in Hindmata cloth market, which is a famous wholesale market in Central Mumbai, said that it was meant to harass the traders. “How can a person violating the law be charged ₹500 and the premises owner who is fully masked and adhering to all regulations be fined ₹10,000 for the violation done by someone who he barely knows?” questioned Shah. Defending the order, state government officials said that the shopkeepers should cooperate with the government to tackle this Covid-19 virus. “The shopkeepers need to refuse to entertain those customers who violate the Covid-19 norms. This will send a strong message to such erring people,” said the official who refused to come on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shopkeepers-express-shock-over-state-s-new-penalty-order-101638208648642.html

The CM unveiled the ‘Shatabdi Stambh’ (centenary pillar) on the Lucknow zoo campus and released a postal stamp and a centenary souvenir to mark the occasion. A centenary year book of the zoo and another book titled ‘Chitron Mein Chidiyaghar’ (the zoo in pictures) were also released by him. Yogi Adityanath honoured those who made significant contributions to wildlife conservation, adopted animals on the zoo campus and distributed prizes to students who won in various competitions such as ‘mobiliography’, still photography, street plays, slogan writing, face painting, recitation, quiz, drawing and painting. Aishna Singh was felicitated by the CM for adopting Himalayan Bear and Saras. A Class 10 student at the Millennium school, she paid the adoption amount from her last three years’ savings. Emphasising on the need to protect wildlife for maintaining ecological balance, the CM said, “It is essential for human beings and animals to co-exist harmoniously in order to preserve nature. Just as the life of a human being is important, so is the life of an animal.” “I would like to extend my best wishes to the forest department for successfully planting over 100 crore saplings, which is a record in itself,” he added. “During the pandemic period, not only did we save lives of people, but also worked to save wild animals who got infected at the Lion Safari, Etawah,” said Yogi. The CM termed the plantation of 100 crore saplings in 5 years as a major achievement. “No wild animal wants to hurt human beings unless it feels threatened. When we interfere in animals’ life for our own interest, they react and cross boundaries in a natural manner,” he added. “Our state has immense potential for eco-tourism and we are working towards promotion of such areas,” he said mentioning that the department of forest and tourism can come together for the purpose. NAMING OF NEW MEMBERS During the function, four lion cubs and two leopard cubs were given names. Three male lion cubs were named Tiger Sherkhan, Abhi and Simba and one female cub was named Sakshi.

When district health officials traced the donor, it confirmed that the donor and his wife - she was also pregnant and was to be given blood - were people living with HIV but had concealed this information when he donated blood.Santosh Kumar, the technician who processed the donor’s blood at the district hospital in Biharsharif, said he followed the procedure and tested the sample for the five mandatory screening tests for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis and malaria.“The authorities should conduct a re-test of the blood sample of the donor on the rapid screening kit and see the result for themselves,” said Kumar, insisting that the rapid screening test was to be blamed, not him.Kumar, who has been with the blood bank since 2013, said he was sacked without an inquiry because he was on a one-year contract that was due to be renewed in March 2022.The woman who was administered the infected blood and her child born on 5 November haven’t tested positive yet. Officials said they will conduct weekly tests on her and her newborn for HIV.Nalanda district civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar said he has ordered an inquiry headed by a panel of three doctors led by Nalanda Sadar hospital deputy superintendent.Dr Kumar said he has reason to believe that Santosh Kumar possibly skipped the HIV test and went by the donor’s self-declaration who claimed he was in good health.Health department officials said some staffers at the district’s anti-retroviral therapy centre possibly figured that the man has donated blood when he turned up at their centre for his dose of medicines soon after the blood donation. They did not, however, inform their supervisors.A Bihar State AIDS Control Society official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a confirmatory ELISA test should have been conducted as well. “We have an ELISA reader machine for the confirmatory test of blood samples,” the official said.Rajesh Kumar, treasurer of the Indian Red Cross Society-managed government blood bank at Biharsharif, confirmed that there was an ELISA machine but asserted that it wasn’t working in absence of testing kits. “I have written on two-three occasions to the civil surgeon for procurement and making the machine functional,” Kumar said.“It is only in advance case of HIV/AIDS that the viral load is not detected in screening, but normally such patients are so weak and thin that one can easily make out by their appearance that they are HIV/AIDS infected,” said Dr Upendra Kumar Sinha, retired chief medical officer of the blood bank at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), now the chief medical officer of the blood bank at the Mahavir Vatsalya Aspataal.On the time taken to confirm the status of the woman who was given the infected blood, Dr Sinha, blamed the government for purchasing outdated rapid screening kits.“At PMCH, we used to test blood samples on fourth-generation P24 antigen testing kits, which has a 14-day window period. However, the government has provided third-generation testing kits at Biharsharif. Such testing kits have a window period of 30-45 days from the date of being infected. These days we have modern Chemiluminescent Assay kits, with a window period of less than 5-6 days. The government should invest in them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pregnant-woman-in-bihar-given-hiv-ve-blood-sacked-technician-blames-test-kit-101638206428535.html
29-11-2021||Lucknow||Prayagraj murder case: Kin of deceased raise doubts over police claims||A day after the Prayagraj police arrested a 23-year-old man in connection with the brutal murder of four members of a Dalit family in the district, the kin of the victims on Monday said they doubted that the arrested man was the real culprit. The police also said that one of the deceased, who was raped, was not a minor, according to the official documents accessed by them.The kin say that the motive given by the police behind committing the rape and murder by the alleged accused Pawan Saroj, a labourer, is not strong enough to prove his involvement in the crime. A 50-year-old man, his 47-year-old wife, daughter, who police said was 25, and 10-year-old son were found dead on their beds inside their home in Prayagraj district on Thursday morning (November 25) by relatives. An autopsy report suggested that they were strangled and assaulted with an axe.Claiming that there were loopholes in the work out theory of police, a brother of the man who along with his family was murdered said cops should carry out a fair investigation and no innocent should be framed or harassed in the case. Police must ensure strict punishment to the culprits who committed the crime, he said. He, who is an SSB personnel posted in Jharkhand but is in Prayagraj these days, also said it did not sound logical that the arrested suspect killed four members of his family only because his niece rejected his advances. Moreover, the accused never even met her for making any proposal, he claimed.The accused could have targeted his niece only outside instead of barging into the house and killing all members of the family, he said. He further said police claimed that the accused was illiterate, then how he was chatting on Whatsapp.“Moreover, instead of receiving messages, my niece could have blocked the number of the accused. It is not possible for the 23-year-old lean framed youth to murder four people alone. Police should have revealed the names of his accomplices as well,” he said.The kin of the deceased, howver, did not comment on the written complaint given to the police by one of his relatives mentioning a land dispute and alleged that members of an upper-caste family had issued physical and verbal threats to the Dalit family in the past. He said while his family had full faith in police, they will demand a CBI probe if they were denied justice.Addressing a press conference on Sunday, ADG zone Prem Prakash had said: “A scanning of the murdered 25-year-old woman’s WhatsApp messages revealed that she was constantly receiving messages from a number that was traced to the accused Pawan Kumar Saroj.” However, the police said they were yet to establish how he carried out the murders and who his accomplices were. Officials added that they will now take the accused’s DNA samples to gather evidence.The ADG said the education certificates accessed by them showed that woman was born in 1996 and the charges filed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act will no longer be applicable.Prayagarj SSP Sarvshrestha Tripathi said further investigations were under way. “Police will take remand of the accused to question him in connection with the case. Police investigation is based on circumstantial and scientific evidence and justice will be ensured for the victims,” he said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagraj-murder-case-kin-of-deceased-raise-doubts-over-police-claims-101638206128339.html
29-11-2021||Lucknow||We brought light to people’s houses: UP energy minister||Launching an attack on the Opposition, state energy minister Shrikant Sharma on Monday said people used to face blackouts because of rampant corruption, commission and bad governance during previous governments and BJP government, he added, brought the state out of darkness after it came to power in 2017.Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters as a part of party’s ‘fark saf hai’ (difference is clear) campaign, he said only four VIP districts used to get adequate power during the previous regime. “Today, every district is VIP so far as power supply is concerned as all districts got uninterrupted electricity after 2017,” he said. Sharma further said now districts headquarters got round the clock power, tehsil headquarters got supply for 20 hours and villages got supply for 18 hours unlike in the past when power was supplied in shifts. “The difference is clear. The previous governments kept the state in the dark and we electrified 1.40 crore households in less than five years,” he said.The minister alleged that the Samajwadi Party government signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) because of which state got power as costly as ₹5.14- ₹11-09 per unit and raised power tariff every year burdening retail consumers. “On the contrary, our government signed PPAs under which power was available for ₹2.9- ₹4.19 per unit and we did not let the tariff increase for three years,” Sharma said.Taking about the achievement on the power generation front, Sharma said today the state’s total power production capacity was 26,937 MW which is 4000 MW more than what it was before 2017. “Despite the fact that the power demand increased from 16000 MW in 2017 to 25000 MW in 2021, we were able to meet the demand as per the roster,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/we-brought-light-to-people-s-houses-up-energy-minister-101638205468071.html

29-11-2021||Bangalore||No proposal to impose lockdown, clarifies Karnataka CM amid omicron variant||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday dismissed fears in some quarters over any possible lockdown amid Covid-19 cases in some educational institutions and the detection of the omicron, a variant of Covid-19 virus in some parts of the world. Allaying the apprehensions, he made it clear that there was no proposal to impose lockdown in the State. "We have instructed adherence to strict precautions at schools and colleges, but not to close them. There is no proposal to impose the lockdown," he said. Speaking to reporters here, the chief minister urged the people not to panic about omicron, and asked them to strictly follow Covid-19 guidelines. He said those arriving from the countries where omicron variant was found are being screened at the airports and that they would be allowed into the cities only if they test negative. Bommai said a negative report has been made mandatory for students from Kerala who are studying in Karnataka and a second test is being done on them on the seventh day of the first negative report. The State government is in constant consultation with experts and the Union government, and precautions are being taken according to their guidelines, he said. Replying to a question about a person who arrived from South Africa found to be having different symptoms of the pandemic, Bommai said, "The test report of the person has been sent for genome sequencing. Exact variant of the virus would be known from the genome sequencing report." Regarding the booster dose for health workers, Bommai said his government is awaiting the instructions from the Centre in that regard. "Our concern is that it is already over six months since the health workers received two doses of the vaccine. We will act according to directions from the Centre," Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/no-proposal-to-impose-lockdown-clarifies-karnataka-cm-amid-omicron-variant-101638202884649.html

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Paddy procurement: RBI hikes Punjab’s cash credit limit by 3%||The Reserve Bank of India on Monday allowed an enhanced cash credit limit of ₹43,297.88 crore to Punjab for purchase of paddy. Earlier, the state was allowed a cash credit limit (CCL) of ₹35,000 crore, which was later enhanced to ₹42,000 crore. In the current season, 188.26 lakh tonne paddy has arrived in the mandis for procurement so far, out of which 187.21 lakh tonne has been purchased by the four state agencies — Pungrain, Punsup, Markfed and state warehousing corporation — and the Food Corporation of India. The remaining, around one lakh tonne paddy, was purchased by private traders. “Against ₹35,600 crores worth of paddy purchased, we have so far made ₹35,211-crore payments to the farmers by crediting the minimum support price into their accounts,” said an officer of state’s food and civil supplies department. The hike in CCL is also being seen as the Centre’s nod to relax the cap on paddy purchase in Punjab, though no formal order has been received yet. Ahead of the procurement, the Union ministry for food and public distribution system had capped paddy purchase from Punjab to 168.65 lakh tonne. However, after the arrivals exceeded this limit, the state government sought the Centre’s nod to relax this cap. “We are still to get a formal nod (for increase in paddy purchase targets). The increase in CCL indicates that the Centre has agreed to our demand,” said Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. He said the government has to make payments on accruals on the paddy purchase as well, which include labour and transportation charges and dami (commission) to arhtiyas. As the state government was still to receive a provisional cost sheet from the Centre, the labour, transportation and dami are yet to be finalised. “We are expecting the cost sheet any day now,” said a food department officer. In recent years, the Centre used to provide the provisional cost sheet to the state government before the start of every procurement season. “We are pushing the Centre to send us the provisional cost sheet so that we should have a fair idea on what expenditure is allowed to us over and above the procurement,” said the officer. Other than labour, transportation and dami, rural development fund and mandi fee is also mentioned in the cost sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paddy-procurement-rbi-hikes-punjab-s-cash-credit-limit-by-3-101638202527935.html
29-11-2021||Mumbai||Came to power democratically, ruling autocratically, Sena slams Modi||Mumbai Shiv Sena on Monday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his statement on dynasty politics being a threat to democracy, and said that the biggest threat to the country is coming to power in a democratic way but ruling it in an autocratic manner. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana also defended the Congress party and said it believes in democratic values. On the occasion of Constitution Day on November 26, the prime minister had criticised the Congress and said, “Party for the family, by the family...do I need to say more? If a party is run by one family for many generations, then it isn’t good for a healthy democracy. How can the parties, which have lost their democratic character, protect democracy?” The editorial said, “The biggest threat to democracy is this tendency to come to power democratically and rule in an autocratic manner. Congress party believes in democratic values. Yes, there can be political differences with Congress, but it has not sold the pillars of democracy.”The editorial further targeted Modi and said that the prime minister attacked the Congress party, which in the past 10 years has become politically weak. This suggests that PM Modi is afraid of Congress as it could be an alternative to BJP.Without naming Congress, Modi criticised the party. In the last 10 years, Congress has weakened politically. Repeatedly attacking the party means that prime minister Modi still fears Congress,” it said and added that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has received a good response from Uttar Pradesh.Further, it said that there is no difference between a family-run political party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is controlled by people, who are under the prime minister. It said, “BJP, which once had illustrious leaders such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitely, Pramod Mahajan, Venkaiah Naidu, has not become a “dictatorship of one group”.” “BJP is not a ‘family party’ but in the past few years, it has become a dictatorship of one particular group. After Mr Modi became the prime minister, a leader from Gujarat was made the party chief. This arrangement was made so that the reins of the party and power remain in his hand. Congress’ reins in the hands of Gandhi family is akin to BJP’s reins in the hands of people who are under the prime minister’s thumb,” it said.As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of the BJP did not respond to criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/came-to-power-democratically-ruling-autocratically-sena-slams-modi-101638202287971.html

29-11-2021||Patna||Winter session of Bihar legislature begins||The five-day winter session of the state legislature began on Monday on a customary note, with the chairs of both legislative assembly as well as the legislative council leading their respective houses in paying homage to the former members and other prominent personalities who passed away during the intervening period since the monsoon session. The proceedings of the state assembly began with recitation of the national anthem after which speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha announced the names of senior leaders Prem Kumar of the BJP, Narendra Narayan Yadav of JD(U), Awadh Bihari Chaudhary of RJD, Jyoti of Congress and Mohammad Ashfaq Alam of the CPI(ML) as presiding officers for the current session. He also reconstituted the business advisory committee for the smooth conduct of the short session. Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad tabled the second supplementary to the annual budget for the fiscal 2021-22 and other bills, including those pertaining to the amendments to the goods and services tax and Panchayati Raj Acts for seeking the house’s approval. The assembly later paid its tributes to sitting MLA Musafir Paswan, former MLAs Sadanand Singh, Mithilesh Kumar Singh, Janardan Sharma, Gauri Shankar Nagdansh and Hind Kesri Yadav, former MLCs Balram Singh Yadav, Khalid Rashid Saba, and Ramji Prasad Sharma, who died recently. The members observed silence to pay homage to the departed souls, after which the house was adjourned for the day. The state legislative council was also adjourned for the day after the customary obituary references of the departed leaders. Working chairman of the upper house, Awadhesh Narayan Singh, hoped that the members of the house would utilise the short session to address the public issues and as usual abstain from creating chaos on insignificant issues. Earlier, members of the left parties staged protests over recent hooch deaths and blamed the state government for failure of the prohibition law. Tejashwi attacks govt for its failure on various fronts Opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav took a dig at chief minister Nitish Kumar over Niti Aayog’s latest report that had ranked Bihar poorly on various counts and blamed the “apathy” the chief minister for the poor condition of the state. Talking to media persons outside the assembly after it was adjourned for the day, Yadav said the “double-engine” government was of no use in Bihar. “One of its (Nitish government) engines had become faulty. They (ruling party leaders) say ‘15-saal bemishal’. But actually, it is ‘Badhaal 15 Saal’ for Bihar under Nitish regime. The Niti Aayog report only lends credence to the opposition’s charge that the Nitish government has failed on all fronts,” said the RJD leader. Yadav alleged the state witnessed 75 financial scams in the last 15 years. “Schemes under the seven commitments of CM, worth ₹24,000 crore, envisaging plantation, remain on papers only. Har ghar nal ka jal scheme is another major scam. Bihar has become no. 1 in poverty, crime and unemployment. Migration remains unabated. People are dying due to consumption of illicit liquor, but police personnel are raiding the wedding functions,” he said. Yadav said the RJD had decided to extend unconditional support to Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/winter-session-of-bihar-legislature-begins-101638201150569.html
29-11-2021||Patna||HIV blood transfused to pregnant woman; Bihar sacks lab tech for clearing infected blood sample||The Bihar government Sunday sacked a laboratory technician (LT), who allegedly collected HIV-infected blood from a donor that was later transfused to a pregnant woman at the district hospital in Nalanda, 63 km south-east of Patna, said officials. The health department is now keeping close tabs on the woman and child and testing their blood samples on weekly basis to see if they have been infected by HIV/AIDS. Santosh Kumar, a contractual LT of the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS), was sacked for lapses in duty. He, however, claimed that the government had acted in haste and sacked him without conducting a proper inquiry. “The authorities should conduct a re-test of the blood sample of the donor on the rapid screening kit and see the result for themselves,” said Kumar. Kumar claimed that the HIV blood donor’s sample had tested non-reactive when he tested it on the rapid screening kit, raising doubts about the efficacy of the kits bought by the state government. He also demanded that an FIR be lodged against the donor for concealing facts that he was HIV-positive and donated blood by concealing facts about his disease. The government has already ordered an enquiry into it. The Nalanda district magistrate has appointed a three-member committee of doctors, under the civil surgeon, to check for lapses and penalise the guilty. A male, with an A-positive blood group, donated blood on November 3 in exchange for one unit of blood (350 ml) for his wife, who was admitted for delivery at the sadar (district) hospital. The donor had allegedly concealed the fact that he was HIV positive and on antiretroviral drugs for the past 8-10 years. Kumar, who was on duty at the state government-run blood bank on the sadar hospital campus at Biharsharif, claimed the sample tested negative for the five mandatory screening tests for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis and malaria. The blood, thus collected, was stored in the inventory of the sadar hospital blood bank for circulation and administered to another pregnant woman, who came there for caesarian delivery on November 5. “We have an ELISA reader machine for the confirmatory test of blood samples. The officials should have cross-checked the result on the ELISA reader, before storing the infected blood for circulation” said a BSACS official, who requested anonymity. “The ELISA reader machine at our blood bank is not functional in absence of testing kits. I have written on two-three occasions to the civil surgeon for procurement and making the machine functional,” said Rajesh Kumar, treasurer of the Indian Red Cross Society-managed government blood bank at Biharsharif. The deputy superintendent of the Nalanda sadar hospital had on November 25 issued a show-cause notice to the medical officer in charge of the blood bank. He had, in turn, sought an explanation from Kumar, who replied to it a day later. Dr Upendra Kumar Sinha, retired chief medical officer of the blood bank at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), blamed the government for purchasing outdated rapid screening kits. “At PMCH, we used to test blood samples on fourth-generation P24 antigen testing kits, which has a 14-day window period. However, the government has provided a third-generation testing kit at Biharsharif. Such testing kits have a window period of 30-45 days from the date of being infected. These days we have modern Chemiluminescent Assay kits, with a window period of less than 5-6 days. The government should invest in them,” he said. “It is only in advance case of HIV/AIDS that the viral load is not detected in screening, but normally such patients are so weak and thin that one can easily make out by their appearance that they are HIV/AIDS infected,” added Sinha, now the chief medical officer of the blood bank at the Mahavir Vatsalya Aspataal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/hiv-blood-transfused-to-pregnant-woman-bihar-sacks-lab-tech-for-clearing-infected-blood-sample-101638201149324.html
29-11-2021||Ranchi||Panel yet to decide on namaaz room allocation in J’khand assembly building||The seven-member committee constituted by Jharkhand assembly Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto is yet to take a decision on the controversial namaaz room allocation in the House that witnessed almost a complete washout of monsoon session as the opposition BJP was up in arms against the notification. On the last day of the monsoon session on September 9, the Speaker formed an all-party committee chaired by senior JMM legislator Stephen Marandi to review the decision of notifying a dedicated namaaz room for Muslims in the assembly building and submit its recommendation in 45 days. Marandi said he would soon be convening a meeting of the panel to discuss the issue. “In our first meeting, we had decided to seek information from legislative assemblies in neighbouring states about any such provision there. I will check with officials about the latest update and call a meeting of the committee accordingly,” said Marandi. Sources said joint secretary of Jharkhand assembly, Ranjeet Kumar, had written to assemblies of Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal seeking details of, if any, space allocation for religious prayers, functions on the assembly premises. The notification issued by Jharkhand assembly dedicating a separate room for offering Namaz on September 2 had led to a political storm in the state with the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) consistently disrupting proceedings in the House during the monsoon session, doing Kirtan and chanting Hanuman Chalisa. Police had even lathi-charged BJP workers and leaders protesting near the assembly when they tried to march ahead by breaking barricades, injuring several of them. On the request of JMM legislator Sarfaraz Ahmed, Speaker agreed to form an all-party committee to deliberate on the issue and suggest move forward. The BJP, however, said they would continue with their protest until the decision is withdrawn. “If a decision is not taken, it would mean we were kept in dark just to delay the issue. Our party would continue our protest in winter session if the notification is not withdrawn,” said Biranchi Narayan, chief whip, BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/panel-yet-to-decide-on-namaaz-room-allocation-in-j-khand-assembly-building-101638201147972.html
29-11-2021||Pune||PMC rules: Multiplexes, auditoriums to continue to operate at 50% capacity||PUNE: After days of confusion, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) cleared the air with its fresh order issued on Monday stating that no fresh set of relaxations is being offered to the city.As per the PMC order, the guidelines issued by the state government will be applicable in the city even as deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar made an announcement regarding some relaxations. The latest PMC order implies that multiplexes, single-screen theatres and auditoriums will continue to operate at 50% capacity, contrary to Ajit Pawar’s announcement about allowing these establishments to operate at 100% capacity.As per the guidelines issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Saturday, restrictions in terms of attendance at any programme or event will continue and that the same can only be augmented by the district disaster management authority but not diluted.Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said in the order, “The state government has issued orders to resume all economic, cultural, social, sports and entertainment activities. These orders will also be applicable in the Pune and Khadki cantonment areas which fall within PMC limits. These orders will be in effect until further notice.”State guidelines have specified that in case of any programme, event or activity taking place in an enclosed space such as a cinema hall, theatre, marriage hall or convention hall, up to 50% of the capacity of the space will be allowed. In case of events or gatherings in open sky spaces, up to 25% capacity will be allowed. However, the DDMA will have the authority to decide the capacity in case of such locations gatherings or events, if not already declared formally. In addition to this, all persons connected with the organisation of any programme, event or show including service providers, participants, visitors, guests and customers have to be fully vaccinated as per the state orders. There has been clamour from theatre- and auditorium- operators and organisers of various programmes to lift the 50% attendance restriction. Hence, Ajit Pawar’s announcement was wholeheartedly welcomed by these stakeholders but later in the day, confusion prevailed after the state guidelines were issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-rules-multiplexes-auditoriums-to-continue-to-operate-at-50-capacity-101638200787978.html

Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal directed officials to ramp up daily testing to 50k samples, arrange hotels and jumbo centres to quarantine Covid-19 patients arriving from at-risk countries.Maharashtra environment and tourism minister and the guardian minister of Mumbai suburbs, Aaditya Thackeray held a review meeting with BMC officials on Monday asking them to stay on alert. Thackeray took to social media to inform, “Mumbai’s first dose is 100% complete and second dose is 72% done. We would be requesting the union government to reduce the gap between two doses, without altering our vaccine delivery schedule, so that we can complete 100% of the second dose for Mumbai by mid-January.” Thackeray urged, “Vaccines and masks are extremely crucial for Covid appropriate behaviour.” BMC has collected samples of those arriving from at-risk nations that include South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and some Middle Eastern and European countries.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC said, “There are no cases of Omicron variant yet in Mumbai. In the last 15 days, we have got data of 466 people from Maharashtra arriving from ‘countries of concern’. Of these, 100 are from Mumbai and none of them is tested positive for Covid-19. We have taken their samples again on Monday and reports will be out by Wednesday.”Kakani assured, “In case any samples are positive, we will send them for genomic sequencing. The next 15 days are going to be crucial.”Currently, all passengers arriving from international destinations that are on the list of ‘countries of concern’ will mandatorily undergo RT-PCR test at the airport. If they are tested positive, they will have to be quarantined institutionally and their samples will be sent to a genomic sequencing lab, said civic officials. Additionally, the BMC is also arranging for hotels ranging from two stars to five stars, where citizens can be quarantined. Richardson and Cruddas campus, located at Byculla is being kept ready by the BMC to accommodate flyers who need to be institutionally quarantined but are unable to pay for the same.BMC officials on Monday also said that primary schools in the city will reopen from December 01, 2021, as per the announcement of the state government and there will be no impact on the reopening of primary schools due to the outbreak of the omicron variant. Starting Wednesday, BMC is also launching another campaign to ensure all private and public offices have fully vaccinated employees. They will launch vaccination campaigns in areas where people are not fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/omicron-concerns-bmc-ramps-up-testing-puts-health-infra-on-high-alert-101638200308138.html

Every year thousands of warkaris (pilgrims) from all across the state come to Alandi, but this time, due to the ongoing MSRTC strike many could not travel to Alandi. Meanwhile, preparations for the big day are on in full swing along with the Covid safety precautions by the district administration, police department and other governing bodies. As the Covid restrictions have been eased, warkaris coming from all around the state have increased. “We have done all the preparations for the Kartiki Ekadashi Wari period and for the last one week, a big rush of people have started coming to Alandi. Also, the Covid norms and safety arrangements to monitor the darshan queues have been made by the temple Devsthan committee,” said advocate Vikas Dhage Patil, president of the Alandi Devsthan temple trust. “I am from Aurangabad district and in a remote village. As there was no direct bus available to come to Alandi we had to change two private buses to come here. The MSRTC strike should end now as it is affecting the common people who cannot afford high fares of private tourist buses,” said Tukaram Andhale, a warkari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/alandi-set-for-kartiki-ekadashi-wari-as-warkaris-brave-msrtc-strike-101638199649340.html
29-11-2021||Pune||Residents conducting survey of Taljai tekdi to maintain biodiversity||PUNE: Every weekend, a group of residents from Sahakar nagar and Satara road heads towards Taljai tekdi, with books in their hands. They are part of a group of volunteers conducting a survey of Taljai tekdi, trying to understand its biodiversity and study its flora and fauna.The group began their survey in November and plan to continue for another month so that most of the area is covered. Ketaki Sathe-Kulkarni, coordinator of the survey, said, “So far, we have covered half the area and this rapid survey will give us an idea about the existing flora and fauna diversity, along with the habitats they provide and the associations which they have. This study will help us understand and anticipate the impact of development if it takes place and what we will lose.”“Ideally, our hills have dry deciduous species which include Hiwar, Pandhara Khair, Son Khair (different species of Acacia), Capparis Zeylenica, Flaucortia Indica. All these are trees with networked branches and thorns that encourage small birds such as shrike, munias, robins and bushcats to build their nests,” Kulkarni said.The tekdi also has the climber plant Dregea Volubilis which requires tall trees for support. Also, this climber forms a habitat where mammals like wild hare can hide. Kulkarni said that another dominant grass species found till date is the Apluda Mutica which stands third to fourth in terms of succession of grasses. Which means that the soil, although not of the best quality, definitely contains some quantity of organic matter.The group of residents is not only studying the flora and fauna but also actively participating in planting trees. “Following our expert advice, we have planted trees like Moha, Kanchan, Wad, Pimpal, Muchkund, Bel and Putranjiva too,” said Indranil Sadagale, member of the Sahakar Nagar Residents’ Association.The survey will also study the soil apart from various species of flora and fauna and has received the support of the Environment Club of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-conducting-survey-of-taljai-tekdi-to-maintain-biodiversity-101638199407909.html
29-11-2021||Patna||‘Trouble engine’ govt: Tejashwi slams JD(U)-NDA coalition over Niti Aayog report||The leader of opposition in Bihar legislative assembly Tejashwi Yadav on Monday called the Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine ‘trouble engine’ government, attacking BJP's often-used phrase 'double-engine' government. He alleged that the government failed on all fronts.“Where does Bihar stand in the Niti Aayog report? It is at the number one position from the bottom. Whenever the CM is asked about it, he expresses his ignorance. This shows that the Bihar government is not serious about meeting the basic needs of the people. This is not a 'double engine' but a 'trouble engine' government in Bihar,” Yadav said.Yadav’s criticism of the government comes after a Niti Aayog report showed Bihar as the poorest state.“The Niti Aayog report shows the Bihar government as a failure on almost all indicators. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is running a corrupt government. There's corruption from top to bottom. Bihar stands first in unemployment, education system has been completely destroyed and health infrastructure in the state is in shambles,” Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He said that resentment was brewing among Bihar’s citizens due to the government’s alleged failures to stem ‘rampant corruption.’Niti Aayog’s recently released National Multidimensional Poverty Index report says that 51.91% of Bihar’s population is poor.Yadav also said that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) found that there were ‘glaring financial discrepancies’ in various departments of the Bihar government as well as ‘ irregularities and wasteful expenditure’. He said that the Rashtriya Janata Dal decided to hand over a copy of NITI Aayog and CAG reports to the chief minister Nitish Kumar. He said that the motive behind sharing it is due to the chief minister not being ‘aware’ of the recent developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/trouble-engine-govt-tejashwi-slams-jd-u-nda-coalition-over-niti-aayog-report-101638198912085.html

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||School challenge: Pargat calls Sisodia fake leader, accuses him of misleading people||Hitting out at his Delhi counterpart Manish Sisodia, Punjab education minister Pargat Singh on Monday termed him a “fake leader” and alleged that he was misleading people by releasing “fake figures” pertaining to schools run by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the national capital. In a series of posts on Twitter, Pargat said that Delhi deputy chief minister Sisodia, who also holds the charge of education, has released a list of 250 schools in the national capital without going into the relevant details sought by him. “I had asked him to compare Delhi and Punjab schools on the national performance grading index 2021. I think Sisodia was in a hurry to respond, but had not read what I asked for,” said Pargat Singh in a press statement released by the education department based on his messages on the micro-blogging site.Sisodia on Sunday issued a list of 250 government schools for review of education reforms in the national capital and sought a list of 250 government schools of Punjab from the his Punjab counterpart. This came a day after Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal accepted Pargat Singh’s challenge for a debate on the education system of the two states. Pargat, a former Indian hockey team captain, was given the charge of the education ministry after Charanjit Singh Channi took over as the Punjab chief minister on September 20 this year. Punjab minister seeks more details“The list (of schools) that Sisodia had released should also throw light on school-wise enrolment numbers, permanent teachers and vacancies, Class 10th results and the names of principals,” said Pargat, asking his Delhi counterpart to mention the figures from the 2013-14 to 2019-20 academic sessions, “so that everyone has a clear picture”. Stating that he had asked for the same information earlier too, Pargat said: “I wonder what you are hiding.”Asserting that he will not let Sisodia get away like this, the Punjab minister further posed a series of questions to him on Twitter: If there is a decline in students, what education reform will you do? When there are no principals, who are you sending on training? When children fail in 10th, then who will go for higher education? Why to talk about infrastructure when there is no new school? “Since @msisodya ji might be reluctant to discuss these points, I will request @arvindkejriwal ji to give the complete list. Let us decide once for all who is “real” and who is “fake” Aam Aadmi (sic)”, Pargat wrote in the concluding message on Twitter. Sisodia could not be contacted for a reaction till the filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/school-challenge-pargat-calls-sisodia-fake-leader-accuses-him-of-misleading-people-101638198267681.html
29-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC sets aside order refusing restraint on Nawab Malik||Mumbai A division bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday set aside the single-judge bench order of November 22 which refused to restrain NCP leader and Maharashtra minorities minister Nawab Malik from posting anything against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede and his family. The order was set aside after the NCB officer’s father, Dnyandev Wankhede, agreed to the consent terms proposed by Malik for re-hearing of the interim application in the defamation suit filed by Dnyandev Wankhede against the NCP leader. The proposal came in response to an appeal filed by Wankhede against the single-judge order. Malik had expressed willingness for setting aside the single-judge bench order on Friday and proposed consent terms before the division bench of Justice S J Kathawalla and Justice Milind Jadhav on Friday. Wankhede’s counsel senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf had sought time till Monday to respond to the proposed consent terms. On Monday, when the appeal came up for hearing, Dr Saraf informed the bench that Wankhede agreed to the consent terms. Accordingly, the division bench struck down the single-judge order and remanded the matter back to the single-judge for a fresh hearing of the interim application. Wankhede who had filed the appeal against November 22 order, had claimed that though there were observations favouring him and his family, the court had failed to restrain Malik from posting anything against them. The order had only directed Malik to reasonably verify the material before posting it online or on any media platform. The bench hearing the appeal had also noted that the observations by the single judge in his order indicated that the content posted by Malik was malicious and hence there should have been an injunction. On his part, Malik had also expressed his discontentment with the single-judge bench order and hence placed the draft consent terms showing his willingness for setting aside the single judge bench order, as sought by Wankhede and agreed for re-hearing of the interim application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-sets-aside-order-refusing-restraint-on-nawab-malik-101638197427839.html

Speaking at the eighth convocation ceremony of Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University (DSMRU), she asked divyang students (with special needs) to draw inspiration from participants of the Tokyo Paralympics who won medals and brought laurels to the country. She also lauded bureaucrat Suhas LY, who became the first-ever IAS officer to win a medal at the paralympics, saying he is a role model for many. Gautam Buddh Nagar district magistrate Suhas L Yathiraj had secured a silver medal in the final of the men’s singles badminton SL-4 event at the Tokyo Paralympics 2020 held on September 5 this year.As many as 145 medals were awarded to 115 students (65 female and 50 male) at the eighth convocation ceremony of DSMRU. Among these, 16 were bagged by 12 students with special needs , said vice-chancellor RKP Singh. Addressing divyang students, the governor said, “If God has taken something from you, he has also given immense potential to you to overcome it. It is heartening that 12 students with special needs are among the medal winners. Visually impaired Arvind Kumar Rathore received Dr Shakuntala Misra Memorial Gold Medal for securing 76.80% marks, the highest by any student at the undergraduate level. He got two other gold medals. Rathore pursued BA with English, history and political science. “I want to become a teacher because they are the nation builders. I want to help children with special needs,” he added.

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab election: Sidhu corners Kejriwal over promises made to women, teachers||Hitting out at Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for promising ₹1,000 per month to all women if voted to power in Punjab, state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday called it a “lollipop” and questioned that how many women have been given a similar sop in the national capital. Sidhu also targeted Kejriwal on jobs created for teachers in Delhi, days after the AAP leader had promised to regularise services of temporary teachers in Punjab. After contesting the Punjab assembly elections for the first time in 2017 and emerging as the main opposition, the Kejriwal-led party has announced a slew of promises in hopes to make more gains in the 2022 elections. A day after Kejriwal accused leaders of the Congress, BJP and SAD of constantly bashing his party over these announcements, Sidhu slammed him, invoking an iconic movie dialogue: “Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones at others”. Series of Twitter posts In a series of posts on Twitter, Sidhu targeted the Delhi CM for not having one woman in his cabinet. “@ArvindKejriwal Ji you talk of women empowerment, jobs & teachers. However, you don’t have one woman minister in your Cabinet. How many women in Delhi get ₹1000 despite revenue surplus left by (former Delhi CM) Sheila Dikshit Ji !! (sic),” tweeted Sidhu. He said women’s empowerment means mandatorily engaging women in every step of electoral process, like the Congress is doing in Punjab, and not in giving “lollipops”. On the issue of teachers, Sidhu accused the Kejriwal government of filling vacant posts by engaging guest teachers. “On teachers and jobs, in 2015 there were 12,515 job vacancies of teachers in Delhi, and in 2021 there are 19,907 such job vacancies of teachers in Delhi… and you are filling most of the vacant posts by just guest lecturers,” said Sidhu. He further questioned Kejriwal about eight lakh jobs and 20 new colleges his party had promised in 2015, dubbing them as “failed guarantees”. “On the contrary, the unemployment rate of Delhi has increased by almost five times in the last five years,” he alleged in another Twitter post. Second attack in a week This was Sidhu’s second big attack on the AAP within a week. Earlier on November 24, targeting the AAP over its sop announcements ahead of the Punjab elections, Sidhu had said people won’t fall prey to populist measures without the backing of a policy framework, defined budget allocations and implementation metrics. He had then said true leaders do not give “lollipops” and instead focus on building the foundations of society and economy. Kejriwal has also promised up to 300 units of free electricity for each household, 24-hour power supply and free treatment and medicines at government hospitals if the AAP forms the government in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-election-sidhu-corners-kejriwal-over-promises-made-to-women-teachers-101638195867658.html

Eighteen people were arrested from Prayagraj, four from Lucknow, three each from Shamli and Ayodhya while one person was arrested from Kaushambi.The STF ADG, Amitabh Yash, said multiple teams were working on the case and trying to find how the question papers were compromised.

There is maximum possibility that the papers were leaked at the examination agency level or at the treasury, where they were kept before distribution and the entire probe was revolving around the same, he said.“We are trying to connect the dots in the entire chain involved in comprising the exam process. Many people have been detained and are being questioned in this connection,” he added.

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||In Covid times, rites of passage and resilience||The Covid-19 era has taught us two important lessons, one about the transitory nature of life and the other about resilience. It has never been easy to cope with the loss of a loved one. People are known to have gone insane or taken their own lives under depression from such a loss. Those who suffered such loss will easily identify with the following lines of poet WH Auden: ‘He was my North, my South, my East and West,My working week and my Sunday rest,My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong’ My first brush with such feelings took place when my brother, younger to me by 10 years, departed suddenly, shattering us all. The grief reduced us to living corpses for a few days, till we boarded a train to Haridwar to immerse his mortal remains in the holy Ganges. A middle-aged couple sat on the adjoining seat with a red pouch containing the remains of their only newlywed son. Listening to their story, we forgot our own grief momentarily. Reaching Haridwar, we found the railway station abuzz with mourners carrying the mortal remains of their respective kin. It was a great grief-dampener when we realised that we weren’t alone. At Kankhal Ghat, the flow of the river was fast and furious. Standing in icy cold and transparent waters, amid chanting of mantras by the priest, I let go of the brittle bones of a bright scholar, consigning the same to the mighty river after holding them close to my chest for a few seconds. Soon, he mingled with his Maker, while I kept looking on for some time. Watching scores of others doing the same thing, I took it as something that did not seem unusual which happened only to us. Reaching Har-ki-Pauri, the family priest took us to his house in a narrow bylane near the ghat. He opened his ledger to show us names of an array of elders who had signed in it when they came here. My father recognised the entry he made in the fifties when he came to immerse the remains of my grandmother. There were signatures of his own great-grandfather in Urdu, who had come due to a similar unnatural death of his young son in the 19th century. Meeting so many relatives in the oblong register was like a family reunion. It was a revelation too, that life is not static. It flows like the Ganges. One comes here in happier times for a picnic, lets down one’s hair to have fun and frolic in its frothy waters, unmindful of this final inevitable moment of surrender that is always waiting in the wings. My head bowed in reverence to our common forefathers who devised this system of coping with such happenings in life. I wondered, how we, who had lapsed into living corpses sprang back to life after coming here. The crux of Indian culture lies in numerous rituals, which may or may not improve one’s future life, but definitely helps to rekindle the extinguishing flame when all seems to have been lost, including one’s will to live. vinodk60@yahoo.co.in The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-covid-times-rites-of-passage-and-resilience-101638194307815.html
29-11-2021||Mumbai||HC: Weight of blotter paper to be included while weighing LSD||Mumbai: The Bombay High Court has held that the weight of blotter paper will be considered part of contraband seizure and the paper ought to be included while weighing Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) for prosecution under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.The HC on Monday set aside the special NDPS court order of April 2021 wherein it had directed the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to reweigh the 31 blotter papers weighing around 0.62 gms containing LSD dots that were seized from alleged drug peddler Anuj Keshwani to determine the actual quantity of the drug present sans the blotter paper. The single-judge bench of justice Revati Mohite Dere while hearing the appeal filed by the NCB against the special NDPS court order had been informed by additional solicitor general ASG Anil Singh and advocate Shriram Shirsat that as the blotter paper was also consumed along with the drug its weight had to be taken into consideration too. The ASG had referred to an apex court judgement in Hira Singh vs Union of India case wherein the weight of the mixture of drugs had to be considered along with the neutral substance and not just its pure form. However, advocate Rizwan Merchant and Gayatri Gokhale argued on behalf of Keshwani that the 0.62 grams seized from their client included the weight of blot paper, along with LSD dots. Merchant had argued that the blotter paper was not a mixture as regarded by the SC judgement and the FSL report had not stated the weight of 31 blot papers. As per the NDPS Act, 1985, the commercial quantity for LSD is 0.1 grams. In light of this submission by Merchant, the special court had directed the NCB to resend the 31 blotter papers to FSL Gujarat to ascertain the actual weight of the LSD seized from Keshwani. In September 2020, Keshwani had been arrested by the NCB and a total of 585 grams of charas, 270.12 grams of ganja, 3.6 grams of Tetrahydrocannabinol and 0.62 grams of LSD were recovered and seized from him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-weight-of-blotter-paper-to-be-included-while-weighing-lsd-101638193647360.html
29-11-2021||Lucknow||The heroic ‘dastaan’ of 1971 war!||“We very well know the 1971 war between Indian and Pakistan resulted in liberation of Bangladesh. Indian Army, Navy and Air Force won the war for India which was the biggest and swiftest war India had won since independence,” narrated dastaango Himanshu Bajpai and Pragya Sharma. The duo was presenting the story of India-Pakistan war at ‘Kissagoi 1971’ at Lt Puneet Nath Datt Auditorium at Lucknow Cantonment organised by Surya Command and Military Literature Festival. “93,000 people surrendered, which was the second biggest surrender after the Second World War. India won the war in just 13 days starting from December 3 and ending on December 16—the day which is celebrated as Vijay Diwas,” said Himanshu. After the war, four Param Vir Chakra were conferred upon Lance Naik Albert Ekka, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal and Major Hoshiar Singh Dahiya. Audience was glued to the presentation by the duo. Bajpai and Sharma narrated the story of the Battle of Longewala where 120 Indian soldiers led by Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri fought for the whole night with 3,000 Pakistani soldiers accompanied with 60 tanks. “The regiment knew if they lose this post Jaisalmer will be captured. They laid landmines and fought a fierce battle and in the wee hours, Indian Air Force fighters came in action and changed the face of the battle.” Dastaango narrated the tension that build up during the Battle of Hilly in which 100 Indian soldiers lost their lives. The tale, of sinking of Pakistani submarine PNS Ghazi that came to destroy INS Vikrant but fell trap to Indian tactics near Vishakhapatnam port, mesmerized the audience. They also told the audience about how the INF Khukri fell prey to Pakistani submarine attack near Diu on December 9. The final narration revolved around the surrender of Pakistani commander Gen AAK Nazi to Lt Gen Jagjit Singh Aurora, GoC-in-C Indian Eastern Command. Many war veterans, retired officers and others were present on the occasion. Three similar events have been held at the same venue and final one will be held on Tuesday. Himanshu, Pragya’s dastaan finds place in PM’s ‘Maan Ki Baat’ Sunday was a special day for the dastaango duo Himanshu Bajpai and Pragya Sharma. During the Man Ki Baat address Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned their dastaan on Rani Durgawati that they narrated at Janjati Gaurav Divas Saptah held at Katni, Madhya Pradesh on November 21. In his address the PM said, “Sathiyon ne ek yaadgaar dastangoi karyakram ki jankari di hai. Ismain Rani Durgawati ki adamya sahas aur balidaan ki yaadein taaza ho gai.” Soon, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also tweeted about the mention of dastaangoi. He also mentioned about Bajpai and Sharma and their other narration about Rani Laxmibai. “The mention of storytelling in PM’s and defence minister’s talks, will make this art form popular and take it to the masses. This is an ancient art form and storytelling has been part of our history. Hope more people come forward and tell stories which are part of our culture,” Bajpai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/the-heroic-dastaan-of-1971-war-101638193349743.html

29-11-2021||Mumbai||Doctors see an increase in viral infections among children||Mumbai Doctors in the city are noticing a spurt of viral infections among children. Amid the ongoing pandemic and the threat of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron, doctors said that parents should immediately seek medical advice instead of wasting the initial days of symptoms with self-medication at home. “We are seeing a lot of upper respiratory tract infection as well as lower respiratory tract infections among children since the past few days,” said Dr Bela Verma, head of the paediatric department of state-run JJ Hospital. “The increase is marginal at the moment. We are ruling out Covid-19 in all patients as the SARS-CoV-2 remains in circulation. But almost all our patients have tested negative for Covid barring one,” she said. According to Dr Verma, three out of 10 paediatric patients are coming with viral ailments. “We have been admitting children with lower respiratory tract infections as they have some breathing difficulty along with cough and fever. They are treated with oxygen therapy, bronchodilators along with other supportive treatments,” said Dr Verma. Doctors said that Mumbai’s air quality and the layers of smog seen over the past several days, has also resulted in worsening of respiratory illnesses, especially among adults and paediatric patients with existing lung ailments. On November 16, south Mumbai recorded worst air quality levels than Delhi, with Colaba’s air quality index touching 345, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). Infectious disease specialist Dr Neeraj Tulara from LH Hiranandani Hospital in Powai said that they have been witnessing an increase for the past two weeks. “Dengue cases have come down significantly in the last two weeks. There are also not many Covid cases. Nearly 60% to 70% of patients coming to the outpatient department have a common cold, flu or viral fever,” said Dr Tulara adding that common flu is highly contagious as it spreads through respiratory droplets and surfaces. “One infected child can it spread to a cohort in the school. Parents should educate their children and make sure that they don’t send their children to school or to play if they have any symptoms of flu,” he said. Doctors said that adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing a mask and washing hands can help in curbing the spread of common flu as well. In wake of the new Covid-19 variant, the task force is likely a convene a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the re-opening of schools. “We have given a go-ahead for Covid-19 vaccination for children in the age group of 12 to 18 years,” said Dr Bakul Parekh, a member of the paediatric Covid-19 task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doctors-see-an-increase-in-viral-infections-among-children-101638189867219.html

The NCP leader on Monday appeared before the metropolitan magistrate court pursuant to summons issued to him. When ACMM Parvez Mokashi asked Malik about the allegations levelled against him, he claimed, “I haven’t defamed anybody. I have evidence and will produce the same before the court.” Bharatiya alleged that Malik, in a television interview after the cruise ship drug bust case, had said that Bharatiya’s brother-in-law, Rishabh Sachdeva, was also on board the cruise when it was searched by a Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) team led by the agency’s zonal director, Sameer Wankhede on October 2. However, Malik added that due to Bhartiya’s influence, Sachadeva was let go. Malik also allegedly said that Bharatiya met Wankhede on October 7 at an undisclosed location. He said that he would circulate the video clip of the meeting, but it never saw the light of the day. Bharatiya said that Malik misused his dominant position of being a cabinet minister to target the NCB, as the agency had arrested and is prosecuting his son-in-law in a drugs case. Faiz R Merchant, who had argued for Mohit Bhartiya, submitted that Malik maligned the image of his client and defamed him. On the other hand, Malik’s counsel Ramesh Dube Patil argued that several complaints have been filed against Bharatiya, as he had defrauded people to the tune of ₹1,100 crore and after the fraud, changed his name from Mohit Kamboj to Mohit Bharatiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-grants-bail-to-nawab-malik-in-bjp-worker-s-defamation-suit-101638189627503.html

According to the victim Deepak Das, the suspected cop robbed him on the pretext of frisking his luxury car on the suspicion of liquor smuggling. Das told HT that he and his driver were returning to Kolkata via Muzaffarpur after collecting cash from small gold shop keepers. “When we reached near Phurshatpur weighing scale, around 12.30 am, five persons including two men in police uniform stopped the car. Accusing me of peddling IMFL, a man came and asked me to come out. When I came out, another man introduced himself as a senior cop and asked me to keep my bag full of cash aside as they wanted to frisk my car, they said they have inputs that we are liquor smugglers. As soon as I took out the cash, they snatched it with my mobile phone and car’s key. They ordered us to sit in the car, saying senior cops will reach shortly to interrogate us,” said Das, adding that as he pleaded innocence, they returned his bag, saying nothing objectionable was found in it. After 30 minutes, Das got down from the car and started searching them but the miscreants sped away.

Opposition parties and activists have raised questions over the way permission was granted.Shaina NC, however, said some people were “needlessly” trying to create controversy and added that the high court has validated the permission granted. “I have absolutely nothing to do with it. Some people are needlessly trying to create controversy,” she said.The High Court in September 2020 ruled in favour of the builders. “The petitioner has obtained permission from every single authority by disclosing the factual position at the site… There are approved plans placed on record which have not been disputed (by the respondents before the court),” the High Court said in its order. Suvarna Lotlikar moved the court in June 2020 against the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) order to cancel permission for construction. The controversy emerged as the new bungalow was reportedly being constructed barely metres away from the UNESCO recognized heritage precinct of Old Goa claiming that an old dilapidated structure was being repaired. Located squarely within the protected heritage area and sharing a boundary with the St Cajetan’s Church and a few hundred metres away from the Sé Cathedral at Old Goa, the two-storeyed structure could not have been permitted, activists say.No permissions for fresh constructions are allowed within the 200-metre radius from a notified archaeological structure. However, the builders applied for repair/reconstruction claiming that there existed a previous structure that was destroyed out of disuse and adverse events that they were seeking to rebuild. “I have asked the concerned the department -- the TCP department, the Panchayat department -- to check the documents and if it is illegal then it should be shut down,” Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said on Sunday.The Save Old Goa Action Committee, which started the campaign against the ‘illegal’ structure, had claimed that the permissions were taken to repair a house and purported pictures of the old building needing repair was actually of an existing palatial ancient old bungalow at Parcem in Goa’s northernmost taluka of Pernem, 50 km from the site, where the repair work was to be done.The committee said at the construction site there was a small ‘shed’ known as loja in Portuguese that was used to store coconuts. The builders, however, described loja an old house that was destroyed and sought permission to repair it, the committee said.“This is a case where Lotlikar has secured permission from various authorities by misrepresentation and fraud. This construction is coming up overriding the objections of the office of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) This is a case of gross misuse of power by the State Government to favour a powerful and influential party. Lotlikar could not have obtained any permission from any Authority even for repair or renovation to any house, which was not even existing in the property,” the Save Old Goa Action Committee has said. Members of the committee have now begun a hunger strike demanding the demolition of the structure.The claims of the committee were confirmed by the archaeological superintendent of Goa circle K Amarnath Ramkrishna in a letter to Arvin Manjul Director (Monuments- II), Goa, who had initially granted permission for the repairs. “The applicant claims that the house in the photograph existed in survey No. 4/1 village Ella (Old Goa) before it was destroyed in a storm in the year 1992. However, …to verify the fact of the matter, this office… visited Parcem village in Pernem taluka... During the inspection, it is found that the photograph submitted by the applicant is false and the claim of the existence of the house in Survey No. 4.1 of village Ella, before the year 1992 is false,” K Amarnath Ramkrishna, superintending archaeologist of the ASI Goa Circle had said in his report to his superiors in Delhi on January 2020.As the superintending archaeologist at the site with the Old Goa precinct under his care, Ramkrishna began sending notices to the builders that they were using the repair licence to expand and construct a new structure well beyond the scope of the permissions they had sought. In a series of communications sent between February and June 2020 when the structure was being built, the ASI authorities directed the builders to remove the poles erected at the site of the said structure within 24 hours while reminding them that the permission granted is restricted only for repairs to the existing hut, without any horizontal or vertical expansion.They are further directed to submit several documents, including approved plans, photographs while asking the builders to maintain the status quo until all this is complied with while calling for a joint inspection. In the meantime, Ramkrishna was issued transfer orders providing further ammunition to those protesting the project. The stop-work order that the ASI had issued was challenged before the Bombay High Court at Goa by Suvarna Lotlikar who claimed before the Court that her project was completely legal. Lotlikar claimed that she wasn’t undertaking any activity beyond the conditions in the permissions/approvals/NOCs issued by various authorities and said the ASI has no powers or authority to either misconstrue the permissions already granted or introduce further conditions that can obstruct the petitioner from undertaking the works.The High Court ruled in favour of the builders and said the petitioner has obtained permission from every single authority. “The ASI (local unit) was not justified in issuing the impugned communications which, to some extent, seek to virtually reopen or revisit the permission which was issued by the competent authority. Under the guise of supervision, the local ASI could not have usurped such powers unto themselves. In particular, we neither understand, nor appreciate the demand for title documents, or styling of the said structure as some ‘hut’, or requiring the petitioner to restrict the works to the ‘hut’. For all these reasons, the impugned communications are liable to be set aside,” the High Court said in an order passed in September 2020. After the high court order, the construction resumed and Save Old Goa Action has decided to move Supreme Court against the court order. And, with elections approaching the Congress and the Trinamool Congress supported the issue claiming the approval process was manipulated. From within the BJP, the pressure has mounted with environment minister, Michael Lobo, asking Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant to revoke permissions for the structure within two days failing which he along with his supporters will join the protests.“I have written a letter to the chief minister and have spoken to the party president and he has told me he will look into it. The permission was given in 2016 and the construction started in 2020. I will see that we take this case to a logical end. We will fight for it. The Town Country will follow due process and ensure that all permissions are withdrawn,” Lobo told reporters on Friday.A day later, Goa’s deputy chief minister and in-charge of the town planning department, Chandrakant Kavelkear, said he has asked the department to revoke the permissions after examining the matter and blamed his predecessor Vijai Sardesai of Goa Forward Party for issuing permissions. “I have asked my department to revoke the permissions. The local village panchayat is also withdrawing the no-objection certificate to construct,” he said.Sardesai, however, said that permissions were granted in 2016 during the tenure of former CM Laxmikant Parsekar when he wasn’t in government, and that “insinuating his role is an attempt to confuse and obscure the truth which then Goa Government and the current one, both with full majority, in an untenable position. “Do not dispute the facts and do not hoodwink Goans,” Sardesai said.For now, members of the Save Old Goa Action Committee have vowed to continue with the hunger strike until the structure is deemed illegal and demolished. With the hunger strike coinciding with the feast of St Francis Xavier that will be held on December 3 and with an election next year, the ruling BJP is on the backfoot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-govt-decides-to-re-examine-permission-for-repair-of-bungalow-co-owned-by-shaina-nc-s-husband-101638184588812.html
29-11-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Two years in opposition, is BJP’s response floundering?||Two years may not be an adequate period to peruse the performance of those in power since the mandate is for five years. But in Maharashtra, parties that came to power in 2019 did not originally enjoy the mandate nor were they all-natural allies. So, when the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress as part of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) managed to complete two years in office on Sunday, it was in itself an achievement.But what about Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which emerged as the largest party to be a natural claimant for power and yet ended up in opposition? After 24 months out of power, the BJP now finds itself grappling with its own issues and losing its grip over the narrative it tried to set months ago as a series of crises hit the MVA government.If there is a lot to assess when the MVA is completing two years in office, the opposition’s performance in Maharashtra may not have been up to the mark despite BJP being aggressive, which has increased bitterness between the government and the opposition.The opposition’s main task is to hold the government accountable and to convince people about the shortcomings of those in power to increase their base. BJP’s response in the past few months has been lacking in this regard. If it has attempted to push Uddhav Thackeray-led dispensation to corner on issues of governance, the recent actions by central agencies against some MVA ministers have overshadowed.After action against former home minister Anil Deshmukh in a case of extortion of ₹100 crore from restaurants and bars, the MVA has been able to successfully create a perception that central agencies are being misused in Maharashtra against its ministers. There is a sense of victimhood that the MVA is trying to play up to generate sympathy among people.For some BJP leaders, harping regularly on a tune of “this government will collapse in a few days” hasn’t helped its cause a bit. It has in fact dented its image of an unbeatable force with a ‘development first’ agenda especially when MVA’s record of initiating major infrastructure projects has been extremely poor.If the government is perceived by many as lukewarm to big projects, the BJP has failed to corner it further after initial success when MVA shifted Metro car shed, changed the site for the proposed airport in Purandar and showed reluctance to the bullet train.In Pune, the BJP hasn’t been able to raise its voice on the airport issue no matter how crucial the project is for the city that contributes most in Maharashtra after Mumbai in employment and revenue. The other projects like the outer ring road in Pune hasn’t progressed anywhere while work on Metro rail has slowed with deadlines missed twice for starting commercial operations at least on priority stretch.The government on its part has cited Covid-19 as an excuse for its inability to start new projects or delay in carrying out existing projects. But it hasn’t handled the Covid-19 situation well, particularly in Pune, which was worst affected. The BJP on its part has not been able to highlight that well no matter government’s focus was only restricted to Mumbai when Covid-19 cases surged during the second wave and people were dying without beds in hospitals or oxygen. The BJP’s tally in the state assembly is 106, an increase of one legislator after it won Pandharpur polls. In the MVA, the Shiv Sena has 56 seats, the NCP has 53 and the Congress has 44. In Pune, six out of eight legislators are from the city. The Member of Parliament (MP) is also from BJP while the civic body is also being controlled by it. Yet, BJP’s record of highlighting lacunas of this government has so far been poor.The recent communal riots in places like Amravati, Nanded and Malegaon has provided the BJP with an opportunity to regroup by looking to monopolise Maharashtra’s Hindutva vote-bank through discrediting the Shiv Sena as a secular party. How much it succeeds will be visible in the coming civic elections at 13 cities including Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur.The municipal elections hold vital importance for the BJP and their results may determine how the MVA trajectory from there on moves as much as the factional politics in the party eventually shapes up. And to win these polls, the BJP has to re-establish itself as powerful opposition, unconcerned about how long will MVA government but how it can force the government to improve the lives of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-two-years-in-opposition-is-bjp-s-response-floundering-101638183146831.html

Also read: Badal loyalist Harjinder Singh Dhami is new SGPC chiefAhuja, who was recently awarded the Padma Shri for social work, was battling cancer for the past few years and breathed his last at 9.30am on Monday. Even on the day of his death, the langar service continued as per his wish and poor patients and attendants were fed. After the post-mortem at PGIMER, the body was taken to his house in Sector 23 and the cremation was carried out at Sector 25. Born in Peshawar, Ahuja moved from Pakistan to Patiala with his family during Partition in 1947. At 12, he was a refugee overnight. He started selling boiled candy to help his family make ends meet. In 1956, the family moved to Chandigarh. Here, he sold bananas and became prosperous. In 1981, he began giving back to society. Having organised ‘langar (community kitchens)’ across the city, Ahuja moved to serving free food outside PGIMER, Sector 12, and Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32 in 2001. Since then, he has been distributing meals to people daily. It was only during the Covid-19 pandemic that the langar service was discontinued for four days but he managed to get permission from the Chandigarh Administration to continue the noble cause. In 2015, Ahuja sold his seventh property worth ₹1.6 crore to arrange money for his noble initiative. He has sold six other such properties worth crores to ensure that poor don’t go to bed on an empty stomach. Sandeep, who distributes food on behalf of Ahuja outside PGI, told reporters that Langar Baba had called him home on Sunday evening and had said that the sewa (service) should continue even on the day he died. A few days ago, he had bought ration for months and stocked it up in a house in Sector 26, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-langar-baba-jagdish-lal-ahuja-passes-away-101638182366833.html

Since the first cases of the omicron variant of Coronavirus were detected in Botswana, travellers from the country are being tracked and made to follow recently issued guidelines for Coronavirus.Jabalpur chief medical and health officer Dr Ratnesh Kurariya said they were informed by an official from the Botswana Embassy that the woman is in isolation at a military organisation in Jabalpur. "We have asked him to share her mobile phone number and her local contact,” the officer was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The officer said efforts were on to find the woman, identified as Khuno Oremeet Selyn, in line with guidelines issued by the Union government's health surveillance to check the spread of Covid-19.Dr Kurariya said the woman came to Jabalpur from Delhi, going by the records shared by the Union government. The location of her mobile number mentioned in Jabalpur's Dumna airport record was traced to Delhi.The investigation conducted by police so far suggested that the phone has not been moved out of Delhi since the last one month, the PTI report said.Meanwhile, the officials are also examining CCTV footage of the Jabalpur airport to find the woman. Information is also being gathered from hotels in Jabalpur and neighbouring districts, the official said.As part of the surveillance process, the Central government was regularly providing lists of visitors coming to Jabalpur from abroad, Dr Kurariya said, adding last month, 164 people from the United Kingdom visited Jabalpur and they were contacted and their health status was checked.The World Health Organisation (WHO) last week described Omicron as a “variant of concern” and it is being feared that the strain could bypass the current vaccines and prolong the Covid-19 pandemic.On Monday, the world health body also warned that the risk related to omicron is "very high" and the strain is likely to spread internationally at a very high speed and could possibly have “severe consequences”.The omicron variant was first detected in South Africa. Till now, India has not reported any cases of the variant. However, the Centre said on Monday that two clusters are under investigation in Maharashtra and Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/search-for-woman-from-botswana-in-madhya-pradesh-amid-omicron-variant-101638180378298.html

29-11-2021||Kolkata||TMC to expand political base across Northeast for 2024 polls: Mukul Sangma||Meghalaya TMC leader Mukul Sangma said that Mamata Banerjee's party is looking forward to expanding its political base across the Northeast ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.The former Meghalaya chief minister, who recently switched over to the TMC along with 11 other Congress MLAs, told PTI in an interview that the political dynamics in the entire region is going to change with him quitting the grand old party."I have been holding talks with leaders from other states in the region. They have been calling me up following the political decision that we have taken. This indicates that they are looking for something new in their respective states," he said.The six-times MLA said that former assembly speaker Charles Pyngrope is likely to be TMC state president, while he, as the legislature party leader, will focus on taking on the government head-on, as well as expanding the party in other neighbouring states.The 12 TMC MLAs have left for Kolkata on Sunday to meet party chief Mamata Banerjee and other senior leaders to finalise the roles of Sangma and Pyngrope.Noting that his joining a new political party was long overdue, Sangma said that the 'lahe lahe' (slowly slowly in Assamese) attitude of Congress has resulted in an exodus of its leaders."It's always good to have a new party in the game as it generates new interests. Anyone aligning himself/herself with a political organisation has a purpose. The TMC leadership in the state is 'tight' with unanimous vision and responsibility," the two-time chief minister said."Politics is a tough job, and when you decide to be a politician, you assume upon yourself a responsibility that revolves around creating acceptability at all levels," he said.Exuding confidence that the people of Meghalaya will have no problem in accepting TMC, Sangma said that the party is not new in the state. Former Lok Sabha speaker and Chief Minister Conrad Sangma's father P A Sangma was once elected as a TMC MP from Tura constituency in western Meghalaya.Asked if the people of Meghalaya will accept TMC under the new dispensation, Sangma said, "I trust my people. I know them. My trust and confidence give me strength."Sangma, however, said that providing an alternative also means that a lot of hard work needs to be put in."There is no time to rest. The 2022 Meghalaya assembly polls and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections are very crucial," he said.Sangma said that the TMC is focussing on the need to implement the Inner Line Permit (ILP) in Meghalaya in the backdrop of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)."The demand for implementation of ILP in Meghalaya has become louder after CAA because there is an anticipated scenario that awaits to be unfolded," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-to-expand-political-base-across-northeast-for-2024-polls-mukul-sangma-101638174539111.html

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal Police to man Atal Tunnel at Rohtang as BRO heads for Shinku La||A year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened the strategic 9.02-km Atal Tunnel at Rohtang Pass, the defence ministry’s Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has asked the Himachal Pradesh government to take over its security as it prepares to move ahead to bore another tunnel at a height of 16,580 feet at Shinku La. Also read: Farm Laws Repeal Bill passed by Lok Sabha, Congress leaders not happyThe BRO has written to the government to upgrade security of the all-weather tunnel located at a height of 10,171 feet, connecting Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley. Earlier, the valley would be cut off for six winter months every year due to heavy snowfall at Rohtang. The state government has set up a high-level committee, comprising additional director general of police, State Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, SP Singh, Atal Tunnel chief engineer VK Singh, Lahaul and Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar, Kullu DC Ashutosh Garg, inspector general of police, intelligence, Daljeet Singh Thakur and State Disaster Management Committee director Sudesh Mokta to prepare a comprehensive plan for the security of the tunnel. “The plan, to be submitted within two months, will be designed to meet any exigency, whether blast, earthquake, fire or avalanche,” said a member of the committee, requesting anonymity. In 2020, state director general of police Sanjay Kundu had constituted a panel that had visited Jammu and Kashmir’s Jawahar Tunnel in Banihal and the Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Tunnel at Chenani-Nashri to study the security set-up adopted by J&K Police. The committee proposed multipurpose barriers at Solang, 14 km down the South Portal at Dhundhi, and at Telling near the North Portal in Sissu. Tunnel maintenance stays with BRO The BRO will, however, continue to maintain tunnel, while the security will be with Himachal Pradesh Police. The BRO will be digging a 4.25-km tunnel 3km before Shinku La between Lahaul valley and Ladakh’s Zanskar valley. Shinku La is 40km from Darcha, a village in Himachal’s Lahaul on the Manali-Leh highway. The BRO is building the Darcha-Shinku La-Padum-Nimu road as an alternative to connect Ladakh with Himachal Pradesh. This will be the third highway connecting Ladakh with the mainland after the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh and the Manali-Sarchu-Leh highways. The Manali-Padum-Nimu road or Darcha-Padum-Nimu road will become all-weather after the completion of the Shinku La tunnel. This will be the safest and shortest road to reach Leh. The Darcha-Padum-Nimu road has only one pass, Shinku La. Shinku La tunnel project report by Dec-end The detailed project report for the tunnel will be completed next month-end. The Rail India Technical and Economic Service Limited (RITES), that provides consultancy and technical services in infrastructure and transport projects across the country, has already conducted the feasibility survey. Atal Tunnel chief engineer VK Singh said that the tender for the construction of the Shinku La tunnel will be floated in April. “We want to execute the work on the tunnel as soon as possible,” he said. With China flexing its military might along Indian borders, the defence ministry is concentrating more on this new road as it will facilitate military movement even in winter. Otherwise, both Manali-Leh and Srinagar-Leh highways get blocked following heavy snowfall for six months a year. The defence ministry had earlier planned a 13.5-km tunnel under Shinku La, but the proposal was rejected in May. Instead, it gave a nod to the 4.25-km tunnel near Shinku La.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-police-to-man-atal-tunnel-at-rohtang-as-bro-heads-for-shinku-la-101638169346648.html

Taking a dig at infighting in the Congress, the MLA, who was addressing a rally in favour of Ludhiana north constituency in-charge Randhir Singh Sivia on Jassian Road on Sunday, said, “The Congress is split into two factions that are dancing to their own tunes.” Targeting former cabinet minister and Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey, Bains said that the voters had elected Pandey as MLA six times, but the north constituency still has no government college, no government hospital and the matter of Buddha Nullah is still not resolved.“With the elections round the corner, all parties are speaking out against the transport and sand mafia, issues which I have been taking up for years,” he said, adding that Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress leaders should disclose how much money they had made from the transport and sand business over the last 15 years. Bains also took on its former ally, the Aam Aadmi Party, alleging that theirs’ was a politics of contradiction. “The party leaders have come to Punjab ahead of the polls, but not a single penny has been paid for the water the Capital receives from Punjab.” He also said that the party was willing to form an alliance for the assembly elections. Woman alleging rape stopped outside venue The woman, who had lodged an FIR against Bains for raping her, staged a protest against the MLA at Jassian Road. However, cops stopped her from entering the venue. The woman alleged that the police were hand in glove with Bains, which is why she had to move court. “The court has issued non bailable warrants against Bains, and he is attending rallies,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lipmlabains-trains-guns-at-political-rivals-101638143604089.html

The complainant, Piyush Passi, 47, said his employer had sent him to collect a packet from a medical store in Basti Jodhewal. However, while he was returning, five armed men, who were riding two motorcycles, intercepted him, and threatened him with sharp-edged weapons. They asked him for the key of the scooter he was riding, and took the packet, which he had kept in the scooter. On being informed about the robbery, his employer, Balwinder Singh, alerted the police. Passi, who had been working at the electronic store near Mata Rani Chowk for four months, said she did not know that the packet contained cash.

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||NCRB data: Ludhiana saw 58% fatalities on urban roads during lockdown||Reversing the trend, more road mishap victims succumbed in urban areas of the district as compared to rural areas during the lockdown, as per National Crime Records Bureau data. Urban areas reported 58% deaths due to road mishaps in 2020, against 49% deaths in 2019. On the reason for this change in trend, National Road Safety Council member Dr Kamal Soi says, “There was almost no traffic on the roads for at least three months in 2020 due to the Covid-induced lockdown. However, once restrictions were relaxed, more traffic was seen on urban roads, which is one of the primary reasons for the lower death rate in rural areas.” In 2020, the mortality rate increased to 72.42% from 69.39% in 2019. In 2020, as many as 281 people had lost their lives in 388 road mishaps, while the previous year 365 people had succumbed in 526 road mishaps.Joint commissioner of police (city and traffic) J Elanchezhian said 10 accident-prone spots had been identified, and the traffic wing was working on increasing road safety in the areas with the help of the National Highway Authorities of India.Residential areas the deadliest In both rural, and urban areas, residential areas were found to be the deadliest, with rural areas reporting 30 deaths, and urban areas 85. Areas near school, colleges and other educational institutes in rural parts had been absolutely safe in 2019, but , in 2020, five people had lost their lives in road mishaps near schools and colleges. Meanwhile, in urban areas, nine fatalities were reported near educational institutions, which is lower than the 12 accidental deaths reported in 2019.In rural areas, 17 deaths were reported in industrial areas, three near religious places and three near recreational centres and cinema halls. Similarly, in urban areas, 12 people died while crossing roads on pedestrian crossings, three near religious places and eight near recreational places and cinemas and five near industrial areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ncrb-data-ludhiana-saw-58-fatalities-on-urban-roads-during-lockdown-101638140303607.html
29-11-2021||Delhi||NDMC nod to extend free water scheme to residential societies||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on Sunday approved the extension of the scheme to supply free water up to 20 kilolitres per month to residential societies under the aegis of the council.The Delhi government’s flagship scheme, under which 20,000 litres of water is provided free of cost, was launched in 2013. A consumer is charged the entire amount only if the monthly water consumption crosses the 20KL mark.Besides providing free water connections to residents of BK Dutt Colony, the council also approved layout plans for the redevelopment of Netaji Nagar and Sarojini Nagar on Sunday.As an MLA from New Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, an ex-officio member of the council, was part of the meeting.A government official said that several residential complexes under NDMC, such as East Kidwai Nagar and New Moti Bagh, have been facing problems in availing the benefit of the free water scheme as these societies were provided with a bulk water supply and the residents did not have any end-user water meters.Moreover, residents of BK Dutt Colony were deprived of the scheme because of the complexity of tracing water and sewerage connections under rows of houses, as the locality was originally established as a refugee colony with common toilets and utilities. “New water pipelines were laid out in the area in the last four years but a lot of residents still hadn’t taken connections due to ‘connection charges’. The council decided to waive the one-time charge of ₹7,500,” the official said.Kejriwal said that there was no point in putting together a policy under which connection charges were so high that they could not be borne by citizensIn the case of societies like East Kidwai Nagar, where residents use bulk water meters, water meters will now be installed near the outlets, the official added.The council also approved the proposal for mechanical sweeping around Connaught Place, Hanuman Mandir and Baba Kharak Singh Marg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ndmc-nod-to-extend-free-water-scheme-to-residential-societies-101638136128063.html

The announcement was made during an industry-trader meet organised by SAD here on Sunday, during which Sukhbir also released SAD-BSP alliance’s 13-point programme, promising to launch ‘Make your own policy’ scheme and ‘Build Punjab’ agency. Industrialists and traders from different parts of the state participated in the meet that lasted for around three hours. Promising a separate ministry for the development of the MSME sector, Sukhbir said ‘Make your own policy’ scheme will enable the business community to frame policies. “An advisory board comprising industrialists and traders will also be established and the focus will be to revive and encourage the existing industries of Punjabis,” he said. He also promised a 200-acre skill university in Ludhiana which will train professionals for motorcycle, cycle, hosiery and other industries in the region. Sukhbir announced a slew of other incentives, including 50% reduction in external development charges (EDC) and registry charges; ₹10-lakh insurance cover as well as pension scheme for small traders, and interest free loans and interest subsidies. He said the industry will not be shifted from Mixed Land Use areas in 2023 and the deadline in the master plan will be extended. Promising power at ₹5 per unit for the industry and traders, he said big industry as well as focal point associations will be allowed to establish their own solar power plants. “Special incentives will be given to the industrial sector for expansion,” he said. “Our purpose will be to end red-tape and rely on self declaration only. Trade and industry with a turnover of less than ₹25 lakh will not have to maintain books. Only a small lump sum amount will be charged from them,” he said. For the real estate sector, ‘Build Punjab’ agency will be established to regulate the functioning and issue all clearances within 45 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-unveils-13-point-programme-to-boost-industry-at-ludhiana-meet-101638134424737.html
29-11-2021||Chandigarh||All government claims to justify abrogation of Article 370 proved wrong: Omar Abdullah||All claims made by the BJP-led Central government to justify the abrogation of Article 370 proved to be wrong as Jammu and Kashmir still faces militancy, separatism, destruction and injustice, National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah said on Sunday.The former chief minister said militancy spread to even those areas, including summer capital Srinagar, which were declared militancy-free during his government’s tenure from 2009-15, with disillusioned local youths continuing to take up arms.Addressing a public rally at Doda bus stand, Abdullah said the claims of the Central government on ending militancy and separatism proved false as did its remarks that Article 370 created an obstacle for the outside investment and for the overall development of the J&K. Abdullah, who is currently on an eight-day tour of Chenab Valley region comprising Ramban, Doda and Kishtwar districts of Jammu province, said his party would continue its struggle in a peaceful manner to restore the pre-August 2019 status of Jammu and Kashmir. “All the claims of the government with regard to J&K to justify abrogation of Article 370 proved wrong. The reality is that J&K is faced with destruction, helplessness, unemployment, poverty and injustice after the August 2019 development,” he said.He said they are projecting that everyone in Jammu and Kashmir is happy and there is ‘mauja hi mauja’ (all is well) everywhere but “we have not seen this as the hearts of the people are weeping”. “They promised peace in Jammu and Kashmir but it is nowhere to be seen. During our rule (NC-Congress between 2009 and 2015), we removed security pickets from interior parts of Srinagar which were cleared of militancy and were also thinking of revoking the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).No accountability in J&K administration: Omar

The IMD has predicted a further drop in the temperature in the coming days across J&K.The Valley has been witnessing foggy conditions in the mornings for the past 13 days. Officials say foggy conditions are due to sub-zero temperatures and air pollution caused by increased traffic and the burning of stubble and tree foliage. The wintry conditions in the Valley set in much ahead of the beginning of the extreme harsh weather conditions which usually start around the third week of December. ‘Chillai Kalan’, the 40-day period of harsh winter in Kashmir, begins on December 21 every year. – With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmir-continues-to-reel-under-cold-spell-srinagar-records-02c-101638132803011.html
29-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Next chai in Sheesh Mahal||The imperial evening in the Palace of Mirrors is already strained to begin with. And then the rebel-courtesan gets more and more mutinous in her dance. She even picks up a knife from the fruit platter. Within moments, the smirking woman multiplies into a multitude of mirrored images. One Anarkali is now a thousand offending Anarkalis, infuriating Emperor Akbar to indescribable rage.This famously thrilling scene in the classic 1960 movie Mughal-e-Azam was filmed in a Mumbai film set in which the makers painstakingly recreated the legendary Sheesh Mahal of Lahore Fort. The wall, as in the original 17th century Sheesh Mahal, was made of thousands of decorative glass tiles, or the sheesh.A similar Sheesh Mahal, as in Lahore, also exists in Agra Fort. One historic Sheesh Mahal is in Delhi, too, in Shalimar Garden, where Aurangzeb was crowned as the sixth Mughal emperor. It is in ruins, with no trace of its original splendour. Then there is one more Sheesh Mahal in the capital, with a wall panelled with hundreds of small glass tiles. This so-named Sheesh Mahal is a little-known chaikhana, or teahouse, in Farash Khana. The atmospheric locality in Old Delhi is a labyrinth of congested by-lanes, each of which is a universe so self-contained with its many landmarks that one can perhaps spend a lifetime within its limits without yearning for the world outside.This afternoon only three customers are in the dimly lit teahouse. They all are backbenchers, withdrawn towards the wall embossed with multi-coloured glasses. Two of these men are sitting by a panel whose central motif appears to be the likeness of a flower. The glass petals in the middle are in deep pink, surrounded with glass leaves of silver, yellow and green. An artistically minded person might recall Vincent Van Gogh’s sunflowers. Indeed, if the penniless Dutch painter were to live in contemporary Old Delhi, he might have liked the ambience of this tea house and lingered here everyday (much like that barefoot painter MF Husain who favoured a tea house in Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti during the 1960s).Sheesh Mahal is managed by young Sajid whose grandfather, Mange Mian, had founded it 30 years ago. It is no accident that the sheeshas occupy a prominence in the tea house, he explains. “My family deals with sheeshe ka kaam (mirror work).” Minutes later, the friendly man gets busy making a cup of customised chai for a fussy customer who demands his tea to have “less sugar, less milk and no malai”, which is basically the antithesis of the chai idealised in Sheesh Mahal.The place serves daily from 4 am to 1 am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-next-chai-in-sheesh-mahal-101638132203642.html

Chauhan said the farmers also have to pay bank loans and for the input items for the next crop.So, it has become necessary that the government pays the pending dues at the earliest. “The anti-farmer policies of the Centre and state governments have adversely hit the agriculture sector in the country. On the one hand, the input cost has been rising, while on the other hand farmers are not even getting a reasonable price for their produce,” he said.He alleged that the APMC Act was openly violated in markets and commission agents and buyers were not paying farmers the actual price for their produce.He said instead of paying the farmers in cash, the HPMC also forces them to get unnecessary items for pending dues.If the government does not immediately clear the arrears of the apple growers, the KSS will mobilise the farmers and launch a stir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shimla-kisan-sangharsh-samiti-seeks-payment-for-apple-bought-under-market-intervention-scheme-101638132082802.html

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Parks turned into dump sites in ward 22 of Chandigarh||Like most urban areas, residents living in ward 22 of Chandigarh municipal corporation also have a plethora of complaints, including lack of cleanliness, choked sewers and inadequate parking space, but their pet peeve is parks being turned into dumping grounds. The ward, comprising Sectors 31, 32 and 33, has enough public parks but most of these are not well-maintained. Sector 31 was earlier part of ward 22 while Sector 32 was in ward 21 and Sector 33 was in ward 16. Sector 31 is largely maintained by the Indian Air Force. Though the sector has approximately 2,000 voters, MC has very little role in its maintenance. Residents of the other two sectors say councillors of their wards are mostly inaccessible and least concerned about the problems of the area.Jagdish Singh Sarpal, president, residents’ welfare association (RWA), Sector 33, says, “Our sector has at least four dirty spots. These areas were earmarked as parks or were vacant plots, but have turned into dumping grounds over the years. Sweepers too dump the garbage picked from roadside here. Residents add to the mounting garbage pile by discarding construction waste even even as the municipal corporation officials turn a blind eye to it.” He added that some people have even illegally encroached upon some areas in public parks, leading to inconvenience for residents.Paras Kumar Goyal, vice-president, RWA, Sector 32, says, “Though Sector 32 has enough facilities, it needs better maintenance. Door-to-door garbage collection in the area is irregular and garbage collectors sometimes skip going up to the first and second floors, due to which elderly residents face inconvenience. We want the next councillor to look into all these issues and also bring development projects.”Residents add that sewer lines also need cleaning, as most of these are choked. Green belts are in need of immediate pruning, and facilities such as public toilets and drinking water facilities also need upgrade.Ashwani Kumar Khanna, president, market welfare association, Sector 32, said, “The biggest issue being faced by people of ward number 22 is that of inadequate parking space. The markets have haphazard parking facilities due to which these remain jam-packed with vehicles. MC must bring multi-level parking so that the issue can be resolved. The new councillor must interact with the public so as to get an idea about what residents actually want.” Know your wardLocalities: Sector 31, 32 and 33 Reserved for womenVoters: 20,000Key Issues:• Choked sewers, poor sanitation and garbage dumped on roads• No parking space in markets• Public facilities like parks, toilets need regular maintenanceLocal voices:The ward has inadequate parking spaces, especially in markets. The MC must construct multi-level parking on vacant plots to ease the problem. Ashwani Kumar Khanna, president, market welfare association, Sector 32.Sector 33 has at least four ‘dirty spots’.

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala: Lack of parking, encroachments in markets leave residents a harried lot||Unavailability of parking facilities, congested alleys and encroachments in markets of the Ambala twin-towns have become a major problem for residents.The markets remain packed through the day with customers and tourists from across the region and scores of sellers in small markets around the city’s old cloth market and Cantonment’s Sadar Bazar have put their products on display at least six to seven feet outside their shops, leaving no space for pedestrian and vehicular movement. Vendors dealing in clothing and fashion accessories have even blocked a lane outside the bus stand in the city, due to which four-wheelers have to drive on the wrong side towards the railway station. Shopkeepers here want authorities to ban the entry of four-wheelers and take action against illegal encroachments that usually hamper the passage of emergency vehicles.Mithun Verma, Congress councillor, under whose jurisdiction some parts of the old cloth market fall, is working with MC employees to cover the drains in the market, also termed as Asia’s largest in terms of sellers dealing in clothing and related products. “We found it difficult to even measure open drains, due to encroachments. The commissioner has been apprised of the fact and we will explore other options,” he said.In Cantt, construction activities particularly on Nicholson and 12 Cross Roads have become a headache for pedestrians as well as merchants, in recent months. Ayushi Chaudhary, a resident of Defence Colony, said that it becomes almost impossible to walk down the crowded lanes and find a parking space for two-wheelers during evening hours. A multi-level parking facility worth ₹19 crore with a capacity of 300 four-wheelers on Cantt station road is underway, but has been delayed and the contractor has been served notice by the authorities. Sachin Gupta, additional deputy commissioner-cum-administrator, Sadar municipal council, said that the civic body has removed temporary encroachments outside shops in gud mandi, sabzi mandi, Gandhi market, motor market, Nicholson road etc and warned the shopkeepers in this regard two weeks back. “Due to these structures, pedestrians have to face a lot of inconvenience in all the markets. This time, the traders have been warned. Next time, their goods will be seized and appropriate action will be taken,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-lack-of-parking-encroachments-in-markets-leave-residents-a-harried-lot-101638131602719.html

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh government hospitals gear up to tackle Covid spike||With the daily Covid-19 cases beginning to show an upward trend in the tricity, government hospitals in Chandigarh are gearing up to tackle the situation. Besides reserving isolation wards and intensive care units for Covid-19 patients, hospitals have decided to scale up testing by screening all people visiting the out-patient departments (OPDs) of the hospitals.Looking at the Covid-19 surge, the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH) Sector 16, has already converted a 40-bed ward into an isolation centre for Covid patients. “At present, we have only reserved one ward for Covid-19 patients as the patient load has not yet increased. Besides, we have already reserved a few ventilator beds and oxygenated beds for the severe patients,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services (DHS), Chandigarh.The DHS has also ordered all heads of departments of GMSH-16 and allied dispensaries to ensure that all OPD patients are screened for Covid-19 even if they are asymptomatic and fully vaccinated. “Residents of Chandigarh should be screened through RT-PCR while those from other states should undergo rapid antigen tests. Also, asymptomatic patients from other states should be tested for both RT-PCR and rapid tests,” the order read.Meanwhile, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, has also ramped up facilities for Covid-19 patients. “Though the hospital admissions have not yet increased, we have already started reserving beds for patients after studying the figures. At present, we have reserved 51 beds, including ICU beds with ventilators, for Covid-19 patients at the hospital. Also, 121 beds are available at GMCH’s South Campus at Sector 48,” said Dr Sudhir Garg, medical superintendent of the hospital.He further added that a 14-bed paediatric ICU has already been established at GMCH-32, keeping in view of the possibility of an increase in pediatric cases.‘Patients with lung infection getting +ve, situation worrisome’Meanwhile, Dr GD Puri, dean (academics) and head of the Covid management panel, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said, “Over the last few weeks, the number of daily Covid cases have been fluctuating but in the last few days, an upward trend in cases has been seen. Earlier, patients with kidney, liver or heart problems were getting infected with Covid-19 but this time, patients with primary lung symptoms are getting admitted in the hospital. This is a worrisome situation.”“Also, the numbers of people, who are vaccinated against the disease and are getting infected, are increasing too. We are hoping that the severity of infection remains low in those people but for the last few days, severe patients are coming to PGIMER. At present, 22 out of 23 beds are occupied but we can accommodate 35-to 40 patients. Many more mild patients can also be accommodated. We have enough standby beds and ventilators and facilities will be scaled up as per the situation as more Covid reserved beds mean cutting on non-Covid facilities,” Dr Puri added.10 new infections in tricity, active cases rise to 133On Sunday, 10 more people tested positive for Covid-19, taking the daily tally in double digits again. Five cases each were reported from Chandigarh and Mohali while no new infection surfaced in Panchkula.Last Friday, the daily infection tally had risen to 26 in the tricity and on Saturday, only eight cases were reported.Meanwhile, no Covid-related fatality was reported in the tricity on Sunday. So far in November, Mohali has reported three fatalities while no death has been reported in Chandigarh and Panchkula. Tricity’s active cases tally rose to 133 on Sunday, with 54 patients still being infected in Chandigarh, 49 in Mohali, and 30 in Panchkula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-government-hospitals-gear-up-to-tackle-covid-spike-101638130942641.html

Like previous years, the gurdwara body members, who are in majority, owing allegiance to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday unanimously authorised party president Sukhbir Singh Badal to choose the entire team. This time too, Sukhbir held a closed-door meeting with SGPC members. Former SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar proposed to give Sukhbir all rights to choose the new team with all members present giving their nod. Incumbent president Jagir Kaur listed the “accomplishments” during her one-year tenure.An SGPC member said Sukhbir hailed Jagir Kaur’s tenure and expressed his desire to avail her services for the party in the upcoming assembly elections and rope her in the cabinet if the party forms government. Contenders for the top postApart from incumbent president Jagir Kaur, who has a long experience of managing the gurdwara body affairs, some other names are also doing rounds for the top post. Balbir Singh Ghunas, a scheduled caste (SC), is also being considered a frontrunner as the SC factor has become dominant in the poll-bound state with the elevation of Charanjit Singh Channi as chief minister after SAD announced to make deputy cm from the community if it forms the government in Punjab. A four-time MLA, Ghunas is head of Gurdwara Tap Asthan Baba Attar Singh at Ghunas village in Barnala district and this is not for the first time that his name is doing rounds for the top post. Besides, incumbent SGPC chief secretary (honorary) Harjinder Singh Dhami and former chief Kirpal Singh Badungar are also contenders. The general house of 191 members comprising 170 elected by Sikh voters, 15 co-opted and six sitting heads of Sikh temporal seats and Golden Temple head granthi assembles to elect the president and other office-bearers (general secretary, senior vice-president and junior vice-president) besides 11-member executive committee. Of these, nearly 15 members have died, while some resigned from the membership.The members either elect the office-bearers or executive unanimously or by voting through secret ballot papers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-annual-polls-today-members-authorise-sukhbir-badal-to-pick-new-team-101638130884128.html
29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Bridge courses needed to fill learning gaps amid pandemic: NISA research report||National Independent Schools Alliance (NISA) on Sunday released a research report, “National Level survey on Learning Loss in School Education during the Pandemic”, aimed at understanding the learning gaps suffered during the pandemic and finding ways to bridge them.The survey involved 1,502 students from urban, semi-urban and rural private schools across 17 states, being assessed for their foundational abilities. The major aspects being analysed in the survey, which also included a common web questionnaire, were students’ understanding abilities, reading and written skills of mother tongue and their grasp over English and mathematics Kulbhushan Sharma, president of the NISA, said, “We have been working for the accessibility and advocacy of quality education since 2010. To take it further, we assessed the learning loss among school students of Classes 3, 5 and 8 during the pandemic at a national level.”The final report, which was released in Chandigarh, arrived at a few significant findings on students’ abilities to overcome academic lapses. The report showed an overwhelming 85% of students exhibited good awareness of their present skill levels in languages and mathematics. In another major finding, almost half, 42.3%, of the total respondents reported undergoing stress, tension and anxiety.The survey also addressed the digital divide in schools in urban and rural parts of the country, finding that students from the latter category were unable to join online classes due to lack of internet access. Notably, almost all respondents, 98.6%, preferred offline classes. The final report pressed for a few teaching reforms, with special focus on remedial classes and innovative curriculum. “The gap needs to be filled. Government should consider if bridge courses can be a part of the curriculum, and other schools will follow. There has been a huge loss, which might not be visible now but will reflect when the students are in secondary or senior secondary,” the group’s national coordinator and one of the researchers, Thomas Antony said.“The survey’s findings would be of great assistance to the pedagogy of a classroom in suggesting measures to bridge learning gaps,” an official NISA statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bridge-courses-needed-to-fill-learning-gaps-amid-pandemic-nisa-research-report-101638130883078.html

There was one test centre in Chandigarh, four in Mohali and seven more within a 60-km radius.CAT is used for admissions into India’s top management institutes like IIMs and other MBA colleges. It tests students on mathematics, English and reasoning ability. The level of difficulty of sections and overall exam this year was on similar lines in the past with verbal being easy to moderate, DILR being the most difficult and quant was moderately difficult.Hirdesh Madan, co-founder of Hitbullseye, said, “The exam was smartly conducted in three slots with uniformity in style, subject areas and level of difficulty. This will reduce the pain of disparity in result declaration.”In the region, IIM Sirmaur and IIM Amritsar top the charts of most coveted colleges accepting CAT scores. The University Business School (UBS) of Panjab University is also one of the sought after colleges and its CAT cut-off is expected to be around 90 percentile.Diksim Gulati of Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh, said “The paper was on expected lines in terms of difficulty. My habit of taking mocks regularly and assuming different scenarios helped me cope with the changes and varied difficulty level”. Another student, Nikhil Gupta of DAV college, said, “I felt the overall exam was a bit lengthy even with less number of questions. I did well in the verbal section and I am hoping for higher accuracy in the other two to secure a good score”. The result for the test is expected to be declared in the second week of January. In the second phase, after the written test results are declared, students go through an essay and interview stage for final selection. Each IIM has its own criteria, but over the years, past academic record, work experience and graduation stream is gaining significance in the overall process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cat-7-000-students-appear-for-exam-in-chandigarh-tricity-101638130706693.html

State government’s projection says a drastic drop in cotton production due to the pest attack. Factory owners say they are facing financial losses as the units are working between 25-50% of the capacity while nearly 10 units are lying shut in Bathinda and Mansa.A leading cotton ginner from Malout in Muktsar Bhagwan Bansal said against the average minimum requirement of 150 bales or 750 quintals per day, meagre 200 quintal cotton is available for processing. “A cotton ginning unit operator has to pay about ₹10 lakh fixed electricity charges for the nine-month season from September 1 onwards. As the pest attack has severely hit crop production, we are unable to run factories. We have to pay fixed charges even when electricity is not used,” he said.“Punjab government was quick to grant compensation to affected cotton growers, the interest of ginners has been overlooked. The government is biased towards investors,” said Bansal, who led a delegation of ginners for a meeting with state agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha on Friday, demanding a relief package for the sector.Ashwani Kumar, who strengthened his cotton factory after shifting it from Bathinda city limits to Sangat town this year, said the sector is struggling for survival. “A factory employs about 125 workers with an estimated annual salary commitment of ₹25 lakh. A planned policy in the adjoining Rajasthan made it a major cotton-growing state in a decade producing over one crore quintals. It has incentivised entrepreneurs with zero market committee fees for cotton. Punjab still charges 1% fees with no incentive for ginners,” he said.For the current season, ginners were expecting 60 lakh quintal raw cotton after Punjab saw an increase of 25% area under cotton. As per Punjab Mandi Board data, different districts of south Malwa had recorded sales of 8.60 lakh quintals till November 27.Board authorities opine the production this year may be around 25 lakh quintals while the industry say cotton arrival may touch the 30-35 lakh quintal mark.Punjab Cotton Mills and Ginning Association president Suresh Bansal said owing to the negligent attitude of the state government, 76% of factories closed down since 2005. He blames the absence of a dedicated policy for agriculture and the industrial sector in Punjab.“Punjab had 335 ginning factories 16 years ago that came down to 82 in 2021. In 2005, factories were ginning 18 lakh bales or 90 lakh quintals in a season and in 2020-21 kharif season, Punjab produced 49 lakh quintals,” he said.“After irrigation system strengthened in over last decade, farmers of the semi-arid region of Malwa switched from the traditional cotton to less labour-intensive crop of non-basmati rice. Kotkapura town used to be a major purchase centre where 20-lakh quintal cotton was a regular feature 10-12 years ago. In 2020-21, the entire Faridkot district registered the arrival of mere 50,000 quintals. It shows the government has failed to set its priorities right,” said Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/unable-to-run-units-to-capacity-for-want-of-enough-raw-cotton-ginners-face-losses-in-punjab-101638130165815.html
29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali to get 20 MGD additional water supply from December 1||After a decade-long wait, Mohali is finally set to get an additional water supply of 20 MGD (million gallons a day) from Phase 5 and 6 of Kajauli waterworks, starting December 1. This will help the district bridge its demand-supply gap, which goes up to 12 MGD during peak summer months. Currently, against a demand of 32 MGD, Mohali gets 10 MGD from the older phases of Kajauli waterworks and 10 MGD from 75 tubewells, leaving a shortfall of 12 MGD. Mohali will be sharing around 5 MGD of the additional supply with Kharar and 1 MGD with Morinda. Chandigarh has already started getting its shareKajauli waterworks is located on the Bhakra mainline canal near Morinda in Rupnagar district, from where the water requirements of Chandigarh, Mohali and Chandimandir are met. Chandigarh has already started receiving an additional supply of 35 MGD from Phase 5 and 6. The additional supply for Mohali got delayed due to pending work at the water treatment plant coming up at Singhpura. The project has missed two deadlines: December 2020 and July 2021. Now, 400 workers are on job to meet the new deadline. What led to the delay for MohaliIn May 2012, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had started laying pipelines to supply additional water from Kajauli waterworks to Mohali and Chandigarh at a cost of ₹200 crore, half of which was borne by Chandigarh. However, the delay in Singhpura plant, being built by a Gujarat-based company for ₹100 crore, put a spanner in the project. One of the reasons was indecision: whether to go for 5 MGD capacity or 20 MGD. GMADA finally went with the second option. The pandemic, too, played a part by creating labour shortage. GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh said, “We will begin the trial on November 30 and start supplying additional water in the next two or three days. The construction work of the water treatment plant is in its final stages.” Mohali deputy mayor Kuljeet Singh Bedi, who had moved the high court over water shortage in Mohali, said, “We are finally getting additional water supply, but the previous dispensation, led by Shiromani Akali Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party, did not take any initiative to expedite the work. It was the Congress government, which made efforts on this front.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-to-get-20-mgd-additional-water-supply-from-december-1-101638130162425.html

After this I contested the senate election and was declared elected.” Manoj Kumar, who was also a candidate from the same constituency, had written to the chancellor questioning Ghai’s eligibility after he was declared elected to the senate. He later also approached the HC as well. “But now, contradicting its own previous orders, vice-chancellor of PU has declared my election to senate null and void,” reads the letter written to PU chancellor.The letter also states, “Such a self-contradiction in a serious matter needs to be thoroughly probed by an independent and competent authority after placing vice chancellor of PU under suspension to ensure an independent inquiry.” He has also decided to hold a protest outside the V-C’s office for 24 hours on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-senate-college-teacher-writes-to-chancellor-over-cancellation-of-election-seeks-probe-101638130112538.html
29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Over 6 years, 40 lakh litres of water went into dousing flames at Dadumajra dump site||The cleaning of the Dadumajra dumping ground is not only costing the city more than ₹33 crore, but in the last six years, approximately 40 lakh litres of water has been used to douse multiple fires at the site. As per a rough estimate, this quantity is enough to meet the daily water needs of approximately 16,000 persons. With the number and extent of fire increasing over the past three years, particularly after 2019, the usage of water for fire control has also increased. In 2019, 1.25 lakh litres was consumed to douse the flames at the Dadumajra dump site, while it increased to 8 lakh litres in 2020 and went up to around 18.25 lakh litres till September 2021. In 2019, the fire tenders made around 25 rounds to the Dadumajra dump site to douse fires. This increased to 90 rounds in 2020 and till September this year, 165 rounds have already been made. This March, a major fire broke out at the site that took around a week to be completely doused.RTI replyThe figures on water consumption in dousing the flames at Dadumajra site were accessed and collated by Amit Sharma, a management consultant and resident of Sector 27, under the Right to Information Act. Sharma is also pursuing a case in the Punjab and high court, seeking resolution of the dumping site problem.The water used by the fire department is mainly from tubewells, which can otherwise be used for drinking purposes, said a municipal corporation (MC) official requesting anonymity.“The dumping site is not only leaving a negative impact on the environment and people’s health, but is also leading to large quantities of precious drinking water being diverted towards firefighting operations at the site,” said Sharma.The average per capita consumption of water in the city stands at 245 lpcd (litres per capita per day). This year’s 18.25 lakh litre water (used for dousing fires at the site) is enough to fulfil 7,500 persons’ daily water needs. Similarly, the 40 lakh litres used over the last six years could have been used to meet around 16,000 persons’ daily water needs.Dumping site messMore than two lakh metric tonne (MT) is fresh waste on the site, and five lakh MT is the legacy waste of more than 20 years (till 2005).The daily generation of solid waste in the city is around 550-600 MT, but with less than 50 MT waste being processed every day at the Solid Waste Processing Plan, Sector 25, most of it is being dumped at the site unprocessed.Notably, around five lakh MT of legacy waste was to be “bio-mined and processed through scientific procedures”, and the entire land of about 25 acres was to be reclaimed by May this year. The deadline has been extended to June 2023. But of the total legacy waste of five lakh MT, only around two lakh MT (40%) has been removed as yet.The ₹33-crore legacy mining project was launched with much fanfare in December 2019 by the then UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in the presence of MP Kirron Kher.For expediting the legacy mining work, MC commissioner Anindita Mitra, said, “We have increased the belt from 3 to 4 to speed up the progress. Now, daily progress 1,100 tonne per day.”On stopping frequent fires at the dumping site, MC chief engineer NP Sharma, said, “The fires have taken place in the fresh waste dumping site. We are examining different permanent solutions to it, particularly, before the onset of summer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/over-6-years-40-lakh-litres-of-water-went-into-dousing-flames-at-dadumajra-dump-site-101638129982583.html

29-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh BJP chief, Congress vice-president have heated exchange over city’s development||Heated words were exchanged as BJP city president Arun Sood and Chandigarh Congress vice-president Pawan Sharma discussed residents’ issues and blamed each other’s parties at the “matdata puchta hai” event organised by Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) on Sunday, where members of over 100 RWAs were present.Sharma spoke about the declining state of cleanliness and how Chandigarh’s rank in the Swachh Survey has dropped every year. He also alleged that funds collected under cow cess have been used to pay the salaries of MC employees instead.Saying that he would resign if this is the case, Sood said, “A large gaushala is being constructed in Raipur Kalan village and the city hasn’t had a single accident due to stray cattle since 2016. When the MC was working under the Congress, the tender given for the Dadumajra garbage processing plant had no exit clause. By January, we will start tendering for a new plant with a 500-600 tonne capacity to manage waste.” Sood also spoke about how a committee with three non-official board members to resolve the need-based changes issue has been constitutedHowever, Sood left the event saying that he had other commitments and many of the RWA office bearers expressed surprise over him leaving early.Hardeep Singh, city head of the Shiromani Akali Dal, also confronted Sood over development in villages of the city. “Apart from Badheri and Buterla, no village has been developed. Only now, a few projects have been started as the elections are right around the corner.” Sharma added that many villages which came under the MC in 2018 have suffered due to lack of representation.Convener of Aam Aadmi Party in Chandigarh, Prem Garg, was also present and discussed the strategy for regularising need-based changes for Chandigarh Housing Board allottees and for coming up with community parkings. “After 15 years under the Congress and 10 years under the BJP, ask yourself if you are happy. We will use the Delhi model to solve your problems,” he said to the RWA office bearers present here.When residents raised questions about whether AAP will actually be able to provide free electricity and water, Sharma intervened and said it is not possible. “Even after the MC passes a bill, Chandigarh is governed by the administration and they have final say. Free water and electricity in a city like Chandigarh are not plausible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-bjp-chief-congress-vice-president-have-heated-exchange-over-city-s-developement-101638129144851.html

In connection with the crime, an FIR was lodged against 11 people of whom 8 were arrested by police on November 26.The 23-year-old suspect Pawan Saroj used to stalk the woman and would send her messages on WhatsApp. “The victims and the suspect belong to same caste and prima facie it appears that one sided love affair was the reason behind the gruesome killings and rape with the woman,” police officials said at a press conference here on Sunday. However, the police officials maintained that the suspect was still to be questioned about his accomplices and the sequence of events.Addressing media persons, ADG zone Prem Prakash said scanning of murdered 25-year-old woman’s WhatsApp messages revealed that she was receiving messages from a number that was traced to be of one Pawan Kumar Saroj, a labourer. As per the police, the last message that Pawan sent to the woman on November 21 was “I Love You” in reply to which the woman sent “I Hate You”. After his arrest, Pawan tried to mislead the police but later confessed that he had been sending messages to the woman since September 18 with his love proposals which were continuously rejected by her.While the woman had deleted her chats, the messages sent by Pawan were found in his mobile. Circumstantial evidence indicates that Pawan committed the murder with the help of his accomplices as he was enraged over being rejected by the woman. The forensic team found blood spots on Pawan’s shirt.“Moreover, Pawan stopped sending messages to the woman after her family and she were murdered. Now the police will take Pawan’s remand of Pawan to question him about his other accomplices involved in the murders and will take his DNA sample to match it with vaginal swab of the raped woman and bite marks found on her body. Investigations also revealed that Pawan lived at some distance from the house of the victims and was a regular visitor to a nearby brick kiln”, ADG added.He also said the arrested accused, who were named in the FIR, had denied their involvement in the murders. “The named accused were locked in a dispute with the brother of the murdered person and his family and no evidence has been found which could establish their involvement in the murders. However, their DNA samples will also be taken for matching them with the vaginal swab preserved for detailed examination,” the ADG said.The one who was raped was adult : ADGADG Prem Prakash said on the basis of educational documents of the murdered woman her date of birth was June, 1996 and it was now established that she was not a minor as alleged in the FIR lodged by the kin of the victims.The ADG said the suspect Pawan Kumar Saroj hails from Korsand village in Tharwai area of trans-Ganga and is illiterate. He used to take help of google voice to send messages to the woman. Call records of accused being scanned: SSPPrayagraj SSP Sarvshrestha Tripathi said Pawan has saved the number of the woman in his mobile as Gauri Ma’am and despite being illiterate, he can identify alphabets in his mobile. Some injury marks have also been found on his body about which he failed to give any satisfactory answers.“Further investigations in the case are underway and soon names of other culprits in the case will also come to light. The post-mortem examination report has established that the woman was raped but no evidence of sexual assault with her mother has been found. Call records of Pawan and other persons are being scanned for getting clues,” the SSP added.Earlier, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra along with the delegations of other political parties visited the kin of victims and assured all possible help to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-police-arrest-suspect-claim-cracking-murders-of-four-of-a-family-101638128604200.html

It is not just tomato, prices of other veggies have also doubled this month. “The rates of vegetables have almost doubled during the last one month and there is no possibility of getting reduced. We expect the government to slash the fuel prices and ensure action against those indulging in hoarding of potatoes, garlic, onions etc.,” said Meera Yadav, a housewife and resident of Alambagh. According to Tinku Sonkar, one of the leading stockiests at Naveen Galla Mandi, the price of tomato has gone up from ₹35 to ₹80 per kg in the city while the price of onion has also increased to ₹40 from ₹25 previously. He added, “Potatoe is being sold at ₹30 per kg which was selling at ₹20 per kg a month back. Capsicum is being sold at ₹130 per kg in the city, which was only ₹65 per kg a month ago.” “It seems prices of potatoes and onions are likely to hold on till January because of higher demand due to the marriage season, followed by festivals including Christmas and New Year. The demand is more than supply and moreover, weather will be changing. There will be fog and smog so the transportation of edible items will be hit,” Sonkar added. “Other reasons behind price rise are increase in rates of fuel and hoarding by the big suppliers,” said Sanjay Gupta, president of Uttar Pradesh Udyog Vyapar Mandal. “The increased transportation costs due to high fuel prices have pushed the prices of vegetables up in the city. That’s why the prices of vegetables transported from other cities have almost doubled this month,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vegetable-prices-in-lucknow-soar-due-to-high-fuel-rates-hoarding-101638127822203.html

On the basis of this interaction, the committees will recommend possible ways of economic betterment of such families in the next 27 days.“It was noticed that economically weaker people are unable to avail benefits of government schemes for multiple reasons. In the first phase of the campaign, we will reach out to 1.5 lakh families and identify how to increase their income,” Khattar said in a news conference here, adding that small entrepreneurs will be promoted through this initiative.“The Antyodaya Gram Utthan Melas will be held across state from November 29 to December 25. Initial target of the government is to increase annual income of these families up to ₹1 lakh and later to ₹1.80 lakh per annum,” Khattar said.“Banks sanction loans to start small businesses under the Pradhan Mantri Start-up Yojana. On the same lines, in Haryana, economically weaker families’ annual income will be raised through the Mukhyamantri Antyodaya Parivar Utthan Yojana,” the CM added.He said the aim is to financially strengthen families standing last in the queue. He said 42 government schemes have been identified to increase income of such families. Preference will be given to the Scheduled Caste, Backward Class, women, and physically disabled persons.He said skills in computers, driving and embroidery, stitching, etc have been included in self-employment, besides business in industrial and commercial sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy farming.‘Omicron has not surfaced in Haryana so far’Meanwhile, Khattar said “hope for the best and be prepared for the worst” has been the strategy of his government in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.Responding to a question about steps the state government plans to take amid concerns of new Covid variant, Omicron, Khattar said so far no such variant has surfaced or is detected in Haryana.“The existing restrictions,” he said, “will continue and there is no plan to further relax restrictions on gathering, etc. The deputy commissioners have been directed to take precautions while giving permission to organise local fairs.”“I personally observe the Covid data regularly and take necessary steps as per the emerging situation,” Khattar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-cm-kicks-off-antyodaya-parivaar-policy-to-lift-annual-income-of-over-3-lakh-bpl-families-101638126922355.html
29-11-2021||Chandigarh||32 farm unions from Punjab to meet at Singhu border today||As many as 32 farmers’ organisations from Punjab are set to meet on Monday at Singhu border to take a call on their future course of actions after the Union cabinet decided to repeal three farm laws which were bought in last year.The winter session of the Parliament will start from Monday and the BJP government is likely to repeal these laws through parliamentary procedure.BKU (Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill said 32 farm unions from Punjab will meet at Singhu border on Monday to decide the future course of action as per the discussion on repealing the farm laws and bringing in law to ensure MSP in the Parliament.“We are expecting that the Centre will repeal these farm laws during the session and will give a guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) by forming a committee in a time-bound manner,” he said.“If the government accepts our demands of amending the Electricity Act, compensation to deceased farmers’ families and job to their next of kin, revocation of FIRs registered during the agitation, and strict action against the Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra, we welcome the Centre’s decision to repeal the farm laws and decriminalise stubble burning,” he added.Butta Singh said they will inform the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) about their decision in the December 4 meeting.“If the government accepts our demands, we will go back to our homes. After that, we will not protest or canvas against the BJP in the upcoming assembly elections,” he added.Centre shying from holding dialogue with SKM: Farm leadersSKM leader Inderjeet Singh accused the Union government of not holding meetings with farm leaders to end the deadlock.“The Centre has taken the unilateral decision of repealing the three farm laws and decriminalising stubble burning. The government is shying from holding meetings with farm leaders. We will continue our protest till our six demands are met,” he said.“The government should give a legal guarantee on the MSP by following the Swaminathan Commission and will not accept the formation of a committee on the MSP. The agitation will be called off after the Union government holds a meeting with SKM leaders and accepts our demands,” Singh added.“PM Modi should call us for a dialogue and accept our demands as a goodwill gesture to the farming community. The government should share their plans about how many crops will be purchased at MSP and how many new mandis will be formed,” he said.Interacting with the media in Bhiwani, Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal said the state government is procuring crops on MSP but it’s impossible to give a legal guarantee on it.“The government has to invest a lot in carrying out developmental projects and it is not feasible to give a legal guarantee on MSP,” Dalal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/32-farm-unions-from-punjab-to-meet-at-singhu-border-today-101638126742298.html

29-11-2021||Pune||Pune NGO saves boy from being given away in superstitious ritual||PUNE: The Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, a non-governmental organisation, previously run by Dr Narendra Dabholkar, and the Pune rural police stopped a ceremony of ‘genmal’ in which children are given away to a group of wandering folk artists in Baramati, Pune district on Sunday. The ‘giving away’ ceremony is performed after marrying the child to a woman symbolic of a goddess. The 11-year-old boy who was going to be subjected to the ceremony was born after the parents had made a virtual promise (called “navas” in Marathi) to the gods to give up their child if and after it was born, said officials. “The ceremony is similar to the Devdasi concept where little girls are given up. Because we knew about the Devdasi concept, we were alerted when we received an invitation to a child’s wedding on WhatsApp. We informed the local police and Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of Pune rural police, directed the local police to provide us help,” said Nandidi Jadhav, head of Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti Pune unit who spearheaded the operation. The child’s father invited 400 people and had taken a loan to organise a feast. He had planned to give his child to a wandering folk artists’ group from Gunawadi village in the fear of inviting the scorn of the goddess, according to the NGO. “We spoke to the person (guru) who had suggested this ritual in front of the parents. But when he realised that other people were involved, he did a U-turn and said that he did not advise anything of this sort. We contacted the Child Welfare Committee too but realised that the parents are capable and had simply been misled. So, we did not register a case and let the matter settle down,” said police inspector Sunil Mahadik of Baramati taluka police station. The man switched off his phone when he realised that the police were involved. The parents who were taken aback when he refused to own up to his actions have assured the NGO and the police that the child will be admitted to a school for primary education, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-ngo-saves-boy-from-being-given-away-in-superstitious-ritual-101638126202075.html

29-11-2021||Pune||Narrow access road, small entry gate makes boarding at Hadapsar railway station a nightmare||PUNE Passengers at the Hadapsar railway station on Sunday had a harrowing time boarding a tri-weekly train to Hyderabad due to traffic congestion outside Hadapsar railway station. Pune resident Kiran Pisal and his family almost missed the train, Passengers said that it is a nightmare to reach the station . This is mainly due to a narrow approach road outside the main gate of the station, and the rush of vehicles causing traffic congestion. According to passengers, the main station gate is too small and long queues add to their woes. “I had to board the train at 3.30 pm and we reached the station in auto at 3.15 pm. It took us 20 minutes to look for the station. The traffic congestion added to our troubles and we literally had to sprint to platform No.3 to bord the train. The railways and PMC should come up with a solution to resolve this issue as passengers have to suffer a lot,” said Pisal. The Hadapsar (Pune) to Hyderabad (train no. 07013) is scheduled for departure on every Sunday, Tuesday and Friday at 3.30 pm. While the same train returns to Hadapsar on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. Passengers start arriving at 2.30 pm or even earlier as they have trouble locating the station which is located quite inside from the main Mundhwa road. The auto stand outside the station and the railway quarters makes it impossible for commuters to navigate. Another passenger Gaurav Kalantri said, “There is complete mismanagement at the Hadapsar railway station. Proper signage boards should be installed to give direction to passengers. The Hyderabad train departs from platform No. 3 which should be brought to platform No. 1 which is just next to the main entrance gate and it would be easier for passengers to board the train.” Talking about the issue the Pune divisional railway manager Renu Sharma said, “The development work of the Hadapsar railway station is currently underway. We are aware of the passengers’ issue with regards to traffic congestion while entering the station, and this will be resolved. More passenger amenities will come up at the station as more train operations will start from here in next six months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/narrow-access-road-small-entry-gate-makes-boarding-at-hadapsar-railway-station-a-nightmare-101638125961979.html
29-11-2021||Pune||Family planning in Pune: No male sterilisation, but 43.3% of women surveyed underwent procedure||According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), in Pune district, male sterilisation accounted for 0% of the total family planning methods used while female sterilisation accounted for 43.3% of the total family planning methods used in 2019-20, which brings to the fore the disproportionate burden on women vis-à-vis men when it comes to sterilisation. Although male sterilisation is much safer and quicker than female sterilisation, the wrong perceptions have often pushed the responsibility on women. Earlier in 2015-16, female sterilisation accounted for 55.5% of the total family planning methods used.The first phase of the fifth round of the NFHS was carried out between June 2019 and January 2020, and the results were released in December 2020. A few days ago, centres released a detailed analysis of the key results from the second phase carried out between January 2020 and April 2021.The stigma associated with male sterilisation that it could lead to physical weakness is the main reason why men do not come forward, said Dr Kalapana Apta, general secretary of the family planning association (FPA). “The disproportionate burden on women to undergo sterilisation is forced at times as men fail to take the responsibility. After going through the biological process of bearing the child in her womb for months, the woman is still forced to undergo the operation because the man simply refuses to share the responsibility of family planning.”Avlokita Mane, president of the Pune branch of the FPA, said, “In the past six months, we have carried out about 18 vasectomies. However, this is after the massive health campaigns that we conducted over the months in which we also convinced people to undergo non-scalpel vasectomies that are carried out in under four minutes. By contrast, we have had women walking nine miles to undergo the operation as men do not prioritise this and so, women have to undergo the operation. However, we have also had men who were willing to undergo the operation but could not undertake it because of their other ailments like hypertension or even urinary tract infection which renders them unfit to undergo the operation. Sometimes we even end up convincing the family to have the man undergo the operation because the woman thinks this might make the man, who is the sole breadwinner of the family, weak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/family-planning-in-pune-no-male-sterilisation-but-43-3-of-women-surveyed-underwent-procedure-101638125723086.html

RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) said that they have generated an email (dtpenfoc@gmail.com) which is being shared with the public through which all stakeholders can share information about the violations and lodge complaints in their respective areas. “The complaints can be lodged and action would be taken on a priority basis. But it must be ensured that this should not become a tool for harassing residents. If complaints are lodged with ulterior motives, then action would be taken against such complainants as well,” he said. The DTCP officials also said that complaints should be lodged only with regard to buildings, which have been recently constructed and issued occupancy certificates. “It has come across that in newly constructed buildings where OCs have been issued, the owners are violating norms blatantly and this is the reason that five teams were constituted recently to conduct inspections. These acts will not be condoned,” said Bhath. The officials said that in the last two weeks alone they have cancelled around 50 OCs for building plan violations. In a related move, the department on Saturday also decided that information regarding OCs, building plans and structures would be given only to those persons, who are authorised by the owners. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement, said that department is taking action against property owners as they are still engaged in making rooms in stilts, covering cutouts and similar other violations. “There is need to follow the norms, else OCs will be cancelled,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-dtcp-to-involve-rwas-to-check-building-plan-pollution-violations-101638125481948.html

Pune parents noted that the government should rethink the decision for the safety of the children.Prashant Khande, National President, All India Parents, Students and Teachers Association (AIPSTA), said that the transmissibility of the new variant is faster and so the government should wait at least for two months before reopening schools.“Younger students from Classes 1 to 4 should not be given permission to attend offline classes. Other classes can be given permission with 20 to 30 per cent attendance. Anyways, this academic year will be over in just three months and so, the education department should focus on the upcoming academic year. Students’ lives should not be risked by reopening of schools. Moreover, students are not vaccinated. We should prepare for this Covid wave,” said Khande. Rajendra Singh, president of the Independent English Schools Association (IESA), said that approvals by the task force to reopen schools came after a detailed analysis of the Covid situation right now.“In my opinion the classes should restart in hybrid mode, that is offline and online for Class 5 onwards. However, Covid protocols are important and should be followed. As private schools we will be taking utmost care to ensure the safety of our students,” said Singh.He added that private schools are focused on the health, safety and protection of the children.“We can’t take chances regarding the education of the students as it is the future of this country. Sooner or later we have to live with this virus and figure out a way wherein children receive education and are safe as well,” said Singh.Medha Sinnarkar, principal, Laxmanrao Apte Prashala said that the government should wait a while before reopening schools. “School for Classes 8 to 12 has reopened. Parents understand that offline education has a deeper impact on the children, but at the same time they are scared about safety. With this new variant, parents will be more scared to send the child to school. Hence, the decision should be delayed,” said Sinnarkar.She pointed out that this season has other viral infections as well. “As children have low immunity, they catch the flu. But, it can also be Covid. Moreover, students are not vaccinated. Offline education is important, but safety of students has a higher priority,” said Sinnarkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/omicron-covid-variant-has-principals-worried-about-pune-schools-reopening-for-all-classes-101638125425738.html

However, due to the threat of the new variant of corona virus, this decision might be reviewed,” he said. The offline sale of tickets at the monuments was discouraged to minimize assembling of visitors in the time of pandemic. However, as many people complained that they were unable to get online tickets, offline tickets were re-introduced, at least at the Taj Mahal. Despite the fears of a third wave of Covid -19 and the new Delta variant, the inflow of tourists at Taj Mahal continues to grow this winter. The number multiplies manifold during the weekends.

The police said investigations are underway to arrest the suspect, the DCP said.While crimes against women in Delhi declined by 24.65% in 2020 as compared to 2019, possibly on account of the Covid-19 pandemic that kept people mostly indoors last year, the national capital still topped the Union Territories (UTs) in the number of rapes reported, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data released in September this year.Delhi accounted for nearly 40 per cent of all rape cases and almost 25 per cent murder cases among 19 metropolitan cities in India in 2020, according to latest NCRB data.During 2020, India reported a total of 2,533 cases of rape across the metropolitan cities, with Delhi accounting for the maximum 967 (38 per cent) cases followed by 409 in Jaipur (16 per cent), 322 in Mumbai (12 per cent), the NCRB data showed.

After the recent incident, more shopkeepers are coming up with complaints and the matter seems to be serious, police officials said. Police on Saturday registered a case of extortion against 15 people at Sector 53 police station. Police said there are small eateries and shops in the sector whose owners are being forced to pay anything between ₹2,000 and ₹6,000 a month to some local goons and those who denied were assaulted and threatened for life. Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police, said that police have launched a probe into the racket. Police arrested suspect Sitam on Saturday in connection with the assault case. “We have taken the suspect in police custody and are questioning him regarding his extortion business. He was running an extortion racket,” Balhara said. Balhara said he has formed several teams that are visiting Sector 56 and are questioning the shopkeepers and cart owners if they are also paying protection money to goons. Police said there are no CCTV cameras installed in the Banjara market as the shopkeepers have encroached upon the land owned by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). Police said the 25-acre plot, where the market is operating, is earmarked for the construction of a college, a bus stand and group housing societies, among others.The shops, most of which sell furniture and handicrafts, have come up illegally over the past 15 years in the area and despite repeated notices by the authority, the owners are not vacating the land, said police. Asha Rani, wife of the victim who was assaulted on Friday night, said that the goons extort money from all the shopkeepers. “There have been several incidents where these goons have assaulted the shopkeepers who refused to pay them. Earlier no one complained to police fearing for their life. But now, some shopkeepers, with the help of visitors and buyers, are approaching police,” she said.  When asked about the encroachment, an HSVP official seeking anonymity said, “The authority has already started an anti-encroachment drive across the city. Action will also be taken in Sector 56.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-police-probe-extortion-racket-at-banjara-market-101638124941872.html

If you love the life of your family, stay away from politics and Kashmir issue,” the second email allegedly said.Gambhir won at the East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 general elections, defeating Congress candidate Arvinder Singh Lovely by over 390,000 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-gautam-gambhir-gets-another-threat-email-third-this-week-101638124821724.html
29-11-2021||Gurugram||12 night shelters in Gurugram to become operational from Dec 1||As winter has set in, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Sunday decided to make 12 night shelters operational from December 1. Each night shelter will open from 9pm to 10 am, and will have provisions of night-time meals, drinking water, mobile toilets, mattresses, quilts, and heaters, among other such amenities, MCG officials said.Apart from five permanent night shelters at Kanhai community centre, Sheetla Mata Mandir, Bhim Nagar, Kadipur, and Badshahpur, the civic body has decided to install seven portable cabins at Sohna Chowk, Railway Station, Bus Stand Chowk, Basai Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Iffco Chowk, and Vatika Chowk. These night shelters can together accommodate around 600 people, the officials said.Each portable cabin measures 10 feet in height and 28 feet in width and costs around ₹3 lakh. It has a capacity of around 10-12 people while each permanent night shelter can accommodate a minimum of 100 people, the officials said.“We are in the process of tying up with local NGOs to serve meals during the night to those who avail of the facility. We have also procured a mobile ambulance for the purpose. A team of doctors will travel to different night shelters periodically and carry out a health check-up of those seeking shelter,” said Devinder Kumar, zonal taxation officer who has an additional charge of city project officer, MCG.Kumar further said that each shelter will also have a caretaker. “The caretakers will be at the shelters throughout the time they are in operation. They will have the responsibility to alert us of any habitants that are ill so that the doctors can assess them or take them to the nearest hospital if required. In addition, if any woman wants to take shelter at a portable cabin, the MCG will take her to the nearest permanent night shelter where separate rooms have been kept for females,” said Kumar.Till early 2016, the city had only two permanent night shelters at the Kanhai community centre and Bhim Nagar which earlier operated as a dog shelter. At that time, six defunct Haryana roadways buses were converted into temporary night shelters. In late 2016, the MCG introduced portable night shelters, and over the next four years, three more permanent night shelters were opened across the city.Despite opening next week, MCG officials only expect occupancy at the night shelters in the last week of December. “It is only during peak winter, in late December and early January, do the night shelters have any significant occupancy. Otherwise, the cumulative occupancy across all 12 night shelters stays in two digits. Even during peak winter, the occupancy remains at 40-60% of the total capacity. We are planning to make arrangements accordingly,” said another senior MCG official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/12-night-shelters-in-gurugram-to-become-operational-from-dec-1-101638124701666.html
29-11-2021||Lucknow||UP govt fast tracks Bundelkhand Expressway project||Lucknow: With the state government fast-tracking the 296-km long Bundelkhand expressway project that traverses through seven districts, it is likely to be the next mega project to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon. The Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) claims that around 80 per cent of the project has been completed. Awanish Awasthi, CEO, UPEIDA, on Sunday, carried out aerial and on-the-spot inspection of the Bundelkhand expressway project. Officials of the district administration of respective districts and UPEIDA were also present. “The Bundelkhand expressway project is in the last stage of completion. Around 80 percent of the construction work has been completed. The project will be inaugurated soon,” said Durgesh Upadhyay, UPEIDA spokesperson. According to government sources, the state government has accorded top priority to completing the Bundelkhand Expressway project and getting it inaugurated by PM Modi before dates for Uttar Pradesh assembly polls are announced. The UPEIDA CEO is personally monitoring progress of the project and is seeking daily updates. The Bundelkhand Expressway has its origin at Bharatkoop in Chitrakoot district. It merges with the Agra– Lucknow Expressway at Kudrail village in Etawah district and traverses through Chitrakoot, Banda, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Jalaun, Auraiya and Etawah. This expressway would provide faster connectivity with Agra, National Capital Region (NCR), Delhi. Recently, PM Modi had inaugurated the 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway. It starts from Chandsarai village in Lucknow district and ends at Haidaria village on National Highway number 31, 18 kilometres east of the Uttar Pradesh-Bihar border. The key feature of the expressway is the 3.2 km long airstrip to enable landing and take-off of Indian Air Force fighter planes in case of emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-fast-tracks-bundelkhand-expressway-project-101638124641667.html
29-11-2021||Delhi||Annual winter bird survey: 150 birders record sightings across Capital||With binoculars around their necks and cameras in hand, several birders set out across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) on Sunday morning to record the number of winter bird species in the city as part of the annual ‘Delhi Winter Bird Count’.Over 150 birders in 20 teams went to birding hot spots such as Sultanpur, Mangar Bani, Bhondsi, Sanjay Van and the Yamuna floodplains, to record rare sightings, including those of the Eurasian griffon vulture, great bittern, Marshall’s iora and the white-bellied drongo.Birders said all sightings made from the count this year will be compiled over the coming week, and the results are expected in three-four days. Birder Kanwar B Singh, who led one of the teams to Bhondsi and the Najafgarh jheel, said the region from Chandu-Budhera wetlands up to neighbouring Najafgarh canal is an important birding habitat. “The key sightings included greylag goose, northern pintail, common pochard, northern shoveler, gadwall and Eurasian coot... among the rare sightings was a great bittern, a bird not commonly found in the region. Among the raptors, the greater spotted eagle, imperial eagle, osprey, hen harrier, marsh harrier and the booted eagle are interesting sightings,” said Singh, adding that teams set out across the Yamuna floodplains from Wazirabad to Okhla; wetlands in Noida and Greater Noida like Surajpur and Dhanauri; the Aravalli belt of Mangar and Bhondsi; parks like Sanjay Van and the Sultanpur sanctuary; and wetlands in Jhajjar.Pankaj Gupta, another birder who took part in the count, said all the sightings are recorded on the e-Bird platform. “If we doubt a relatively rare sighting, we try to submit multiple shots so that birders can discuss among themselves and identify the bird.” he said.Jaswinder Waraich, who headed out to the Sultanpur national park and its outskirts, said most migratory birds have arrived in fairly decent numbers so far this year. “The great crested grebe, hen harrier, imperial eagle and water pipit were some of the rarer sightings,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/annual-winter-bird-survey-150-birders-record-sightings-across-capital-101638124581739.html
29-11-2021||Delhi||Key skills: Typewriter finds its place despite digital onslaught||New Delhi: It is Friday afternoon and inside a small, dimly lit room in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar, a group of young men and women are hunched over old Remington typewriters, practising touch typing--- the skill of fast typing without looking at keys. The only sound one can hear inside is the clickety clack, and the ding as the ribbon reaches its one end and starts on the other.Their instructor, Ashok Ahuja, is teaching a new batch of students how to position their fingers correctly on the middle line of the keys and apply the right pressure. Ahuja, whose family has been running Ashoka Typing College for the past four decades, says while business dwindled over the years, he still has many students wanting to be trained only on the manual typewriters.“They believe that typewriting can be best learnt on typewriters, and not on computer keyboards. There is a finger for each key and you tend to forget that while typing on a flat computer keyboard, and consequently your speed and accuracy suffers,” says Ahuja whose institute offers 45-days to 3- months typewriting courses comprising what he calls well-structured lessons for ₹500 a month.Delhi has many other typewriting institutes, where hundreds of aspirants for various government jobs requiring a typing speed test are trained on old Remingtons and Godrej typewriters, even as laptops and touch screens hold sway. Several southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, which still allow typewriting tests on manual typewriters for various government positions, have thousands of typing training institutes. Many of them get their machines from dealers in Delhi, which restore and sell old typewriters.Ahuja says manual typewriters are perfect for learning the art and science of touch typewriting, and his students could not agree more.“On the flat keyboard of a computer, it is difficult to learn the movement of the fingers on the keys. Once you have learnt it on the manual typewriters, typing on a computer keyboard is child’s play. But learning to type on manual typewriters is like learning to play a musical instrument. It is hard work,” says Manisha Meena, a constable in Delhi police who is aspiring for a typist’s job in the Delhi high court as she tries to type, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”— a beginner’s typing sentence that contains all the alphabets in the English language.“ When I started two days ago, my fingers pained and I thought of not returning to the class ever. But now I love this Remington,” says Meena.Sitting next to her in the class is Anjali Rawat, 24, who is in the institute to increase her speed and accuracy of typing. “My current speed is 25 words per minute, and I want to make it at least 40 words per minute, and I believe I can do so only on a manual typewriter. Unlike a computer, a manual typewriter allows you to be focused, and you think twice before you type a word,” says Rawat.The Ashoka Typing College was started by Ahuja’s father and it had over 200 students in the 1990s. Today, the institute has about 40 students. “Before the pandemic, a lot of parents sent their small children to learn typing on manual typewriters during their summer vacation,” says Ahuja.Until the 1990s, Delhi had over 500 typewriting and stenography institutes, the biggest of them being Pitman Shorthand College in Karol Bagh, which had over 150 students working on typewriters at any given time. In fact, Delhi even had a federation of typewriting and stenographers institutes.Rajesh Palta, who runs Universal Typewriter Company at Asaf Ali Road in central Delhi, says they supply old, restored typewriters to institutes across the country. “A lot of these institutes bought old computers from us. We bought old typewriters from various government departments at auctions. Even today we supply about 30 old restored typewriters every month to typing institutes across the country. Most of our orders come from south India,” Palta says. The company was set up in 1937 by Palta’s father.Asaf Ali Road and the area around it used to be the hub of typewriter dealers. Many of them such as Allied Type Writers, Shimla Typewriters, Punjab Type Writers, Associated Typewriters, International Typewriters, have shut shop in the last fifteen years.The shelves of Palta’s shop have several restored vintage typewriters of brands such as Remington, Godrej, Smith Corona, Halda, Olympia, and Hermes. Outside, half a dozen typewriters are ready to be shipped to a typewriting training institute in Tamil Nadu.Palta, who has a vast knowledge of the history of typewriters, says that Remington was the first foreign company to assemble typewriters in India in 1950, and Godrej and Boyce, was the first Indian company to make a typewriter in 1955. In the late 1980s, India produced about 200,000 typewriters a year. Godrej, which once advertised its typewriter as a durable machine that “makes a good secretary a great one”, stopped producing typewriters in 2009.Palta gets nostalgic as he talks about the social and economic history of typewriters, which he says were instrumental in bringing women to the workforce. “ In the 1960s, thousands of women found employment as typists in cities. Those were the days when people made a beeline at typewriting institutes to learn typing. Many considered the skill of typing a key to success in life,” says Palta.Rajesh Gupta, 69, who runs one of the city’s oldest typewriting training institutes in East Of Kailash, still gets many such students. The institute was started by his father in 1955 at Panchkuian Road, and later shifted to Karol Bagh and then in the 1970s to its current location. Known as Rajesh Gupta Shorthand Institute, today it is one of the most sought-after stenography and typewriting training Institutes in the city, where nine typewriters stay busy throughout the day.“A lot of my students are those who cannot afford a computer, but then there are also lawyers, doctors and other professionals who believe that good typing speed is a key skill for their personal and professional growth. They want to learn it on a manual typewriter,” says Gupta.So what is the most important lesson he gives to his wards? “I focus a lot on typing ergonomics. I tell them to keep their posture straight and fingers should be vertical as they press the keys. There is a direct relationship between your posture and the mistakes you make while typing,” says Gupta, who charges ₹1,000 a month. One of his students Sweta Dogra, 27, says though she has a computer at home, she chose to learn typing on a typewriter. “Since there is no word processor or autocorrect on a typewriter, I have drastically improved my spellings by typing on a manual typewriter. Besides, there is no greater joy than seeing a hard copy being produced instantly as you write on a typewriter,” she says.SK Bansal who runs Anand Type Shorthand & Key Punching College, in Karol Bagh, which has over 50 typing students, agrees with Dogra’s assessment. “Computers can make you intellectually lazy thanks to auto-correction and cut and paste. But, no one wants to use correction fluid on a page typed on a manual typewriter, which exercises both your fingers and mind,” says Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/key-skills-typewriter-finds-its-place-despite-digital-onslaught-101638124463286.html
29-11-2021||Gurugram||Faridabad: Nigerian among four arrested for duping people online||The Faridabad police on Saturday arrested four persons, including a foreign national, for allegedly duping people after befriending them on social networking sites. Police said that the suspects were active in Delhi-NCR for the last one year and at least 50 cases were registered against the gang. The suspects were identified as Chinonso Roy Akata of Nigeria who lived in Delhi’s Tuglakabad, his woman friend Sangeeta, Ajay Kumar of Bihar who lived in Delhi’s Jasola on rent, and Atif Ali of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, also a resident of Delhi. Akata who is in his late thirties and Sangeeta were in a live-in relationship, police said.The suspects would befriend people on Facebook and then convince them to transfer money on the pretext of sending them costly gifts and foreign currency, said police, adding that all the suspects were arrested from Delhi.  According to the Faridabad police, they received a complaint from a 28-year-old engineer working at a private company in the city alleging that he was duped of ₹5.78 lakh by a woman who befriended him online in October. Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), Faridabad, said that the Nigerian national with the help of a Delhi woman formed a gang and started duping people after creating fake profiles. “Akata and Sangeeta created fake social media profiles and befriended people by posing as women. They would tell the victims that they are visiting India along with their siblings to meet them to finalise the wedding. Later, the victims used to receive calls from a man posing as customs officer who would inform them that the duo are caught with valuables worth several lakhs of rupees and they have to pay custom duty for their release,” he said. Police said that Akata’s bank account had transactions worth ₹65 lakh in the past two months.Basant Kumar, station house officer of Faridabad cyber police station, said that the suspects used to tell victims that they would get precious gifts as a token of friendship or would propose them for marriage. The SHO said that Ajay would provide Sangeeta and Akata SIM cards to make calls to dupe people, and Ali opened accounts for them to transfer money. “All the suspects were taken on seven-day police remand on Sunday after being produced before the court,” he said. After an investigation by the cyber cell, an FIR was registered on Sunday at Faridabad cyber police station. “Our cyber police team put the suspects’ numbers on surveillance and their locations were traced, following which they were arrested,” said SHO Kumar. The passport of Akata who came to India on a student visa had expired six months ago and he was staying in India illegally, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-nigerian-among-four-arrested-for-duping-people-online-101638124342435.html
29-11-2021||Delhi||Little breathing space: Third day of ‘severe’ air in Delhi||Delhi’s air remained in the “severe” category for a third consecutive day on Sunday, clocking an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 402 according to Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4pm bulletin as wind speeds remain low in the region. While agencies forecast some temporary respite over the next two days with an increase in wind speed that could help disperse pollutants in the region, wind speed will dip again from December 1, keeping the air quality largely between “very poor” and “severe” categories. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Delhi recorded an AQI reading of 402 (severe) on Saturday, and 406 (severe) on Friday. On Thursday, Delhi’s AQI had touched 400, on the brink of the “severe” category. Gufran Beig, founder and project director at the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), said wind speeds had become “calm” over the last 72 hours, but are expected to pick up from Monday. “We were forecasting relief from November 29 onwards and wind speeds will remain good during the day both on November 29 and 30. However, conditions will once again become adverse from December 1, as wind speed and temperatures decrease, dropping the ventilation index too,” said Beig.According to Safar, only around 200 farm fires were recorded in the northern plains on Sunday, with the share of their contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 pegged at just 3%. PM 2.5 is fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters of 2.5 microns. It is about 30 times smaller than a strand of human hair.According to the Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi, a forecasting mechanism under the ministry of earth sciences, Delhi’s ventilation index is also expected to improve considerably in the next two days, allowing faster dispersal of pollutants. While it was 2,500 m2/s on Sunday, it could increase to 7,500 m2/s on Monday and 6,000 m2/s on Tuesday. “A ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s with average wind speeds less than 10km/hr is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants,” said EWS in its daily bulletin on Sunday.Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius on Sunday, with mercury expected to remain around 10 degrees Celsius on Monday as well. While it could drop below the 10-degree mark on Tuesday, the influence from a western disturbance may take the minimum up to 12 degrees Celsius by Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast said. Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 26.8 degrees Celsius on Sunday, one degree above normal. Its maximum temperature is expected to hover between 26-27 degrees Celsius for the next three days, the IMD said.“Shallow fog with a visibility range of 500 to 1000 metres was reported in the early hours on Sunday. Shallow fog will continue across Delhi in the next few days,” said a Met official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/little-breathing-space-third-day-of-severe-air-in-delhi-101638124223162.html

Officials of the civil aviation ministry, health ministry and the Delhi government will be part of the DDMA meeting scheduled to discuss and take steps against the threat of the new variant.Also Read | States issue guidelines, review travel curbs over Omicron threatIn his letter to the Prime Minister, a copy of which HT has seen, Kejriwal wrote that India has fought a tough battle against Covid-19 for the last one-and-a-half years, and the country has recovered with great difficulty due to the selfless service of millions of Covid-19 warriors.“A number of countries, including the European Union, have suspended travel to the affected region (with new coronavirus variant). I urge you to stop flights from this region with immediate effect,” the letter said.The B 1.1.529 variant, dubbed Omicron and classified as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization on Friday, has sparked fears across the world that it could trigger new waves.Instances of the new variant have now been reported from Botswana, Hong Kong, South Africa, the UK, Australia, Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, Israel, and the Netherlands, among others.A central government official on Sunday told HT that India will review its decision to allow regular overseas flights in light of the new variant, even as it may not impose a blanket ban.Mandatory test for flyers from ‘at risk’ countriesOfficials at the Delhi airport have ramped up measures to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, with a specific focus on inbound travellers from Europe as well as 10 other countries that have recorded cases of the variant of concern.According to new guidelines issued by the Union health ministry, it is mandatory for passengers flying in from Europe, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel to get a fresh RT-PCR test at the airport, even if they have attached a Covid-19 vaccination certificate and negative test prior to boarding a flight.“For these three countries, which have been deemed as the most high-risk in terms of the new variant, flyers have to wait at the airport’s waiting room, located near the RT-PCR testing facility. Flyers from other countries have to submit their samples and fill in all their details before leaving, but if they test positive, the government will call and ask them to quarantine,” said an airport official.Dr Gauri Agarwal, founder of Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, the lab which carries out RT-PCR tests at the airport, said the facility is capable of handling 15,000 samples a day.“There is no significant surge in the number of passengers being tested, but there is coordination with the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics in Delhi, which is carrying out the genomic sequencing of the samples tested at the airport to trace whether it belongs to the mutated strain or not,” she said, adding that similar arrangements had been made for flyers from the three countries, as done earlier for passengers from the UK which had to be mandatorily be tested and were only allowed to leave post-results.“We need to ensure testing and vaccination do not remain interchangeable strategies, but rather both need to be implemented in tandem.” she added.The airport operator, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said the November 26 guidelines for 11 countries and Europe, were strictly being enforced, with all other social-distancing and Covid-19 protocols still in place as earlier.DIAL said passengers are also not allowed to use seats with cross marks on them to ensure distancing, while masks will also still be required to be worn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/stop-flights-from-omicron-affected-countries-delhi-cm-kejriwal-writes-to-pm-101638123501584.html

Candidates claimed that the exam had even started at some centres and was called off thereafter. They said at Krishna Convent in Jankipuram the message for cancellation of the exam reached at 11 am. Some candidates claimed they had solved 70% of the question paper.A number of UPTET candidates also said the question paper was relatively easy. Some of them had come from districts like Lakhimpur Kheri, Sitapur and Bahraich.Women candidates held the examination conducting body guilty for not ensuring safety of the question paper.“People with vested interests are involved in such practices. It causes inconvenience to the lakhs of candidates who are looking for jobs,” said Lily Gupta of Krishna Nagar. Shilu from Haryana said, “The government makes claims about a foolproof examination system. But the paper gets leaked each time, making a mockery of the exam.”Aradhana Singh of Jankipuram said there were reports about elaborate safety measure being taken for smooth conduct of the exam but the incident has exposed such claims.UPTET is conducted in two shifts for two papers: 1 and 2.

This year, the theme for the IPW was to ‘reconnect and rebuild’ to achieve the next phase of growth in the Indian pharma domain, said organisers of the event. This was the 14th edition of the expo organised by Informa Markets and was held offline for the first time since the pandemic. CEOs of leading pharma and bio-pharma companies, 534 exhibitors from 16 countries and over 30,000 visitors attended the expo, which concluded on Friday. A roundtable conference, which was a closed-door strategic gathering of CEOs of leading pharma and bio-pharma companies, was held to discuss pharma developments in India. Focus on innovation, research and development in the pharmacy industry in light of the Covid pandemic was the highlight of the expo. Bodh Raj Sikri, co-chairperson, Federation of Pharma Entrepreneurs, said the pharma industry played an important role during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The industry--not just in India but across the globe--was entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring there are no drug shortages, due to which production was ramped in a short span of time. Since we also had to follow Covid guidelines, we could work with only half the manpower, which increased the cost of production. However, the industry didn’t bother about that and continued to churn out life saving drugs responsibly,” he said. Yogesh Mudras, managing director of Informa Markets, said after the Covid outbreak, pharma industry has shifted its focus to innovation, research and development to develop new drugs in the wake of unprecedented health emergencies.“As the focus has shifted to new technology and ideas, such an expo, where leaders of the pharma industry, manufacturers of medicines and researchers can gather, holds significance. All the stakeholders are able to establish connections and exchange ideas here that further enhance drug development, preparing us for any unprecedented health emergency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-3-day-expo-in-throws-light-on-innovation-in-pharma-industry-101637951508499.html

He will continue to serve on the board of Twitter until his term expires in 2022 to help with the transition, before moving on.“I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,” Dorsey said in a statement.Agrawal is a computer engineer from IIT Bombay and has been with Twitter for the past 10 years, the last four of which were as the company’s chief technology officer. He started at the company as an engineer in 2011 after stints at AT&T, Microsoft and Yahoo, according to his LinkedIn profile.Dorsey cited Agarwal’s appointment by the board as one of the reasons for stepping down.“The board ran a rigorous process considering all options and unanimously appointed Parag,” Dorsey wrote, adding, “He has been my choice for some time given how deeply he understands the company and its needs. He is curious, probing, rational, creative, demanding, self-aware and humble. My trust in him as our CEO is bone deep.”Agrawal becomes the newest entrant to the gallery of Indian Americans heading major US tech companies. He joins Google’s Sunder Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen.  Referring to his decision to not stay on the board or become chair, he said he believes it’s really important to give Agarwal the “space he needs to lead”.“I believe it’s critical a company can stand on its own feet, free of its founder’s influence of direction,” he added.Dorsey said the reason behind sharing this email on Twitter was because he wished for it to become the “most transparent company in the world”.Dorsey founded the company in 2006, and posted the platform’s first tweet on March 6. The company went public in 2013, five years after he was ousted 2008. He returned to the company in 2015, after the then CEO Dick Costello stepped down. Dorsey launched payment app Square in the time he was away.The social media giant has 206 million monetizable active daily users worldwide with 24.45 million of them in India.CNBC was the first to report this development, citing sources.Stock prices of Twitter went up by 5% in response to the report.Dorsey faced an ouster move in 2020 when a key shareholder, Elliott Management, called for him to step down from one of the two companies, It dropped the demand in a deal with the company management, according to report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dorsey-steps-down-indian-origin-parag-agrawal-takes-over-as-new-twitter-ceo-101638206614087.html
29-11-2021||World||Not many founders that choose their company over their own ego: Here is what Jack Dorsey wrote in his resignation email||Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in his letter to Twitter employees on Monday highlighted why he stepped down and cited three main reasons behind his decision. He also explained why he chose Twitter CTO Parag Agarwal to lead the social media giant. Jack also shared his letter on Twitter with the tweet, “not sure anyone has heard but, I resigned from Twitter,” and the subject of his letter to his employees was ‘Fly’.Here is what Jack Dorsey told Twitter employees before resigning as CEO:Hello team.After almost 16 years of having a role at our company...from co-founder to CEO to Chair to Exec Chair to interim-CEO to CEO...I decided it’s finally time for me to leave. Why?There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being “founder-led.” Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I've worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders. There are 3 reasons I believe now is the right time.The first is Parag becoming our CEO. The board ran a rigorous process considering all options and unanimously appointed Parag. He’s been my choice for some time given how deeply he understands the company and its needs. Parag has been behind every critical decision that helped turn this company around. He’s curious, probing, rational, creative, demanding, self-aware, and humble. He leads with heart and soul, and is someone I learn from daily. My trust in him as our CEO is bone deep.The second is Bret Taylor agreeing to become our board chair. I asked Bret to join our board when I became CEO, and he’s been excellent in every way. He understands entrepreneurship, taking risks, companies at massive scale, technology, product, and he’s an engineer. All of the things the board and the company deserve right now. Having Bret in this leadership role gives me a lot of confidence in the strength of our board going forward. You have no idea how happy this makes me!The third is all of you. We have a lot of ambition and potential on this team. Consider this: Parag started here as an engineer who cared deeply about our work and now he’s our CEO (I also had a similar path...he did it better!). This alone makes me proud. I know that Parag will be able to channel this energy best because he’s lived it and knows what it takes. All of you have the potential to change the course of this company for the better. I believe this with all my heart!Parag is CEO starting today. I’m going to serve on the board through my term (May-ish) to help Parag and Bret with the transition. And after that...I’ll leave the board. Why not stay or become chair? I believe it’s really important to give Parag the space he needs to lead. And back to my previous point, I believe it’s critical a company can stand on its own, free of its founder’s influence or direction.I want you all to know that this was my decision and I own it. It was a tough one for me, of course. I love this service and company...and all of you so much. I’m really sad...yet really happy. There aren’t many companies that get to this level. And there aren’t many founders that choose their company over their own ego. I know we'll prove this was the right move.We'll have an all-hands meeting tomorrow at 9:05 AM Pacific to discuss it all. Until then, thank you all for the trust you’ve placed in me, and for the openness to build that trust in Parag and yourselves. I love you all.jackPS: I’m tweeting this email. My one wish is for Twitter Inc to be the most transparent company in the world.

29-11-2021||World||Russia says Sputnik Omicron booster on the cards||The backers of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V said Monday that the jab is effective against the new Omicron coronavirus variant but they were also developing an adapted booster.The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which supported the vaccine's development by the state-run Gamaleya Center, said that the centre "has already begun developing the new version of Sputnik vaccine adapted to Omicron.""In an unlikely case such modification is needed, the new Sputnik Omicron version can be ready for mass-scale production in 45 days," RDIF said in a statement. "Several hundred million Sputnik Omicron boosters can be provided to international markets already by February 20, 2022 with over 3 billion doses available in 2022."The promise comes after the US pharmaceutical company Moderna said Friday that it will develop a booster shot against the highly mutated strain of the coronavirus, which is more transmissible than the dominant Delta variant.Germany's BioNTech and US drugmaker Pfizer said the same day that they expect data "in two weeks at the latest" to show if their jab can be adjusted.Last week RDIF said Sputnik V provides longer immunity against the coronavirus than Western jabs using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.It added that the Sputnik vaccine is 80 percent effective against the coronavirus between six and eight months after the second dose.No independent study has confirmed the claim.Russia registered Sputnik V last August ahead of large-scale clinical trials, prompting concern among experts over the fast-tracked process.But it was since declared safe and over 90 percent effective in a report published by leading medical journal The Lancet. The RDIF says its two-dose vaccine has been approved in 71 countries and that it has applied for registration in the European Union.Earlier this summer several Latin American countries that have relied on the Russian vaccine to protect their populations complained to Moscow about delivery delays. emg/gwPFIZERBioNTech||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-sputnik-omicron-booster-on-the-cards-101638202886611.html
29-11-2021||World||Omicron variant underlines need for global 'pandemic treaty', says WHO||The emergence of the omicron variant shows how "perilous and precarious" the situation is, the WHO's chief warned. The EU and Germany's Merkel have backed negotiations on an accord to prevent future pandemics.As concern grows over the omicron variant, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday the panicked reactions by world leaders showed the urgent need for a global accord on pandemics."The emergence of the highly mutated omicron variant underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the start of a three-day World Health Assembly meeting.He said scientists around the world are "urgently" working to determine whether the omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, is more infectious or whether vaccines are effective against it.The UN health agency chief, however, emphasized that the 194-member World Health Assembly needs to ensure that the groundwork is laid for an accord that can prevent future pandemics."We shouldn't need another wake-up call," Tedros said.Why did the WHO label omicron as 'high risk'?Earlier on Monday, the WHO released a statement with the latest assessment of the omicron variant — designating it as a bringing a "very high" risk of global infection surges.While it remains to be seen whether the variant increases the risk of severe disease or death — the multiple mutations in the past have led to a higher risk of recurring infections in patients who have already recovered from Covid-19."Depending on these characteristics, there could be future surges of Covid-19, which could have severe consequences, depending on a number of factors including where surges may take place," the WHO said in a statement.How much support is there for a pandemic accord?Leaders from Germany and the European Union threw their support behind a global pandemic pact, calling for more stable financing for the WHO."I would like us member states to increase our contributions significantly — this means up to 50%," said acting Chancellor Angela Merkel.The outgoing German leader also backed efforts to make a pandemic prevention accord legally binding — which is currently not on the table in the draft agreement.The United States has been hesitant to agree to sign on to a legally binding treaty, but reached a compromise with other member states to kick start the process for a global "accord."What is in the draft?The draft, which is expected to be adopted by the end of the talks on Wednesday, sets out the long-term steps.Countries have tentatively agreed to establish an intergovernmental body that will draft and negotiate an accord. The accord itself will focus on three areas: pandemic prevention, preparedness and pandemic response.A treaty, accord, or another type of agreement won't likely be ready for years. The deadline is currently set at 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-underlines-need-for-global-pandemic-treaty-says-who-101638202277631.html

29-11-2021||World||Chinese province commissions surveillance system to target journalists, foreign students||Security officials in one of China's largest provinces have commissioned a surveillance system they say they want to use to track journalists and international students among other "suspicious people", documents reviewed by Reuters showed.A July 29 tender document published on the Henan provincial government’s procurement website - reported in the media for the first time - details plans for a system that can compile individual files on such persons of interest coming to Henan using 3,000 facial recognition cameras that connect to various national and regional databases.A 5 million yuan ($782,000) contract was awarded on Sept. 17 to Chinese tech company Neusoft, which was required to finish building the system within two months of signing the contract, separate documents published on the Henan government procurement website showed. Reuters was unable to establish if the system is currently operating.Shenyang-based Neusoft did not respond to requests for comment.China is trying to build what some security experts describe as one of the world's most sophisticated surveillance technology networks, with millions of cameras in public places and increasing use of techniques such as smartphone monitoring and facial recognition.U.S.-based surveillance research firm IPVM, which has closely tracked the network's expansion and first identified the Henan document, said the tender was unique in specifying journalists as surveillance targets and providing a blueprint for public security authorities to quickly locate them and obstruct their work."While the PRC has a documented history of detaining and punishing journalists for doing their jobs, this document illustrates the first known instance of the PRC building custom security technology to streamline state suppression of journalists," said IPVM'S Head of Operations Donald Maye, using the initials of the People's Republic of China.Reuters was unable to find any documents identifying journalists or foreigners as specific targets of surveillance systems in other parts of China.The Henan provincial government and police did not respond to requests for comment. The Ministry of Public Security and China's Foreign Ministry also did not comment."Tailed and Controlled"The near-200 page tender document from the Henan Public Security Department does not give reasons why it wants to track journalists or international students. Another category of people it said it wants to track were "women from neighbouring countries that are illegal residents."Public access to the tender document was disabled on Monday.The tender document specified cameras must be able to build a relatively accurate file for individuals whose faces are partially covered by a mask or glasses, and those targeted must be searchable on the database by simply uploading a picture or searching their facial attributes.The system will be operated by at least 2,000 officials and policemen, and specifies that journalists will be divided into three categories: red, yellow, green, in decreasing order of risk, according to the tender.Different police forces covering all of Henan, whose 99 million inhabitants makes it China's third-largest province by population, will be connected to the platform in order to spring into action in the event of a warning being set off, the tender explains.Warnings will be set off if a journalist while in Henan registers into a hotel, buys a ticket, or crosses the provincial border, according to the tender."Suspicious persons must be tailed and controlled, dynamic research analyses and risk assessments made, and the journalists dealt with according to their category," the tender reads.The tender also detailed different early warning systems for the other groups.Media ControlSome press freedom groups say the ruling Chinese Communist Party has tightened control over media since Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2012.In February, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) said China used coronavirus prevention measures, intimidation and visa curbs to limit foreign reporting in 2020, citing responses to an annual survey of correspondents and interviews with bureau chiefs.The Chinese foreign ministry at the time called the FCCC report "baseless" and said China always welcomed media and journalists from all countries to cover news in China according to the law. "What we oppose is ideological bias against China and fake news in the name of press freedom," a spokesman said.While most of the Henan document refers to journalists, several segments specify "foreign journalists".In October last year, the Henan government published on its procurement platform for prospective suppliers a short summary of the intended project in which it said the system would be "centred on foreigners" and help "protect national sovereignty, security, and interests".The contract was put out for tender on July 29, days after foreign journalists from the BBC, LA Times, Agence France-Presse and others reporting on devastating floods in Henan were targeted by a nationalist campaign on China's heavily censored social media platform Weibo.The FCCC said at the time it was "very concerned to witness the online and offline harassment of journalists" covering the floods. It described how, for instance, one Weibo account asked its 1.6 million followers to report the whereabouts of a foreign journalist who was reporting about the floods.The tender also said the system should be able to track the movements of international students through methods such as mobile phone positioning and travel bookings - particularly during key dates such as the country's national day or annual session of parliament."On...sensitive dates, launch a wartime early warning mechanism," it read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-province-commissions-surveillance-system-to-target-journalists-foreign-students-101638193535331.html

29-11-2021||World||Pakistan’s move to allow India’s aid to Afghanistan comes with a rider||Pakistan has linked its decision to allow India to transport 50,000 tonnes of wheat and medicines as humanitarian aid to Afghanistan to the condition that the relief materials be moved by Pakistani trucks, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.Officials of the two sides are engaged in discussions to find a solution to the impasse, especially in view of the looming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The Indian side is keen on using its own trucks as it wants to ensure that the relief materials directly reach the Afghan people without being diverted in any manner. The Indian side also envisages that the aid will be distributed only through the UN, the people said.India proposed shipping wheat and life-saving medicines to the people of Afghanistan via Pakistani soil on October 7 and received a response from the Pakistan government only on November 24. The people said Pakistan had attached several conditions to the shipment of the relief materials, besides the use of Pakistani trucks, but declined to go into details.It is understood that the Pakistani side is also seeking shipment charges from India for the use of its trucks.The people pointed out that the process of unloading and loading the relief materials at the Wagah land border crossing would add to the logistical issues associated with the transportation of the goods.The Indian side has repeatedly said in recent weeks that there should be unimpeded and unhindered access to Afghanistan for relief supplies and that the United Nations should play a central role in humanitarian efforts.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had made it clear at a news briefing on Friday that no conditions should be attached by Pakistan to the shipment of humanitarian aid.“This was about humanitarian access into Afghanistan for the delivery of the 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines we are supplying to the people of Afghanistan,” he said.“We are also working on the modalities with the Pakistan side. We believe that humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionalities,” he added.A joint communiqué issued after a meeting of foreign ministers of the Russia-India-China (RIC) mechanism on Friday had called for “immediate and unhindered humanitarian assistance to be provided to Afghanistan” in view of the deteriorating humanitarian situation.Pakistan has for long opposed two-way trade between India and Afghanistan via the Wagah land border crossing. It allowed the former Afghan government to export goods to India via the crossing but barred any transportation of Indian goods to the Afghan side.There are currently no flights between India and Afghanistan, and transporting the materials via Pakistan was seen as the quickest way of getting aid to the Afghan people, who are grappling with food shortages.Pakistan had said recently that it would allow the transportation of Indian wheat and medicines via the Wagah border on an “exceptional basis” for humanitarian purposes and as a goodwill gesture towards the Afghan people.Even a Taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, that recently visited Islamabad, had raised the issue of allowing the shipment of the wheat with the top Pakistani leadership.The UN has warned up to 23 million Afghans will be in “crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity” as winter sets in. Ten out of 11 of Afghanistan’s most densely populated urban areas are anticipated to be at emergency levels of food insecurity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-move-to-allow-india-s-aid-to-afghanistan-comes-with-a-rider-101638193348567.html
29-11-2021||World||China: Xi Jinping asks PLA to step up recruitment to win future wars||Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed the need to recruit new talent to support the armed forces’ rapid modernisation and win future wars.Talent holds the key to advancing the high-quality development of the Chinese armed forces, achieving victory in the military competition, and gaining the upper hand in future wars, Xi told a conference on military talent-related work held from Friday to Sunday.Besides being the general secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), Xi heads the Central Military Commission (CMC).Strengthening the capabilities to fight and win should be the starting point and ultimate goal of military talent cultivation, Xi Jinping said, calling for “ great efforts to improve military personnel’s scientific literacy and technological know-how to improve their ability to win modern wars”.“He also urged accelerating the building of first-class military schools and training of first-class military personnel,” the Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying at the conference.Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Monday that the Chinese military has allocated resources for 300,000 troops for the frontline roles to encourage younger professionals to join the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).The new allocation comes amid the ongoing Sino-India military friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged bilateral ties to their worst level in decades.The air force, the rocket (missile) force, and the strategic supporting force were among others which however enlarged with more forces, the Post report said.“The PLA airborne troop units were upgraded from division-level to brigades, while the number of pilots was also increased to support more new-generation fighter jets like the J-20s, J-16s, J-10Cs,” the newspaper quoted Chinese military sources as saying.Xi Jinping’s goal is to turn the PLA into a modern fighting force by 2027, the PLA’s centennial, and a world-class military on a par with the United States by 2050.The SCMP report quoted a CPC publication as reporting that China has expanded its combat forces to adapt to changing risks - despite a years-long push to streamline the PLA.“In a book of commentaries published in mid-November by CPC mouthpiece People’s Daily, military commentator Zhong Xin said the PLA had been “optimising” its personnel structure by deploying more troops to combat roles after reducing three lakh troops,” the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-xi-jinping-asks-pla-to-step-up-recruitment-to-win-future-wars-101638192567420.html
29-11-2021||World||How Omicron compares against other WHO-designated variants of concern||The uncertainties around the highly divergent variant of coronavirus, Omicron, has prompted countries to review the easing of restrictions. The World Health Organization (WHO) wrote to member states that the likelihood of potential further spread of Omicron at the global level is “high” and the overall risk related to the variant of concern is “very high”. The variant has a high number of mutations, including about 30 in spike protein, and, according to the UN health agency, some are concerning and may be associated with immune escape potential and higher transmissibility.Omicron is the fifth WHO-designated variant of concern first identified in South Africa last week. The other four variants of concern are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.Here’s how Omicron compares against other WHO-designated variants of concern:TransmissibilityThe alpha and beta variants appeared to spread more easily and quickly than the original Sars-CoV-2. The delta variant, first detected in India, was found to be 43% to 90% more transmissible than previous virus variants. While the experts are awaiting more data on Omicron, its detection coincides with a sharp rise in cases in South Africa.Severity of illnessSeveral studies on the alpha variant submitted to Britain’s new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (Nervtag) in January suggested there could be a link to increased risk of death. According to a study published in August, people infected with the delta variant is 50% more likely to be hospitalised than those infected with alpha. For Omicron, the WHO and other health agencies are closely monitoring the impacts from this latest variant of concern.Vaccine efficacyWhile some laboratory studies have shown that the vaccine remains effective against the beta and alpha variant of coronavirus, some studies have suggested that beta and gamma may have mutations with immune escape capability. In the case of delta variant, studies have suggested that the variant of concern is moderately resistant to vaccination. The high number of mutations in regions of the spike protein of omicron can potentially dampen the potency of antibodies.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-omicron-compares-against-other-who-designated-variants-of-concern-101638190640623.html

This Water Lily Pond and Rose is the widest of the three.”“In the Asian art market, the appetite for masterpieces of Western modern and contemporary art has proliferated in recent years in Hong Kong - setting record prices at auctions. This trend could gradually spread northward into mainland China,” the website Artists Studio said in an article ahead of the auction.The market for world-renowned western artists in China has huge potential, wrote Crystal Wilde for CKGSB Knowledge, the quarterly publication for the CKGSB Business School.“As the art market has matured, buyers have developed an interest in Western art, driven by the popularity of international art fairs like “Art021” and the “West Bund Art and Design” fair in Shanghai, as well as an increasing presence of foreign galleries. With a better support network of museums, galleries and experts behind it, Western art, whether it be works of masters like Monet or those of more modern blue-chip artists like Andy Warhol, is now seen by many as a safer investment bet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/works-of-renowned-western-artists-sell-for-37mn-at-beijing-auction-101638185247122.html

In a technical briefing document for its member states, the UN health agency said that the likelihood of potential further spread of Omicron at the global level is high and the overall risk related to the new variant of concern has been assessed as “very high”“Depending on these characteristics, there could be future surges of Covid-19, which could have severe consequences, depending on a number of factors including where surges may take place,” the report said.Currently, the local transmission of Omicron has been reported in South Africa and the variant has now been detected in four WHO regions: African; Eastern Mediterranean; European; and Western Pacific. The UN agency said that most of the cases outside Africa are travel-related, it expects local transmission in other countries as more information becomes available.Risk related to Covid variant Omicron 'very high', warns WHOThe WHO has suggested a number of priority actions for member states to curb the spread of the new virus variant, including enhanced surveillance and sequencing efforts and widespread use of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s PCR test to detect the variant.Here are some of the immediate actions for member states as suggested by WHO:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-lists-suggestions-for-countries-as-omicron-poses-very-high-overall-risk-101638178306475.html
29-11-2021||World||Risk related to Covid variant Omicron 'very high', warns WHO||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday warned that the risk related to Omicron – the new variant of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) – is "very high". The global health body said that the B.1.1.529 strain, first found in South Africa, is “highly divergent” and likely to spread internationally at a very high speed and could possibly have "severe consequences."Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic," the WHO said. “The overall global risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron is assessed as very high,” it noted.Earlier the WHO had said that it was “not yet clear” whether the newly-detected virus variant was more transmissible or causes more severe consequences compared to the previously known strains, especially the Delta variant.Delta variant was the cause behind India's horrifying second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.The WHO also said that researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available.The UN agency, however, urged its 194 member states to boost vaccinations and ensure “mitigation plans are in place” for essential health services.“The use of masks, physical distancing, ventilation of indoor space, crowd avoidance, and hand hygiene remain key to reducing transmission of SARS CoV-2 even with the emergence of the Omicron variant," the WHO said, urging countries to increase contact tracing of Covid-19 cases.Currently, the Omicron variant has not been reported in India. However, two clusters from Maharashtra and Karnataka are under investigation, the Indian government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/risk-related-to-covid-variant-omicron-very-high-warns-who-101638175496616.html
29-11-2021||World||WHO working on better understanding Omicron Covid-19 variant as experts from South Africa say symptoms appear mild||The World Health Organization is working with researchers around the globe to better understand the new coronavirus variant after health experts in South Africa, where omicron was first detected, said it appeared to cause only mild symptoms.There’s no information to suggest that symptoms associated with omicron differ from those caused by other variants, the Geneva-based WHO cautioned Sunday. Some of the earliest reported infections occurred among college students who are more likely to experience less severe illness from Covid-19, and understanding the level of severity of the new strain “will take days to several weeks,” the WHO said.“We don’t have enough data to determine vaccine effectiveness against omicron or disease severity, so any claims about either at this stage are not evidence-based,” said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “So far, the virus has not mutated to become less severe -- in fact the opposite.”Also read | Risk related to Covid variant Omicron 'very high', warns WHOGovernments around the world are banning travelers from South Africa and nearby countries amid fears the new “variant of concern” could evade vaccines, exacerbate Covid surges and frustrate efforts to reopen economies. While news of the new variant wreaked havoc in global markets on Friday, trading in Asia Monday indicated investors were waiting for more clarity, as scientists from the U.S. to Asia work to understand more about omicron’s makeup, its transmissibility, and how lethal it is compared with other strains.The U.K. government will convene an urgent meeting of Group of Seven health ministers Monday to discuss the latest developments, according to the country’s Department of Health. In the U.S., President Joe Biden will also give an update on Monday, the White House said.Omicron was first detected earlier this month. It’s characterized by some 30 or more genetic changes, half of which are in the receptor binding domain -- the part of the spike protein used to bind to human ACE-2, which is the enzyme the coronavirus targets to enter cells and cause an infection. Mutations there can make the spike protein less recognizable to the antibodies produced in response to vaccination or a natural infection.Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, called symptoms associated with the variant at this point “different and so mild” compared with others she’s treated in recent months.Coetzee, who first spotted what turned out to be the new variant, told the U.K.’s Telegraph newspaper that a number of healthy young men turned up at her clinic “feeling so tired.” About half were unvaccinated.“What we are seeing clinically in South Africa and remember, I’m at the epicenter, that’s where I’m practicing, is extremely mild,” she said Sunday on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show.”Click here to know more about the Omicron Covid-19 variant“We haven’t admitted anyone” to the hospital with the new variant, she said. “I spoke to other colleagues of mine, the same picture.”Asked if authorities around the world were panicking unnecessarily, Coetzee said, “Yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now on maybe we will say something different.”Experts elsewhere, however, followed the WHO in urging caution.Richard Lessells, an infectious-diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, said a rapid understanding of disease severity caused by omicron is critical, but it’s too early for reliable data. The time it takes for infections to progress to severe disease or hospitalization means omicron’s impact may not be apparent for a few more weeks.‘Be Cautious’“Observations from clinicians on the ground are always important, and we lean heavily on them, but we need to be cautious about jumping on early reports that all cases with this variant are mild,” Lessells said in a Twitter post Sunday.The variant’s genome contains “some concerning elements,” said Stephen Goldstein, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Their affect on vaccine effectiveness should be better known in the next couple of weeks, he said. Omicron also has some mutations near the so-called furin cleavage site of the spike protein that are associated with the increased transmissibility of both the alpha and delta variants.“We’re starting to see cases pop up in other parts of the world, so it appears to be spreading quite quickly, which leads to concerns that it may be even more transmissible than delta, but it really is too soon to say,” Goldstein said in a Zoom interview. Any advantage omicron has may become clearer if it starts spreading in the U.S. and parts of Europe already battling delta-fueled epidemics, he said.Also read | Omicron: Sisodia says can’t lower guard, Centre, states to monitor variantThe average number of daily cases in South Africa jumped to about 1,600 last week from about 500 the previous week and 275 infections in the week before that, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Sunday. The proportion of Covid tests coming back positive jumped to 9% from about 2% in less than a week. Only 36% of adults in South Africa are fully vaccinated.Barry Schoub, chairman of South Africa’s Ministerial Advisory Committee on Vaccines, said there’s been no real uptick in hospitalizations. “The cases that have occurred so far have all been mild cases, mild-to-moderate cases, and that’s a good sign,” Schoub told Sky News on Sunday, adding that it was still early days and nothing was certain yet.No unusual symptoms have been reported following infection with omicron and, as with other variants, some individuals are asymptomatic, South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases said Friday.Also read | No case of Omicron variant in India, 2 clusters under investigation, says govtAsymptomatic CasesTwo omicron cases detected in Australia and an initial one in Hong Kong occurred in fully vaccinated people who developed no apparent sign of illness. A 62-year-old man who was infected in a quarantine hotel in Hong Kong did develop symptoms. Both places require negative Covid tests for travelers to enter, however, indicating these infections may have been at an early stage.The WHO said there was preliminary data showing a higher number of hospitalizations, “but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with omicron.”The large number of mutations found in the omicron variant appears to destabilize the virus, which might make it less “fit” than the dominant delta strain, said Schoub.“In a way, hopefully it won’t displace delta because delta we know responds very well to the vaccine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-working-on-better-understanding-omicron-covid-19-variant-as-experts-from-south-africa-say-symptoms-appear-mild-101638173311714.html

The economic collapse has pummelled smaller outlets too.Nehad Rasana-e-Afghanistan (NAI), an organization supporting media in Afghanistan, said that since the Islamic Emirate rule, over 257 media outlets have ceased operating in the country due to financial challenges as well as restrictions. This includes print, radio and TV stations.According to the watchdog, over 70 per cent of media workers have become jobless or left the country. The most affected community has been the ones who are actually upholding the freedom of speech and expression.No media could report on corruption, mismanagement, lack of capacity of government or Taliban's behaviour towards people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-permission-without-review-taliban-censors-media-reports-in-afghanistan-101638167354423.html
29-11-2021||World||'A heavy burden on lives': WHO criticises travel bans over Omicron variant||The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the travel bans imposed on southern African countries in wake of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 by saying that these restrictions place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods.“Travel restrictions may play a role in slightly reducing the spread of Covid-19 but place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods,” WHO's regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, said in a statement on Sunday.She called on countries to follow science and international health regulations to avoid using travel bans.South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa also called the travel bans as completely unjustified, adding it will not be effective in controlling the spread of Omicron. Ramaphosa said the only thing that travel bans will do is further damage to the economies of affected countries.Since the discovery of the Omicron variant, several countries including the United States (US), the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and others have imposed travel bans on the affected region in southern Africa. It has been reported that Omicron has a higher number of mutations and spreads very quickly.The United States has given exceptions in its travel ban for American citizens, and permanent residents. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced that all international arrivals will be barred, days after the government imposed quarantine rules for Japanese nationals coming back to the country from South Africa and eight other nearby countries.Matshidiso Moeti on Sunday also lauded South Africa for informing the United Nations' body about the variant as soon as it identified it. “The speed and transparency of the South African and Botswana governments in informing the world of the new variant are to be commended," the top WHO official further said.Currently, the WHO has said that it is not yet clear whether omicron is more transmissible or causes more severe disease compared to other variants of Covid-19. It will take days to weeks to understand the level of severity of omicron, the WHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-heavy-burden-on-lives-who-criticises-travel-bans-over-omicron-variant-101638158283047.html

On Friday, Canada imposed a ban on foreign nationals travelling to the country from seven southern African nations. However, the two cases detected were not associated with those countries. In a statement released on Sunday, Christine Elliott, deputy premier of the province of Ontario as well as minister of health and Dr Kieran Moore, chief medical officer of health, said, “Today, the province of Ontario has confirmed two cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in Ottawa, both of which were reported in individuals with recent travel from Nigeria. Ottawa Public Health is conducting case and contact management and the patients are in isolation.”Ontario has asked the federal government to mandate “point-of-arrival testing for all travellers irrespective of where they’re coming from”.The ban announced on Friday and valid till January 31 next year was on South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Namibia. Some travellers, including Canadian citizens and permanent residents, were exempt.Canadian authorities warned more cases may be discovered going ahead. Minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos said “As the monitoring and testing continues with provinces and territories, it is expected that other cases of this variant will be found in Canada.”The government also warned Canadians against travelling outside the country, as the Public Health Agency of Canada noted, “Restrictions are changing quickly and may be imposed by countries with little warning, disrupting travel plans. Should individuals choose to travel outside Canada, they may be forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected.”Early date, it said, pointed to the variant being more transmissible that others earlier but “evidence is limited at this time”. The border measures that have been implemented, it added, while an international effort is in progress “to understand the potential implications in terms of transmission, clinical presentation and vaccine efficacy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-in-canada-two-cases-confirmed-in-ottawa-101638166105819.html

This is a dangerous-looking virus, but I think we have many tools in our armamentarium now to fight it,” Moderna's top executive said during his interaction with the BBC.The Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa, has a higher number of mutations and has been spreading very quickly. The variant has prompted several countries to shut down their borders and renew Covid-19 restrictions.Health experts in South Africa, including the doctor who first sounded the alarm about Omicron, have said that the symptoms linked to the variant have been mild till now.However, the World Health Organization (WHO), has urged caution and said that the initial cases of the variant symptoms, adding, younger patients tend to have milder symptoms.The WHO said that it will take days to several weeks to understand the level of severity of the variant. "There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with omicron are different from those from other variants,” the WHO added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-for-omicron-might-be-ready-in-early-2022-says-moderna-101638150205920.html

The coalition has also said  it plans to rework the 2022 state budget to reduce a large deficit."The new government has a very complicated time ahead and many challenges... I want it to be a government of change for the future," Fiala said at a televised news conference, adding that he expected his cabinet to be appointed in mid-December.The new prime minister also called on people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and praised medical staff as cases are on the rise.Only 58.5% of Czechs are vaccinated against coronavirus. This compares to an average to an European Union average of 65.8%, according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.President Zeman performed the inauguration ceremony from a plexiglass cubicle after testing positive for coronavirus. Zeman, who came in a wheelchair escorted by a medic in full protective gear, contracted the virus after a six-week stay in hospital for an unrelated illness.The outgoing government has toughened measures on Thursday, including a ban on Christmas markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/czech-president-appoints-milos-zeman-petr-fiala-as-pm-in-ceremony-behind-glass-101638152384867.html

The minister said the situation is "volatile" and warned residents to prepare for more evacuation orders, possible increased flooding and closed highways.British Columbia was hit by record rainfall in mid-November that caused widespread flooding and mudslides. The extreme weather damaged and destroyed roads and bridges, forced thousands to evacuate their homes and left at least four dead and one missing.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited affected areas on Friday, after deploying the military to help with sandbagging."Extreme weather events are going to become more frequent," he warned.This weekend has so far seen up to 130 millimeters (five inches) of rain dumped on parts of British Columbia, plus 30 millimeters of snow melt adding to runoff in already swelled rivers.Localized flooding has been reported in communities near Vancouver, officials said, while minor landslides once again struck several highways into the city, leaving behind rocks, trees and other debris.Ted White of the River Forecast Centre said, "A potentially potent atmospheric river is developing in the Pacific Ocean... (that has) the potential of being an extreme storm" when it makes landfall.amc/sw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floodravaged-british-columbia-in-western-canada-braces-for-more-rain-101638143572915.html
29-11-2021||World||Taliban asks EU for help with Afghanistan's airports||The Taliban asked for help in keeping Afghanistan's airports running in weekend talks with EU officials that also raised "grave concern" about the humanitarian situation in their country, according to an EU statement late Sunday.Both sides sent senior officials to the Qatari capital Doha for the talks, which happened just ahead of two weeks of negotiations between the US and the Taliban due to start Monday, also in Doha.The EU's European External Action Service (EEAS) said in its statement that "the dialogue does not imply recognition by the EU of the interim (Taliban) government but is part of EU's operational engagement, in the interest of the EU and the Afghan people".The Taliban delegation was led by interim foreign minister Amir Khan Mutaqqi, accompanied by the interim ministers for education and health, the acting central bank governor, and officials from the foreign, finance and interior ministries and the intelligence directorate.The EU side was headed by the EU special envoy for Afghanistan Tomas Niklasson, with officials from the EEAS and the European Commission's service handling humanitarian aid, international partnerships, and migration.'Worsening humanitarian situation'The EU statement said the Taliban vowed to stick by its promise of "amnesty" for Afghans who had worked against it during the two decades of Western-oriented rule up to the hasty exit and evacuation by the US and its allies in August.The Taliban side also re-committed to allowing Afghans and foreigners to leave if they wish so, but "requested assistance for maintaining operations of airports" so that could happen."The two sides expressed grave concern about the worsening humanitarian situation in Afghanistan as winter is arriving," the statement said, adding that the EU would continue supplying humanitarian aid.The EU side pressed the Taliban to create an "inclusive government", foster democracy, ensure girls had equal access to schooling, and prevent Afghanistan serving as a base for any group "that threatens the security of others".It also suggested that, if the Taliban met EU conditions, that could unlock extra financing for Afghanistan's cash-strapped new rulers but only "for the direct benefit of the Afghan people".The Taliban reiterated they would uphold human rights "in line with Islamic principles" and would welcome back diplomatic missions that had closed, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-asks-eu-for-help-with-afghanistan-s-airports-101638138852877.html

29-11-2021||World||South Africa to remain on lowest lockdown level amid Omicron concerns||South Africa will remain on the lowest 'Level One' of its five-level lockdown strategy to fight the Covid-19 pandemic despite the global panic around the detection of the Omicron variant in the country, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday.Ramaphosa also called on more than 20 countries that have imposed travel bans to and from South Africa and its neighbours to immediately end the ban to avoid further harm to the economies of these countries, which have already been battered by the pandemic.“In taking the decision not to impose further restrictions at this stage, we considered the fact that when we encountered previous waves of infection, vaccines were not widely available and far fewer people were vaccinated,” Ramaphosa said in a national broadcast.“That is no longer the case. Vaccines are available to anyone aged 12 and above, free of charge, at thousands of sites across the country.“We also know that the coronavirus will be with us for the long term. We must therefore find ways of managing the pandemic while limiting disruptions to the economy and ensuring continuity,” the president added.Commenting on the travel ban, Ramaphosa called for an immediate reversal of the ban.“(The ban) is a clear and completely unjustified departure from the commitment that many of these countries made at the meeting of G20 countries in Rome last month.”“They pledged at that meeting to restart international travel in a safe and orderly manner, consistent with the work of relevant international organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and the OECD.“The G20 Rome Declaration noted the plight of the tourism sector in developing countries, and made a commitment to support a rapid, resilient, inclusive and sustainable recovery of the tourism sector,” Ramaphosa said.“These restrictions are unjustified and unfairly discriminate against our country and our Southern African sister countries. The prohibition of travel is not informed by science, nor will it be effective in preventing the spread of this variant. The only thing the prohibition on travel will do is to further damage the economies of the affected countries and undermine their ability to respond to, and recover from, the pandemic.”Ramaphosa said there was no scientific justification for keeping these restrictions in place.Placing great emphasis on the need to use vaccination as the primary defence tool in fighting the virus, Ramaphosa said a task team led by Deputy President David Mabuza has been established to report back on suggestions that vaccines be made compulsory in some circumstances.“As individuals, as companies and as government, we have a responsibility to ensure that all people in this country can work, travel and socialise safely.“We have therefore been undertaking engagements with social partners and other stakeholders on introducing measures that make vaccination a condition for access to workplaces, public events, public transport and public establishments, “the president said.Ramaphosa said discussion has already been taking place with the business and labour sectors, with broad agreement on the need for compulsory vaccination.He did not comment about the growing anti-vaccination proponents, including some political parties, and even some lawyers who have argued that forcing people to take vaccinations would undermine their constitutional rights.“We realise that the introduction of such measures is a difficult and complex issue, but if we do not address this seriously and as a matter of urgency, we will continue to be vulnerable to new variants and will continue to suffer new waves of infection,” Ramaphosa said.“We also know that the likelihood of the emergence of more severe forms of variants is increased significantly where people are not vaccinated. The emergence of the Omicron variant should be a wake-up call to the world that vaccine inequality cannot be allowed to continue,” the president said as he repeated his call for vaccine inequality to end.“These variants may well be more transmissible, may cause more severe disease, and maybe more resistant to the current vaccines.“Instead of prohibiting travel, the rich countries of the world need to support the efforts of developing economies to access and to manufacture enough vaccine doses for their people without delay,” Ramaphosa concluded.South Africa recorded 3,220 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, up from about 100 daily just over a week ago, but scientists said there was no need to panic about Omnicron yet because not enough was known about it.The Omicron variant, feared to spread faster and partially reduce vaccine protection, was identified in South Africa earlier this week and classed as a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation (WHO).A “variant of concern” is the WHO's top category of worrying Covid-19 variants.Countries around the world are currently racing to introduce travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain Omicron's spread.European countries along with the UK have banned travel to and from South Africa and neighbouring countries of Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana, as well as Lesotho and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), both of which are landlocked within South Africa.Other countries include Mauritius, Israel, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, the US, Canada and the Netherlands.In New Delhi, the Indian government asked all states and union territories to conduct rigorous screening and testing of all international travellers coming from or transiting through South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana, where the new variant has been detected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-to-remain-on-lowest-lockdown-level-amid-omicron-concerns-101638138165832.html
29-11-2021||World||More omicron cases pop up as world rushes to learn more||Cases of the omicron variant of the coronavirus popped up in countries on opposite sides of the world Sunday and many governments rushed to close their borders even as scientists cautioned that it's not clear if the new variant is more alarming than other versions of the virus.The variant was identified days ago by researchers in South Africa, and much is still not known about it, including whether it is more contagious, more likely to cause serious illness or more able to evade the protection of vaccines. But many countries rushed to act, reflecting anxiety about anything that could prolong the pandemic that has killed more than 5 million people.Israel decided to bar entry to foreigners, and Morocco said it would suspend all incoming flights for two weeks starting Monday — among the most drastic of a growing raft of travel curbs being imposed by nations around the world as they scrambled to slow the variant's spread. Scientists in several places — from Hong Kong to Europe — have confirmed its presence. The Netherlands reported 13 omicron cases on Sunday, and Australia found two.Noting that the variant has already been detected in many countries and that closing borders often has limited effect, the World Health Organization called for frontiers to remain open.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States, meanwhile, emphasized that there is no data yet that suggests the new variant causes more serious illness than previous COVID-19 variants."I do think it’s more contagious when you look at how rapidly it spread through multiple districts in South Africa. It has the earmarks therefore of being particularly likely to spread from one person to another. … What we don’t know is whether it can compete with delta,” Collins said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Collins echoed several experts in saying the news should make everyone redouble their efforts to use the tools the world already has, including vaccinations, booster shots and measures such as mask-wearing.“I know, America, you’re really tired about hearing those things, but the virus is not tired of us,” Collins said.The Dutch public health authority confirmed that 13 people who arrived from South Africa on Friday have so far tested positive for omicron. They were among 61 people who tested positive for the virus after arriving on the last two flights to Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport before a flight ban was implemented. They were immediately put into isolation, most at a nearby hotel.Authorities in Australia said two travelers who arrived in Sydney from Africa became the first in the country to test positive for the new variant. Arrivals from nine African countries are now required to quarantine in a hotel upon arrival. Two German states reported a total of three cases in returning travelers over the weekend.Israel moved to ban entry by foreigners and mandate quarantine for all Israelis arriving from abroad.“Restrictions on the country’s borders is not an easy step, but it’s a temporary and necessary step,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting.Morocco's Foreign Ministry tweeted Sunday that all incoming air travel to the North African country would be suspended to “preserve the achievements realized by Morocco in the fight against the pandemic, and to protect the health of citizens.” Morocco has been at the forefront of vaccinations in Africa, and kept its borders closed for months in 2020 because of the pandemic.The U.S. plans to ban travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries starting Monday.“It’s going to give us a period of time to enhance our preparedness,” the United States’ top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the ban on ABC’s “This Week.”Many countries are introducing such bans, though they go against the advice of the WHO, which has warned against any overreaction before the variant is thoroughly studied.South Africa's government responded angrily to the travel bans, which it said are “akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker.” It said it will try to persuade countries that imposed them to reconsider.The WHO sent out a statement saying it “stands with African nations” and noting that travel restrictions may play “a role in slightly reducing the spread of COVID-19 but place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods." It said if restrictions are put in place, they should be scientifically based and not intrusive.In Europe, much of which already has been struggling with a sharp increase in cases over recent weeks, officials were on guard.The U.K. on Saturday tightened rules on mask-wearing and on testing of international arrivals after finding two omicron cases, but British Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the government was nowhere near reinstituting work from home or more severe social-distancing measures.“We know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health,” he told Sky News.Spain announced it won't admit unvaccinated British visitors starting Dec. 1. Italy was going through lists of airline passengers who arrived in the past two weeks. France is continuing to push vaccinations and booster shots.David Hui, a respiratory medicine expert and government adviser on the pandemic in Hong Kong, agreed with that strategy.He said the two people who tested positive for the omicron variant had received the Pfizer vaccine and exhibited very mild symptoms, such as a sore throat.“Vaccines should work but there would be some reduction in effectiveness,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-omicron-cases-pop-up-as-world-rushes-to-learn-more-101638136000220.html
29-11-2021||World||A new republic is born as Barbados cuts ties with UK queen||On a rainy night in Hong Kong in 1997, Prince Charles read a message from his mother Queen Elizabeth II, as Britain handed back sovereignty of the territory to China after more than 150 years of UK rule.On Monday, nearly a quarter of a century on, Charles will be present at another handover, when Barbados becomes the world's newest republic, with an elected president -- not the queen -- as head of state.The ceremony will not be on the same scale as in Hong Kong, when military marching bands and bagpipes provided the backdrop to a momentous occasion that was described as "the epilogue of empire".But the Caribbean island's abandonment of constitutional monarchy is significant, not just for the monarch and her heir, but for the new republic -- and others that may follow.Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty Magazine, said the declaration was a "natural progression" of a trend that began soon after the queen took the throne in 1952."I think inevitably it's one that will continue, not necessarily in this current reign but in the next -- and probably accelerate," he told AFP.Royal officials have said little about the end of nearly four painful centuries of British rule and influence on Barbados, which was a key centre in the slave trade."This is a matter for the government and people of Barbados," Buckingham Palace said when the authorities in Bridgetown set out its intentions last year.However, it sends a clear message that in the twilight of the 95-year-old queen's reign, and when Charles, 73, succeeds, the British monarchy's global reach is diminished.'Democracy day'In 1947, five years before she became queen, Britain saw the "Jewel in the Crown" -- India -- emerge as an independent republic.After Elizabeth took the throne in 1952, independence movements swept Britain's former colonies, severing ties to the crown that were bound by commerce and bloody conquest.But between 1983 and 1987, Elizabeth was still queen of an astonishing 18 countries.Fiji (1987) and Mauritius (1992) have since become republics, following in the footsteps of Caribbean nations Dominica, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago in the 1970s.In doing so now, tiny Barbados, with a population of just under 300,000, could start a domino effect in the queen's 14 remaining Commonwealth realms outside Britain.Professor Hilary Beckles, a Barbadian historian, called Monday's event -- on the eve of Barbados' 55th anniversary of independence -- "an historic moment" with far-reaching significance.For Barbados, the Caribbean and all post-colonial societies, it represents freedom from the "tyranny of imperial and colonial authority", and the "brutal legacy" of slavery and genocidal oppression, he said this week."History has given Barbados this responsibility to move forward into the 21st century" with pride, dignity and honour, he added, calling Tuesday "a democracy day".Republican sentimentThe queen has consistently been the most popular royal in Britain and beyond, and is seen as the symbol of the country post-war as well as the last living link to its imperial past.When the succession comes, with the more controversial Charles lacking that history, experts predict the republican question will be asked with more urgency in Commonwealth countries -- and even possibly in the UK.Little said the push for an elected head of state was more than likely in places such as Australia and to a lesser extent Canada.Australians last voted on the the issue in November 1999, but the proposal did not pass.Graham Smith, from the anti-monarchy pressure group Republic, said Barbados' move is "useful" to demonstrate that ditching constitutional monarchy can be done easily."It's going to have a big impact," he said.Jamaica in particular, where both main political parties back the idea of becoming a republic, could see it as a "prompt", he added.In Britain, a YouGov poll in May indicated support for scrapping the monarchy was low among older age groups, dropping to just 13 percent among those aged 65 and over.In contrast, 41 percent of those aged 18 to 24 said they wanted an elected head of state.Smith attributed that to changing attitudes to monarchy, a greater awareness about the legacies of colonialism and support for anti-racism movements and a fairer society."As the older generation starts to die, we're going to see a big spike in support for republicanism," he said."I think the only people that think monarchy has a big role to play are the British and the royal family."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-new-republic-is-born-as-barbados-cuts-ties-with-uk-queen-101638134714220.html

It also deployed missile systems to monitor them.Sunday’s incursion included 18 fighter jets and five H-6 bombers, as well as a Y-20 aerial refueling aircraft, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry.The Chinese aircraft flew into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone near the southern part of the island and out into the Pacific Ocean before returning to China, according to a map by Taiwan authorities.It’s the largest deployment of Chinese warplanes since a record 52 aircraft were detected close to Taiwan in early October.This comes after a US lawmaker defied a Chinese demand that she abandon a trip to the island. Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, wrote on Twitter after landing in Taiwan Thursday that her office received a “blunt message” from the Chinese embassy to call off the trip. The trip also includes Japan and South Korea.Over the past year, the frequency of Chinese incursions has increased, with about 150 aircraft over a period of four days. China’s air force mission toward Taiwan came as Chinese President Xi Jinping met with officers at a military conference, where he called for military talent cultivation to support and strengthen the armed forces, according to state-owned news agency Xinhua.Xi said that talent is imperative in achieving victory in military competition and gaining the upper hand in future wars, according to Xinhua.China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. It refuses to recognize the island’s government and has increasingly sought to isolate the independence-leaning administration of President Tsai Ing-wen.Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949, and Beijing opposes Taiwan’s involvement in international organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-sees-biggest-flyby-of-chinese-warplanes-since-oct-101638131182156.html
29-11-2021||World||UK seeks ‘urgent’ talks with Europe after French snub||Britain’s government on Sunday announced plans for its own talks on the Channel migration crisis with European ministers this week as it was frozen out of a crisis meeting in France.Home secretary Priti Patel was barred from Sunday’s meeting in Calais, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson published the text of a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron setting out London’s demands for concerted action.But following the tragic drownings of 27 people in the Channel last Wednesday, she tweeted: “I will be holding urgent talks with my European counterparts this week to prevent further tragedies in the Channel.”There was no immediate comment from Patel’s interior ministry on the venue or timing of the talks. But Patel used a commentary piece in the Sun on Sunday newspaper to spell out the need for joint action, and for tougher UK legislation, as she comes under pressure in right-wing media and from her own Conservative party to get a grip on the crisis.“There is still so much more we can do and I am sorry not to be at a meeting with European ministerial counterparts today to discuss this pressing issue,” she wrote in the tabloid.France sought help from its European neighbours on Sunday to crack down on Channel people-smuggling gangs, with interior minister Gerald Darmanin saying he could “not accept” any more deaths.Ministers responsible for immigration from France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium convened in the northern French port of Calais.“The biggest point for this meeting is the fight against people-smugglers who take advantage of our borders and countries,” Darmanin said at the start of the event, adding that “migratory pressures continue and are constantly increasing”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-urgent-talks-with-europe-after-french-snub-101638130838456.html
29-11-2021||World||Israel worries Iran will get sanctions relief without capping nuclear projects||Israel worries Iran will secure a windfall in sanctions relief in renewed nuclear negotiations with world powers but will not sufficiently roll back projects with bomb-making potential, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Sunday.Negotiators will convene in Vienna on Monday in a last-ditch effort to salvage a nuclear deal which the United States under then-President Donald Trump quit in 2018, reimposing sanctions on Iran. That led to breaches of the deal by Tehran, and dismayed the other powers involved.Israel, which is not a party to the talks, opposed the original 2015 pact as too limited in scope and duration. Israeli leaders have long threatened military action against Iran if they deem diplomacy a dead end for denying it nuclear weaponry.The Islamic Republic says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.“Israel is very worried about the readiness to remove the sanctions and to allow a flow of billions (of dollars) to Iran in exchange for unsatisfactory restrictions in the nuclear realm,” Bennett told his cabinet in televised remarks.“This is the message that we are relaying in every manner, whether to the Americans or to the other countries negotiating with Iran.”Few expect a breakthrough in the talks as Iran’s uranium enrichment activities have escalated in an apparent bid to gain leverage against the West. Six rounds of indirect talks were held between April and June.The new round begins after a hiatus caused by the election of a new Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline cleric.Diplomats say time is running low to resurrect the pact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-worries-iran-will-get-sanctions-relief-without-capping-nuclear-projects-101638130417963.html
29-11-2021||World||Scratchy throat, unfamiliar symptoms: South African doctor reveals details of Omicron cases||Amid worldwide concerns over Covid's new variant Omicron, which is believed to be more transmissible than the previous variants, a South African doctor who raised the alarm over this new variant revealed that the patients she treated had unfamiliar symptoms. However, the symptoms were mild and her patients recovered fully without hospitalisation. Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told AFP she had seen around 30 patients over the past 10 days who tested positive for Covid-19 but had unfamiliar symptoms.The Omicron patients reported extreme tiredness, mild muscle aches, a scratchy throat and dry cough, the doctor told AFP. Only a few had a slightly high temperature.Coetzee had alerted the health officials that the clinical picture was not fitting Delta, the dominant variant of South Africa. By that time, scientists have already picked up the variant and were working on it.Omicron: Why the new coronavirus variant is so scary? Experts explain"We are not saying that there will not be severe disease coming forward. But for now, even the patients that we have seen who are not vaccinated have mild symptoms. "I'm quite sure... a lot of people in Europe already have this virus," Coetzee said.The patients that Coetzee treated were mostly men aged under 40 and under half of them were vaccinated.The variant has brought much ignominy to South Africa and countries have started isolating South Africa by imposing a blanket ban on travellers. South Africa's top health federation has termed this as a 'knee-jerk' reaction.Angelique Coetzee who is also the chairperson of the South African Medical Association said South Africa should instead be lauded and not vilified for the alertness the scientists have shown. "My suspicion is that because our scientists are very alert and doing a lot of sequencing in the background, maybe those European countries missed it because of the symptoms," Coetzee told TV news channel Newzroom Afrika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scratchy-throat-unfamiliar-symptoms-south-african-doctor-reveals-details-of-omicron-cases-101638115538400.html
29-11-2021||India||Centre offers vaccine support to African nations battling Omicron||India on Monday offered to supply Covid-19 vaccines, life-saving drugs, test kits and medical equipment to African countries to fight the new Omicron variant of the Coronavirus. Omicron has been designated a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO), based on evidence that it has several mutations that may impact how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes. “The government of India stands ready to support the countries affected in Africa in dealing with the Omicron variant, including by supplies of made-in-India vaccines,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement, adding that supplies can be delivered through the WHO-backed COVAX facility or bilaterally. “India also stands ready to supply essential life-saving drugs, test kits, gloves, PPE kits and medical equipment such as ventilators, as may be required,” the statement said. Indian institutions will “favourably consider cooperation in genomic surveillance and virus characterisation related research work” with African counterparts. The statement noted that the Indian government has cleared all orders placed so far by COVAX for supplies of the Covishield vaccine, including to African countries such as Malawi, Ethiopia, Zambia, Mozambique, Guinea and Lesotho. The government also cleared supplies of Covaxin to Botswana, and any new requirement projected bilaterally or through COVAX will be considered expeditiously, according to the statement. India expressed solidarity with countries, particularly in Africa, that have so far been affected by the Omicron variant. India has so far supplied more than 25 million doses of made-in-India vaccines to 41 countries in Africa.The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa. WHO has said it is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible than other variants such as Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, and epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-offers-vaccine-support-to-african-nations-battling-omicron-101638209969697.html
29-11-2021||India||Covid vaccination voluntary, Centre tells Supreme Court||The Centre informed the Supreme Court on Monday that while Covid-19 vaccination is voluntary, any misconceived doubts or motivated propaganda against it can lead to vaccine hesitancy at a crucial period when all efforts are being made by central and state governments to vaccinate every individual. The affidavit was filed in response to a petition filed by Jacob Pulayil, a former member of the national technical advisory group on immunization (NTAGI) – the apex body on immunization. The petitioner has challenged the vaccine mandates issued by states making vaccination compulsory to access workplaces and benefits under government schemes, besides raising an issue of personal autonomy. It further sought segregated data for each of the phases of clinical trials undertaken concerning the Covid vaccines administered in the country. The Centre said, “There are very few cases where purported public interest litigation (whether bonafide or motivated) harms public interest directly. This is one such petition which, if entertained, would harm public interest…. Any misgivings and misconceived doubts and motivated propaganda against vaccination can only result in a potential threat of setting vaccine hesitancy again, which will not be in the public interest.” The affidavit filed by central drugs standard control organization (CDSCO) joint drugs controller PBN Prasad also revealed the government’s stand on vaccine mandate. It said, “As per the operational guidelines document, Covid-19 vaccination is voluntary. However, it is emphasized and encouraged that all individuals take vaccination for public health and in his/her interest as well as public interest since in case of a pandemic, an individual’s ill health has a direct effect on the society.” The CDSCO, working under the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), also denied the allegations by the petitioner that Covid-19 vaccination is linked to any benefits or services and said, “He (petitioner) has chosen to give a false picture before this court for the reasons best known to him. In the process, however, he has raised a false alarm and warning against efforts of the nation to combat an unprecedented tragedy faced by the human race. Such an attempt is to be viewed very seriously at a time when the Central Government, all State Governments and Union Territories are individually and collectively making all possible efforts to vaccinate every individual.” The petitioner, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, disputed the position on the ground. “Centre on affidavit has said there is no mandate on Covid vaccines. But there are instances to show orders passed by states making it mandatory,” Bhushan said, referring to news reports from Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra where unvaccinated have been advised to remain home. He pointed out that Delhi has issued a mandate for government servants reporting for work to be vaccinated while Madhya Pradesh has denied subsidized food grains to unvaccinated persons. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, said, “It is with great difficulty that we have overcome vaccine hesitancy in this country. Many persons have benefited from vaccination not only in the country, but across the world. This court should avoid allowing this platform to be used for extraneous purposes.” Appearing along with additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, Mehta said that once the Centre can show to the Court that a statutory regime exists for certification and permission to administer any drug/vaccine, the petition should be dismissed as further examination of the matter would not fall within the scope of judicial review. The bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai made it clear that vaccine mandates by individual states cannot be decided in abstract and require to be challenged separately by the petitioner. Addressing Centre’s concerns, the judges said, “We do not want to add to the concerns of vaccine hesitancy. We have made this clear at the first hearing itself.” The Court posted the matter for hearing on December 13 as it was yet to receive the Centre’s affidavit. Bhushan informed the bench that by the next date, he will file applications challenging the mandates issued by various states for Court to issue notice and know their stand. Even on the study on adverse effects, the affidavit stated that out of the total doses of Covid-19 vaccine administered till November 24, a total of 2,116 serious and severe adverse events following immunization (AEFI) have been reported. A report of rapid review and analysis has been submitted to NEGVAC (National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19) for 1,356 (1,236 Covishield, 118 Covaxin and 2 Sputnik) severe AEFI cases, while the remaining cases are still under review. The Court, while issuing notice on the petition on August 9 was conscious of vaccine hesitancy in rural areas and said, “Our apprehension is that a detailed enquiry into this issue will amount to throwing a spanner into what already exists leading to more doubts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-offers-vaccine-support-to-african-nations-battling-omicron-101638209911097.html
29-11-2021||India||China began work on LAC long before standoff, says Tibetan researchers’ report||A year before the People’s Liberation Army attempted to unilaterally alter the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, Chinese authorities were putting in place measures to use border villages to buttress their territorial claims and keep an eye on the Indian side of the border. This trend was picked up by a group of Tibetan researchers who worked for the past two years on putting together a handbook aimed at helping the world to decipher China’s policies that are often vaguely worded and open to different interpretations. As they put together material for the handbook – titled Decoding Chinese Communist Party – to be released on December 2, the researchers came across several reports on the Chinese side’s focus on using border villages as a means to project force along the frontier. One such report in Tibetan from August 2019, circulated on Chinese instant messaging apps and websites, was on border patrols and propaganda activities at Geru village in Shigatse prefecture, bordering India’s Sikkim state. The report quoted Phurbu Sonam, deployed as the first party secretary in Geru, which is described as a “border defence village”, as saying: “These days, Geru residents have a strong consciousness that everyone is a spy and every household is a spy house.” “The bond between the soldiers and the local residents is as deep as the fish and water,” Sonam added. Every Monday, permanent Chinese cadres stationed in Geru organised a ceremony at the border pillar to hoist the Chinese flag and sing the national anthem. To assist border defences forces, about 100 people from the village conducted regular border patrols on motorcycles. Tsering Tsomo, executive director of the Tibetan Human Rights Centre, which put together the handbook, said the five researchers who worked on the project picked up more such reports that pointed to China’s intentions along the LAC. The Chinese side is not only attempting to recruit Tibetans, but also trying to ensure the loyalty of their communities. “This requires social engineering on a large scale, giving border communities top priority for employment and finance for enterprises, and creating villages intended to create abiding dependence and loyalty,” she said. “This handbook is a tool to help people assess the intentions of the Chinese side. Many countries haven’t devoted adequate resources to understanding China. The handbook unpacks the meanings and connotations of Chinese slogans and popular phrases. For example, ‘Xi Jinping Thought’ is several volumes long and open to interpretation,” Tsomo added. For instance, the Tibetan researchers contend that India is the clear concern of China’s new land border law enacted in October. The law, which takes effect in January, will consolidate the securitisation of China’s land borders, the researchers said. While China has land borders with 14 countries, it has unsettled boundaries only with India and Bhutan. The law has strong punitive clauses forbidding activities such as flying drones near the border, mandating military exclusion zones and authorising security agencies to open fire at anyone believed to have committed a crime. Article 53 of the law, the researchers contend, is aimed at authorising a Chinese security presence in countries in the neighbourhood. Article 11, they said, is aimed at pushing Tibetan nomads into villages in border districts and making key border prefectures, such as Shigatse and Lhoka, into zones where loyalty to China is required. Other articles establish a very different kind of long-term securitisation, which requires inhabitants of border prefectures to undertake profound culture change. This is aimed at pushing local communities such as Tibetans to drop their own identity and identify first and foremost as Chinese, the researchers believe. Tsomo said Chinese ethnic policy has “abandoned the fiction that China comprises 56 nationalities, many with territories within which regional ethnic autonomy is legally guaranteed”, and this has been replaced with efforts aimed at cultural assimilation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-began-work-on-lac-long-before-standoff-says-tibetan-researchers-report-101638209910072.html
29-11-2021||India||South African’s Covid sample different from delta: Karnataka health minister||Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Monday said the sample of one of the South African nationals, who tested positive for Covid-19, is ‘different from the Delta variant’. Refusing to further divulge details, the minister said that he is in touch with the Union health ministry and the Indian Council for Medical Research officials.“There is a 63-year-old man whose name I should not disclose. His report is a bit different. It appears different from the Delta variant. We will discuss with the ICMR officials and will let people know what it is,” the minister told reporters in Bengaluru.Two travellers from South Africa tested positive for Covid-19 in Bengaluru and their samples have been sent for genome sequencing to determine the variant. Officials said they tested positive for Covid during the RT-PCR tests conducted at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). The first passenger arrived in Bengaluru on November 11 and the second arrived on November 16. Both were in quarantine after the positive result, according to health department officials.A new variant of the coronavirus, classified as Omicron, has spread in several parts of South Africa, forcing many countries to shut their borders. India has instituted a mandatory test-on-arrival, and a 7-day quarantine thereafter if people are negative.“We have sent the sample to a central government laboratory and are waiting for the final information. We are taking every possible step to contain the spread of the new mutant strain. However, it is said to be spreading rapidly and I’m afraid we cannot stop it as India sees an influx of millions of people every day, being a large country. What we can do, however, is contain it,” the minister added.The minister said he would chair meetings on Tuesday with the officers of his department, from the principal secretary to the Primary Health Centre level doctors, regarding the steps to be taken. He added that members of the Technical Advisory Committee on Covid-19 have also been invited to the meeting.Sudhakar also said that he has sought a detailed report on the Omicron variant. “We will get clear information on December 1 about how the Omicron behaves after the genomic sequencing. Accordingly, we will initiate all measures,” he explained.Sudhakar said international travellers will be tested carefully and those tested positive will be hospitalised compulsorily. “We are tracking and closely watching all those who came from South Africa in the past 14 days. We have started tracing and testing their primary and secondary contacts since Saturday,” the minister said.Speaking about Omicron, Sudhakar, a medical professional, said he has spoke to doctors working in South Africa, who told him that the new variant is not as dangerous as the Delta variant.“The satisfying thing I came across after talking to my classmates in South Africa is that this (Omicron variant) spreads rapidly, but it is not as dangerous as Delta. People feel nausea and vomiting and sometimes the pulse rate goes up, but the loss of taste and smell is not there. There is less hospitalisation because its intensity is not severe,” Sudhakar said.To be sure, experts have said it may be too soon to make conclusions about the nature of the variant and the disease it causes since cases may have not had the time to progress to severe stages. The minister also clarified on the speculation that there may be a fresh lockdown, saying there was no such proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/south-african-s-covid-sample-different-from-delta-karnataka-health-minister-101638209788634.html
29-11-2021||India||Bengaluru: Covid patients’ bodies found in morgue 15 months later||Health officials in Bengaluru recovered two decomposing bodies from an old mortuary in the city’s Rajajinagar on Saturday.According to their death certificates, the two people died of Covid-19 in July last year. The bodies were discovered when a foul smell at the ESI hospital mortuary led hospitalworkers on Saturdayto open the freezers, said officials of the health department. The mortuary was put out of use in August 2021,since a new mortuary was operational, according to the officials. The freezers, however, are still functional. The name tags on the bodies identified the people as Durga, 40, and Maniraju, 50, said the officials. According to ESI hospital records, both were brought to the hospital with Covid-19 symptoms in July 2020. Both of them died the same month. Durga’s elder sister Sujatha said that she died four days after being taken to the hospital. “After she died hospital authorities said that they won’t hand over the body to use because of the guidelines. Two days later we got a call saying they had cremated her body,” she said.Maniraju’s son, Satish, said the hospital told them they would cremate the body according to guidelines. “When we asked them (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) for the body after his death, they said they will cremate the body. So, when we went to collect the death certificate, they asked to sign a document which said that government had performed the last rites,” he said.At the peak of first wave of the pandemic last year, the BBMP took over some hospitals in the state and bodies were handed over to the families owing to infection risks. The families of the people who succumbed to the infection were assured the government would undertake the last rites. According to the health department, the government hospital that comes under the labour department has two mortuaries. The old one could only store four bodies, while a newly constructed mortuary could accommodate 10 bodies. “During the peak of the pandemic, in 2020, both mortuaries were used to store bodies. Following the pandemic, in August 2021, the old mortuary was shut down for operations,” said the health department official. A probe has been ordered to find out how the bodies were neglected for over a year, the official added. “There is clear negligence from all those who were involved. The staff members who didn’t check freezers before the shutting down the facility to (medical) superintendent who is responsible for the incident, will be investigated,” said the official, who didn’t want to be named. Rajajinagar police have registered a case under unnatural death and are probing the matter, said police officials. Police officials said that both bodies have been sent for postmortem and will be handed over to the families. Rajajinagar BJP MLA and former minister S Suresh Kumar has written to Karnataka labour minister A Shivaram Hebbar requesting him to get the matter investigated and punish those responsible for the “inhuman incident”. In his letter, Kumar said that during the first wave of Covid-19 two people died in the ESI Hospital in July 2020 and their bodies are still rotting in the mortuary of the hospital. “The role of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanaara Palike and the ESI authorities is grave. In this regard, I request you order a high-level probe, get the detailed inquiry report and initiate stringent action against those who are responsible for this inhumane act,” Kumar wrote. Kumar added that such incidents should never occur anywhere. “During the peak of COVID-19, we came across various heart-wrenching incidents but the incident that came to the light in the ESI Hospital is most unfortunate. It is the height of irresponsibility and inhuman behaviour,” Kumar wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-covid-patients-bodies-found-in-morgue-15-months-later-101638209729785.html
29-11-2021||India||Supreme Court raps states for delay in forming Covid aid portals||Two months since ex gratia payments were made mandatory for the families of those who died due to Covid-19, several states are yet to set up portals to receive applications, while some are still finding out who constitute the “next of kin” to whom the ₹50,000 compensation can be given, according to a status report submitted to the Supreme Court.Maharashtra, with an official death toll of about 140,000, is in the process of developing a web-based application to disbursing the ex-gratia relief. Kerala, the state with the second highest death toll of over 38,000 has a portal to receive claims but has not started the disbursal because it can’t ascertain who to give the amount to. Meanwhile, nearly a dozen states have not supplied any information on the claims received and the compensation paid. This information was part of the status report compiled by the ministry of home affairs (MHA), the nodal ministry for the national disaster management authority (NDMA), submitted to the Court on Saturday.Taking up the report in a petition filed by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal – which led to the October 4 order making ex-gratia payments mandatory – a bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said: “From the aforesaid it can be presumed either no wide publicity has been given by the concerned states or UTs with regard to the compensation offered for death of a person who had died due to Covid-19 or the concerned claimant is not made aware where to apply.”The bench listed states which have reported low claims, those yet to share information, and sought details on eight counts – compliance of October 4 order; procedure adopted to invite applications for ex-gratia relief; deaths recorded; claims received; compensation given; setting up of a compliance framework; details of online portals; publicity given to the scheme; and details of where the compensation can be collected. The court asked for information to be with Centre, and filed by chief secretaries of the states in an affidavit before the top court on December 6, the next date of hearing.The numbers from several states suggested there was a huge lag in claims and payments.According to the report, in Madhya Pradesh, out of the over 10,00 recorded deaths, only 937 claims were received. In West Bengal, this number is just 124 for over 19,000 deaths. Karnataka, which reported 38,182 deaths, received 14,237 claims, of which 3,900 were processed. The bench noted that some states, such as Tamil Nadu, had a high death toll but did not provide information on disbursal. According to the status report, Telangana, Bihar, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh were among the regions who did not provide disbursement information.Delhi, which witnessed 31,017 deaths, received 25,358 claims of which 19,926 have been processed, according to the data submitted. The bench said that there was no uniformity in the practices adopted by states and UTs in implementing its order. “Appropriate orders can be passed after hearing the states so that procedure for providing compensation shall be followed uniformly pan-India,” it said. The bench also expressed concern over how children orphaned due to Covid-19 can receive compensation. Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta informed the court that this issue was pending before another bench of the top court in a suo motu proceeding. Incidentally, that case too was listed on Monday, with the court directing states to ensure the education of children who lost one or both parents due to Covid-19 did not suffer due to financial stress. The Centre filed an affidavit informing the court that, till November 23, the PM CARES scheme received 5,335 applications for financial relief to children orphaned due to Covid and 2,705 these have been approved by concerned district magistrates, and 1,503 postal accounts have been opened for the transfer of funds.The PM CARES for Children scheme promises health insurance and educational facilities to children who lost both or a single parent due to Covid-19. The benefits include cost of education, uniform, books, and health insurance cover under Ayushman Bharat till the age of 18 years. On turning 18, they will be entitled to a monthly stipend and a fund of ₹10 lakh per child when they are 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-raps-states-for-delay-in-forming-covid-aid-portals-101638209728536.html
29-11-2021||India||‘Be alert to threat of Omicron’: PM Modi warns amid rising concerns||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday urged Indians to remain vigilant against Omicron, the Sars-CoV-2 mutation first detected in Africa that has been designated a variant of concern by the World Health Organization.“We should be alert to the new variant. I also request all members of Parliament and you also to be alert because everyone’s health is our priority in this hour of crisis,” Modi said in an address to the media ahead of the winter session of Parliament. “We have administered more than 100 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines during the challenging times of the pandemic. Now we are moving towards 150 crore doses.”Modi said the government’s priority has been to ensure the health of people. On Saturday, the Prime Minister chaired a high-level meeting that lasted almost two hours to review public health preparedness and Covid-19 vaccination.Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, principal secretary to the Prime Minister PK Mishra, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul attended the meeting, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.No cases of the Omicron variant have been detected in India so far.During the meeting, officials briefed Modi about the new variant of concern, designated as B.1.1.529 and latter named Omicron, along with its characteristics and the impact seen in various countries. Its implications for India were also discussed, and Modi spoke about the need to be proactive in light of the new variant. He added that people need to more cautious and take precautions such as masking and social distancing.He also highlighted the need for monitoring all international arrivals, and their testing as per guidelines with a specific focus on countries identified as “at risk”. Modi spoke about the need to increase genome sequencing efforts and make it more broad-based, and directed officials to work closely with state governments to ensure that there is proper awareness at the state and district levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-alert-to-threat-of-omicron-pm-modi-warns-amid-rising-concerns-101638209668833.html
29-11-2021||India||Speaker can’t permit merger of 12 Meghalaya MLAs with non-existent TMC: Cong||The Congress on Monday asked Meghalaya assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh to disqualify its 12 MLAs, who recently merged with the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC).Also Read | Congress loses 12 Meghalaya MLAs in a huge jolt. They team up with Mamata’s TMCAmpareen Lyngdoh, the newly elected Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader, asked the Speaker to initiate the procedure for acting on a petition for disqualification under Rule 7 of the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly (Disqualification on Ground of Defection) Rules, 1988 and to rule in its favour.Also Read | Congress, Mukul Sangma trade barbs amid rumblings in MeghalayaAmpareen was also accompanied by Meghalaya Congress chief and Shillong MP Vincent H Pala, two MLAs Mohendro Rapsang and Process T Sawkmie, former chief of Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) PN Syiem and senior advocate VGK Kynta.The Congress suffered a big jolt after 12 of its 17 MLAs led by former chief minister Mukul Sangma announced that they have exited the party and merged with the Trinamool Congress last week. The Speaker is yet to give his ruling on the letter of merger submitted by the former Congress legislators.Also Read | Kharge says Congress high command will look into Meghalaya ‘conspiracy’After meeting the Speaker, Ampareen Lyngdoh told reporters that no political party should allow this kind of an exodus that discredits the political structure and asserted that the merger needs to be evaluated before it is accepted “because we still see no parent body for them (12 MLAs) to merge with”.“We are challenging this so-called merger of 12 Congress MLAs with the Trinamool. How can this be allowed? That is the first question that we are asking the Speaker to consider,” Ampareen said.Stating that there are many aspects of the 10th Schedule which need to be taken into consideration before this merger is actually permitted, the CLP leader said, “(This is because) we fail to see the presence of the Trinamool Congress…in operation in the state of Meghalaya.”She added, “We don’t know who is the president, who their members are, we don’t know where their office is, we don’t know whether they have an address, if any communication is to be given to this group.”Ampareen further questioned if the 12 MLAs have resigned from the Congress before merging with Trinamool Congress.“…Have they given us their resignation letters, have they placed on record any point of contention, was there any anger, was there any feeling of being not heard, is there any written agenda that they hold, that makes them want to take this extreme step of working behind our backs and betraying us – this is something we are taking note of. We hope that we will be given an opportunity through our legal team to question the loyalty of these individuals. When you question loyalty, you automatically calculate and know that if they are not loyal today, they will never be loyal ever,” she stated.She said the party has also requested the Speaker to again look at this whole question of less than two-third under paragraph 4 of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India adding that the party’s legal team will also be arguing whether it is 17 or 19 MLAs.“…if you look at all these grey areas in the particular merger of the 12 MLAs of the Congress, we feel that there will be enough grounds to fight for disqualification of these individuals,” the Congress leader claimed.She continued, “Our basic thrust in filing our petition is to ensure that we also give an opportunity to the Speaker’s office to review the 10th Schedule and adaptation of the rules of the 10th Schedule by the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly in the long run so that the 10th Schedule is not being played around by political ploy of this kind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speaker-can-t-permit-merger-of-12-meghalaya-mlas-with-non-existent-tmc-cong-101638208408627.html
29-11-2021||India||Niti Aayog report on Bihar: Nitish aide seeks greater central assistance||A key aide of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday expressed indignation over NITI Aayog presenting the state in poor light in one of its recent reports and wondered why more central assistance was not coming to expedite economic uplift of the province. Ashok Choudhary, who holds building construction portfolio in the state cabinet, underscored the all-round progress made under Kumar's decade and a half long tenure and said "we wish to protest...like a student who has scored 90 per cent in tests and yet is being told by the teacher that he is a laggard". Choudhary was reacting to the NITI Aayog's multidimensional poverty index report, which was released last week, and wherein Bihar, along with Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, has been placed at the bottom. The report has provided fresh ammunition to the opposition, led by the RJD of Kumar’s arch-rival Lalu Prasad, who has been rubbishing the claim of the current dispensation that it has achieved an economic turnaround in the state which has been clocking a growth rate of more than 10 per cent for over a decade. Choudhary pointed out that India Today magazine had published a report of a survey of states in which Bihar was placed at the top in terms of improvement in education, health and infrastructure. "As far as NITI Aayog report is concerned, it is silent on the parameters it has chosen for ranking the states," he said. Choudhary, who had earlier served in the cabinet of Rabri Devi and Nitish Kumar from the Congress quota before walking over the latter’s JD(U) a few years ago, also said the NITI Aayog should facilitate greater central assistance for Bihar to speed up the economic progress. "If NITI Aayog is convinced that Bihar is lagging behind other states, why does it not back our demand for greater central aid," said the JD(U) leader whose party has for long been seeking special category status for the state and complaining of inadequate support from the Centre. He also mocked attempts by leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav to corner the government on the basis of NITI Aayog report. “I think he (Tejashwi) needs a bit of education. He should look at the statistics and study what was the condition of Bihar before the NDA came to power and how far have we come," Choudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niti-aayog-report-on-bihar-nitish-aide-seeks-greater-central-assistance-101638207511197.html

29-11-2021||India||Omicron probably indicates Covid is now endemic: 3 things experts say on this new variant||The entire picture of new Covid variant omicron is not yet clear as studying the cases will take some time, but from the information available so far, scientists and experts in India are gauging the possible extent of the impact of the variant. The variant has not been confirmed in India, though Karnataka has raised alarm on Monday over a Covid case reported in a 63-year-old South African person. Karnataka health minister said the variant pattern is not matching with Delta. Apart from Karnataka, some cases in Maharashtra are also being closely watched.Here are 3 things that experts are guessing about Omicron:Very good at spreadingImmunologist Satyajit Rath told news agency PTI that he guesses the variant will be spreading very fast. Public policy expert Chandrakant Lahariya explained that Omicron has around 50 mutations, which potentially make the variant more transmissible. Out of these 50 mutations, 32 are in spike proteins, which the virus uses to enter the human cells, and 10 are mutations of high relevance. "These include H655Y, N679K and P681H mutations which potentially increase the transmissibility. The mutations R203K and G204R are being considered to be associated with higher infectivity. Similarly, there are deletions at NSP6, which could result in immune escape," Lahariya said.Omicron: List of 'at risk' countries and situation in IndiaNot severe diseaseSatyajit Rath told PTI that according to his understanding, the variant will not cause a more severe disease. The effectiveness of vaccines may get reduced by the new variant, but they will not be rendered ineffective by the variant.Possible indication that Covid is becoming endemicDirector general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Dr Shekhar C Mande, told news agency ANI that the new variant and the situation is concerning but not alarming. Indicating that this might be a sign that Covid is now endemic, Dr Mande said, "If you look at the history of all the infectious diseases, it does happen that viral disease, particularly initially, causes pandemics and over a period of time they become endemic." Endemic means when a disease or infection keep coming every year, but in a milder form.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-probably-indicates-covid-is-now-endemic-3-things-experts-say-on-this-new-variant-101638205804136.html
29-11-2021||India||India offers vaccines, medical supplies to support African countries hit by Omicron variant||India on Monday offered to supply Covid-19 vaccines, life-saving drugs, test kits and medical equipment to African countries to fight the new Omicron variant of the Coronavirus.Omicron has been designated a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO), based on evidence that it has several mutations that may impact how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes.“The government of India stands ready to support the countries affected in Africa in dealing with the Omicron variant, including by supplies of made-in-India vaccines,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement, adding that supplies can be delivered through the WHO-backed COVAX facility or bilaterally.“India also stands ready to supply essential life-saving drugs, test kits, gloves, PPE kits and medical equipment such as ventilators, as may be required,” the statement said. Indian institutions will “favourably consider cooperation in genomic surveillance and virus characterisation related research work” with African counterparts.The statement noted that the Indian government has cleared all orders placed so far by COVAX for supplies of the Covishield vaccine, including to African countries such as Malawi, Ethiopia, Zambia, Mozambique, Guinea and Lesotho. The government also cleared supplies of Covaxin to Botswana, and any new requirement projected bilaterally or through COVAX will be considered expeditiously, according to the statement.India expressed solidarity with countries, particularly in Africa, that have so far been affected by the Omicron variant.India has so far supplied more than 25 million doses of made-in-India vaccines to 41 countries in Africa, including nearly one million doses as grants to 16 countries and more than 16 million doses under the COVAX facility to 33 countries.The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa. WHO has said it is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible than other variants such as Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, and epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-offers-vaccines-medical-supplies-to-support-african-countries-hit-by-omicron-variant-101638204689736.html
29-11-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee to amend TMC’s constitution to accommodate leaders from other states||Taking forward her plans to contest elections in Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states, Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee on Monday decided to amend her party’s constitution so that leaders from other states can be accommodated in the working committee that she heads. The decision was taken at a meeting of the working committee held at Banerjee’s south Kolkata residence where she announced the TMC’s formation in 1998, months after severing ties with the Congress. Since then, leaders from Bengal have run the party with Banerjee taking all crucial decisions. Monday’s meeting was attended by former Union minister Yashwant Sinha, who joined TMC in March, former Janata Dal (United) Rajya Sabha member Pavan Varma, former Congress MP from Haryana, Ashok Tanwar, former Meghalaya chief minister Mukul Sangma, who joined the TMC along with 11 Congress legislators on November 24, and top TMC leaders. Former tennis star Leander Paes, who recently joined the TMC in Goa where the party will contest the coming assembly polls, was also present. “Right now, all members of the TMC working committee are from West Bengal. Since our party is now expanding in other states, the leadership today decided to amend the constitution so that leaders from all regions can be inducted into the working committee,” TMC’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, said after the meeting. “How and when the constitution will be amended is to be decided by Mamata Banerjee. The next meeting of the working committee will be held in Delhi. These changes are necessary because TMC is expanding nationally,” O’Brien added.This is the first time leaders from the northeast and the Hindi belt are likely to find a place in the TMC’s working committee which is the highest decision-making body. Mamata Banerjee’s poll strategist Prashant Kishor is advising the party on these issues, party leaders said. Kishor has been meeting regional leaders for the last six months. The TMC announced late on Monday night that Mamata Banerjee has appointed Charles Pyngrope as president of the party’s Meghalaya unit. Party leaders, who did not want to be named, said Sushmita Dev, the Lok Sabha member from Assam who left the Congress and joined TMC in August, may be asked to head the TMC units in Tripura and Assam. TMC has already formed a separate steering committee in Tripura. The chief minister’s nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee is seen in the party as the driving force behind the expansion plan. He announced in October that TMC will set up working units in 15 states within a year. He also steered the campaign for the Tripura civic body elections the results of which were announced on Sunday. The TMC, which started from scratch less than six months ago, emerged second in overall vote share although it could win only one seat. The Bengal chief minister did not meet the media after Monday’s meeting. TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said, “Decisions taken by the working committee today will be communicated to leaders in Meghalaya, Goa and Tripura. In the two northeastern states, we have emerged as the main opposition force. The TMC is making these changes to meet the demands of the changing scenario.”A senior TMC leader, who did not want to be identified, said changes will be made in the organisation in Bengal as well during the next meeting of the state working committee. Reacting to the development, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “All parties aspire to expand. These decisions are internal matters of the TMC. Its leaders can always visit Delhi and hold working committee meetings while enjoying popular food but everybody knows who will address the nation from the Red Fort after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.”During the day, popular movie actor Shrabanti Chatterjee, who joined the BJP eight months ago and unsuccessfully contested the March-April assembly polls against Partha Chatterjee, returned to the TMC at a workers’ meeting at Gosaba in South 24 Parganas district. She announced on Twitter earlier this month that she was quitting the saffron camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-to-amend-tmc-s-constitution-to-accommodate-leaders-from-other-states-101638200608947.html

29-11-2021||India||After Opposition demand discussion on farm laws repeal bill, minister says decision unanimous||After the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 was passed in both Houses of Parliament on the first day of the Winter Session, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that the passage is a testament of uniformity in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words and deeds. Tomar lamented that the government failed to explain the benefits of the farm laws, saying the agricultural reforms were brought in for the betterment of farmers.The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 was passed by the Parliament amid huge uproar from Opposition parties as they wanted a discussion on the bills. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi lashed out at the government for not holding a discussion on the farm laws on the floor of the House. Gandhi alleged that the hasty passage of the bill shows that the government is “scared of discussion”, adding that the way the bill was passed was an insult to the farmers.“The way they (farm laws) were repealed, without discussion in the Parliament, no talk, this shows that the government is scared of discussion, that the government knows that they have done wrong. And that the government is scared,” Gandhi told reporters.Congress welcomes withdrawal of farm laws but questions Centre’s move to pass repeal bill without discussionTomar said that a detailed discussion was held after the three farms laws were introduced and the Opposition had then demanded the withdrawal of those laws. When the ruling party also agreed for withdrawal, Tomar opined, there was unanimity on the subject.“Lok Sabha Speaker repeatedly assured that he was ready to hold a discussion if members sit at their designated place,” said Tomar, adding that if there was a discussion, he would have certainly answered the questions posed by Opposition MPs.The BJP leader asserted that the central government has tried to help the agriculture sector through many schemes in the last seven years. He said that the minimum support price was implemented in accordance with the recommendations of the Swaminathan report and the procurement of crops at MSP has almost doubled as compared to 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-opposition-demand-discussion-on-farm-laws-repeal-bill-minister-says-decision-unanimous-101638197903263.html

The row is a non-issue to detract attention from this 'non-attractive' government's decision to not allow a discussion on the farm act repeal, Mahua Moitra wrote on Twitter. "Not surprised that a bunch of ugly trolls attacking @ShashiTharoor on a non-issue to detract attention from this non-attractive government’s decision to not allow a discussion on the farm act repeal," Moitra tweeted. Shashi Tharoor thanked Mahua for her solidarity. Not surprised that a bunch of ugly trolls attacking @ShashiTharoor on a non-issue to detract attention from this non-attractive government’s decision to not allow a discussion on the farm act repeal.The photo posted early in the day created a row, not because of the photo but Tharoor's use of the word 'attractive' in his comment. Apart from social media users, prominent figures weighed in with their opinion over the issue. As Supreme Court advocate Karuna Nandy slammed Tharoor and said it was unbelievable that Shashi Tharoor would attempt to reduce the women MPs to their looks, ace badminton player Jwala Gutta differed and said she thinks people need to take a few things on a lighter note. "Not really, Karuna. I think we need to take afew things on a lighter note..and not see everything with a magnifying glass..And this was a compliment to all the women in the Parliament which is generally stereotyped!! just my opinion," Jwala wrote. Obama said Kamala Harris was the 'most brilliant Attorney General & also the most attractive', he apologised for the comment. Because when women's looks are commented on, chance of being elected reduces. It's the wrong metric.

29-11-2021||India||Air India pilots warn of industrial action if demands not addressed in 3 days||Air India pilots have given an ultimatum of three days to the Air India management to meet their demands. In a letter to the aviation secretary (also Air India Chairman and managing director- Rajiv Bansal), sent on Monday evening, the pilots warned that if they do not see the illegal pay cut and related issues being addressed within three days, they will seek justice through industrial action.The letter was written by the airline’s Airbus’ union- Indian Commercial Pilots’ Guild (ICPA) and Boeing pilots union- Indian Pilots’ Guild (IPG) which represent over 900 pilots. It read, “International passenger services to/from India started from December 15th, 2021, and all airlines are rolling back the COVID cut, if we do not see the issues related to an illegal pay cut of 55% and the plethora of longstanding disinvestment issues addressed within three days we will have no choice but to seek justice through industrial action.”These pilots have been writing to the airline since October but they haven’t received a reply. In their previous letters, the pilots complained that they are burdened by the “illegal pay cut” of 55% and demanded to be paid as per market standards. Mentioning their long-standing disinvestment issues, the pilots have also demanded the withheld 25% arrears with interest, statement of gratuity, an option of leave encashment, medical benefits for all permanent employees, tax implication on withheld layover substance allowance and release of pending grades to first officers.“Tatas have to fully take over the company and start flying by January 22, 2022, and here we have no communication on our pending dues. Media reports suggest that the airline’s closing date will be just next month. How much more are we expected to sit quietly?” an airline said on condition of anonymity. Another pilot said, “We are thrilled that Tatas will soon begin to operate the airline but the current management seems to be turning a deaf ear to us. This is a great matter of concern to us and hence we seek an urgent response,” said a senior airline pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-pilots-warn-of-industrial-action-if-demands-not-addressed-in-3-days-101638196049067.html

And that the government is scared.” He added that how the bill was passed is an insult to the farmers.He further said that the withdrawal of the farm laws is the success of the farmers of the country who have been protesting against the farm laws for over a year.“We wanted to discuss MSP (issue), we wanted to discuss the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, we wanted to discuss the 700 farmers who died in this agitation and unfortunately that discussion has not been allowed,” Gandhi said.The Congress leader further hinted that the decision to withdraw the farm laws has something to do with the upcoming legislative elections in seven states including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.He asked if the government was in support of the farmers, then why did the 700 farmers have to die for the government to repeal the laws.Gandhi said the farmers’ still have a long list of unfulfilled demands. This includes a legal guarantee of MSP, action against Ajay Misra and compensation for the families of farmers who lost their lives during the one-year-long protest.“The PM has accepted that the farmers died because of his decision. So, compensation must be given,” Gandhi added.In the Upper House, the Congress did not, however, have much to say. Congress’ leader in the house Mallikarjun Kharge said all parties agreed on the bill and no one was opposed to it.The Congress, which supported the farmers’ demand all along, held a protest in front of the Gandhi statue in the Parliament House complex earlier today, carrying banners that read “We demand repeal of black farm laws.”The BJP pointed out that Congress’s protest was “fake”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insult-to-farmers-rahul-gandhi-over-no-debate-in-parliament-on-farm-laws-101638195569037.html

29-11-2021||India||60-year old man’s timely alert saved hundreds from Kadapa floods||A timely alert by a 60-year old man saved hundreds of lives on the night of November 19, when devastating floods, caused due to the breach of the earthen bund of Annamayya project reservoir on Cheyyeru river in Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district, swept away several villages downstream.Parna Ramaiah, a retired watchman of the Annamayya project, is now being treated as a messiah by the people of Togurupeta, Ramachandrapuram and Salipeta villages of Rajampet constituency, as they would have been swept away by the swirling waters of Cheyyeru river while they were still asleep but for the timely alert from him.Ramaiah, who retired from service in June this year on superannuation, has been staying at his house at Togurupeta village, about half a kilometre from the dam. He has two acres of land on which he was growing turmeric.“Even after my retirement, I have been continuing to keep a vigil on the project, as it has become a part of my life for the last three decades. Though I suffered a fracture to my leg three months ago, I have not stopped visiting the dam site regularly,” he told Hindustan Times.Narrating the events of the fateful day, Ramaiah said due to heavy rains upstream of the river, the inflows into Annamayya reservoir was gradually increasing since the morning of November 18.“The irrigation authorities were controlling the floods by releasing four of the five crest gates of the dam after assessing the inflows. By 8.30 pm, the water level reached 200 metres and within an hour, the water level came down to 190 metres, as all the gates were completely lifted,” he said.But around 1.30 am on November 19, there was a massive flood to the dam. “In my three-decades-long service, I had never seen such a heavy flood and the reservoir was overflowing and the earthen bund started caving in. I alerted my son, who, with the help of a couple of irrigation officials, brought my family members to the upper part of the concrete dam,” he recalled.Ramaiah immediately started calling whoever he knew in the three villages downstream of the dam – Togurupeta, Ramachandrapuram and Salipeta. “I told them to wake up all the villagers and ask them to rush to the nearby hillock, where a temple of Dasalamma (local village deity) is located. Within an hour, all the villagers were moved to the hillock,” he said.Ramaiah also tried to contact the sarpanch of Pulaputhur village on the other side of the reservoir and after repeated attempts, he succeeded in talking the sarpanch, who immediately alerted all his villages who also rushed to the hillock.“By 4 am, the earthen bund started eroding gradually. By 5.30 am, the entire bund got washed away and floodwaters gushed into the villages with massive force. Several villages downstream were completely inundated, causing massive destruction to crops, cattle and poultry. Hundreds of houses were razed to rubble,” Ramaiah said.Gunisetty Mani of Togurupeta village said nobody in the village would have survived had Ramaiah not alerted them on time. “We were all in deep sleep and we didn’t have any hint about the threat to the dam. It was only receiving a call from Ramaiah that we could realise the magnitude of the situation and save ourselves by rushing to the Dasalamma temple on the adjacent hill,” Mani said.Another villager J Sivaramaiah said he had been alert all through the night due to heavy rains and when he got a call from Ramaiah about the breach to Annamayya project, he rushed to every house and told the people to shift to the hill. “I also made a quick visit to the adjacent villages of Ramachandrapuram and Salipeta and alerted the people,” he said.After the floods receded, the villagers came down from the hill, only to find their villages turning into virtual graveyards. “Not a single house withstood the flood fury. We have lost everything – money, gold, food grains, clothes, household articles, furniture. We are now at the mercy of the government,” Ramaiah said.Kadapa district collector V Vijayarama Raju, in his report submitted to the state government, attributed the flash floods to Cheyyeru due to heavy rains, up to 10.7 cm in just 12 hours, which was unprecedented.“The Pincha project upstream of Annamayya reservoir was receiving an inflow of only 3,845 cusecs at 8.30 am on November 18. But by evening, the inflow increased to 90,464 cusecs in one hour by 8.30 pm, which further went up to 1.17 lakh cusecs, while its discharge capacity was only 48,000 cusecs. So, the Pincha project got breached first and resulted in massive flood to Annamayya project to the extent of 3.2 lakh cusecs which led to the collapse of the earthen bund,” he explained.The collector also claimed that the district authorities had alerted all the villagers by 6 pm on November 18 and as many as 400 families were shifted to safer locations. “Otherwise, the toll would have been higher,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60year-old-man-s-timely-alert-saved-hundreds-from-kadapa-floods-101638191967390.html

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana also defended the Congress party, saying it believed in democratic values. In his speech on the Constitution Day on November 26, PM Modi had said political parties run by families for generation after generation was not good for a healthy democracy . “How can the parties which have lost their democratic character protect democracy?,” he asked and said that dynasty politics could be seen from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in the country. Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana launched a counter attack while defending the Congress, believed to be the chief target of Modi’s attack on political dynasties.“The biggest threat to democracy is... to come to power democratically and rule in an autocratic manner. Congress party believes in democratic values. Yes, there can be political differences with the Congress, but it has not sold the pillars of democracy,” the editorial said.The editorial added that the PM’s attack on the Congress party, which had weakened substantially in the past 10 years, suggested he feared the party could be an alternative to the BJP nationally.“...Repeatedly attacking the party [the Congress] means that Prime Minister Modi still fears the Congress, and it can be an alternative to the BJP at the national level,” it said. Also Read: Rajya Sabha passes farm laws repeal bill amid uproarThe editorial further remarked that the Bharatiya Janata Party was no different as it was “controlled” by people chosen by the PM. “BJP is not a family party, but in the past few years, it has become a dictatorship of one particular group. After Mr Modi became the Prime Minister, a leader from Gujarat was made the party chief. This arrangement was made so that the reins of the party and power remain in his hand. Congress’ reins in the hands of Gandhi family is akin to BJP’s reins in the hands of people who are under the Prime Minister’s thumb,” the Saamana piece said.As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of the BJP does not respond to criticism or remarks made in Saamana editorials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-not-very-different-from-family-run-parties-claims-shiv-sena-101638185786967.html

This needs to be seen in the context that a new variant is coming and with time only we will get to know more information about it. Therefore relevance and effectiveness of the current vaccines will also become apparent with time only," news agency ANI quoted Arora as saying on Monday.Arora also explained the difference between a booster dose and an additional shot. "A booster dose is given in a predefined period after two primary doses. Whereas, an additional dose is only given to those people who have problems with their immune function even after the primary doses. If a person's immune function is not appropriately built you give them an additional dose. So these are two different things," he added.Top AIIMS doctor pushes for booster shots as experts scramble over new Covid-19 variantThe doctor also said, “a comprehensive plan for immunising 44 crore children below the age of 18 years will be made public soon.” Arora added that children with comorbidities will be prioritised and vaccinated first, followed by healthy children.His remarks came when health experts across the world are scrambling to study the new variant of Covid-19 that was first detected in South Africa's Botswana on November 11, 2021. It has been declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation.On Saturday, a senior doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Delhi, said booster shots will need to be administered in the coming days and immediate studies must be commenced to ascertain its effectiveness on various age groups. Chairperson of the Covid-19 task force, AIIMS Delhi, Dr Naveet Wig, also gave Israel as a case study and said studies have shown vaccine effectiveness after the booster dose increases significantly -- from 40 per cent to 93 per cent.Notably, many countries across the world are administering booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine, including the US, Germany, Austria, Canada and France among others as a precautionay measure amid the ongoing pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policy-on-booster-additional-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-2-weeks-dr-nk-arora-101638183819258.html

The government's report on the ruckus states that a male marshal was choked by CPM MP Elamaran Kareem while a female marshal of the Rajya Sabha was assaulted by Chhaya Verma and Phulo Devi Netam, Congress MPs. The report was submitted to the Rajya Sabha chairman after the House was suspended for the season.The suspension notice issued of the first day of the Winter Session said: “That this House takes cognisance and strongly condemns the utter disregard to the authority of the Chai, complete abuse of rules of the House persistently thereby wilfully obstructing the business of House through their unprecedented acts of misconduct, contemptuous, unruly and violent behaviour and intentional attacks on security personnel on the last day of 254th Session of Rajya Sabha (Monsoon Session) i.e, 11th August 2021 thereby lowering the dignity of and bringing disrepute to the August House by the following members and resolves, for above compelling reasons, to suspend these members from the service of the House for the remainder of the 255th session under rule 256 of Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Rajya Sabha.”Reacting to the suspension notice, Priyanka Chaturvedi on Monday said, “From district court to Supreme Court, an accused is heard even there, lawyers are provided for them too, sometimes government officials are sent to take their version. Here, our version wasn't taken. If you see the CCTV footage, it has been recorded how male marshals were jostling female MPs. All of this on one side and your decision on the other? What kind of unparliamentary behaviour is this?"Terming the suspension as unfair and unjust, Congress MP Chhaya Verma said there were members from other parties too who created the ruckus but have not been suspended.  “PM Modi is doing just as he wishes since he enjoys a brute majority,” the Congress MP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-rajya-sabha-mps-suspended-for-rest-of-winter-session-in-parliament-101638179743268.html

29-11-2021||India||Congress welcomes withdrawal of farm laws but questions Centre’s move to pass repeal bill without discussion||Congress veteran and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday said that his party welcomed the Union government’s move to repeal the three farm laws but expressed displeasure over the absence of debate in the house before passing the bill.The Centre passed The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, in both houses of Parliament on the first day of the Winter Session amid the protests and sloganeering by the Opposition demanding a debate. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar tabled the bill in both houses. However, the opposition parties, including Congress, had demanded a discussion around the bill.“We welcome withdrawal of the three farm laws. We demanded a discussion on several incidents that took place during agitation including the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and the electricity bill. Farmers are still present at the protest site,” news agency ANI quoted Kharge as saying.Also read | Rajya Sabha passes Farm Laws Repeal Bill without any discussionFurther, he also said that by passing the bills in a haste in Lok Sabha, the government intended to prove that they were in “favour” of the protesting farmers. “We want that there should be a discussion on the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021. But with the passing of this Bill in Lok Sabha in a haste, they (govt) just want to prove that they are in the favour of farmers,” he said. “Government is wrong in saying that there is never a discussion on Repeal Bills, therefore it will not allow discussion on Repeal of Farm Laws Bill,” he added.Meanwhile, leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury called the passage of bills “Mann Ki Baat” in reference to the lack of discussion before it. “The government blames us for not letting the House function. But Farm Laws Repeal Bill 2021 was introduced and passed without discussion. Opposition had demanded a discussion on it. Even though the government has repealed the farm laws, its 'Mann ki Baat' is something else,” he said.Earlier in the day, the Congress party, led by its interim president Sonia Gandhi protested at the Parliament house against the Centre demanding the repeal of the farm laws.Another opposition party, the Trinamool Congress, too protested at Parliament house demanding a discussion on the repeal bill and alleged that the Centre was “afraid” to discuss. “TMC wanted to have a discussion on the Farm Laws Repeal Bill but the government is afraid to discuss the conditions of the farmers. Government is not giving Opposition a chance to speak on behalf of the farmers,” TMC minister Kalyan Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-welcomes-withdrawal-of-farm-laws-but-questions-centre-s-move-to-pass-repeal-bill-without-discussion-101638177312991.html

What led to a row over the photo was the caption that Tharoor used. "Who says the Lok Sabha isn't an attractive place to work?" Tharoor wrote as he posted the photo.The whole selfie thing was done (at the women MPs' initiative) in great good humour & it was they who asked me to tweet it in the same spirit. I am sorry some people are offended but i was happy to be roped in to this show of workplace camaraderie. That's all this is. https://t.co/MfpcilPmSBAccused of sexism, the Congress MP clarified that it was the initiative of the women MPs in the photo and they, as Tharoor said, asked Tharoor to tweet about the photo. "I am sorry some people are offended but I was happy to be roped in to this show of workplace camaraderie. That's all this is," the Thiruvananthapuram MP tweeted.As clear in the photo, the selfie was taken by Mimi Chakraborty while the rest posed happily for the selfie with Tharoor in the middle of them. The women MPs also shared Throor's post about ‘attractive place to work’ on their social media handles.  It minimises women in politics or aspiring to politics, Dr. Tharoor, and seems to make attractiveness the criteria. Intention isn't the point here."The whole selfie thing was done (at the women MPs' initiative) in great good humour & it was they who asked me to tweet it in the same spirit," Tharoor wrote.Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nandy exclaimed on social media that someone like Shashi Tharoor would "reduce elected political leaders to their looks, and centre himself in the comment to boot." "This is 2021, folks," Nandy wrote. After Shashi Tharoor's apologies and clarification, Nandy wrote the intent of the selfie is not the point. "It minimises women in politics or aspiring to politics, Dr Tharoor, and seems to make attractiveness the criteria."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-apologies-for-selfie-with-mimi-nusrat-and-other-woman-mps-after-backlash-101638175949454.html

It also said that there is no proposal to recognise bitcoin as a currency in the country.The response was given the form of a written reply in the Lok Sabha on a question on cryptocurrency. A legislation seeking regulation of cryptocurrency will be discussed in the winter session of Parliament, which began on Monday.The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, seeks to create a framework to regulate digital to be currency issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).According to the Lok Sabha website, the bill will also seek to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, barring certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its use.Currently, there is no regulation or ban in the country on cryptocurrency.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a meeting earlier this month where he discussed the issue with senior officials. The Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader member Jayant Sinha, met the representatives of crypto exchanges, blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), among others this month and arrived at a conclusion that cryptocurrencies should not be banned, but regulated.The Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly reiterated its strong views against cryptocurrencies, saying they pose serious threats to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country and also doubted the number of investors trading on them and their claimed market value.The RBI had announced its intent to come out with an official digital currency in the face of the proliferation of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.Cryptocurrencies work on blockchain technology - a decentralised ledger of transactions. This isn’t maintained or stored in one place or with any central authority. Instead, it is spread across a network of computers, also known as peer-to-peer networks.This system is used to authenticate transactions done using crypto coins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-proposal-to-recognise-bitcoin-as-currency-finance-ministry-says-in-lok-sabha-101638172366919.html

On Monday, Manickam Tagore, Congress’ Member of Parliament (MP) from Tamil Nadu, tweeted a May 28 video of Union minister Prakash Javadekar saying that India will be vaccinated by the end of 2021 and said that merely around 42 crore of the 108 crore eligible adults had been vaccinated in the country till now, making the task of fully vaccinating the entire adult population before December 31, challenging.“108 crore Indians needed to be twice vaccinated by Tuesday, but Fully vaccinated remains at 42 crore Indians. What they achieved? Who will be held responsible? When #Omicron on the way where bucks stop?” Tagore said in his first tweet on the issue before claiming that roughly 66 crore eligible Indians population was yet to be fully vaccinated. As per the Union health ministry data, more than 122 crore vaccine doses have been administered so far. In measures announced to mitigate the threat of the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa, the Central government has asked states to speed up the vaccination drive apart from tightening the screening and tracing protocols even as experts debate the amount of protection currently available vaccines are likely to offer against the new variant. Also Read | Omicron: PM Modi urges people to be alert, extends PMGKY till MarchAll India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) chief Dr Randeep Guleria has said that all vaccines against Covid-19 will have to be reviewed globally since most of them form antibodies against the spike protein and since Omicron has many mutations in the spike protein, it might render many vaccines less effective.On Saturday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had described the vaccination figures as “bad” while referring to the emergence of a new threat in Omicron variant. “[The] new variant is a serious threat. High time GOI (Government of India) gets serious about providing vaccine security to our countrymen. Bad vaccination figures can’t be hidden for long behind one man’s photo. #Omicron,” Rahul’s tweet said.

I am unable to step outside my house despite my doctors' recommendations and I seek to avoid the limelight at all costs now. My poor health doesn't allow me to go and do anything."My lawyers are fighting cases in both Antigua and Dominica and I have complete faith that I shall emerge victorious because I am an Antiguan Citizen who was kidnapped, abducted and taken against my will to a different country," he alleged."It is a matter of record the extent to which certain governments are willing to go to secure my presence, but I repose full faith in the legal systems of commonwealth countries and I'm sure that justice will prevail in the end," he added.Choksi had gone missing from Antigua on May 23 this year after going out for dinner and was soon caught in Dominica. He was charged with illegal entry by the police in Dominica after he allegedly escaped from Antigua and Barbuda in a possible attempt to evade extradition to India.Later on July 12, The Dominica High Court granted him interim bail on medical grounds.The 62-year-old fugitive is wanted in India in connection with a ₹13,500 crore fraud with the Punjab National Bank (PNB).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fugitive-diamantaire-mehul-choksi-fears-he-may-be-kidnapped-again-101638160882967.html

Modi last week announced the repeal of the laws and the Bill in this regard is expected to be tabled on Monday.Modi said the measure of the work done in Parliament should be the hours spent on discussion and debate and no disruptions. He hoped in the spirit of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav marking 75 years of India’s independence, lawmakers will find ways for the progress of the country. Modi added constructive decisions will be taken during the winter session. “I hope in future, how Parliament was run and how constructive the proceedings were should be the measure and not how it was disrupted,” he said. Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien criticised the PM for his latest remarks, calling his assurances “hollow words”. “You ran away from discussing #Pegasus and are responsible for disrupting full monsoon session. In Sept 2020, your govt broke every rule and bulldozed the #FarmLaws. The problem is no one in your Cabinet will tell you that #Parliament is not #MannKiBaat,” O’Brien tweeted.In the wake of reports about a new Covid-19 variant spreading, Modi asked the country to be more vigilant and alert. He said the country is inching towards getting 150 crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-is-ready-to-face-all-questions-in-parliament-says-pm-modi-101638163645753.html

But the big people like Thakur and Thakar keep their women confined to homes and do not let them go out. They should pull them out from their houses because both men and women should work equally,” said Sahu, a tribal, on Thursday.Chouhan on Sunday said he called Sahu and he has publicly apologised for his statement. “Whatever the sentiment, the message should not go wrong. Every word should be spoken carefully. I have warned all the ministers and MLAs (members of legislative assembly) that such statements should not be given under any circumstances.” He added anything that sends a wrong message to the people will not be forgiven whoever the person may be.

A significant part of these land were occupied illegally. In some cases, the lands of temple and Maths were already sold,” Kumar said.He added that there were several cases of cheating gullible buyers, who do not know that the land of temples and Maths can’t be sold by any individual. By the time buyers learn the truth, the sellers disappear from the scene, he added.“This is why it has been made clear that lands of temples and Maths are owned by the deity of the shrine and that it should be declared public land and any transaction of sale and purchase of such land by any individual is illegal,” he said.Also Read: Bihar govt directs officials to conduct genome study, increase vaccination to tackle new Covid variantBesides, there’s an effort to get all other temples and Maths under the purview of the Religious Trust Board, the law minister added.The association of priests said they will not accept government control on the land of the shrines. “The decision to declare it as public land is not in good taste. Priests of the shrines should be given the responsibility to manage it,” the association said. The association includes priests from Kabir Math, Parbatta ( Khagaria), Udasin Akhara , Phulwarisharif, state capital based Baba Bhikham Das Thakurbari and Ayodhyadas Thakurbari, Kabir Math of Rajgir, and Bihar Sanskritik Vidyapeeth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-priests-protest-move-to-declare-30-000-acres-of-temple-land-as-public-101638160465568.html

29-11-2021||India||Maharashtra may impose 7-day quarantine for passengers from SA||Maharashtra is likely to announce seven-day institutional quarantine for passengers arriving directly from South Africa or transiting through the country, which was the first to report the latest Omicron variant of the coronavirus, considered to be more transmittable than the previous Covid -19 mutations. The state is also likely to make a negative RT-PCR test mandatory for entry of domestic travellers, according to senior state officials. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, in a review meeting with the district collectors and municipal commissioners, said they could go ahead with immediate imposition of quarantine rules without waiting for the Centre to announce new guidelines. Thackeray chaired the meeting from a Mumbai hospital where he is recuperating following a spine surgery. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has suggested imposing 14-day institutional quarantine for passengers from geographies of concern in Africa. However, the state is expected to approve a seven-day quarantine. Detailed guidelines are expected to be issued in a couple of days, officials said. “A large number of people from abroad have started coming to Mumbai and other places. Many of them land elsewhere in the country and travel by domestic airlines, roads and trains. If any of them are carriers of the virus, others may be at great risk, so it is imperative to investigate such passengers, to keep a tab on them,” Thackeray is quoted in a statement released by his office. During the meeting, Thackeray instructed officials to test international and domestic passengers arriving at airports in the state. Also Read | Maharashtra: Man tests positive for Covid-19 after returning from South AfricaState Covid Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi said they are now in the “vigilant” mode as the new variant, B.1.1.529, is reportedly more infectious than Delta, the variant largely responsible for the deadly second wave of coronavirus infections in India earlier this year.  “The Delta variant had two mutations, this has over 50. It is a super mutant, and it transmits rapidly. In 10 days, it replaced the dominant Delta strain in South Africa,” Joshi, who attended the meeting on Sunday, said. Experts have also expressed fears that the Omicron variant was less likely to face resistance from immunity built in individuals who successfully recovered from infections triggered by the old variants such as Delta.“If you look at the mutation sites, it [Omicron] is likely to cause more severe disease. In the next four weeks, we will have data to understand how severe it is. India is concerned because this new variant can replace Delta. If a new strain comes into India now, we might get a new wave through this strain.” Joshi added. The Omicron variant is currently being studied by researchers around the globe to ascertain if it can result in more severe infections. Joshi added that the vaccination drive needs to pick up speed and people who have not taken their second dose must not delay after completing the mandatory waiting period between the two doses.Maharashtra on Sunday added 832 new Covid-19 cases (6,634,444 cumulative). The state also reported 33 deaths to take the toll to 140,941. Mumbai added 210 new infections on the same day (762,584 cumulative) and recorded four disease related fatalities (toll 16,330). There were 8,193 active cases in the state, including 2,192 in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-may-impose-7-day-quarantine-for-passengers-from-sa-101638155544912.html

29-11-2021||India||From today, Singapore to resume flights to India. Details here||From Monday, Singapore will resume commercial flights with India through its vaccinated travel lane (VTL) facility with six designated flights daily from Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai.The resumption comes a week after Singapore's civil aviation authority (CAAS) announced on November 21 that it reached an agreement with India's aviation ministry to resume flights between the two countries.However, the city-state has been kept under the category of 'at risk' countries by India in the wake of the spread of a new variant of coronavirus, called Omicron. This means that travellers coming to India from Singapore will be subjected to tighter scrutiny.Applications for vaccinated travel passes (VTP) for short-term visitors and long-term pass holders from India started on November 22.“All short-term visitors and long-term pass holders who meet the requirements of the VTL will receive a VTP,” the CAAS said last week, according to a report by Channel News Asia.All VTL travellers should be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and present digital proof of their inoculation.They must also undergo two tests for the virus: a pre-departure test within two days before leaving for Singapore, and an on-arrival test at the airport, following which they will have to remain self-isolated until the result is confirmed to be negative, Hindustan Times reported on November 21.Initially, VTPs were being issued for travellers who are visiting Singapore between November 29 and January 21 next year. However, those intending to visit the country after December 1 were urged to apply after November 24.Travellers who require a visa for travel to Singapore should apply for their visa separately and only after their VTP is approved, the CAAS said in a release.“They must also purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of Singapore USD 30,000 for Covid-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travel to Singapore. In Singapore, these visitors must also use the TraceTogether app to facilitate contact tracing,” the authority added.Meanwhile, the CAAS also said that airlines can operate non-VTL flights between India and Singapore, but passengers on such flights will be subject to prevailing public health requirements.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-today-singapore-to-resume-flights-to-india-details-here-101638144732885.html
29-11-2021||India||Omicron: List of 'at risk' countries and situation in India||The emergence of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus has made the government cautious about resuming international flights. It released new guidelines on Sunday, listing nearly a dozen “at risk” countries, and removing the exemption for vaccinated people.The rules are meant to contain the spread of Omicron variant.After a long hiatus of more than 20 months, the government had on November 26 announced the resumption of scheduled international commercial flights from December 15. Flights are currently on under bilateral bubble arrangements with countries.What are the “at risk” countries?These are the nations where cases of Omicron strain have been found. The variant was first detected in southern Africa and has since spread to a number of countries.As per the new guidelines released by the government, the UK, entire Europe and 11 countries - South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel - are “at risk”.Rules for passengers arriving from ‘at risk’ countriesPassengers travelling from or transiting through 'at-risk' countries will have to undergo RT-PCR test on arrival in India and will be required to wait for the results before leaving the airport or taking a connecting flight, according to revised guidelines issued by the Health Ministry.Travellers who test positive will be taken to a medical facility for isolation, where they will need to stay till they test negative if they indeed are infected by the Omicron variant. If they are infected by any of the other variants, their release will be at the discretion of a doctor based on their condition.For people who test negative after coming from the listed countries, they will need to be in home quarantine and take another test on the eighth day. If they are positive, they will need to report to the Covid-19 helpline, the guidelines said.These travellers will also have to declare their travel history for the last 14 days.The spread of Omicron variantAt least nine countries have confirmed detecting the super mutated strain as of Sunday. The B.1.1.529 variant was designated as a "Variant of Concern" by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday.Situation in IndiaA man who returned from South Africa to Dombivali in Thane district of Maharashtra recently has tested positive for coronavirus, a Kalyan-Dombivali Municipal Corporation (KDMC) official said on Sunday.It is not confirmed whether the patient was carrying the Omicron variant of coronavirus, which was identified as the variant of concern by the WHO, the official said.His samples are being sent for genome sequencing to check the presence of the Omicron variant.

29-11-2021||India||Winter session of Parliament begins today: Govt's priorities and what opposition parties want||The winter session of Parliament will begin from Monday, and the opposition has vowed to corner the government over various issues, ranging from farmers protest to inflation. The government, meanwhile, has urged the opposition parties to let Parliament function smoothly.On the first day, the Lok Sabha is expected to take up the bill to repeal the three central farm laws which triggered nationwide protests. The Farm Law Repeal Bill was cleared by the Union Cabinet last week. It is likely to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha on the same day after its passage in the lower house of Parliament.The farmers too will be watching the proceedings closely. After Prime Minister’s announcement that the three laws will be repealed, the cultivators said they don’t believe in his words and would like to see the bills actually repealed. They have also raised fresh demands on Minimum Support Price (MSP) in a bid to end their protest, which has been going on since November last year.Legislative prioritiesThe government called an all-party meeting on Sunday during to urge to the opposition parties to let the two houses of Parliament function smoothly. Apart from the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, the central government is also expected to bring a bill on cryptocurrency to lay the foundation for Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) digital currency.The government has said that it is ready to discuss on the floor of the House any issue as permitted under the rules of procedure. At the meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) parliamentary executive committee meeting, the leaders discussed strategy for the winter session. A leader later said that the opposition doesn’t have any major issue to pillory the government, now that the Centre has agreed to repeal the farm laws.The party stressed on higher attendance of its Members of Parliament (MPs) and asked them to come prepared to take on the opposition. A meeting of all the constituents of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was also held where the allies stressed on the need for better coordination among all partners.Opposition’s focusThe leaders of the opposition parties are looking forward to the Farm Law Repeal Bill debate to corner the government over farm issues and also demand a law to guarantee the MSP for agricultural produce.At the all-party meeting on Sunday, they also pushed for discussions on price rise, unemployment and the use of Pegasus spyware. Some also asked for discussions on enhanced jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in certain states. Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O'Brien raised the issue of disinvestment of profitable public sector units.The TMC, the YSR Congress and the DMK were among the parties that suggested that the women's reservation bill be brought for discussion in the session starting from Monday.A total of 31 parties attended the meeting called by the government before the start of the winter session. The session will begin on Monday and conclude on December 23.What the farmers plan to doAs many as 32 farmers’ organisations from Punjab are expected to meet on Monday at the Singhu border to take a call on their future course of action.“If the government accepts our demands, we will go back to our homes. After that, we will not protest or canvas against the BJP in the upcoming assembly elections,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) leader Buta Singh Burjgill.The farmers’ key demands include amending the Electricity Act, revocation of FIRs registered against protesters during the agitation, and strict action against the Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra, whose son has been arrested in connection with the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on October 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winter-session-of-parliament-begins-today-govt-s-priorities-and-what-opposition-wants-101638145416673.html
29-11-2021||India||DRI seizes 3.6k iPhones from Mumbai international airport||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized consignments of 3,646 latest models of iPhones, suspected to be smuggled into the country from Hong Kong, at the Air Cargo Complex (ACC) at the international airport here, officials said on Sunday. In the import documents accompanying these two consignments, the goods were declared as "memory cards". Their physical examination on Friday revealed that the consignments actually contained 2,245 handsets of iPhone 13 Pro, 1,401 handsets of iPhone 13 Pro Max, 12 handsets of Google Pixel 6 pro and one Apple Smart Watch, collectively valued at ₹42.86 crore. The above-mentioned mobile phones and the Apple smart watch were not declared in the imported goods under the Customs Act. The declared value of these goods was only ₹80 lakh. The detection of attempted smuggling of these high-end phones of the latest models in such large numbers shows how quickly the smugglers establish their smuggling networks for the latest products, like iPhone 13, an official release said. "This detection has helped unearth a serious import fraud having substantial revenue implications," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dri-seizes-3-6k-iphones-from-mumbai-international-airport-101638133806023.html
29-11-2021||India||SC: Casteism yet to be annihilated even after 75 yrs of independence||Incidents of caste-motivated violence show that casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of independence and it is high time civil society reacts and responds with "strong disapproval" about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste, the Supreme Court has said.The apex court, which delivered its verdict on a batch of pleas in a 1991 Uttar Pradesh honour killing case, in which three persons, including a woman were killed, said it had earlier issued several directions to authorities to take strong measures to prevent honour killings.Those directives should be carried out without any further delay, it said.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao also said that to avert trial getting tainted and "truth becoming a casualty", the State has a definite role to play in protecting witnesses, to start with, at least in sensitive cases involving those in power who have political patronage and could wield muscle and money power.It said that "bigotry" perpetuated by caste-based practices, which are prevalent even today, impedes the Constitution's objective of equality for all citizens."Two young men and a woman were physically assaulted for nearly 12 hours and killed by the accused for violating caste-ridden societal norms. These episodes of caste-motivated violence in the country demonstrates the fact that casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of independence," the bench, also comprising justices Sanjiv Khanna and B R Gavai, said.The top court, while upholding the Allahabad High Court verdict with regard to conviction of 23 accused in the case, acquitted three persons in view of ambiguity in their identity.Referring to the aspect of witness protection, the bench noted that 12 prosecution witnesses in the case turned hostile."Even if the witnesses have turned hostile, their evidence can be accepted, if they are natural and independent witnesses and have no reason to falsely implicate the accused," it said.The apex court said the right to testify in courts in a free and fair manner, without any pressure and threat whatsoever, is "under serious attack today", and if one is unable to testify in courts due to threats or other pressures, then it is a clear violation of the rights under articles 19 (1) (a) and 21 of the Constitution."Right to life guaranteed to the people of this country also includes in its fold the right to live in a society which is free from crime and fear, and the right of witnesses to testify in courts without fear or pressure," it said.The bench said one of the main reasons why witnesses turn hostile is that they are not accorded appropriate protection by the State. It is a "harsh reality", particularly, in cases where the accused are influential people and are tried for heinous offences and they make attempts to terrorise or intimidate witnesses, the bench said."This unfortunate situation prevails because of the reason that the State has not undertaken any protective measures to ensure the safety of these witnesses, commonly known as 'witness protection'," it noted while referring to an earlier judgment of the Supreme Court.The bench said that as a protector of its citizens, the State has to ensure that during a trial a witness can safely depose the truth, without any fear of being haunted by those against whom he or she has deposed.It noted that according to Dr B R Ambedkar, inter-caste marriage is one remedy to get rid of casteism in order to achieve equality."His vision for ensuring justice and equality to all sections of society, especially to the repressed segments, is well enshrined in the preamble of the Constitution," the bench said."Though the number is a tad less, honour killings have not stopped in this country and it is high time that the civil society reacts and responds with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste," it said.Referring to an earlier verdict of the apex court, the bench said honour killings, pursuant to the decree of 'khap panchayats, have been strongly criticised by the top court in its earlier verdict.It said harsh punishment was recommended to those "brutal and feudal minded persons" who commit atrocities in the name of castes."The Law Commission of India in its 242nd report suggested the legal framework on prevention of interference with the freedom of matrimonial alliances in the name of honour and tradition," the bench noted.The 'panchayatdars' or caste elders have no right to interfere with the life and liberty of young couples whose marriages are permitted by law. They cannot create a situation whereby such couples are placed in a hostile environment in the village or locality concerned and exposed to the risk of safety, it saidThe bench said in the interest of "liberty and dignity" of young men and women in choosing their life partners and in the interest of peace, tranquillity and equality in society, it is imminently necessary that directions issued by the apex court earlier should be carried out by states without any further delay.It also referred to the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018, which was approved by the apex court earlier.In the 1991 Uttar Pradesh honour killing case, a trial court in November 2011 had convicted 35 accused.

29-11-2021||India||India takes up LAC infra build-up by China’s PLA||With China investing heavily in upgrading military infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), India expressed concern over the build-up by the People’s Liberation Army opposite the Eastern Ladakh sector.During the talks held recently between the two countries, the Indian side expressed concerns over the build-up by the Chinese Army in areas near the Eastern Ladakh sector, officials familiar with the matter said.They said there are reasons for concern for the Indian side as the Chinese are building new highways and connecting roads, constructing new habitats and settlements near the Line of Actual Control and have deployed heavy weaponry, including missile regiments on their side.The officials said the military infrastructure upgrade has been very significant as the Chinese are widening highways, and new airstrips are being constructed apart from the main bases in Kashgar, Gar Gunsa and Hotan.A major wide highway is also being developed which will further improve the connectivity of the Chinese military positions on the LAC with the hinterland, they said.The officials said the Chinese military has also focused on building infrastructure for its air force and army to keep them hidden from the US and other satellites also in the depth areas.The attempts of recruiting Tibetans and basing them right at border posts along with the mainland Han troops are also gaining speed, as they want to use the original inhabitants of the region to man the highly difficult terrain, where survival has been very tough for the mainland Chinese troops.The people cited above said if compared with winters last year, the Chinese are much better prepared in terms of shelters, road connectivity and acclimatisation. Rockets and missile regiments have been deployed in rear areas controlled by the PLA in Tibet Autonomous Region, they said.The deployment of drones from the Chinese has gone up significantly, as a large number of them have been deployed for surveillance in the sector, they added.On whether the number of Chinese troops deployed opposite Indian borders has gone up in the recent past, the sources said the Chinese have focused more on capability enhancement in that area.The Indian side, the officials said, is also much more prepared than last year, as it has also deployed whatever is required by the forces to deal with any misadventure in the region.The conflict on the northern borders started after the Chinese Army started behaving aggressively and diverted around 50,000 troops from a summer wargame in the Aksai Chin area to the Indian border, which led to the creation of multiple friction points on the LAC.The Indian side responded at great speed and the Chinese aggression was checked with mirror deployment and other measures.India has also diverted many of its Pakistan-centric armoured forces towards the high altitude border in areas where tanks can manoeuvre in the cold desert.The number of formations looking after the highly sensitive border has also gone up and now the entire eastern Ladakh area is covered and protected by the security forces.A large number of measures have also been taken to strengthen the troops in the fight against the extreme winters and mega airlift exercises have been carried out by the Indian Air Force to help further build up the winter stocking for the next six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-takes-up-lac-infra-build-up-by-china-s-pla-101638133094935.html

He was remanded to the custody of Pune police on Saturday. The man was identified as Prashant Bhaurao Patil, 31, a resident of Kumpatgiri in Khanapur, Belgaum. Patil was remanded to custody till December 1 by a local court.Senior police inspector Devidas Gheware of Sinhagad police station said, “He has absconded from the armed forces and has not reported to duty since 2018. From 2018 till Sunday, five cases have been registered against him at Pune, Ahmednagar, and Latur.”The incident came to light when a girl approached the police and said that a man of Patil’s description had pretended to marry her, established physical relations and then blocked her number claiming frontline duty. Patil met the girl through an online matrimonial service on November 18 at Dagdusheth Ganapati temple wearing an armed forces uniform. He then allegedly took her to a lodge room on Sinhagad road where they consummated their marriage. The girl told the police that he made her swear not to tell anyone about them and placed her in a car where he had sex with her against her will. Once she left the lodge, the man blocked her number and stopped all communication.A case under relevant sections was registered against him around a week ago when one of his victims approached the Sinhagad road police station officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-posing-as-defence-officer-dupes-pune-women-on-matrimonial-platform-arrested-101638126442048.html
29-11-2021||India||Bommai reiterates planned development of Bengaluru||The Karnataka government on Sunday reiterated its grand vision for the planned development of Bengaluru where public infrastructure continues to crumble on account of civic apathy. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the government was “keen” to come out with a clear agenda for the planned development of India’s IT capital which is known globally as a technology hub as well as its civic challenges. “Some prominent entrepreneurs have invited me for a preliminary discussion on plans for economic growth and development of Bengaluru and Karnataka. It is part of a series of such discussions and it is just the first in that series,” Bommai said on Sunday. The plans come even as the city and it’s over 12 million population continue to endure the burden of the government’s inefficiency and apathy. The city’s roads have become the benchmark for poor quality of public infrastructure in the country which is embellished almost annually with the lack of planning and long-term solutions that is often substituted with quick fixes which has so far only exacerbated the problems. “More comprehensive discussions would follow after today’s meeting. The discussions would involve prominent personalities from various domains, legislators from Bengaluru, senior officers and my ministerial colleagues. The agenda to be evolved for the city’s planned growth would be discussed and finalised in the state legislature,” Bommai said. The meeting was organized by Biocon Ltd chairperson Kiran Mazumdar Shaw who is also a prominent voice against the city’s poor infrastructure and development. The recent heavy rains in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka is conveniently being used as the reason for the deteriorating quality of roads in a city where a newly laid street by one civic agency is dug up by another which has formed a loop denying some relief to its residents. During the monsoon session of the state legislature in September, Bommai had said over ₹20,000 crore was spent on road-related works in Bengaluru over the past five years. The condition of roads is so bad that it has snuffed out several lives. At least 18 people lost their lives in Bengaluru due to civic apathy in 2020 which is more than all other major cities in the country combined, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). In fact, Shaw had criticized the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) which won an award in the union government’s Swachh Survekshan programme. “BBMP wins award for ‘keeping Bengaluru clean’. This is the biggest joke on us citizens! A municipality who has failed to keep our city clean for decades wins the award? Citizens need to hold them accountable with rallies @BBMPSWMSplComm,” Shaw had posted on November 19. Earlier in July, she posted another tweet of a poor quality footpath. “Is this what @BBMPCOMM accepts as a completed project? I am so depressed to see our city in ruins with no pride left. All other cities have used the pandemic to complete road projects except us!” she posted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-reiterates-planned-development-of-bengaluru-101638126022069.html
29-11-2021||India||Karnataka reimposes curbs on educational institutions amid Covid spike||The Karnataka government on Sunday issued fresh directives for educational institutions, imposing restrictions on social, cultural and academic events after a rise in Covid-19 cases in some such establishments in the state.The Basvaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government said that after the recent clusters of Covid-19 in Mysuru, Bengaluru and Dharwad, certain restrictions are being imposed.“All social and cultural events in educational institutions may be postponed for two months. Conferences, seminars, academic events, etc. in educational institutions, wherever possible, may be postponed. Alternatively, it could be conducted in hybrid mode i.e. with minimal physical attendance and with more persons attending through virtual mode,” according to the advisory issued by TK Anil Kumar, the additional chief secretary of the health and family welfare department, on Sunday.The order came at a time when the Bommai government was relaxing restrictions in schools and other places after almost 18 months of pandemic-induced lockdowns.The Bommai government had resumed physical classes for pre-primary students from November despite opposition from various quarters, including a significant section of parents and guardians, who are apprehensive about the impact of the move on the children who are not eligible for vaccination making them vulnerable to contract the coronavirus.The government had also eased restrictions on many other fronts, allowing for organising of fairs.In the wake of the new Covid-19 variant ‘omicron’ that has been detected in South Africa, the state government on Saturday made it mandatory for people arriving from affected countries to take the RT-PCR test upon landing in the city. Home quarantine has also been made mandatory for these passengers.“Earlier international passengers were tested but asked to go home and quarantine themselves. Now test them there itself (airport) and allow them to leave after they test negative,” Bommai said on Sunday.The Karnataka government on Saturday reintroduced restrictions including making it mandatory for people working in malls, cinemas and other public places to be allowed in only if they have been inoculated with both shots of the Covid-19 vaccine.Bommai on Sunday said that these new strains were found in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, but there were no cases detected so far in Karnataka.“We haven’t seen that strain in Karnataka but in places like Dharward, Mysuru and Bengaluru hostels, we have seen spurts of cases spreading rapidly making them clusters. We have to take precautions,” Bommai said.He said these hostels have been declared as containment zones with restrictions imposed and directions issued to increase testing on the premises.“Health care professionals may also conduct conferences, seminars, CME sessions, etc., virtually for a few more months to send a positive message to professionals in other fields, in the larger interest of public health,” according to Sunday’s advisory by the government.The new restrictions have been imposed on the public even as electioneering for the December 10 MLC polls continues unchecked.Bommai said that there are no big public meetings for the MLC elections and that only about 50-100 people were present. He said people attending these meetings should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.The new restrictions impending the possibility of a third wave of infections have made people apprehensive of more lockdowns that would affect their livelihoods and pile on the burden of financial hardships.Bommai said measures were being taken to increase vaccination coverage. He said there were around 8 million Covid-19 vaccine doses available in the state and around 91% of the eligible population were administered at least one dose but conceded that this was reaching saturation levels. He said around 58% of the population had received both doses and the government will aggressively pursue measures to increase coverage to at least 70% by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-reimposes-curbs-on-educational-institutions-amid-covid-spike-101638125963323.html
29-11-2021||India||KS Eshwarappa backs Murugesh Nirani for Karnataka chief minister’s post||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Karnataka’s rural development and panchayat raj (RDPR) minister KS Eshwarappa backed his cabinet colleague Murugesh Nirani for the top post in the government in a rare moment of camaraderie in a deeply divided outfit.Eshwarappa is also an aspirant for the post of chief minister and was one of the many who expressed their displeasure at the possibility that incumbent Basavaraj Bommai will be the face of the 2023 state assembly election.“Murugesh Nirani will soon become the chief minister but I don’t know when. He has the capacity to become the chief minister and he can strive for the welfare of backward communities, poor, downtrodden and all the sections,” according to a statement from the large and medium industries department, attributing it to Eshwarappa.Eshwarappa, however, added that Bommai will not be removed.The statement fuels speculation of a growing divide within the BJP in Karnataka that threatens to dent its prospects in the 2023 assembly election.The backing of Nirani is also seen as a move to get the backing of the Panchamasalis, the largest sub-sect of the dominant Lingayats, who are unhappy with the BJP for not yielding the community’s demand for better reservation as well as being overlooked for the top post when BS Yediyurappa was forced to step down in July.The BJP and other parties continue campaigning for the December 10 MLC polls to take control of the upper house of the state legislature.It is largely believed that this divide is part of the reason why the BJP lost in Hanagal constituency in Bommai’s home district of Haveri in the October 30 bypolls.But the opposition has barely been able to capitalise on the divide within the BJP as they continue to be entangled in problems of their own in their respective outfits.DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah remain entangled in a battle for dominance within the Congress while Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) is facing a rift within the family as former prime minister HD Deve Gowda’s sons -- HD Kumaraswamy and HD Revanna -- fight it out to claim the reins of the regional party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ks-eshwarappa-backs-murugesh-nirani-for-karnataka-chief-minister-s-post-101638125901984.html
29-11-2021||India||Telangana on alert amid Omicron concerns, airport put on alert||Telangana government is on high alert to meet any eventuality in the wake of reports of a possible third wave of Covid-19 pandemic triggered by Omicron, a new variant of Sars-Cov-2 which was first reported in South Africa, the state government officials said on Sunday.Following a direction from the Central government, Telangana state health minister T Harish Rao held a high-level meeting at his chambers to review the preparedness for the situation arising out of the new variant.Speaking to reporters after the review meeting, director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said there was no need for the people to panic over the new variant of Sars-Cov-2, as the government machinery was fully prepared to handle the surge in the Covid-19 infections.“All that the people should do is to strictly follow the Covid-19 guidelines, including wearing of masks, maintaining of physical distancing and regular sanitisation. They should not let their guards down under any circumstances,” Rao said.The director said a high alert had been sounded at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad, though there were no direct flights from South Africa to Hyderabad. The number of positive cases for Covid-19 had been stable in the state and there was no sudden increase in the infections, he said.“We have enough manpower at the airport and international passengers are being screened. We are also conducting RT-PCR tests at the airport itself and arrangements were also taken up to keep passengers who test Covid-19 positive in 14-day quarantine. So far not a single Omicron case has been reported in India,” Rao said.He further said the state government had taken a series of measures to improve infrastructure like adding more hospital beds, developing medical oxygen lines to hospital beds and creating infrastructure for paediatric Covid cases, across all government hospitals, so as to prepare for any possible third wave.On an average, Telangana has been witnessing on an average of 100-150 cases per day for the last few weeks. While 90 per cent of the eligible individuals have received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, 45 per cent of the eligible persons have got the second dose.“Still, nearly 25 lakh people in Telangana have missed out on the second dose of the vaccine, and have lapsed the time to get them administered. They all should get their second dose of vaccine at the earliest,” the director of public health said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-on-alert-amid-omicron-concerns-airport-put-on-alert-101638125843730.html
29-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu: Two loco pilots booked after train runs over 3 elephants||: The Tamil Nadu forest department said a case was filed against two loco pilots who were booked under Section 9 of the Wildlife Protection Act on Saturday in the case of death of three elephants—who were killed by a moving passenger train near the Madikeri range of Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu.On Saturday, the forest department detained the two loco pilots—M T Subair from Kozhikode and M C Akhil from Thrissur. After taking their statements and relevant documents, the forest department took an undertaking from the loco pilots that they will appear for questioning, the forest department said and added that the forest department has also sent a team from Coimbatore to Palakkad, Kerala to collect a microchip to collect data on the speed of the train. Members of the loco pilots association in the neighbouring state, Kerala, opposed the move.“This has become a kind of tension between the two states and the railways department with the forest department,” said principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden Shekar Kumar Niraj.Niraj said the case has to be booked because it is mandated under the Wildlife Protection Act, and added “We are now judicially moving things. Both departments must work together for short term and long-term measures.”In reply to a journalist’s tweet, the southern railways said they are cooperating with the forest department.“Investigation is in progress. At the moment there is no evidence supporting the claim of negligence by the loco pilots. It is being discussed only as a possibility,” the southern railways said.A postmortem conducted on Saturday had revealed that one of the elephants was pregnant.On Friday night, a speeding train from Mangalore to Chennai, near the A line between Walayar and Ettimadai, hit and killed three elephants—two female and a male.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-two-loco-pilots-booked-after-train-runs-over-3-elephants-101638125842496.html
29-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu minister asks IIT-M to play state song at institute’s functions||Tamil Nadu higher education minister K Ponmudi has written to the IIT-Madras director Bhaskar Ramamurthi after the centrally-run institute failed to play the state invocation song during a recently-held convocation. In the letter, dated November 24, Ponmudi urged the IIT-M director to ensure that the song Tamil Thai Vazhthu be played by the institute in all its functions as mandated by protocol.“...it is disheartening to learn that in the recently concluded convocation the State Invocation Song “Tamil Thai Vazhthu” was not sung in the event, a deviation of well-established protocol,” the letter read.In a common ritual, the song, written by scholar Manonmaniam Pillai and set to tune by musician M S Viswanathan, is played at the beginning of all government functions in the state, and the national anthem is played at the end of the function. “I would like to point out that the invocation song is sung in all the State and Central Government functions in Tamil Nadu, including the functions where higher dignitaries, like (the) President of India and Prime Minister, participate,” Ponmudi said in his letter. “I, therefore, request you to ensure that the “Tamil Thai Vazhthu” invocation is sung in all the functions of the institution, including convocation in future.”IIT-M held its 58th convocation virtually on November 20, in which Olympic badminton medallist P V Sindhu was the chief guest. Around 1,962 students graduated and as many as 2,425 degrees (including Joint and Dual Degrees) were awarded to students on the occasion this year. It included the highest number of PhDs awarded in an academic year – 392. Ponmudi also pointed out that IIT-M was established in 250 hectares of land provided by the state government in 1959. “From that time onwards, the Government of Tamil Nadu has been contributing through various means for the growth and development of the institution and the present government is also very keen in continuing the same support,” he said. He added that IIT-M recently wrote a letter to the principal secretary to the government, higher education department seeking ₹10 crores support from the state to establish a national facility for cryo-electron microscopy, which is currently under examination. In 2018, a controversy broke out after a video circulated on social media showing junior Sankaracharya of Kanchi Mutt, Vijayendra Saraswati, sitting through the state invocation song at an event in Chennai. Current state chief minister M K Stalin, who was then the opposition leader of the DMK, heavily criticized the act. HT has reached out to IIT-M for a response. IIT-M has not responded on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-minister-asks-iit-m-to-play-state-song-at-institute-s-functions-101638125783076.html
29-11-2021||India||5k teachers, staff in Kerala schools yet to get jabs: Minister||Around 5,000 school teachers and non-teaching staff in Kerala have not taken a dose of Covid-19 vaccination, citing religious beliefs and poor health, state education minister V Sivankutty said on Sunday.The minister said the state government would review the issue at the earliest as the safety of the children is paramount. “We have started collecting data on this. There is a standing instruction that un-vaccinated teachers will not be allowed to take classes. Teachers are role models, and the government views their attitude seriously,” said the minister. There are around 1.6 lakh school teachers and 25,000 non-teaching employees in the state. “Children’s safety is our main concern. We can’t justify the action of these un-jabbed teachers. We will give them some more time. Otherwise, the government will take action against them,” the minister said in the state capital. The majority of these un-vaccinated are from the north Kerala districts Malappuram and Kasargod. These teachers haven’t visited schools and conduct online classes, an official said.Many health activists and teacher’ organisations have asked the government to create proper awareness among the reluctant staff. “A modern society can’t accept this. Some of the religious states like Saudi Arabia and the Vatican are carrying out the jabbing exercise strictly. No religion supports such an attitude,” said public health expert Dr Pamanabha Shenoy. Some teachers’ associations have also decried this. “All teachers should take jabs, and we will support any initiative in this regard,” said Kerala Pradesh School Teachers’ Association leader M Salahuddin. Many experts also urged religious leaders to step in and educate teachers about the importance of vaccination against Covid-19.Even before the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, the CPI (M)-led left government had instructed all educational institutions to make basic vaccines for polio, influenza, measles and other diseases compulsory for enrolling children in schools. In 2017, the government had constituted a 17-member expert panel headed by Dr B Ekbal to chalk out a comprehensive health policy. One of the key recommendations of the panel was to make these vaccinations compulsory for children. While enrolling children, the government-mandated the parents to produce details of vaccines administered to their wards. In Kerala, 96 per cent of the eligible population have received the first dose and 65% got both doses of the Covid vaccine, according to the health ministry data. The state has been topping the Covid-19 chart for more than six months, and in the total tally of Covid-related deaths, it is second to Maharashtra with 39,679 fatalities. On Saturday, the state reported 4,741 cases, and an active caseload is 48,501.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5k-teachers-staff-in-kerala-schools-yet-to-get-jabs-minister-101638125781910.html

The truck, which was carrying stones, was parked by the road, police found during investigation. Passengers travelling in the goods carriage were residents of Bagdah in North 24 Parganas district. They were going to a crematorium at Nabadwip in Nadia with the body of an elderly woman from Parmadan village. “Since the accident took place in the dead of the night there were not eyewitnesses. The goods vehicle came from the opposite direction and rammed into the truck parked by the road. Eighteen people have so far died. They were carrying the body of an old woman for cremation. Police have started an investigation,” said Sayak Das, Superintendent of Police, Kalyani police district in Nadia.Prasenjit Das, 20, the driver of the goods vehicle, died at the spot and a man who was sleeping inside the stationary truck suffered minor injury, police said. Police have seized the goods vehicle. Das might have been tired and could not spot the truck because of fog, said a police officer who wished not to be named.“I talked to the driver’s assistant. He said the driver might have fallen asleep,” said Bidhan Chandra Das, one of the passengers of the ill-fated vehicle who miraculously escaped the accident, and added that five of the deceased were members of the elderly woman’s family and rest were her relatives and neighbours. The injured were shifted to a local hospital. Bengal minister Jyotipriya Mallick met the families of the victims at Parmadan village in Bagdah and also announced a compensation of ₹2 lakh for the nearest kin of every victim.

The officials arrested three people from Shamli and two others from Prayagraj on Sunday.A team of the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UPSTF) conducted searches at fivelocations in the state after receiving information about the leak, said Prashant Kumar, additional director general, law and order.“As many as 18 people were arrested from Prayagraj, four from Lucknow, three from Shamli, two from Ayodhya, and one from Kaushambi districts,” the ADG said.Copies of the question papers were recovered from four people in Lucknow and three people in Shamli, while one person in Kaushambi received handwritten questions on WhatsApp, Kumar said.Cell phones and some mobile numbers have been recovered from the accused and police are trying to ascertain the point at which the paper was leaked, Kumar said.Officials suspect a role of officials at the examination agency or at the treasury, where the question paper was kept before distribution. The UP government’s exam regulatory authority (ERA) conducts the exam.The examination, conducted once a year to test ability to teach primary and upper primary classes in government-run schools in the state, was scheduled in two shifts, from 10am to 12.30pm, and 2.30pm to 5pm, at 2,736 centres across 75 districts of the state.Over 1.9 million candidates were scheduled to appear for the exam, according to official data.Three people were arrested from Shamli district on Sunday, deputy superintendent of police of the STF (Meerut circle) Brojesh Singh said. “They were arrested with copies of the leaked paper they had received from a gang in Mathura for ₹5 lakh and (were) going to distribute (it) to candidates in exchange for ₹50,000 from each of them,” said Singh, adding that the arrested persons were being interrogated to collect inputs about people involved in the network.Issuing a stern warning, CM Yogi Adityanath said, “Those who have committed this act … cases will be registered against them under the Gangsters Act and the National Security Act.”“Instructions were issued to arrest the gang leaking UPTET (Uttar Pradesh Teacher Eligibility Test) paper. Prompt action is being taken by identifying the culprits and a case against the culprits will be registered under the Gangsters Act. Those who play with the future of our young sisters and brothers will not be spared at any cost. The people responsible for the inconvenience caused to them will definitely be punished,” he later tweeted.The government is determined to conduct the examination in a fair and transparent manner, the chief minister said.“The state government stands with UPTET candidates. The examination will be conducted in a transparent manner within a month. No additional fees will be charged from any candidate. The candidates who were appearing for the examination will be given free travel facility in commuting by UPSRTC (Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation) buses,” he said in another tweet.“UP STF has been asked to probe it and orders have been issued for lodging of the FIR (first information report) in this connection,” said Satish Chandra Dwivedi, the state’s basic education minister. “The culprits would be identified and strict action would be taken against them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-teachers-exam-cancelled-after-paper-leak-cm-yogi-says-will-invoke-nsa-101638124522058.html
29-11-2021||India||Sangh is not a military force, says Bhagwat||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said the Sangh is not a military organisation, but a group with a family atmosphere. “Sangh is not an all-India music school. Martial arts programmes do take place (in it), but Sangh is neither an all India gym nor a martial arts club. Sometimes, the Sangh is described as a paramilitary (force). But Sangh is not a military organisation,” he said.Sangh is a group with a family atmosphere, the RSS chief added. He was speaking here at the closing event of the four-day Ghosh Shivir (musical band camp) of the Sangh’s Madhya Bharat Pranth. Noted Sarod player Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and others attended the valedictory function. “Western countries consider music as entertainment. It is played for a thrill there. But in India, music is meant to soothe the soul. It is an art that calms down the mind,” he added. The RSS chief also said that even though India was celebrating the 75th anniversary of Independence, the country needs to make up for the loss caused by the mismanagement and loot, and this work rests with society. “We attained Independence on August 15, 1947, but the struggle for it began in 1857”, he added. “A thought prevailed that we had lost to a foreign power at our home and efforts were launched to straighten up things. A continuous political and social correction work took place and we attained freedom,” Bhagwat said. He said more efforts were needed to build the country. “The mismanagement and loot that inflicted losses need at least 10-12 years to be repaired,” he added. He said the change brought in by politicians, government and the police lasts for some time if it is not backed by society.Bhagwat underlined the need to build a value-based society if the fortunes of the country need to be changed.“The Sangh is doing this work which needs the faith of the society,” he added. Bhagwat reached Gwalior on Friday midnight to address the ghosh shivir that had begun on Thursday. The musical band camp concluded at Saraswati Shishu Mandir (school) located on the Shivpuri Link Road, a senior RSS Madhya Bharat functionary said. More than 500 instrumentalists drawn from 31 districts of RSS’ Madhya Pradesh Bharat Pranth (including Gwalior and Bhopal divisions) took part in the camp. Last week, Bhagwat had attended ‘Ghosh Pradarshan’, a programme on demonstrating musical instruments by band members in Chhattisgarh. RSS functionary Vinay Dixit said the RSS was formed in 1925 while its musical branch came up in 1927. He added that musical bands, especially drums, are used in shakhas during drills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sangh-is-not-a-military-force-says-bhagwat-101638124464340.html
29-11-2021||India||Chennai logs wettest November with record rainfall of 882.4 mm||This November has been one of the wettest for Chennai which has recorded rainfall of 882.4 mm up to November 28 even as incessant rains in the past three days led to the city being inundated putting its residents through tremendous strain. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) the all-time record for the month of November is from 1918 when Chennai received 1088.4 mm of rain. In the past decade, it was in November 2015, that Chennai received record rainfall of 1049 mm and in December the city went through the catastrophic floods. The northeast monsoon from October to December is when Tamil Nadu receives most of its rainfall and since the monsoon set in late this year, in October, Chennai received 215 mm of rainfall which was a deficit by 22%. However, in the following month, the rainfall picked up and has now resulted in Chennai recording 79% excess rainfall having received a total of 1097.6 mm from October 1 up to November 28.“In November alone, till now we have received 882.4 mm rainfall,” said S Balachandar, head, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Chennai adding that the weathermen were unsure if Chennai would cross the 100 cm rainfall milestone with just two days left for November to end. Chief minister M K Stalin who has been inspecting flood-affected areas in Chennai and its neighbouring districts since Saturday tweeted that meteorologists say that this is the fourth highest rainfall in a single month and that it was vital to prevent loss of life and property. Independent weather blogger Pradeep John who tracks the rain in Tamil Nadu as per his calculations which adifferent from that of the RMC said that Chennai recorded 1003 mm until 7.30 pm in November. Rains batter ChennaiHowever the intensity of the rains has paralysed the capital city, its adjoining districts of Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram and other districts. In the last 24-hours two people have died from the districts of Cuddalore and Thoothukudi, the disaster management department said in a statement. As many as 15,016 people have been evacuated from low lying areas and accommodated in relief camps. Since heavy rains began in the first week of November, crops spread over 50,000 hectares in Tamil Nadu’s delta districts have been damaged. The IMD on Friday issued a red alert for all the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu including Chennai. Overall, Tamil Nadu has received 76% excess rainfall this monsoon season. “Almost all districts except Madurai and Virudhunagar have received excess to large excess rainfall,” the IMD said in a bulletin. Up to 5.30 pm on November 28, Meenambakkam in Chennai received 55mm rainfall, Cuddalore (70mm), Tiruchenduri in Thoothukudi (11mm), Cheyyur in Chengalpattu district received 19mm. Boats were back on Chennai roads for rescue and relief operations in suburban localities such as Perumbakkam and Pallikaranai. The Greater Chennai Corporation increased its capacity of heavy duty motor pumps from 750 to 850 on Sunday to drain excess water. Traffic was diverted in several areas as roads had to be blocked due to water logging. Water was more than knee-deep in some residential localities. A holiday has been declared for schools in Chennai, Thiruvallur and several other districts for Monday due to the rains as the IMD has forecast heavy rainfall for Chennai in the next 24-hours and heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places over Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts and heavy rain over Thoothukudi and Ramanathapuram districts. Thunderstorms with moderate rain are likely to occur at most places over rest Coastal Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-logs-wettest-november-with-record-rainfall-of-882-4-mm-101638124461735.html
29-11-2021||India||Siwan, Sitapur have a bigger air pollution problem than Delhi||Europeans for a long time believed the earth was flat and were scared of undertaking long voyages on sea, lest they fell off the planet. It is unfair to blame them completely for this, for nobody had mapped the earth to remove this fear. Reversing this analogy is useful in evaluating India’s policy response to the problem of air pollution.Every year, as pollution levels spike in October and November, both governments and the courts scramble to control the menace in Delhi and its adjoining districts in the national capital region (NCR). Anyone who follows these processes in the news will believe that pollution is only a problem around the national capital and all is well in the rest of the country. This appears more to be result of lack of pollution data from other parts in northern India than anything else. An HT analysis, which has used satellite data to map pollution levels, shows air pollution is a problem that needs a much wider geographical outlook than just a Delhi-centric focus. Here is why.India’s air quality monitoring data is geographically skewed, but satellite mapping can helpThe Central Control Room for Air Quality Management (CCR) database counts 321 air quality monitoring stations in India. They cover just 156 cities, while there were 640 census districts in the 2011 census. Of the total air quality stations, 22% are located in just three mega cities: Delhi (40 stations), Mumbai (21 stations) and Bengaluru (10 stations).Does a lack of air quality stations mean we have no idea about pollution levels in the rest of the country? HT has found a solution to this problem by using satellite imagery based data.Particulate matter such as PM2.5, which are 2.5 micrometre wide or less, prevent light from travelling through the air. NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites take snapshots of this to find where such particles are higher in concentration. This provides an index called aerosol optical thickness or depth (AOD). This index varies between 0 and 1, with values closer to 0 representing a clear sky and values closer to 1 representing a hazy sky.Monthly averages of AOD are available for 0.1-degree grids (a box bound by two latitudes and longitudes 0.1 degree or 11.1km apart). For October and November, 321 of 632 census 2011 districts (Delhi’s districts merged as one) have this data since 2000 such that over 80% of their grids are represented in nearly all years. More on this later. These 321 districts cover large parts of the states in the northern plains, where air pollution in winter is higher.

According to a recent report, a big change has come this year itself,” the Prime Minister said. “In just 10 months, a unicorn was made in India every 10 days.”He said that it was a big achievement because India’s youth have achieved this success in the midst of a pandemic. “Today, there are more than 70 start-ups in India that have a valuation of more than $1 billion,” Modi said. “Due to the success of start-ups, everyone has noticed it. And the way it is getting support from investors from all over the country and abroad…, one could not have imagined it a few years ago.”The central government has started a programme called Startup India, which allows several facilities, including funding and investment, tax exemptions and industry-academia incubation in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, health care and education, he said.Modi encouraged youth to become job creators. Three things matter a lot in a country that has a lot of young population, he said. The first is ideas and innovation, the second is the passion to take risks, and the third is the can-do spirit.“A few years ago, if anyone said they wanted to start a new company, or start a business, family elders used to advise against that. They would ask the person to take up a job as that would offer job security, salary and a hassle- free existence,” he said. “Today, if anyone wants to start his own company, people around him are excited and supportive. People today are trying to become job creators, not just job seekers.”The Prime Minister also referred to the death anniversary of BR Ambedkar on December 6 and said discharging one’s duty would be a fitting tribute to him.“Babasaheb Ambedkar devoted his entire life to discharge his duties for the country and society. We must never forget that the basic spirit of our Constitution expects all of us to discharge our duties,” Modi said. “So let us take a pledge that in the Amrit Mahotsav, we will try to fulfil our duties with full devotion. This will be a tribute to Baba Saheb.”Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav is an initiative of the government of India to celebrate and commemorate 75 years of India’s independence.BOXWhile interacting with a listener who is a beneficiary of the government’s health care scheme for the underprivileged, Modi commented that he does not covet power but seeks to serve. “I do not seek power, I want to serve the people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-leading-the-world-pm-narendra-modi-hails-india-s-start-up-sector-in-mann-ki-baat-101638124226790.html
29-11-2021||India||Prayagraj murder case: Dalit man held, UP police say was stalking deceased||The Prayagraj Police on Sunday arrested a 23-year-old man in connection with the brutal murder of four members of a Dalit family in the district. The police also said that one of the deceased, who was raped, was not a minor, according to the official documents accessed by them. A 50-year-old man, his 47-year-old wife, daughter, who police said was 25, and 10-year-old son – were found dead on their beds inside their home in Prayagraj district on Thursday morning by relatives. An autopsy report suggested that they were strangulated and assaulted with an axe. A written complaint to the police by one of the relatives of the victims mentioned a land dispute and alleged that members of an upper-caste family had issued physical and verbal threats to the Dalit family in the past. Police, however, said that the accused, also a Dalit, was stalking the woman and carried out the crime after she rejected his advances. Addressing a press conference, ADG Zone Prem Prakash said: “A scanning of the murdered 25-year-old woman’s WhatsApp messages revealed that she was constantly receiving messages from a number that was traced to the accused Pawan Kumar Saroj, a labourer.” Police said they detained Saroj for questioning, during which he confessed to stalking the woman. They were, however, yet to establish how he carried out the murders and who his accomplices were. Officials added that they will now take the accused’s DNA samples to gather evidence. The ADG said that the education certificates accessed by them showed that woman was born in 1996 and the charges filed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act will no longer be applicable. The incident sparked protests in the region with politicians making a beeline to the victims’ village and local residents alleging police negligence. Initially, police registered an FIR against 11 persons for murder and rape under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Police officials said they were yet to find evidence to establish the involvement of the eight people, all upper caste, arrested earlier in the case. They also suspended three policemen, including the station house officer of the local station, for laxity in connection with the incident. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had met the kin of the victims. “The women in the family are living in terror and are scared that they may face harassment again,” she said.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking an appointment with him to discuss the incident. “The family had been communicating their apprehensions about this incident to the police since 2019,” he said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prayagraj-murder-case-dalit-man-held-up-police-say-was-stalking-deceased-101638124224955.html

At least nine countries have confirmed detecting Omicron infections as of Sunday.
29-11-2021||India||‘This is the end’: Comedian Munawar Faruqui after Bengaluru Police cancel show||A show by comedian Munawar Faruqui was cancelled on Sunday, hours before it was supposed to be held in Bengaluru, after the city police denied it permission citing possible law and order problems amid protest by right-wing outfits.Faruqui, who was jailed for a month earlier this year on charges of “insulting Hindu gods and goddesses” during a comedy show, tweeted: “Aaj Bangalore show cancel ho gaya (Under the Threat of venue vandalism) We sold 600+ tickets... Putting me in jail for the joke I never did to cancelling my shows which has nothing problematic in it. This is unfair... I think this is the end. My name is Munawar Faruqui and that’s been my time. You guys were a wonderful audience. Goodbye, I’m done.”He further indicated that he may not do any more shows after at least 12 of his shows were cancelled in the last two months due to threats from right-wing groups. “Nafrat jeet gayi, artist haar gaya (hate has won, the artist has lost). I’m done, goodbye. Injustice,” the tweet said.According to Alwin Mendoza, the manager of Good Shepherdauditorium, Faruqui’s show was scheduled to be held on Sunday evening at Good Shepherd auditorium in Bengaluru for the second time within two months. He said that a show by Faruqui was held last month at the same venue.However, on Saturday, the Bengaluru Police wrote to the organisers and asked them to call off the event as the comedian was a “controversial figure”.“It is learned that Munawar Faruqui is a controversial figure as he was been in controversial statements and on other religion Gods. Many states have banned his comedy shows...,” said the letter by the Ashok Nagar Police Station, adding that the show “could create chaos and could disturb the public peace and harmony which may further lead to Law & order problems”.In his social media post, Faruqui also said that his team had reached out to late Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar for the show, the proceeds of which would be used for charity. “Month back my team called late Puneeth Rajkumar sir organisation for charity which we will be going to generate from this show in Bangalore. We agreed to not sell the show in the name of charity as suggested by the noble organisation.”Faruqui and four others were arrested by Madhya Pradesh police on January 1 following a complaint by Eklavya Singh Gaud, son of BJP MLA Malini Laxman Singh Gaud, that objectionable remarks about Hindu deities as well as Union Home Minister Amit Shah were passed during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore on New Year’s Day. He was later released on bail.Welcoming the cancellation, Mohan Gowda, the spokesperson of Hindu Janajagruthi Samithi, said: “Today the programme by Hindu hater Munawar Faruqui’s show was cancelled and we thank the Bengaluru police.”He added that there should be a permanent ban on him and cancellation of the show on Sunday was due to the efforts of several pro-Hindu organizations who rallied to stop Faruqui’s show in Bengaluru.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, however, tweeted: “Hate won’t win - have faith Don’t give up, don’t stop. #StayUnited.”The Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra and two other senior leaders of the ruling BJP could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-is-the-end-comedian-munawar-faruqui-after-bengaluru-police-cancel-show-101638123863413.html
29-11-2021||India||Nepal seeks permit to conduct census in villages near border||Authorities in Nepal have sought permission from Indian officials to send a team to conduct a population census in Chhangru and Tinkar villages near the Indo-Nepal border, the route to which goes through Pithoragarh district in Uttarakhand, officials familiar with the matter said. The development came during a meeting between the officials of Pithoragarh district and Nepal’s Darchula district across the international border on Saturday evening. The meeting was held a day after former Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said that “if voted to power, his party’s government will take back the areas of Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani in Pithoragarh district through dialogue with India.”Ashish Chauhan, the district magistrate of Pithoragarhm, who was among officials from the Indian side, said, “The Nepalese side had sought the permission during the meeting as the route to the two villages in their area goes through India. They have sought permission before also to conduct the population census amid their ongoing national census. We informed them that the communication has been done with the top-level on same, and as soon as they give their nod for it, we will intimate them accordingly.”Informing about the officials who were in attendance during the meeting, Chauhan said, “Apart from me, the chief development officer of Pithoragarh Anuradha Pal, additional district magistrate PR Chauhan, sub-divisional magistrate of Dharchula, divisional forest officer and executive engineer of the irrigation Dharchula division were present from the Indian side. While from Nepal’s Darchula district, chief district officer Siddhraj Joshi, deputy inspector general, Nepal Armed Police Narendra Bam, 10 other officials attended meeting.”Chauhan further said that “Both sides also agreed to work in utmost coordination in case of a flood-like situation in Kali river, which separates Pithoragarh and Darchula at border.” Nepal raked up the border issue in Pithoragarh district earlier this month by claiming three villages in the Kalapani area were in its territory, again raising an issue that reared its head last year when Kathmandu published a new map showing India’s Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limipiyadhura as part of its territory. Nebin Lal Shresth, director-general of Central Bureau of Statistics of Nepal responsible for the census, said while speaking to a leading Nepalese daily on November 10: “The three villages are under Nepal’s territory but has a presence of Indian armed forces. Hence, there has to be an appropriate solution at government level so that our team can go there for the population census.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-seeks-permit-to-conduct-census-in-villages-near-border-101638123741709.html
29-11-2021||India||BJP sweeps Tripura civic body elections, wins 217 of 222 seats||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the Tripura local body elections, winning 217 of the 222 seats that went to polls, according to the results released on Sunday.The state’s ruling party won all the seats in 11 urban bodies, including the 51-member Agartala Municipal Corporation (AMC ). Of the total 334 seats across 20 urban bodies in the state, the BJP emerged victorious on 329, having won 112 seats uncontested before the polling took place. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) won three seats, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), which bagged the second highest votes in AMC and the Tipra Motha — helmed by Tripura royal family head Pradyot Kishore Debbarma’s— won one seat each.The BJP brass said the results showed that Tripura’s people have faith in the party’s governance model.“The people of Tripura have given a clear message - that they prefer politics of good governance. I would like to thank them for the unequivocal support to @BJP4Tripura,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.Union home minister Amit Shah said the results showed people’s “unwavering trust” in the party. “The results are a clear testimony of people’s unwavering trust in BJP’s politics of development. This will further strengthen our resolve to serve the great land of Maa Tripura Sundari,” he tweeted.Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb said the poll verdict showed that the voters rejected those who he said tried to demean the state. “The people of Tripura from across communities have voted in favour of development. The people have also replied to those who hatched conspiracies to insult and demean our state,” he said.Left Front convener Narayan Kar said, “ We are thankful to the voters who exercised their franchise in favour of the Left Front. The BJP turned the poll into mockery through violence and using the administrative powers amidst failure of state Election Commission and police. We will strengthen our movement in the coming days.”The TMC, however, accused the BJP of using unfair means to win the elections, and claimed that their 24% vote share on an average showed that the voters in the state wanted a change of guard.TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said the performance was “exceptional” for his party, which had negligible presence in Tripura. “This is despite the fact that we commenced our activities barely 3 months ago and @BJP4Tripura left no stone unturned to butcher democracy BUTCHER DEMOCRACY in Tripura,” he tweeted.The state has emerged as the latest flashpoint in the tussle between the TMC and the BJP ahead of the state elections, set to take place in 2023. TMC moved the Supreme Court last week alleging violence in the state prior to the local polls against its candidates, prompting the top court to direct the Centre to deploy additional troops in the state.On Sunday, Section 144 of the CrPc was imposed in the Teliamura Municipal Council area after police personnel and TMC workers were attacked by unidentified men, a police official said.“Some unidentified miscreants attacked our vehicle while we were escorting polling agents and candidates to their homes, “ said a police official on condition of anonymity. He added that the police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpsweeps-tripura-civic-body-elections-wins-217-of-222-seats-101638123623423.html
29-11-2021||India||Mathura: Sec 144 imposed after right-wing outfits’ threat||The Mathura district administration has imposed prohibitory orders under CrPC section 144 following an announcement by the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha that it will install a Lord Krishna idol at the deity’s “actual birthplace”, which it claims is in a mosque close to a prominent temple here.“Nobody will be allowed to disturb the peace and tranquillity in Mathura,” District Magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal said.The clampdown comes even as another right wing organisation, the Narayani Sena, has said it will take out a march from Vishram Ghat to Sri Krishna Janmasthan, demanding the “removal” of the mosque.Section 144 of the CrPC prohibits the assembly of four or more people in an area.Police said they have detained Narayani Sena secretary Amit Mishra in Mathura Kotwali, while the outfit claimed its national president Manish Yadav has been detained in Lucknow.Chahal said he, along with Senior Superintendent of Police Gaurav Grover, reviewed the security around both the religious places, the Katra Keshav Dev temple and the Shahi Idgah.He said the Mahasabha had requested permission to install the idol at the mosque but it was turned down.Question of granting permission to any event that may potentially disrupt peace does not arise, Chahal added.Hindu Mahasabha leader Rajyashri Choudhary had earlier said her organisation will install the idol of Lord Krishna in the Shahi Idgah after a “maha jalabhishek” to “purify” the place on December 6.The date marks the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the site of a temple-mosque dispute, in 1992.The Mahasabha’s threat to perform the ritual inside the Shahi Idgah comes at a time when the local courts are hearing a series of petitions seeking the “removal” of the 17th century mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mathura-sec-144-imposed-after-right-wing-outfits-threat-101638123381707.html

29-11-2021||India||Chennai infra caves in as November rain breaks records||Incessant rainfall has continued to batter Chennai, which recorded its second-highest November rainfall in a decade, according to official figures. The Tamil Nadu capital received 882.4mm rain this month till Sunday, just behind the 1,049 record rainfall received in 2015.The northeast monsoon from October to December is when Tamil Nadu receives most of its rainfall, and since the monsoon set in late this year, Chennai received 215 mm rainfall in October, which was a deficit by 22%. However, the following month, Chennai recorded 79% excess rainfall, taking the toll to 1097.6 mm from October 1 to November 28. “In November alone, till now, we have received 882.4 mm rainfall,” said S Balachandar, head, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Chennai, adding that weathermen were unsure if Chennai will cross the 100cm rainfall milestone with just two days left for the month to end. When asked about the reasons that contributed to an extreme weather condition this year, Balachandar said that there have been successive low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal this month that brought more rains. “We also had a depression that crossed near Chennai overnight between November 6 and November 7 that brought 21cm of rainfall,” he said.The intensity of the rainfall has paralysed the capital city, its adjoining districts of Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram and other districts.In the last 24-hours, two people have died in Cuddalore and Thoothukudi respectively, the disaster management department said. As many as 15,016 people have been evacuated from low lying areas and accommodated in relief camps. Since heavy rains began in the first week of November, crops spread over 50,000 hectares in Tamil Nadu’s delta districts have been damaged. The high rainfall has hampered normal life in the city, with water-logging reported in various parts of the city. 35-year-old M Kavitha scooped out more than 30 buckets of water from the entry of her house in Perumbakkam on Sunday. Though she lives on a higher floor, rainwater entered through an open balcony. She cannot step out since the water is knee-deep. “We have to been stuck inside for at least a week now since this water will take days to be pumped out,” she said. “And we have had no power for the past two days.”The IMD on Friday issued a red alert for all the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai. Overall, Tamil Nadu received 76% excess rainfall this monsoon season. “Almost all districts except Madurai and Virudhunagar have received excess to large excess rainfall,” the IMD said in a bulletin. Up to 5.30 pm on Sunday, Meenambakkam in Chennai received 55mm rainfall, Cuddalore (70mm), Tiruchenduri in Thoothukudi (11mm), Cheyyur in Chengalpattu district received 19mm. Boats were back on Chennai roads for rescue and relief operations in suburban localities such as Perumbakkam and Pallikaranai. The Greater Chennai Corporation increased its capacity of heavy-duty motor pumps from 750 to 850 on Sunday to drain excess water. Traffic was diverted in several areas as roads had to be blocked due to waterlogging.A holiday has been declared for schools in Chennai, Thiruvallur and several other districts for Monday due to the rains as the IMD has predicted heavy rains for Chennai in the next 24-hours and heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places over Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts and heavy rain over Thoothukudi and Ramanathapuram districts. Thunderstorms with moderate rain are likely to occur at most places over the rest of Coastal Tamil Nadu. Chief minister M K Stalin, who has been inspecting flood-affected areas in Chennai and its neighbouring districts since Saturday, tweeted that meteorologists suggested that this is the fourth-highest rainfall in a single month and that it was vital to prevent loss of life and property. Independent weather blogger Pradeep John said that Chennai recorded 1,003 mm until 7.30 pm in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-infra-caves-in-as-november-rain-breaks-records-101638122781725.html
29-11-2021||India||Omicron: 10 restrictions Karnataka has imposed amid new variant concerns||Bringing back several restrictions, the Karnataka government has declared an all-out fight amid apprehension of the new Covid variant, Omicron, first identified in South Africa. The Union health ministry has alerted all states and Union territories to be alert, to increase testing and the monitoring of the hotspots. The decision to resume international flights from December 15, which was earlier announced by the civil aviation ministry, is being reviewed. While all the states are scaling up efforts to assess the situation and take action when there is time, the new variant sent Karnataka into a tizzy as over 1,000 people have come to the state from South Africa. The government said all have been tested and their samples have been sent for genome sequencing. Two Covid positive cases spread fresh concern in the state, while later it was confirmed that those were of Delta variant and not of Omicron. The state government has asked the Centre to ban passengers coming from the affected countries. The state has also sought booster doses of vaccines from the Centre.The state government has put in place several restrictions in the wake of the new Covid variant being reported from other countries.1. People coming from Omicron-affected countries will have to take mandatory RT-PCR after landing in Bengaluru. If they are found positive, they will have to stay in and around the airport.2. All schools, colleges, educational institutes have been asked to postpone all kinds of public events.3. Negative RT-PCR is mandatory for those travelling to Karnataka from Kerala and Maharashtra.4. Students who have travelled to the state from Kerala 16 days ago have to undergo RT-PCR test again.5. Students from Kerala staying in hostels, who have got a negative RT-PCR test report, would have to get the tests done again on the 7th day after the first report.6. Stringent checks have been put in place on the areas bordering Maharashtra and Kerala.7. Two doses of vaccination have been made mandatory for those working at government offices, malls, hotels, swimming pools and theatres.8. All medical and nursing colleges have been alerted to increase testing of students.9. For the MLC elections on December 10, no big public meeting will be allowed.10. Two Covid cluster zones have been identified in Bengaluru and Dharwad. All positive cases in these two clusters will undergo genome sequencing to find the variant.Will there be another lockdown in Karnataka?The chief minister has made it clear that at this stage, the directions are advisory. If required, more stringent measures might be taken, depending on the situation, the chief minister has said. There will be restrictions over Christmas and New Year celebrations too, following the direction of the chief minister, an official said. Separate directives will be issued regarding that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-10-restrictions-karnataka-has-imposed-amid-new-variant-concerns-101638109029504.html
29-11-2021||India||Cong urges Lok Sabha Speaker to ease curbs on media||Congress Member of Parliament (MP), Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Sunday, requesting to re-allow media persons to cover Parliamentary proceedings.In his letter, Chowdhury wrote that media people were denied access to the Press Gallery and were not allowed to interact with the Parliamentarians on the pretext of pandemic guidelines. However, he argued that Covid-19 restrictions have been withdrawn from many public areas, “however, the restrictions imposed during the pandemic are still on for the media person as far as covering the proceedings of the Parliament is concerned,” he said.The Congress MP added, “It is definitely against the spirit of Parliamentary democracy. I am concerned that there is a dangerous trend emerging to isolate the Parliament and the Parliamentarians from media scrutiny.” Chowdhury concluded by appealing to Speaker Om Birla that media persons be allowed access to all necessary facilities that will help them cover the Parliament proceedings in a “free and fair manner.”Congress MP Manickam Tagore supported Chowdhury and retweeted the letter saying, “It’s important one… parliament can’t follow the Gujarat Assembly.. let’s all demand from Hon’ble speaker Media access to Parliament. In the name of #COVID19 it’s not fair.”Since the budget session of Parliament in 2020, media was barred from covering the Parliament proceedings due to the spread of the novel coronavirus disease. However, a few media persons representing news agencies were given access to the proceedings.Prior to the Monsoon session of the Parliament, in July, the Press Club of India, along with several other media organizations, wrote to Birla requesting full access to the Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mp-writes-to-lok-sabha-speaker-to-allow-media-to-cover-parliamentary-proceedings-again-101638107242779.html
29-11-2021||India||What do Omicron's 30 mutations signify? AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria explains||Available information about the new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 indicates many possibilities which need to be scientifically established, AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria said on Sunday commenting on the new variant which has the governments across the world scrambling in panic.Dr Guleria said it has been reported that Omicron has over 30 mutations in the spike protein region. Mutations at the spike protein region makes a variant potential to develop an immune escape mechanism, Dr Guleria said.All vaccines of the world against Covid will have to be reviewed as most vaccines work by forming antibodies against the spike protein. Since Omicron has many mutations in the spike protein, it might render many vaccines less effective, the AIIMS chief said.“The new variant of coronavirus reportedly has got more than 30 mutations at the spike protein region and therefore has the potential of developing immune escape mechanisms. As most vaccines (work by) forming antibodies against the spike protein, so many mutations at the spike protein region may lead to a decreased efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines," Guelria told PTI.The new variant has first been detected in South Africa and the World Health Organization has identified it as a variant of concern. The variant has now been reported in several other countries including the United Kingdom, Australia. So far, there has been no case reported in India.Dr Samiran Panda, the head of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases Division, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said structural changes have been observed in the variant which is indicative of the possibility of "adherence to the same cellular receptors with increased affinity or transmission"."Some of the vaccines are directed towards the spike protein of the virus, which gets attached to the receptor. So if the changes have happened in the virus then the vaccines might not be effective. The mRNA vaccines need to be tweaked around this change that has been already observed, but not that all the vaccines are of similar nature," he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-do-omicron-s-30-mutations-signify-aiims-chief-dr-randeep-guleria-explains-101638103007128.html
29-11-2021||Today's||A bleak and contested new world order||The phrase “new world order” has been doing the rounds episodically in global political discourse since the early 20th century. Rising like the phoenix from the embers of war and tectonic disruption, the idea of a new world order embodied an idealistic aspiration — a world that would be free of violence and bloodshed. But, like many ideals, it has remained nascent and tentative. Very often, the new that followed the old world was characterised more by disorder than order.

And, add to that, information technology (IT) infrastructure and digital highways.
29-11-2021||Today's||The contours of the battle in Uttar Pradesh||The battle for Uttar Pradesh (UP) is now taking shape. With the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) alliance, it is clear that the SP and at least five parties it has allied with will directly take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Will the Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) gain or lose in this clash?Six months ago, the general sentiment was that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav should fight at the grassroots level. But the former chief minister (CM) had been quietly meeting disgruntled NDA allies for months. He was probably waiting for the right time.He had already tied up with Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party, influential in eastern UP, Sanjay Singh Chauhan’s Janawadi Party (Socialist) and the Mahan Dal, which have influence in western UP and Rohilkhand, before he began negotiating seats in western UP with RLD chief, Jayant Chaudhary. Meanwhile, a new round of speculation has started over Akhilesh Yadav’s meetings with Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Raghuraj Pratap Singh “Raja Bhaiya” of the Jansatta Dal (Democratic) and Krishna Patel of the Apna Dal (kamerawadi). Will this new alliance be successful?Akhilesh Yadav’s alliance with the BSP in 2019 failed. The Congress collapsed with just 6% of the vote share and the BJP walked away with nearly 50% of the votes. In 2017, the fight between Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav led to a decline in the SP’s fortunes. At that time, the SP tied up with the Congress, a counterproductive move for the former. The SP, which got 224 seats in the 2012 assembly elections with 29.13% votes, saw its share go down to 21.82% with a mere 47 seats. The Congress got seven seats against 28 in the previous assembly.Akhilesh Yadav has learnt from bitter experiences that neither workers nor voters favour alliances with national parties or with those such as the BSP, which has been a traditional opponent of the SP. This explains why this time around, he has gone for alliances with smaller or sub-regional parties. However, the bigger party has to give up seats for such parties and cannot count on their loyalty. This kind of grouping may not work if the main party does not get a majority. This is what happened with the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar. The SP’s strategists are probably putting off these considerations for another day, something that could cost the party dearly. Can such disparate groupings hold?To answer this, one has to look at the BJP’s trajectory. As expected, it is betting entirely on Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s image and CM Yogi Adityanath’s work. This is why the PM has visited UP five times in the last two months. Many more programmes are scheduled before the code of conduct comes into force. Special care has been taken to focus on regional interests, religion, development, women, Dalits, backward and forward castes and almost every possible political equation. The BJP has assigned region-wise responsibilities to three of its stalwarts — national president JP Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh. In addition, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and former agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh have been touring the state for months.This is to establish direct communication with party workers, redress their grievances and ensure ticket distribution according to zonal requirements. The BJP knows that despite all the work done by the government over five years, it will have to contend with some anti-incumbency sentiments.Now let’s look at the BSP and Congress. For the first time in decades, Mayawati is believed to be a little removed from the main electoral battle. Younger leaders such as Chandra Shekhar Azad, the Bhim Army chief, have started eating into the BSP’s traditional vote bank. In such a situation, will the BSP be able to attract Brahmin votes? The Brahmins have traditionally been with the BJP or Congress. Akhilesh Yadav plans to give tickets in large numbers to Brahmins this time around. Many experts see this election as a fight for supremacy between the BJP and the SP; they overlook the fact that this is a do-or-die battle for the BSP.The Congress too is on the ropes. Its votebank is slowly vanishing, its workers are demoralised and ageing. There is no leader at the regional level who has universal acceptability. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is trying to impress the 5-6% “floating voters”, who have the potential to influence every election, with the slogan “Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon” (I am a girl and I can fight). She knows that women and young voters are Narendra Modi’s biggest strength. She is trying to influence them by promising 40% tickets to women in what appears to be a forerunner to 2024.Whether Priyanka Gandhi Vadra succeeds or fails, UP’s political importance cannot be understated. The election to be fought here in 2022 will decide the future course of the nation.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-contours-of-the-battle-in-uttar-pradesh-101638171928126.html

29-11-2021||Editorials||A new deal for agriculture||The contentious farm laws were repealed by both Houses of Parliament on Monday. Their repeal may be a victory for farmers and Opposition parties — but only to the extent that the three laws pushed through by the government, and on which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party expended a great deal of political capital, have been withdrawn. This is undoubtedly a setback for the government, but it is important to understand that the scrapping of the laws does not leave farmers any better off. The agrarian crisis in the country continues. The unremunerative nature of farming has seen once-dominant landholding agrarian communities take to the streets demanding quotas in admission to educational institutions and in government jobs. Indian agriculture also remains uncompetitive, and the minimum support price (MSP) regime has wreaked havoc with cropping patterns and destroyed water tables.

Almost all of north India, which is what the satellite captures, has seen a significant increase in absolute pollution levels in the last decade.
29-11-2021||Editorials||The onset of the winter session||The winter session of Parliament commences on Monday in the backdrop of a series of significant political events, as well as in the run-up to a series of politically consequential state elections. On one hand, the government has decided to pilot the repeal of the farm laws — a key source of discord between the treasury and Opposition benches for over a year. This opens up room for cooperation. But, on the other hand, before the repeal, there was the tragedy in Lakhimpur Kheri, which will prompt the Opposition to seek the resignation of the minister of state for home, especially given the upcoming polls in Uttar Pradesh. The fact that protests haven’t ended yet, farm groups continue to make a push for legislation on minimum support price, and the future of agriculture will remain a key issue in the Punjab elections, means that there will also be political competition to come across as more sensitive to the interests of farmers.

But countries aspire to move to the next stage of the development hierarchy, and signal to the world that they have robust political and economic institutions.
