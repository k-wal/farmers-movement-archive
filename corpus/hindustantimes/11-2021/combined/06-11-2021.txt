We fear the ruling BJD would try to influence the voters by a largescale distribution of liquor just before polls as was seen during the 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly polls. So we requested the Election Commission to put at least 7 days ban on liquor before the polls,” said Shibananda Ray, Congress leader.According to a Union ministry of social justice and empowerment report titled ‘Magnitude of Substance Use in India - 2019’, Odisha was at the 17th spot among the 36 states and Union territories in the country in terms of alcohol consumption. The survey found around 32 per cent of the population in the age group of 10-75 years to be consuming various forms of alcoholic drinks. The per capita consumption of liquor that was 700 ml in 2001-02 climbed to 3.3 litres in 2018-19.Election Commissioner Padhi said no decision on banning liquor for 7 days before polls has been taken.During Saturday’s meeting with the SEC, political parties demanded raising the expenditure limit for sarpanch and panchayat samiti candidates from ₹80,000 to ₹2 lakh and that of Zilla Parishad candidates from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh. The parties also demanded widening the window for voting from the existing 7 am-12 pm.The panchayati raj department has already prepared a final list of reservations for the president of 30 zilla parishads, half of which would be for women candidates. For the first time in panchayat polls, Zilla Parishad president posts in 4 districts are reserved for candidates from backward class category.Elections are due in February to the posts of 6,800 sarpanch and panchayat samiti members, 92,000 ward members, 853 zilla Parishad members and 314 panchayat samiti chaiperson posts. The 2022 panchayat polls would be crucial for the BJP as it would show whether the party’s popularity has gone up after its stunning success in the 2017 polls when it registered 9 times rise in its zilla parishad members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/political-parties-in-odisha-demand-7-days-ban-during-panchayat-polls-101636222952023.html
06-11-2021||Noida||Man arrested for killing cousin in Noida on Diwali night||A 22-year-old man and his accomplice were arrested on Saturday for allegedly killing his cousin in Noida’s Phase 2 on Diwali, which was observed on Thursday. Police have launched a manhunt for the cousin’s wife, whom they suspect was also involved in the crime. The victim has been identified as 26-year-old Santosh Kumar, a native of Badaun who stayed at Bhangel in Noida and worked as a cab driver. The suspects were identified as Santosh’s cousin Rikendra Kumar (22) and Pintu (23). Sujeet Upadhyaya, station house officer of Phase 2 police station, said Santosh lived with his wife in Bhangel village. “Rikendra was allegedly in a relationship with Santosh’s wife for a few months. This led to differences between the two cousins,” said Upadhyaya. Police said on the night of Diwali, Rikendra called his accomplice Pintu and hatched a plan to murder Santosh. “The two suspects bought some liquor and called Santosh to a secluded place in Noida’s Sector 88 for partying. They offered him drinks and when Santosh lost consciousness, the two suspects assaulted him with bricks. Santosh received critical injuries and died on the spot,” said the SHO. On Friday morning, a passerby spotted the body and informed police. Phase 2 police registered a case against unknown persons under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and launched an investigation. The SHO said mobile phone records and other evidences showed Rikendra was in touch with Santosh on Diwali night. “Rikendra was picked up for questioning and during interrogation, he confessed to the crime. We have arrested both the suspects,” said Upadhyaya adding that the two men will be produced in court and sent to judicial custody. The SHO said primary investigation shows Santosh’s wife was also involved in the murder conspiracy. “The woman is currently on the run. We have deployed a team to trace and arrest her,” said Upadhyaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-arrested-for-killing-cousin-in-noida-on-diwali-night-101636222887642.html
06-11-2021||Lucknow||UP transfers money to accounts of students’ parents for uniforms||Lucknow The state government on Saturday initiated the process to transfer ₹1100 each in the bank accounts of parents of 1.80 crore students of the state, for purchasing school uniforms, sweaters, bags, shoes and socks. Those in the know of things said the move was aimed at putting an end to complaints of poor quality uniforms and shoes being made available to students. In the past, several students also complained of getting either oversized or undersized uniforms and shoes as orders were placed in bulk to lowest bidders. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that the state government had credited ₹1100 in bank accounts of parents of 1.20 crore students of government primary and upper primary schools for purchase of two sets of school uniforms, shoe, socks and sweater. “There are 1.80 crore students in 1.5 lakh government primary and upper primary schools. Money was credited in 1.2 crore parents’ accounts. It will be credited soon in the remaining 60 lakh parents’ accounts. The money is meant to buy two sets of uniform, school bag, shoes, sweater and socks for the students. The money has been transferred through DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) scheme of the government,” he said. Earlier, the government purchased these items from various vendors and distributed them to students. “This led to problem of size and quality of uniforms and sometimes even delay in distribution of these items. The DBT scheme will allow parents to purchase the items of desired quality and size,” said basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi in a video message. Dwivedi said the state government undertook a drive to collect bank data of the parents for the scheme after Covid-19 that made timely distribution of these items more difficult. Targeting the previous governments in the state, the CM said, “The performance of basic schools of Uttar Pradesh is very high on the national standards of grading but some people do not like it. Before 2017, the buildings were in a dilapidated condition and if there were buildings, they were without teachers.” “Further, if there were teachers, students were missing. The students did not have uniforms and children used to go to school barefoot. The whole department was just engaged in transfers and postings. Now when the process is transparent and the condition of government schools has improved to a large extent due to ‘Operation Kayakalp’, they do not liking it. The opposition can’t digest the fact that the children of the poor are going to schools and getting quality education,” he added. Yogi said more than 1.3 lakh government schools were refurbished under Operation Kayakalp and the process to improve the infrastructure in remaining schools would be completed shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-transfers-money-to-accounts-of-students-parents-for-uniforms-101636222827596.html

Currently, there are 68 active cases in the district. As per officials, this is an all-time high of dengue cases in the district. As per data available from the last 10 years, the district had 14 cases in 2012, 69 in 2013, 0 in 2014, 176 in 2015, 17 in 2016, 13 in 2017, 28 in 2018, 40 in 2019 and 28 in 2020.“This year, there has been a spike in dengue cases in the district as they have crossed the 500-mark for the first time. Compared to nearby districts, the situation is still better in Gautam Budh Nagar as regular fogging drives and containment measures are being taken by the authorities,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer. Officials have identified 18 clusters in Noida and Greater Noida where a large number of dengue cases have been reported. Sadarpur, Chhalera, Mamura, Nithari, Barola, Chhijarsi, and Sectors 5, 9, 22 and 51 have been identified as dengue hotspots in Noida. Alpha 2, Gamma 1, Beta 1, Gaur City 1 and 2, Haibatpur, Kulesara and Surajpur are the hotspots in Greater Noida. “This year, we have seen more rainfall for a longer period compared to other years. Because of this, water kept accumulating in artificial containers, providing a conducive environment for mosquitoes to breed. As a result, transmission of the virus increased,” said Sharma.Meanwhile, the Covid helpline (18004192211) issued by the district administration last year for queries related to Covid-19 has been receiving queries regarding dengue now.“As Covid cases have gone down and vaccinations are going smoothly, there are barely any queries regarding Covid on the helpline. However, since the past three weeks, we have been getting 15-20 calls regarding testing facilities for dengue fever and requests to conduct fogging in some areas,” said an official of the health department.Sharma added that such queries are being resolved by the health officials. “If there are requests for fogging in a particular area on the helpline, concerned authorities are informed about it and it is carried out,” said Sharma.Currently, dengue testing is being done at District Hospital, Post Graduate Institute of Child Health, and Government Institute of Medical Sciences in Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dengue-cases-at-an-all-time-high-in-gautam-budh-nagar-tally-crosses-500mark-101636222527571.html
06-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai university’s distance education wing to attract more students with fresh degree courses||Distance education, for years, has come to the rescue of working professionals wanting to pursue higher education. The growing demand for newer courses has finally made way for courses like Masters in Business Administration (MBA) too to be pursued on the distance mode. The Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), the distance education wing of the University of Mumbai (MU) recently started registrations for admissions to the 2021-22 batch, and for the first time ever, IDOL will hold an entrance exam for their newly launched MBA/MMS (Master of Management Studies) program. “IDOL has got permission for MBA/MMS in the distance mode from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) as well as the University Grants Commission (UGC), with approval for 720 seats. This is the first time the University of Mumbai has received recognition for its MBA course and we plan to declare dates for the entrance exam very soon,” said Vinod Malale, deputy registrar (public relations), MU. This is the first year of three new approved courses, Bachelor of Science (B Sc) Computer Science, Masters in Art (MA) Geography and MBA/MMS and officials at IDOL are seeing this as a positive trend. “We are already receiving inquiries for the new courses. For years IDOL was opted by working professionals, but like every other education institute which was hit by Covid, IDOL too faced a decline in admissions. We hope to attract maximum applications this time around,” added Malale. IDOL completed its admission for the July session of 2020-21 academic year and witnessed a drop in admissions from 67,000 students enrolled in the 2019-20 academic year to 64,000 admissions confirmed in the 2020-21 academic year. Officials and experts attributed this decline to the job losses and economic trouble faced by many, due to the pandemic induced lockdown. “The job market is looking better and we hope to attract more students than ever this time around,” he said. Last week, IDOL kicked off admissions for its 17 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Despite Covid-19 hampering routine work, IDOL managed to register admissions of nearly 64,000 students across 14 courses in 2021-20, but with the launch of three new courses, officials are looking forward to a better admissions session. “MMS course will be a two-year program divided into four semesters. The syllabus of MMS offered through regular college and IDOL will be the same. We are thrilled to offer such interesting courses to students,” said a senior official for IDOL. He added that the course material was discussed on several occasions by the academic council and finally a proposal was sent to the UGC. The final approval came through from the Distance Education Bureau (DEB) of the UGC. Other than these new courses, IDOL has also been planning to offer popular undergraduate courses like BMS (Bachelor in Management Studies), BMM (Bachelor in Mass Media) and BAF (BCom in Accounting and Finance) in physical as well as online mode. Apart from the degree courses, IDOL is also planning to offer a host of certificate programs, including a few courses in collaboration with the Bombay Stock Exchange and MU’s department of journalism. For a certificate course in radio jockeying, IDOL is in the process of reviving the university’s campus radio channel which had gone off the air a few years ago. “The idea is to make education more accessible for everyone. Now that education is already being impacted online, the gap between interested students and available courses has reduced and this makes the entire process easier for students as well as universities,” said the senior official. The last date for filling out the admission form is November 20, 2021. Interested students can log on to https://old.mu.ac.in/distance-open-learning/ for further information.

According to official data, the total tally of dengue cases is highest in the district after 2013, when the number of cases stood at 1,622. However, so far, the district health department has not reported any dengue death compared to 2013, when four fatalities from the infection were reported. The first dengue case in the district was reported on September 1 with the month recording 312 cases followed by 647 cases in October. As many as 85 dengue cases have been reported so far in November. The district breached the 1,000 cases mark on November 3. According to the official data, the daily average of dengue cases was about 10.4 in September which shot up to 20.87 in October. In the current month, 14.16 dengue cases are being reported on an average per day. “The number of dengue cases reported daily on average has declined in November. This is because the temperature has suddenly dropped and more relief is expected by end of November. With the ongoing trend, we are expecting that there will be no fresh cases by mid December,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. “In 2013, the total number of dengue cases stood at 1,622. If the current declining trend continues, we hope the current tally of dengue cases will not cross 2013’s figure. As for our part, our teams are continuing fogging and spraying of anti-larvae in high caseload areas and every case is being mapped for containment,” said Gupta. In 2014, the overall dengue tally in the district stood at 928 and then onwards, there has been a decline in the total number of cases reported in a year. “This year, there have been more cases due to the prolonged monsoon and heavy rains which caused waterlogging in many areas. If there has been a minor decline in fresh cases, we need to observe it further for some more weeks before we can say that it is actually on decline. In the previous years, there has been a declining trend in dengue cases after the temperature falls right after Diwali,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). Unlike dengue, cases of malaria stood were under control. The total tally of malaria cases stands at 16, with one case reported in October and none in November so far. Likewise, the tally of scrub typhus also stood at 39 with no cases in October and November. “Cases of malaria and scrub typhus were majorly reported in September. No cases from either of the infection have emerged in the following months,” said Dr Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/tally-of-dengue-cases-crosses-1-000-in-ghaziabad-fresh-cases-on-the-decline-101636222342377.html

Hrishikesh, who was summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for the fifth time on November 5, failed to appear before the agency. “We have moved an anticipatory bail application on behalf of Hrishikesh,” said advocate Vikram Chaudhri, who appeared for Hrishikesh Deshmukh along with advocates Inderpal Singh and Aniket Nikam. “The agency had last summoned him on August 15. Two-and-a-half months later, they have suddenly summoned him again. Apprehending arrest, this application has been moved.” As ED sought time to reply to the plea, additional sessions judge Prashant Sitre posted the plea for hearing on November 12. The pre-arrest bail plea reads: “The entire proceedings are actuated with malice. The whole edifice of the ECIR and consequential investigations initiated by the ED pale into insignificance in view of the contents of the FIR registered in Goregaon police station for extortion in which dismissed police inspector Sachin Vaze has clearly mentioned that ‘Number 1’ is Param Bir Singh.” It added: “In such circumstances, the manner in which the allegations have been twisted against the applicant and his father and the investigations have thus commenced in a shady manner certainly warrants the interference of this court to remedy the wrong committed against the applicant.” Hrishikesh’s plea further stated that it was a matter of record that on account of a witch-hunt campaign launched at the instance of certain vested inimical interests, “some blatantly false allegations have been levelled by those persons (Sachin Vaze and Param Bir Singh) who have absolutely no credibility, honour or pride.” “These unscrupulous persons are themselves knee-deep involved in several rackets of extortion, fraud and even murder. The principal person who held the high office of Commissioner of Police is now a wanted absconding criminal. The ED has been citing some properties which were purchased by the father Anil Deshmukh fifteen years ago when the applicant was a teenager. The agency has changed its stand in last few days before various courts and is now treating them as suspect to accused based on same material available before it. The agency has neither arrested Surinder Jain or Virender Jain the alleged hawala operators in the case and the agency was adopting a pick and choose method. The applicant fears arrest like his father if he appears before the agency and prays for pre-arrest bail,” the plea added. ED has arrested Anil Deshmukh on November 2 after he joined probe in the money laundering case against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/money-laundering-case-anil-deshmukh-s-son-applies-for-pre-arrest-bail-101636221506986.html

Police said all the persons were arrested and later released on bail. The unchecked bursting of firecrackers caused pollution levels to spike in the district, with the air quality breaching the ‘severe’ category. An air quality index reading above 400 is considered to be ‘severe’. On Saturday, Noida and Greater Noida had an AQI recording of 461 and 414 respectively. Love Kumar, joint commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said the commissionerate did not issue licences for the sale of firecrackers to any vendor this year. “The police had deployed their enforcement teams and also registered cases against some vendors for unauthorised sale of firecrackers. The police team also stopped people from bursting firecrackers in Noida and Greater Noida. It seems some people managed to get the firecrackers and burst them on Diwali,” said Kumar.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said 43 people were booked in 31 FIRs in Noida. He said police teams ensured the enforcement of rules and regulations in the jurisdiction of different police stations and even cracked down on people bursting firecrackers. “The suspects have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and also under Explosive Substances Act. They have been served notices under Section 41-A of the Criminal Procedure Code to appear before court as and when required,” said the DCP. Sub-inspector Sunil Kumar said that he was on duty in Sadarpur village where he spotted a man bursting firecrackers on Diwali. “The suspect was identified as Rambhajan, a resident of Sadarpur village. A case has been registered against him under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health) of the IPC at Sector 39 police station,” he said. A few cases were also registered in Greater Noida. Ayodhya Prasad, a sub-inspector at Kasna police station, said some men were bursting firecrackers near Gharbara road. “We reached the spot and saw a number of people bursting firecrackers. Most of them fled the spot when they saw us. We apprehended two suspects – Pankaj Kumar and Sandeep Kumar, who said they were aware of the ban on firecrackers but were still bursting them. A case has been registered against them under Section 188 of the IPC and Section 9B of the Explosive Substances Act, 1884,” said Prasad. Police also lodged some cases against vendors for illegally selling firecrackers without a licence. Sector Beta 2 police registered a case against two vendors, identified as Zakir and Mohan (known by their first names), in Bironda village on Friday. The two were later released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/141-arrested-in-gautam-budh-nagar-for-bursting-firecrackers-on-diwali-101636221326904.html
06-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad surpasses Noida to become the worst polluted city in the country||The air quality, which started deteriorating on the day of Diwali, continued its downward trend with Ghaziabad and Noida emerging as the two most polluted cities across the country on Saturday. The air quality index (AQI) released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) indicated that Ghaziabad was most polluted on Saturday with an AQI reading of 466 while Noida, with an AQI of 461, was the second most polluted city in the country--the air quality of both the cities hovering in the ‘severe’ category. Greater Noida too was in the ‘severe’ category with an AQI of 414. According to forecast of the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), strong north-westerly winds have enhanced transport of emissions from stubble burning. “Share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is 41% (effective fire count 5,159)... Delhi’s AQI is likely to improve to upper end of ‘very poor’ category as surface winds are becoming stronger in dispersing air pollutants,” said the Safar forecast. An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 “severe”. Environmentalists said the pollution levels will improve on its own and there is no man-made intervention than can mitigate high pollution levels. “It has been a regular feature in the past few years that meteorological conditions have spiked pollution and also mitigated it. The present spike in pollution levels is the result of burning crackers and also meteorological factors. It will subside on its own in the coming days as the volume of vehicles on roads, that shot up during the festive season, will also reduce. The inter-departmental coordination between the agencies is missing. There is hardly any effect of enforcement on the ground level,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. On Saturday, the four stations monitoring air quality in Ghaziabad and the two in Greater Noida recorded PM2.5 as the primary pollutant while the four monitoring stations in Noida had both PM2.5 and PM10 as primary pollutants. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board said the spike in pollution levels was higher during the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. “The pollution levels increased due to burning of crackers. The effect reduced during the day on Friday as wind speed picked up and helped pollutants to disperse. It is expected that the upcoming spike will be more because of stubble burning, which has spiked to 41% as per the Safar forecast. It is likely that the pollution levels will improve from the evening of November 7,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad, who is also officiating for Noida. A day after Diwali on November 5, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida had an AQI of 470, 464 and 475 respectively, under the “severe” category, with Noida emerging as the most polluted city across the country. “The spike in pollution levels during this time of the year is a feature prevailing in the Ghaziabad/Noida region for past several years and the trend is continuing this year as well. A comprehensive study about the meteorological factors, demography, wind pattern and other elements, must be conducted to find out the reasons behind the spike just before the onset of winter,” said Sushil Raghav, another city-based environmentalist. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality early warning system for Delhi, the air quality is likely to improve further and reach the lower end of “very poor” category on November 8. “The outlook for subsequent five days: The air quality is likely to improve progressively and remain in lower end of very poor category to poor category. PM2.5 to be the predominant pollutant,” the forecast said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-surpasses-noida-to-become-the-worst-polluted-city-in-the-country-101636220966935.html

As much as the flowers add to the aesthetics of a house during the festival of lights, they end up in the trash as soon as the decorations are taken down. Some environment-conscious residents of Gautam Buddh Nagar are now making the most out of this flower waste and turning it into rich organic compost.At Prateek Wisteria apartments in Noida’s Sector 77, the Apartment Owners’ Association is collecting flower waste from residents to turn it into compost.“We have requested all residents in our society not to throw away the flowers used in Diwali decorations and instead use them to make compost. We taught residents the process of making compost out of the flowers,” said Amit Gupta, president of Prateek Wisteria AOA.“As an alternative, we have also provided a collection box at each tower where residents can put all their old flower decorations and the housing complex gardener will use it to make compost for the society’s garden. Usually, people throw away the flowers in trash or at the roadside in a polythene, which adds to the garbage problem,” said Gupta.Residents of Sector 62’s HCL towers are also using their flower waste to make compost in their apartment complex, thanks to Anamika Chaturvedi who took the initiative.“I first started doing this (making compost) myself in 2019. This year, we spread word among other residents of our society, who will be reusing the flowers to make compost. In fact, to make the most of these flowers, I am also trying to make bioenzyme (organic solutions usually produced by fermentation of fruits, vegetables, sugar, and water that are a natural way of managing home cleaning needs) out of them this year. If it works, I will be holding a workshop to inform and educate other residents,” said Chaturvedi, who runs an eco-friendly resident’s group called Bhumitra.A similar initiative is being carried out by Arun Vihar residents’ group ‘SAAPH’ (Sustainable Alternatives and Awareness against Plastics and Household waste) led by seven women residents.“We first started reusing Diwali flower waste for making compost in 2019 and spread the word among other residents as well. We have already been using green waste of our homes to make compost for many years now, we will just add the flowers used for decoration purposes during Diwali in our usual compost,” said Radhika Gulati, a resident of Arun Vihar and a member of SAAPH.She added this year, instead of clay diyas, she used diyas made of cowdung which will also be used to make compost. In Sector 55, Shail Mathur did not buy fresh flowers to make rangoli at her home for Diwali. Instead, she picked up all the waste flowers from the local temple in the sector a day before Diwali in order to reuse them.“Every day, tonnes of flowers are offered at the local temple in our sector. This Diwali, instead of buying fresh flowers or colours for rangoli, I decided to reuse the flower waste from the temple. Usually, this flower waste is dumped as trash,” said Mathur, who created a residents group TREE (Taking Responsibility for Earth and Environment.) Now that Diwali is over, these rangoli flowers will be used for making compost, she added.In Sector 37, Sumit Khanna has spread word among his family and friends to give all their flower waste to him as he will be using it to make ‘dhoop’ or incense sticks. “We have created a collection point for all our friends and family who will be giving us their flower waste. This will be sent by us to self-help groups in Jaipur which will make ‘dhoop’ out of the flowers,” said Khanna. who runs an eco-friendly venture called Indibam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/environmentconscious-residents-of-noida-reuse-diwali-waste-for-making-compost-101636220426973.html

Bettiah and Gopalganj reported 13 and 15 deaths respectively while 4 fresh deaths were reported earlier on Saturday from Samastipur.“Wherever the police are active, there is sale of illicit liquor. Especially in East Champaran, the sale of illicit alcohol can not happen without the collusion of police,” Jaiswal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Jaiswal also called for the review of the Prohibition Act. “We need to review the entire prohibition policy. We cannot link the prohibition policy with this incident. But the Bihar government must look into the suspicious role of the administration,” Jaiswal said.“The law is strict and has been made with tough rules, but the circumstances show that people are not as aware. The government's primary work will be to stop the mafia gangs in villages as the police has meagre control," Jaiswal added referring to the recent deaths due to the hooch tragedy.As many as 32 people, including 15 people in Bettiah, 13 people in Gopalganj and four people in Samastipur died due to the consumption of spurious liquor.Bihar minister Sunil Kumar added that two more are suspected to be dead due to the consumption of spurious liquor in Bettiah but he said that the reason is yet to be ascertained since the post-mortem reports are not yet released. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar held a review meeting and said that the government is looking into the prohibition rule as well as the recent deaths.Raids were conducted in 60 locations in Bihar's Gopalganj district and 19 people were arrested so far in connection with the hooch tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-hooch-tragedy-toll-reaches-32-bjp-state-prez-claims-police-collusion-101636219461138.html
06-11-2021||Mumbai||‘Sachin Vaze extorted huge sums from cricket bookies’: Crime branch tells court||A metropolitan magistrate court on Saturday extended Mumbai police crime branch custody of dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze by seven days after special prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap informed the court that the 52-year-old controversial cop has extorted huge money from cricket books by threatening to frame and arrest them in false cases, the Mumbai police crime branch informed a metropolitan magistrate. Jagtap pointed out that Vaze has extorted huge money from cricket bookies at the behest of Param Bir Singh and sought an extension of his custody for his further custodial interrogation to find out if he has extorted money from others as well. In August, the Goregaon police registered an extortion case against Singh, Vaze, who is arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases, and four civilians - Sumeet Singh, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Singh and Riyaz Bhati. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint by Agarwal, alleging that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him. They also threatened to register cases against his hotel restaurant and bar. The crime branch has already arrested Sumeet Singh, who allegedly used to collect money for Vaze, on whose orders money was allegedly collected by Sumeet Singh from Agarwal. In this case, the court has already issued non-bailable warrants against Param Bir Singh, Riyaz Bhati, a purported aide of gangster Dawood Ibrahim, and one Vinay Singh. Vaze has been arrested in this case on November 1 and was remanded to the crime branch custody. He was presented before the Esplanade metropolitan magistrate court on Saturday as his earlier custody remand ended. Appearing for the crime branch, advocate Jagtap sought an extension of his custody. He informed the court that the crime branch has collected Vaze’s voice samples in order to prove the number of phone call conversations with Vaze that the complainant had recorded. In these calls, Vaze talked about his alleged extortion activities involving him and Singh. Agarwal submitted the recorded audio clips to the crime branch which will now try to match the (Vaze’s) sample voice with Vaze’s alleged voice in the recorded conversations with Agarwal to corroborate allegations of extortion against Singh, Vaze and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-extorted-huge-sums-from-cricket-bookies-crime-branch-tells-court-101636219705895.html
06-11-2021||Mumbai||Aryan Khan cruise drug raid case: BJP, NCP trade charges||A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) functionary on Saturday targeted the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) alleging that a party worker named Sunil Patil was the “mastermind” of the Aryan Khan drug raid case, even as NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged that Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede had attempted to “kidnap Aryan Khan” and frame him in a drug bust case after failing to get extortion money from his family.“Wankhede tried to extort money after kidnapping Aryan Khan and later framed him in a drug bust case after his plans failed,” Malik said. When asked for a reaction to this, Wankhede refused to comment.Wankhede and his team arrested Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan and a few others for their alleged involvement in the cruise drugs party on October 2.BJP functionary Mohit Khamboj said at Saturday’s press conference that Patil, an NCP worker since its inception, had given the number of Kiran Gosavi, an independent witness in the case, to Sam D’Souza and told him that Gosavi will coordinate with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Prabhakar Sail, another independent witness in the case, had alleged that Gosavi and Sam D’Souza were involved in an extortion attempt involving Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani and Wankhede was a reported beneficiary. Sail made these allegations in a notarised affidavit on October 23.Khamboj said that he would disclose the “entire conspiracy” with all the supporting “proof”. Though he did not name Malik, Kamboj said that a “narrative of lies [was being created] in the entire country.”According to Khamboj, Patil contacted D’souza with information that drugs would be consumed on a cruise ship party set to sail on October 2. “Sunil Patil sent a WhatsApp message and called Sam D’Souza on October 1. He told D’souza that there is going to be a cruise party where drugs would be consumed. He said that he had information about 27 people and sought to connect to a Narcotics Department official. Sam D’souza spoke to NCB official VV Singh about this,” Khamboj said.“The question now is, why is the cabinet minister [Nawab Malik] using Sunil Patil to create this conspiracy? A narrative of lies has been weaved since last one month linking BJP to the raid, connecting people associated with BJP as [independent] witnesses, and that Sameer Wankhede and the BJP are hand-in-glove... The minister, who is in favour of drugs, will now have to come out and respond,” he said.Reacting to Khamboj’s charge, Malik tweeted: “A member of Sameer Dawood Wankhede’s private army just held a Press Conference to misguide and divert the attention from the truth albeit unsuccessfully. I will reveal the truth tomorrow.”The NCP meanwhile has denied that Patil was a member of the party. NCP leaders released pictures of Gosavi and Patil with Gujarat cabinet minister Kiritsinh Rana as well as other images of Patil and Manish Bhanushali, a BJP functionary and yet another independent witness in the cruise drug party case.“I had demanded an SIT probe to investigate Sameer Dawood Wankhede for kidnapping & ransom demand from Aryan Khan. Now 2 SITs are constituted (state & centre), let us see who brings out the skeletons from the closet of Wankhede and exposes him and his nefarious private army,” Malik tweeted on Saturday morning.A four-member team, led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Milind Khetle was formed on October 27 to probe the allegations made by Sail. The NCB has is also conducting an internal probe against officials, including Wankhede, following Sail’s allegations.Sail claimed to have overheard a phone call between his employer Kiran P Gosavi — another witness in the cruise ship drug raid case — and Sam D’Souza. The discussion was about a payment of ₹25 crore. “You put a bomb of 25 crores and let’s settle at 18 final, because we have to give 8 crores to Sameer Wankhede,” Gosavi told Sam D’Souza, according to the affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aryan-khan-cruise-drug-raid-case-bjp-ncp-trade-charges-101636219406702.html

06-11-2021||Patna||Oppn, ruling party play blame game over hooch deaths in Bihar||A war of words ensued between the opposition and ruling parties over the recent hooch tragedies in Bihar. While the opposition parties alleged the connivance of the ruling party leaders and government officials for the proliferation of illegal liquor trade, the ruling party leaders accused the opposition of levelling false allegations on the government with an apparent intent to protect the liquor mafia. Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajit Sharma said that sudden spurt in hooch-related deaths laid credence to the general perception that the prohibition act had miserably failed in Bihar. “Either the state government should completely smash the illegal liquor trade network or scrap the law to legalise its sale after imposing three-four fold tax. The revenue collected from liquor sales can be used to develop industries and create jobs for the unemployed,” argued Sharma. At least 26 persons, including an army man and a Border Security Force (BSF) jawan, have died due to alleged consumption of spurious liquor in Bihar in the last five days. Officials said that illicit liquor had claimed more than 100 lives across the state since January this year. The consumption of illicit liquor has risen suddenly due to the ongoing panchayat polls. Opposition leader and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had alleged that the liquor prohibition in the state was only confined in the words of the chief minister. “Instead of taking strict action against the officials, Mafiosi and illegal traders, CM Nitish Kumar keep on cautioning the people from not consuming the liquor. “The police had recovered two trucks loaded with illegal liquor from the school of a BJP minister in the government. Yet, there is no reference of the minister in the FIR,” alleged Yadav. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said that it was high time the government should re-evaluate the prohibition act, which utterly failed to check alcohol’s consumption, and rethink if the law was effective. “The accountability of deaths due to illicit liquor must be fixed at the higher levels,” said Mishra. Former MLA and Congress leader Rishi Mishra and other Congress leaders held a Press conference and sought time from governor Fagu Chauhan to discuss the prohibition law vis-à-vis recurring deaths due to spurious liquor. Meanwhile, JD(U) national president and MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh categorically said there would be no relaxation in liquor ban and the existing excise law for prohibition would remain enforced strictly. “ With the excise law in place, action can be taken against liquor vendors manufacturing illicit liquor. Strict action would be taken against the culprits,” he said while taking potshots at the RJD’s first family and RJD chief Lalu Prasad for leaving Patna once the by-polls were.” Where were they when Covid pandemic had stuck,” he asked“The opposition parties shall not indulge in politics over the tragedies. The CM has already announced to review the situation in the coming weeks and see what is lacking,” said Neeraj Kumar, JD(U) spokesperson and MLC. He also questioned the logic behind the CLP leader Sharma’s contention of scrapping the liquor law and asked him to issue a formal request from the party to the government for lifting the prohibition law. “How can Sharma say like this, as the Congress party members are bound by the party’s oath not to take liquor,” asked the JD(U) MLC. BJP spokesman and national general secretary of the OBC front Nikhil Anand said that the government was firm on enforcing strict adherence to the prohibition laws. “Those found indulging in violating the laws have been penalised. Still, some illegal traders are being patronised by the opposition parties trying to prove that the law has completely failed in the state. Instead of issuing statements, opposition leaders shall abide by their commitment to make Bihar a liquor-free state,” said the BJP leader..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/oppn-ruling-party-play-blame-game-over-hooch-deaths-in-bihar-101636218509049.html

Sale and consumption of liquor is banned in Bihar since April 2016.In Samastpur, four people, including two jawans, allegedly died after consuming spurious liquor at Rupali Chak of Patori block in Samsatipur on Friday night, said police.Two persons also fell ill and are currently undergoing treatment at different hospitals.However, the family members of the three deceased denied consumption of alcohol by the victims. DM, Samastipur, Shashank Shubhankar, said, “Four people died, but three families have denied consumption of liquor by the victims. We are waiting for their viscera report. Prima facie, it appears that liquor was the reason behind the incident. We also launched a drive to identify people who sat with them for consuming liquor,” he added.SP, M S Dhillon, Samsatipur, said, “Some bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) were also recovered during the search drive. The police are investigating the matter,” he added.The deceased persons have been identified as 27-year-old army jawan Mohan Kumar and 53-year-old BSF jawan Vinay Kumar Singh, besides one Shyam Nandan Choudhary (50) of Sangrampur and Virchandra Rai (35) of Rupali. Both jawans had come to their villages to celebrate Diwali and Chhath Puja.The incident came to notice when they complained about low vision on Friday night. During the investigation, the police got to know that all the victims had bought liquor from the same place.In Gopalganj, two persons died on Saturday allegedly due to spurious liquor.Anand Kumar, superintendent of police (SP), said that as many as 36 persons have been arrested in the past two days.Dr Nawal Kishor Choudhary, district magistrate (DM), Gopalganj, said, “Sternest action will be taken against those found guilty. We have already identified the drinkers across the district with the help of chowkidars and police officials. A major drive has been launched to nab persons indulged in sale or consumption of liquor,” said DM Choudhary.Meanwhile, at Telhuwa village, where a total of 14 people have died so far due to suspected spurious liquor since November 4, the residents were inconsolable. “We had never visualised a day like this in our lives. This incident could have been averted had the local police acted against liquor traders, namely Munna Ram and Ram Prakash Ram,” said a villager Heera Lal Ram. Barely a few meters away, deceased Madan Ram’s wife Anita Devi at Dakshini Telhuwa village said her husband was a regular liquor consumer and had the same alcohol along with a few other villagers on the eve of Dipawali. A total of 14 people died in West Champaran, 13 in Gopalganj and four in Samastipur due to consumption of spurious alcohol, said the officials.In a related development, a joint team of Bettiah police and excise department conducted raids at 88 locations to look for over 2400 litres of raw materials for liquor manufacturing. “A total of 16 people were arrested,” said Upendra Nath Verma, superintendent of police (SP), Bettiah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-hooch-deaths-six-more-deaths-take-toll-to-31-101636218506454.html
06-11-2021||Bhopal||Gwalior aircraft crash landing: MP govt suspends pilot||The Madhya Pradesh government has suspended its senior pilot Majid Akhtar for "serious negligence" that caused the crash landing of an aircraft at Gwalior airport on May 6 this year. The suspension order issued recently by MP Aviation Department Secretary M Selvendran stated that "serious negligence on the part of Captain Majid Akhtar resulted in damage to the plane and loss to the government". The Madhya Pradesh government had bought the aircraft, a seven-seater Beechcraft King Air B-200GT VT MPQ, from American company 'Textron Aviation' for over ₹65 crore last year. The order, in Hindi, further said Akhtar was not allowed to leave the headquarters Bhopal without prior permission and that he had been suspended under relevant sections of the Civil Services Rules. While Selevendra did not respond to calls, a top MP Aviation department, who did not wish to be identified, confirmed the development on Saturday. Earlier, in August, aviation safety regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had suspended the flying licence of Akhtar for a period of one year in connection with the crash landing. The state-owned B-200GT VT MPQ aircraf was bringing supplies of Remdesivir, an antiviral drug used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, from Gujarat to Gwalior via Indore when it crash landed at around 9 pm on May 6 at the Gwalior airport, which has an Air Force base. The incident, in which the newly-purchased aircraft skidded and turned over to one side, resulted in major damage to the cockpit front, propeller blades, propeller hub and wheels, and had left Akhtar and co-pilot Shiv Jaiswal and one more person injured. The DGCA licence suspension letter had stated that Akhtar "flew the aircraft very low and failed to sight the arrester barrier" before the runway, adding that "the approach profile of the aircraft was not appropriate for landing in the touchdown zone and resulted in hitting the arrester barrier". The DGCA letter had further said Akhtar was issued a show case notice on July 1, and his explanation was found to be "not satisfactory". It said the crash landing took place due to a manual error and noted that Akhtar's actions not only jeopardised the safety of the aircraft, but were also in violation of the Aircraft Rules. The incident had reduced the plane to scrap, source said, while the opposition Congress, at the time, had said officials responsible for not insuring the aircraft, and thereby causing loss to the state exchequer, were being shielded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/gwalior-aircraft-crash-landing-mp-govt-suspends-pilot-101636218142907.html
06-11-2021||Lucknow||Baba-Babua barbs resonate in war of words between CM Yogi, Akhilesh Yadav||Just a few months before the Uttar Pradesh assembly election, a war of words erupted between chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday.After Akhilesh Yadav called Yogi “Baba” at an event earlier in the day, Adityanath took a jibe at the SP chief and said, “Babua, ye Twitter hi vote bhi de dega (This twitter will give you votes).”The chief minister was in Akhilesh Yadav’s home district Etawah on Saturday late afternoon to inaugurate and lay foundations for projects worth about ₹475 crore. The projects he inaugurated included the Central jail in Etawah.Hours before, Yadav, referring to Yogi Adityanath, said, “Baba Mukhya Mantri should not contest an assembly seat, he is already on his way out.”The former chief minister often refers to Adityanath as “Baba” (an apparent allusion to Yogi’s position as the chief priest of the Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur). Babua was a term frequently used by Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati in the run-up to 2012 UP assembly polls to hit out at Akhilesh Yadav. At that time, Yadav often used to refer to Mayawati as bua (paternal aunt). Neither Mayawati nor Yadav uses these terms for each other anymore.At the Etawah function, Yogi hit out at Yadav for frequently accusing the BJP and him of “re-laying foundation stones and inaugurating or re-inaugurating previous SP government projects”.“I congratulate you all on the inauguration and foundation laying of a total of 21 development works in Etawah on the day of Bhaiya Dooj. It happens only in the BJP government that we lay the foundation and then inaugurate the projects. When the intent is not clean, dishonesty and corruption rule. Even if power is attained by deceit, and foundation stones are laid, the public doesn’t leave them in a state to inaugurate the projects,” said Yogi.“We lay the foundation in shubh muhurat (auspicious time), and then inaugurate them in shubh muhurat. The projects for which we laid foundation stones three years earlier, we are inaugurating them today,” he said.The chief minister also mentioned Ayodhya to attack the SP without directly naming it.“The glitters of the lamps of Ayodhya is shining the world over,” he said, adding that it was the same Ayodhya where people used to be scared to go earlier and where Rambhakts (devotees of Ram) were fired at (in 1990 when Akhilesh Yadav’s father Mulayam Singh Yadav was the Uttar Pradesh chief minister).“I came here (Etawah) twice during corona but people of other parties were in home isolation when you were amid crisis. They should be confined to their homes even during polls. They need to be given replies to by people in this manner only. Tell them, ‘Babua, ye Twitter hi vote bhi de dega’,” he further said.Yogi also made reference to “kabristan (graveyard) boundary walls” and Yadav’s recent Jinnah remark.“Earlier, money used to be spent on kabristan boundary walls, now, money is spent on development projects. Someone is embracing mafia, while someone else is making Jinnah his ideal,” he said.While the comment about Jinnah was aimed at Akhilesh Yadav, the remark about embracing the mafia was apparently targeted at SP ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP). SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar had made a statement on November 3 saying if Mukhtar Ansari wants to contest the assembly polls then SBSP will give him a ticket. Rajbhar visited Ansari in Banda jail on November 2.Akhilesh Yadav, at a public meeting in Hardoi on October 31, said that leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Muhammad Ali Jinnah played a crucial role in India’s freedom struggle.In an obvious reference to the Samajwadi Party without naming it, Yogi said, “My family is the state’s 25 crore people, while for some their own clan was the state.”Although the SP has not reacted to Yogi’s visit to Etawah on Saturday, Yadav had said, “Okay. He must be coming to inaugurate some of the projects initiated by our government.”Akhilesh Yadav had made the remark during his visit to his ancestral village Saifai (in Etawah).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/babababua-barbs-resonate-in-war-of-words-between-cm-yogi-akhilesh-yadav-101636218207775.html

Additional commissioner of police (economic offences wing) RK Singh said the suspect, Sameesh Chawla,53, was arrested in a case that the EOW had registered in September 2020, based on a woman’s complaint that Chawla and his partners had taken money from her and others, after promising them high returns, but later fled without returning the money. During the probe, police found that one of the persons that Chawla had allegedly duped was a former India cricketer, who had invested around ₹25 lakh, in the hopes of getting high returns. Police said Chawla had allegedly duped the victims to the tune of ₹1.34 crore. “Investigation revealed that Chawla and his family members used to lure people residing in their neighbourhood to invest with them after promising higher returns. The amount was received in cash as well as through banking channels. After taking the money, the accused persons neither paid the principal amount nor any interest to the investors. Our police team arrested Chawla from Mehrauli on Friday.

06-11-2021||Lucknow||Allahabad high court for expeditious examination of viscera samples to avoid delay in investigation||The Allahabad high court has taken a serious note of delay in submission of viscera reports affecting investigation of criminal cases. The court directed the Uttar Pradesh director general of police (DGP), and the secretary (home) of the state government to take up this issue for expeditious examination of viscera samples to help the investigating agencies so that it does not become an impediment before the courts in deciding matters.The Allahabad high court was hearing a bail application filed by one Tahir Khan of Jhansi district in Uttar Pradesh.Justice Samit Gopal observed, “The examination of viscera is also an integral part of investigation which may provide a link regarding the cause of death or give a lead in the matter. In so far as the offence is concerned, the delay in examination of viscera and due to the same being wanting, the investigating agency forwards reports under the criminal procedure code before the court concerned, on which the courts take cognizance and proceed with the matter and then at some stage the report of viscera is supplemented as document of investigation. In totality of circumstances, investigation remains lacking in the event of non-receipt of report of chemical examiner.”“The delay in examination of viscera is seen not only in this case, but in many other cases. Result is thus that the opinion of the investigating officer is lacking in so far as the opinion of experts with regards to viscera is concerned. It is observed that there is no method evolved till date for speedy analysis of viscera so that the investigation may be completed in one go and a report may be filed after its conclusion in whatsoever nature it may be,” observed the Allahabad high court.Fixing November 11, 2021 as the next date of hearing, the court directed the additional government advocate (AGA) to communicate this order to the officers concerned for its compliance and necessary action.A viscera report is prepared to determine the cause of death in suspicious circumstances, where autopsies are inconclusive. A viscera examination tests the internal organs to rule out poisoning or any other abnormality in cases of suspicious death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-high-court-for-expeditious-examination-of-viscera-samples-to-avoid-delay-in-investigation-101636217546223.html
06-11-2021||Lucknow||BJP launches fresh attack on Akhilesh Yadav over Jinnah remarks||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday launched a fresh attack on Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav over his remarks on Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan.The attack came after Akhilesh Yadav, in an interview to a news channel, advised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to read history. He made the comment when asked to clear the air on his Jinnah remarks that sparked off a political controversy with the BJP seeking an apology from the SP chief. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh tagged a video clip of Yadav’s interview and tweeted: “The love for Jinnah is intact. @yadavakhilesh ji you want to read history books of India or Pakistan?” In the video clip, the interviewer of the news channel is asking Akhilesh Yadav if he would like to clear the context of his remarks on Jinnah. “No, why should I clear the context? I would say that they should read the books again,” Akhilesh Yadav said. On October 31, Akhilesh Yadav, while addressing a public meeting in Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh, had said that leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Muhammad Ali Jinnah had played a role in India’s freedom struggle. The remark saw BJP leaders, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath, targeting Akhilesh Yadav and seeking an apology from him. UP minister Anand Swaroop Shukla on Saturday said Akhilesh Yadav should get a narcotics test done for glorifying Jinnah. “SP chief Akhilesh Yadav making a statement on Muhammad Ali Jinnah is not a common incident… Jinnah is responsible for the division of the country. Jinnah is a villain, who no Indian would like to see or listen to. Akhilesh Yadav must clarify as to under which pressure, greed, is he glorifying Jinnah?” Shukla said to reporters. “I want Akhilesh Yadav to himself come forward, and get his narco test done,” Shukla said. He further said that those heaping praises on Jinnah should go to Pakistan. According to a PTI report from Ballia in eastern Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party has demanded the sacking of UP Minister Anand Swaroop Shukla for making controversial remarks against Akhilesh Yadav.The SP also demanded that a case be registered against Shukla for “insulting” Yadav and for “spreading animosity” in the society.Uttar Pradesh minister of state for parliamentary affairs Shukla had also accused Yadav of getting economic support from ISI – the Pakistan spy agency.On Friday, SP workers staged a protest at the district collectorate building in Ballia to demand the registration of a case against the minister.SP’s Ballia district unit chief Raj Mangal Yadav said there will be intense protests, and the minister will not be allowed to enter Ballia if the administration doesn’t take action against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-launches-fresh-attack-on-akhilesh-yadav-over-jinnah-remarks-101636217368439.html

06-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: NCR transport body fined ₹50,000 for dust at RRTS site in Anand Vihar||The Shahdara south division of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Saturday imposed a fine of ₹50,000 against the Anand Vihar project of the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for not having sufficient measures to control dust emissions at the site. The officials said the penalised project is the construction of the Rapid Rail Transit System (RRTS) by the NCRTC near the Anand Vihar interstate bus terminal (ISBT). They said the site had insufficient machinery and manpower to undertake dust mitigation measures, which was causing pollution. Neeraj Kumar, junior engineer, Shahdara south division, EDMC, who issued the fine under Section 491 of the DCC Act, said the NCRTC has been directed to pay compensation of ₹50,000 for polluting the environment. “The fine is to be paid by banked cheque or demand draft, drawn in favour of commissioner, East Delhi Municipal Corporation, within five days at the zonal office building. Since the offending construction was found in a plot area of more than 500 square metres, the environmental compensation was kept at ₹50,000,” he said. All the prescribed guidelines of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to mitigate pollution are being religiously followed at all RRTS construction sites, including Anand Vihar, the NCRTC said in a statement.“Anti-smog guns are operational round the clock to curb the dust, apart from regular sprinkling of water to settle the dust. Excavated soil and construction material are duly kept covered. C&D waste is being disposed of as per prescribed norms. Mechanized cleaning of roads through brooming machines is being done on a regular basis. High-pressure tyre washing facilities are also in operation to remove mud and dust from heavy truck tyres. The site is duly barricaded (2 to 4 mt height) near the smog tower at Anand Vihar to isolate it, the NCRTC further said..“A dedicated team of environment and safety experts is duly monitoring these steps round the clock to ensure their effectiveness,” it added.Delhi’s air has been in the severe category of the air quality index since Diwali ( November 4), owing to a sharp increase in stubble burning in neighbouring and large-scale violations of the firecracker ban in Delhi on Diwali. The Delhi government on Saturday dispatched over 100 water tankers to sprinkle water on the roads to mitigate dust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhincr-transport-body-fined-50-000-for-dust-at-rrts-site-in-anand-vihar-101636216286227.html
06-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Fire Brigade gets 39 calls due to firecrackers; number slightly up than 2020||Even as the number of fire calls due to firecrackers in the city slightly increased this year, as compared to 2020, they have not reached the pre-Covid-19 levels, reveals the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) data. This indicates a possible trend of lesser citizens bursting crackers this year.According to the data provided by MFB, it received a total of 142 calls between November 1 and 4 during Diwali, this year. Of these, 39 calls were due to firecrackers. In the corresponding period last year, the MFB received a total of 155 calls, of which, 35 were due to firecrackers.The data further revealed that in 2019, before the outbreak of Covid-19, it received a total of 173 calls, of which, 47 were due to firecrackers, followed by 246 calls in 2018, of which 50 calls were fire-related due to firecrackers.A week ago, the Maharashtra government had issued guidelines for Diwali celebrations in the state, urging people not to burst crackers. The state government had issued directives keeping the air pollution and Covid-19 in mind. Many states have put a ban on the bursting of firecrackers to keep the pollution level under control.Hemant Parab, chief fire officer of the MFB said, “The number of calls related to fire due to firecrackers has gone down due to awareness and timely intervention.” Further, MFB officials said all the incidents due to firecrackers were minor in nature and there were no casualties due to the same. Officials added that all the firefighting calls were timely attended and there were no untoward incidents.Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), had said that owing to changing geography and increasing traffic the peak response time of the fire brigade to attend a call has gone up to 20 minutes, which ideally should be around six to seven minutes. Owing to this, the BMC had recently purchased 24 fire bikes that can reach the spot of the call quickly and take firefighting measures, until the fire tankers reach the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fire-brigade-gets-39-calls-due-to-firecrackers-number-slightly-up-than-2020-101636216226208.html
06-11-2021||Gurugram||Namaz row: Muslim group says ready to rent space in Gurugram for prayers, seek admin help||Gurugram: A day after right-wing Hindu groups organised Govardhan Puja at a designated namaz site in Gurugram Sector 12 to protest against Friday prayers in public spaces, members of the Muslim community, which formed a 21-member committee on Saturday to resolve the ongoing issue, said that they are ready to take up spaces on rent for their prayers and sought the help of the district authorities for the same.Members of the committee said five of their representatives will meet the Gurugram deputy commissioner on Monday to discuss their action plan.“We are ready to take up places on rent to offer namaz but then the residents of the area should not have any problems. We need the support of the government and administration to offer namaz peacefully,” said president of the Jamiat Ulama, Gurugram, Mufti Mohammad Saleem, who is also part of the 21-member committee under the leadership of former Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Adeeb.He said the committee held several meetings with community members and will share their plan of action on Monday after the meeting with the administration. A meeting was held at Idgah and Sushant Lok-1 on Saturday where a large number of Muslim community members participated and discussed the issue.“We have taken representation from Muslims staying across various sectors of Gurugram and Manesar so that we can work on finding solutions wherever they are facing challenges in offering Juma Namaz,” said Altaf Ahmad, a member of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch and a member of the committee. Ahmad further said that there are two major issues that need to be addressed: “Firstly, the district administration should get all the Waqf Board properties cleared of encroachers so that namaz can be offered there. Secondly, until we are given designated sites, we should be allowed to offer namaz in the open as we are only offering prayers and do not want to hurt anyone’s sentiments.”Members said that they will also seek an appointment with Haryana chief minister and appeal to him to grant them land for building mosques in Gurgaon as per town planning guidelines. “We will also request for stern action against those who are working towards disturbing the communal harmony of Gurugram.” said Ahmad, adding that they are also seeking appointments with deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Ahmad pointed out that they were forced to offer namaz in the open because the city lacked mosques, particularly in newer parts of the city. “We have requested the administration to provide us land in different parts of the city so that we can build mosques. But till that happens, the authorities must ensure that namaz is offered peacefully and no one is allowed to create a disturbance,” he said. Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gururgam, said that the administration will hold meetings with both communities before coming up with a solution this month. “We do not want to take any decision in haste, so we are working on all possible solutions to resolve the problem. The members of the Muslim community are meeting me on Monday and they want to discuss some plans to offer namaz at some sites,” he said.Muslim members said they did not visit the Sector 12 site on Friday to avoid confrontation with right-wing Hindu groups who participated in Govardhan puja at the namaz site on Friday. Meanwhile, Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, the legal advisor for Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, a Hindu group which organised the Govardhan puja at Sector 12 on Friday, said that they will not disrupt namaz at any location for a month. “They have 30 days to make arrangements but once the deadline is over we will not let anyone offer namaz in open.,” he said. Over the past two weeks, right-wing outfits had tried to disrupt namaz at the open site in Sector 12 and on October 29, 35 protesters were detained for attempting to disrupt Friday prayers. Representatives of the Muslim community had agreed to relocate from the site, calling for an alternative space and clearing encroachments from Waqf Board properties.A few days ago, police and administration withdrew permission for offering namaz at 8 out 37 designated sites. Police had earlier issued a statement saying that permission for namaz at the remaining designated sites could be withdrawn if local residents raise objections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/namaz-row-muslim-group-says-ready-to-rent-space-in-gurugram-for-prayers-seek-admin-help-101636214490233.html
06-11-2021||Other||Activists raise questions on arrest of 8 alleged Maoists by Sukma police||Raising questions on the arrest of eight alleged Maoists in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district, human rights activists and tribal bodies on Saturday claimed they were innocent tribals and were returning from the Silger protest on November 2, officials said.On Saturday, Sukma police claimed that eight Maoists, six of them collectively carrying a reward of ₹17 lakh on their heads, were arrested from a forest near Morpalli village under Chintalnar police station limits on Thursday during an “area domination operation” of the CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action), an elite unit of the CRPF, and the District Force of police.Police said that they arrested Kawasi Raju alias Santu, a battalion member, and Kalmu Mada (25), a militia company commander, who were carrying rewards of ₹8 lakh and ₹5 lakh respectively. Others arrested included Komram Kanna (38), Madkam Hidma (29), Tursam Mudraj (45) and Madkam Enka (25), who carried rewards of ₹1 lakh each; and Madkam Soma (32) and Madkam Mutta (40).Police further claimed that security forces also recovered 35 detonators, six gelatin rods, two Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), batteries, wires and other materials from their possession, the SP said. On Saturday, Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist working in the Bastar region, in a press conference on the arrests, claimed that those arrested were innocent tribals.Bhatia released a press note in which she stated, “ The Mool Niwasi Bachao Manch held an Aam Sabha on November 1 as part of a long drawn protest against police camps in Silger in which many lawyers, activists and other prominent people participated. People from far off places of Sukma also came to take part in the protest. On November 2, 55 people took their bicycles and started returning home. They were intercepted in the forests of Morpalli by approximately 150 policemen and were taken to Chintalnar police station. Out of 55, eight have been booked under the arms and explosives act while the rest of them were released. Of the released 47, one woman is still missing and hasn’t returned to her family.”“When I met them, those eight people reiterated that they weren’t presented in front of the magistrate on November 5 which is a clear violation of the law. They have been framed in a false case and we demand their immediate release,” the letter further read.Meanwhile, district police said that the allegations against the security forces are baseless and the tribals were rescued by eight Maoists who were arrested by police.“The police actually rescued the innocent tribals from the Maoists... The eight arrested Maoists were forcibly taking these villagers to various meetings and protests. The arrested Maoists were found with explosives and were booked under the arms and explosives act. When the security forces intercepted them the Maoists started running and that’s when the CoBRA apprehended them,” said Superintendent of Police, Sukma, Sunil Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/activists-raise-questions-on-arrest-of-8-alleged-maoists-by-sukma-police-101636214428783.html

Crime investigation units were also looking for suspects at different locations identified using technical and human intelligence.Police said the incident took place at the residence of a former sarpanch (village head), identified as Gopal, around 8pm on Thursday, when his extended family was visiting them on the occasion of Diwali. A pet dog owned by the family was also shot at in the firing.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said some of the suspects were masked and could not be identified but four of them were regular visitors of that area. “We are also scanning the call details of the suspects and are checking CCTV footage from different locations. Our teams have recovered some crucial leads and we are hoping to arrest them at the earliest,” he said. Sangwan said the incident was captured in the CCTV cameras installed inside and outside the house but as the family members could not remember the system password, it was taking time to retrieve the footage.Police claimed that the two groups were allies in criminal activities before their relations soured in 2007, when Gopal’s sons, Balram and Sohanpal, allegedly murdered Rinku’s brother Manoj.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that over the years, the two groups were involved in a fight to establish supremacy in the area.“Balram and Sohanpal shot dead Manoj in 2007 while they were out on bail and since then Rinku was waiting to take revenge. On Thursday night, when all the family members were busy, Rinku and his associates barged into the house and shot indiscriminately at the six members,” he said. Police believe the suspects may have fled to Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-days-after-shooting-at-family-gathering-in-manesar-4-teams-formed-to-trace-suspects-101636213945881.html
06-11-2021||Delhi||Who all are most vulnerable to Delhi’s pollution? Doctors answer||As Delhi’s air quality continues to remain in the “severe” category two days after Diwali, medical experts have expressed concerns regarding the situation causing serious health conditions, especially because of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The national capital’s air quality began taking a tumble starting Thursday 9pm when it reached the “hazardous” category as people of Delhi refrained from obeying the blanket ban on firecrackers imposed by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government. Although the air quality index (AQI) improved to reach the “severe” category, it is far from being healthy.The central government-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) has predicted that the air quality is likely to improve to “very poor” category from tonight considering no more firecrackers are burnt. However, stubble burning that is also a primary cause of the frightening air quality situation in Delhi, has been predicted to remain almost the same.Also Read | Brace for bitter cold and high pollution this winterAs an emergency step to bring down the pollution level, the Delhi government on Saturday stopped as many as 92 construction sites for flouting norms and began spraying water on roads.According to data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI in Chandni Chowk was recorded at 442 at 8pm, at 442 in IGI Airport, at 442 in ITO Airport, at 456 in Okhla Phase-2, at 454 in Punjabi Bagh, at 451 in Patparganj, at 453 in Rohini, and at 437 in Sirifort, among others.When the air quality is at such an alarming level, it can lead to severe cases of Covid-19, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria told news agency ANI.He added that air pollution has “huge effects” on respiratory health in general, and especially in people with lung ailments and Asthma.Also Read | Stubble burning emissions account for 36% of Delhi’s pollution: SAFAREchoing Dr Guleria, chairman-MD of Medanta, Dr Naresh Trehan said that such worse pollution levels will cause every individual to suffer. He told ANI that people are complaining about “headaches, breathing problems, especially [those] with Asthma and lung problems.”Dr Trehan further explained that young children are vulnerable and the “severe” category air quality in Delhi can affect their brain development. “Hospital is full of patients, so this is a difficult phase for us. Every year we face this problem but fail to address or correct it,” he added to ANI.Terming the current air quality in the national capital to be “dangerous”, Dr Ashok Seth, chairman of Fortis Escorts Heart Institute said that the AQI levels are especially worse for the elderly and those with lung issues and heart diseases. “Pollution itself leads to chest congestion and bronchospasm. Those with Asthma, Bronchitis will start getting worse,” he told ANI.Dr Seth further stated that such extreme pollution predisposes patients with Asthma and Bronchitis to “further chest infections, viral infections and cases of pneumonia.”He recommended old people to stay indoors, get vaccinated against flu and also use air purifiers at home continuously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/who-all-are-most-vulnerable-to-delhi-s-pollution-doctors-answer-101636212851848.html
06-11-2021||Mumbai||11 dead in blaze in Covid ICU ward in Ahmednagar||At least 11 elderly Covid-positive patients, including four women, admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the civil hospital in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district died in a fire on Saturday morning. The fire broke out at 11 am in the ground floor of the hospital where 17 patients were admitted, at least 15 of whom were on ventilator or oxygen support. While 10 patients died in the blaze, one person who was critically injured succumbed after being rescued.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has ordered a probe into the incident, and the state health minister Rajesh Tope has announced an ex-gratia amount of ₹5 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased persons.The district collector said that pending official investigation the fire was likely caused by a short circuit.“There were 17 Covid patients admitted [to the ICU] when the fire broke out at around 11 am. Eleven out of the 17 have lost their lives. A short circuit seems to be the possible cause of the incident,” Ahmednagar collector Rajendra Bhosale said.The hospital has two wings of ICU — on the ground and second floor. The fire broke out on the ground floor ward which only housed Covid-19 patients, officials confirmed. No other casualties have been reported from any of the other wards.Of the 17 persons admitted, 15 were on ventilator or oxygen in the ICU. “Saving them was the priority. But due to their critical condition, to remove the oxygen support and bring them out was a tough decision,” said one fire brigade official. There was a lot of smoke which the patients would have inhaled and which led to their death, officials said.“After discussion, we decided to bring them out anyhow and later put them back on oxygen or other support systems,” he added.Fire brigade officials said that all patients in the ICU, which was set up barely 18 months ago, were badly injured and were shifted to another room immediately as firemen brought the fire under control by 1.30 pm.“The chief minister spoke to the district guardian minister Hasan Mushrif and chief secretary (Sitaram Kunte) and asked to ensure those needing medical attention won’t have to face any difficulties. He also ordered the district collector (Rajendra Bhosale) to conduct a detailed probe of the incident and submit a report,” a statement issued by the CM’s office said.The hospital had carried out a fire audit earlier this year, but a lack of funds prevented the management from installing all necessary fire safety equipment, Shankar Misal, chief fire officer of Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation, said.The audit carried out by the fire brigade department between the last week of January and the first week of February recommended that an effective firefighting system, including a sprinkler system and a pipeline should be installed in the hospital, though the hospital had fire extinguishers.Union minister of state for Health and Family Welfare Bharati Pawar visited the hospital on Saturday and met the met six patients who were undergoing treatment as well as their relatives.The Central government sends instructions regarding the fire safety audit (to hospitals) regularly. “We are awaiting reports. Accordingly, action will be taken against the guilty,” she said.The deceased, aged between 55 and 85, have been identified as Sitaram Dagdu Jadhav (83), Ramkisan Vithhal Harpude ( 70), Satyabhama Shivaji Ghodchoure (65) , Kadubal Gangadhar Khatik ( 65), Shivaji Sadashiv Pawar ( 82), Deepak Vishwanath Jedgule (57) , Kondiba Madhukar (70), Asrabai Nangre ( 58), and Chabibi Ahmed Sayyed (65).“Anguished by the loss of lives due to a fire in a hospital in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. Condolences to the bereaved families. May the injured recover at the earliest,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter“Very shocking & disturbing news from Nagar,” posted Fadnavis from his personal handle on Twitter. “My deepest condolences to the families who lost their loved ones in the Nagar civil hospital ICU fire incident. Praying for the speedy recovery of the injured. An in-depth inquiry should be conducted and strict action should be taken against all responsible people,” leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis also tweeted.Saturday’s fire follows a spate of similar incidents in Maharashtra hospitals. On April 21, 24 Covid patients on life support died at a municipal hospital in Nashik after a leak in a medical oxygen tank. The same month, at a time when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak, 15 Covid patients died as fire engulfed the ICU ward of the Vijay Vallabh Hospital in Virar, around 60 km from Mumbai. The previous month, 11 Covid positive patients died in a fire at a hospital in the eastern suburb of Bhandup in Mumbai. The fire broke out in a mall in which the Covid-designated hospital was housed. The dead included those on ventilator support. In January, 10 newborn infants died in the Sick Newborn Care Unit of the district hospital in Bhandara after a fire began in radiant warmer control panel and melted the central oxygen pipe.The incidents and the criticism that ensued led the state to issue a formal notification in August, placing the onus of fire safety audits on the hospitals, both private and government-run, including those which were dedicated Covid hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/11-dead-in-blaze-in-covid-icu-ward-in-ahmednagar-101636213405918.html

She also informed that a bomb squad, along with a team of police, rushed to the spot and have been trying to find if there were more explosives planted around the area. Talking to Hindustan Times, Ramandeep Kaur said, “A bridge is under construction at Khulcherra area near the inter-state border under a scheme of Assam government. We got information that the explosive was kept near a drain and it has a detonator attached with it. Our bomb squad is verifying if there are more explosives planted near the construction site.”Answering a question whether this planting of explosives has any connection with Mizoram, she said, “Though it has been found near Mizoram border, we cannot come to any conclusion without verification.”Additional SP of Cachar district, Subrata Sen, along with officer incharge of Dholai police station Sahab Uddin and other officials of the police department, were also at the spot. Sen initially verified the packet found near the bridge and confirmed that it contained suspected explosives. In a similar case, an explosive blast took place near the inter-state border last Tuesday in Hailakandi district’s Ramanathpur Area. An Indian Reserve Battalion (IRBN) personnel of Mizoram was arrested in Assam for his alleged connection with the blast.“During the investigation, we found that the Mizoram miscreants used detonating cord for blasting the explosive. We have arrested one Mizoram citizen named Laldintwanga for involvement in the blast,” the Hailakandi SP said.There has been a long-standing dispute regarding the right to the land between Assam and Mizoram. In the last year, several schools near the inter-state border on Assam’s side have been bombed by miscreants. Assam has always blamed Mizoram for these incidents but Mizoram denied it. The dispute between the two states turned ugly on July 26 after police forces of both the states opened fire on each other. Six Assam Police personnel died in that incident and over 70, including an IPS officer, sustained injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/explosive-found-near-assam-mizoram-border-in-cachar-101636213047619.html
06-11-2021||Mumbai||Former Maharashtra minister Anil Deshmukh sent to judicial custody till Nov 19||A holiday court on Saturday rejected the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) plea for extension of custody of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, and remanded the 72-year-old Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader to 14 days judicial custody till November 19. Deshmukh, arrested by ED on November 2 in connection with a money-laundering case against him, was sent to Arthur Road jail in south central Mumbai. Shortly after his medical check-up at the state-run JJ Hospital, Deshmukh was produced before a special holiday court on Saturday, the day his ED custody ended. The agency sought extension of his custody for confronting the NCP leader along with some other persons, including his son Hrishikesh, summoned for questioning in connection with the case. Appearing for the agency, additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted that the probe so far has revealed that Deshmukh and his family was directly or indirectly controlled 27 companies and used these entities to launder money by creating a complex web of transactions. ED’s application seeking extension of Deshmukh’s remand stated that the money has flown from personal accounts of Deshmukh family members to these companies and an amount of Rs. 9.8 crore was laundered to one of these entities – M/s Zodiac Dealcom – through 18 Kolkata-based shell companies.Singh added that Deshmukh himself was involved in the money-laundering, but he has been giving evasive answers to the questions put to him by the investigators and sought extension of his custody to find out the entire money trail. Deshmukh’s counsels Vikram Chaudhri and Aniket Nikam opposed the plea. “The present remand application is a photocopy of the first remand application,” they said. “The investigations of the agency seems to not have progressed at all, the same grounds are shown to seek further custody of Deshmukh. Besides, the grounds are vague.” They also pointed out that Deshmukh had appeared before the agency to prove his bona fides and that the agency has attached some of Deshmukh’s assets purchased in 2005 and 2006, claiming that those were bought while he was the home minister and that the ED was stretching its probe “way beyond the scope of the allegations against him.”ED had registered the money-laundering case against Deshmukh on May 11 this year on the basis of an April 21 First Information Report (FIR) of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which in turn was based on allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.In a letter written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh alleged that Deshmukh had instructed certain Mumbai police officers to collect an amount of ₹100 crore every month from Mumbai’s restaurants and bars. ED’s lawyers pointed out that the agency’s probe revealed that, on Deshmukh’s instructions, Sachin Vaze – an assistant police inspector in Mumbai – had called a meeting of bar owners, and that, between December 2020 and February 2021 collected ₹4.7 crore from the owners of so-called orchestra bars in Mumbai to avoid police interference. In his statement to ED, Vaze reportedly revealed that he handed over the “extorted money” in two instalments to Deshmukh’s aide Kundan Shinde. Subsequently, they said, Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh received an amount of ₹4.18 crore routed through Delhi-based shell entities as donations to a Deshmukh-led charitable trust, Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, Nagpur. On June 26, ED had arrested Shinde and Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande in the money laundering case, and on August 23, filed a charge sheet against them. Vaze is also an accused in the charge sheet. In July 2021, ED has provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties worth ₹4.2 crore, which included the NCP leader’s residential flat at Worli, valued at ₹ 1.54 crore, and 25 land parcels worth ₹2.67 crore, at Dhutum village in neighbouring Raigad district,” said an ED officer. The properties were held in name Deshmukh’s wife Aarti and a company named Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd. ED officers said Deshmukh family had acquired 50% ownership in this company, including its assets i.e. land and shops valued at approximately ₹5.34 crore by paying just ₹17.95 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/former-maharashtra-minister-anil-deshmukh-sent-to-judicial-custody-till-nov-19-101636212805706.html

06-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai gets light rains after Diwali||A low-pressure area, which formed over the Arabian Sea on November 2, brought light rains to Mumbai city and suburbs on Friday. However, the showers were not enough to dispel the post-Diwali day spike in air pollution. The same was the case in Pune city a day earlier, which recorded ‘satisfactory’ air on November 4 and 5.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast earlier this week that the city might get an unseasonal bout of mild rains over the weekend. However, the IMD observatory in Santacruz (taken as representative for the city) recorded ‘NIL’ rainfall at 8.30am Saturday The passage of the low-pressure area (LPA) also caused wind patterns to fluctuate, and easterly winds began to prevail over the region.“If we had got cleaner and stronger westerly winds from the sea, there would have been more dispersal of residual Diwali pollutants. But with only light rains and easterly winds, there was not much dispersal of particulate matter. The LPA has now moved north-west and wind patterns will stabilise next week. There is only a very slim chance of rain, but skies may remain overcast for another day,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai, the sky will become “mainly clear” from Monday. The maximum temperature is expected to hover around 35 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature will hover around 23 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-gets-light-rains-after-diwali-101636208186648.html

06-11-2021||Lucknow||Makka Darzi Imambara in UP’s Sitapur may get protected monument status||The Makka Darzi Imambara located in Khairabad town of Sitapur district, some 80 km from the state capital, may get the status of a protected monument as Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) has approached Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), demanding inclusion of the edifice and that of adjoining Qadam Rasool into its list.“It is also worthwhile to mention that the properties of the waqf are very old and are of historical significance. Therefore, it is requested to kindly declare the Imambara of Makka Darzi, its adjoining mosque and Qadam Rasool situated at Khairabad in Sitapur as ancient monuments under protection of ASI,” said the Board’s letter to superintending archaeologist, ASI’s Lucknow Circle.Zufar Ahmed Farooqi, chairman, UPSCWB, said, “Granting the status of protected monuments may safeguard the property from any unforeseen vandalism and destruction.” Sunni Central Waqf Board’s move is an outcome of the representation filed by two Lucknow-based heritage enthusiasts stating if not granted the protected status, Makka Darzi would soon be lost into oblivion.“Imambara Makka Darzi, the mosque and Qadam Rasool are in an utter bad shape. Currently, the sprawling Imambara and nearby structures serve as a haven to anti-social elements and hence intervention is urgently required to save the structure,” said S Mohammed Haider, a corporate lawyer and a heritage activist who along with his wife prof Sanober Haider has filed the representation.This was, however, the second time when the heritage-enthusiast duo has raised their voice to save this structure. Prior to this, the duo has filed a representation in 2019 after the Hindustan Times highlighted the tattered state of the structure and had carried a detailed report on Makka Darzi and adjoining structures that has fallen victim to the apathy of the authorities.The 2019 representation was addressed to the secretary, culture, Government of India and the director general of ASI. In response to the representation, ASI in a letter had stated, “There is a certain procedure to grant a protected status to any heritage structure. You are requested to provide additional information regarding the stakeholders of the heritage structures so that further procedure can be followed.” Now since the UPSCWB—the stakeholder of the structure—has written to the ASI, giving a kind of a no objection certificate (a mandate for granting protected status), the heritage enthusiasts here are hopeful that the protected status would be granted to the crumbling heritage structures.About Makka Darzi ImambaraIf historians are to be believed, “Makka Darzi”, also known as “Makka Jaamadar”, was constructed in 1835 by a Makka, a close confidant of the then King Nasir-ud-din Haider of Oudh. Makka is believed to have been the only tailor in the entire kingdom to fulfil Nasir-ud-din’s passion for European dresses.Some historians say Makka is believed to have learnt the intricacies of English dressmaking from the five favourite European friends of the king. He was so much adept in his work that he could demand any amount for designing and stitching an exclusive garment in conformity with the expectations of Nasir-ud-din Haider. And perhaps his proximity with the king made him seek the royal indulgence of a huge amount of money for the construction of a complex which not only comprised his Imambara but also a beautiful mosque and a Qadam Rasool.Some historians have also termed it one of the most beautiful monuments, combining and symbolizing the Nawabi-Mughal-gothic architectural styles. The beautiful inlay work on roofs, the heavy stucco work and the beautiful façade of Imambara building, composed of five multi-foliated archways flanked with octagonal minarets is a delight for watchers.Presently, the fading structure is a hub of illegalities and home to more than 200 squatters. City-based historians say it would be a major step in saving to decaying structure that is one of the most important parts of history of erstwhile Oudh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/makka-darzi-imambara-in-up-s-sitapur-may-get-protected-monument-status-101636207825464.html
06-11-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Vaze extorted money from cricket bookies: Crime branch to Mumbai court||A metropolitan magistrate court on Saturday extended the police custody of dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze by seven days after special prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap informed the court that the 52-year-old controversial ex-cop has extorted large amounts of money from cricket bookies by threatening to frame them in false cases. Jagtap pointed out that Vaze had extorted the money at the behest of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, and sought the extension of his custody for further interrogation by the crime branch to find out if he has extorted money from other persons as well. Vaze has been dismissed from the service after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested him in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases. The Goregaon police had in August registered an extortion case against Singh, Vaze and four civilians – Sumeet Singh, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Singh and Riyaz Bhati. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint by builder Bimal Agarwal, alleging that the accused had extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against his hotel restaurant and bar. The crime branch has already arrested Sumeet Singh for allegedly extorting money from Agarwal at Vaze’s behest. In this case, the court had previously issued non-bailable warrants against Param Bir Singh, Riyaz Bhati – a purported aide of gangster Dawood Ibrahim – and another accused named Vinay Singh. Vaze was arrested in this case on November 1 and remanded in the crime branch custody. He was presented before the Esplanade metropolitan magistrate court on Saturday as his earlier custody remand had ended. Appearing for the crime branch, advocate Jagtap sought the extension of his custody. To corroborate the allegations of extortion, the crime branch has collected Vaze’s voice samples to match with the voice recorded on the complainant’s phone calls. Agarwal had claimed that he had recorded Vaze’s phone calls, in which the ex-cop has talked about the alleged extortion activities involving him and Singh. Agarwal had submitted the recorded audio clips to the crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-extorted-money-from-cricket-bookies-crime-branch-to-mumbai-court-101636207645288.html

06-11-2021||Mumbai||PM level six times the safe limit; AQI drops to ‘poor’ day after Diwali in Mumbai||On November 5, a day after Diwali, the city’s air quality index (AQI) slipped into the ‘poor’ category after two years. Mumbai’s AQI stood at 215 based on 10 monitoring stations under the Union ministry of earth sciences’ system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR) as compared to 107 (moderate) in 2020 and 75 (moderate) in 2019. The drop in air quality on Friday was an outcome of emissions from firecrackers and prevailing weather conditions the previous day, according to scientists monitoring the city’s pollution levels. After logging in ‘satisfactory’ air quality on Diwali day for two years, the city’s AQI fell into the ‘moderate’ category at 180 on November 4 – it was 90 last year and 75 in 2019. Hourly data from 21 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) across the city operated by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and SAFAR showed that the immediate, localised impact of bursting firecrackers between 8pm and 10pm was much more significant on November 4 with spikes in the concentration of particulate matter. “AQI is calculated as a 24-hour average. Given the significant variations in concentration of pollutants that can happen within a single day, this average tends to mask the very high spikes that are seen within the permissible window of time for bursting crackers,” said Gufran Beig, project director and meteorologist at SAFAR. “These pollutants then linger on due to lower temperatures at night and slower wind speeds.” Navy Nagar in Colaba was the most polluted locality recording particulate matter (PM) concentrations well over 300ug/m3 (micrograms per metre of cubic air) from 8pm Thursday to 11am on Friday. An air quality monitor in the area recorded a maximum of 425ug/m3 of PM2.5 at 6am Friday, which is more than seven times the daily safe limit of 60ug/m3, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Maximum PM10 concentration was 235ug/m3. The SAFAR monitor in Mazagaon recorded PM2.5 levels at 395ug/m3 on Friday evening, and PM10 at 373ug/m3. High levels of PM were present till around 10am on Friday, and by evening the concentration of suspended particulate matter had dropped to between 70-80ug/m3, the data shows. Other monitors in the city also recorded intense spikes in pollution, as opposed to seeing satisfactory levels of PM just a few hours ago. In Worli, for example, MPCB monitor that recorded PM2.5 at 123ug/m3, at 6pm on Thursday, saw a threefold increase in pollutants with PM2.5 levels touching 438ug/m3 by 10pm. Experts and officials said this was a clear indicator of widespread use of firecrackers. “The data clearly shows that around Thursday evening there was a dip in air quality as people started bursting crackers, and then there is an improvement the next morning as the sun comes up and winds become stronger,” said Sachin Pawar, an independent air-quality scientist certified by the Quality Council of India under the union environment ministry. These granular spikes in pollution, which can adversely impact a person’s health on exposure, are not reflected in the average AQI value calculated by CPCB in its daily all-India bulletin, or by SAFAR, which maintains its own network of monitors in the city. However, past AQI data suggests that pollution levels this year were considerably higher. In 2019, Mumbai had recorded its cleanest Diwali and post-Diwali air in five years owing to high wind speed under the influence of Cyclone Kyarr in the Arabian Sea. The year 2020 was the second cleanest post-Diwali air since 2015. Quietest Diwali in three years While MPCB officials did not share official data from their annual noise monitoring exercise, spot checks by city-based NGO Awaaz Foundation observed that Diwali this year was the quietest in three years. The maximum noise levels were recorded at 100.4 decibels (dB) at Shivaji Park at around 9pm. In 2020, the maximum noise level was 105.5dB at Shivaji Park. In 2019, pre-Covid, maximum noise level was 112.3dB at Marine Drive. “Maximum recorded noise levels measured at Bandra, Mahim, Worli, Dadar, Shivaji Park, Babulnath and Marine Drive were much lower than previous years,” Awaaz Foundation said in a report on Saturday. Marine Drive, which was the centre of firecracker use before 2020, was completely silent in 2021 even before 10pm due to heavy police presence, the report observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm-level-six-times-the-safe-limit-aqi-drops-to-poor-day-after-diwali-in-mumbai-101636206327239.html

06-11-2021||Mumbai||CCTV cameras protecting mangroves in Navi Mumbai uprooted for road widening project in Vashi||In an effort to protect the mangroves, the forest department had installed two CCTV cameras along the Sion-Panvel highway in Vashi in 2018. Both the cameras were recently removed as the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has started widening the highway in that area.Illegal dumping of debris had severely affected the mangroves in the said area over the past two decades.DS Kukare, range forest officer (RFO) of the Navi Mumbai mangrove cell, said, “Unidentified culprits would carry debris from different places of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai and illegally dump there at night. They chose that deserted place for that purpose as there used to be no one to check on them. Taking the gravity of the issue into consideration, we installed two CCTV cameras there in December 2018. The number of debris dumping cases had drastically reduced after the installation of the cameras.”A senior MSRDC official said, “The CCTV cameras were installed very close to the highway. As we are now widening the entire stretch, we had to remove the cameras so that our people could carry out their work without any hindrance. We have also informed the forest department about it, and they will take the future course of action on this.”When asked about their next course of action, Kukare said that they have decided to develop a 600m-long concrete wall for protecting the mangroves in that area.“The plan of developing the wall has recently been approved by our higher authorities and the work at the site will be started within a few days.

This is a part of the initiative to have as many voters registered in a month-long awareness programme.Under the guidance of the State Election Commission, the KDMC has initiated a month-long voters’ list updating programme from November1. The civic body is undertaking several initiatives to spread awareness. Among them, one is involving the colleges to get young voters registered and another is involving the political leaders.“We have urged the political leaders not only in helping with registering new voters but also to help scrutinise the existing list and maintain a proper list of voters without any repetition and mistakes,” said Sunil Pawar, additional commissioner, KDMC.“We have also urged them to approach differently-abled citizens and get them registered in the voting list. This way, we can reach out to more non-voters and get them registered,” added Pawar.A meeting with the political leaders was held earlier this week to explain how the entire one-month programme for awareness would be carried out in the city. The drive will focus on registering new voters and rectifying any errors in the existing list related to the names of the voters.“Once the voters’ list is published, the political leaders can check it and rectify any errors before the final voters’ list is updated,” added Pawar.As per the civic body, the final voters’ list will be out by January 5, 2022.Representatives of all political parties from Kalyan-Dombivli who attended the meeting also gave their suggestions and highlighted some concerns.Sachin Bansare, a Shiv Sena leader, said, “There is a need to mention the part number of the respective areas that will help enrol a voter in his or her respective area. Most of the time, the part number is not mentioned and due to this, the name, which is listed, is listed for some other area that is even far away. Similarly, there are many names of the deceased citizens. The civic body should make use of the death certificates and remove such names from the list.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-seeks-help-of-political-leaders-to-update-voters-list-101636201355773.html

But, even after repeated warnings, we found that they did not mend their ways. Some of the houses with tinned roofs have tyres kept on them so that the roofs are not damaged during windy days. The workers are supposed to check the tyres for breeding spots and destroy them but it was found that the work was not being done. Hence, we decided to send notices and, if required, will take strong action against them,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.He further added that the number of suspected dengue cases have increased in 2021 as compared to 2019 and with the offset of monsoon, the cases will now go down. While in 2019, the suspected dengue cases were 260, this year it was reported to be 579.“Prevention and surveillance is a very important part when it comes to dengue for which the workers who fog the breeding spots play a major role. Besides, we had also asked all the hospitals to report to us regularly in order to keep a tab of the cases and the areas of breeding,” Bangar added.In September, a 17-year-old boy from Vashi was suspected to have dengue and passed away due to multiple complications. According to the health officers, it was the first case of death with suspected dengue but the major reason behind the death was late reporting that led to complications.“Increased number of suspected cases of dengue also means an effective reporting system. We are making sure to find the breeding spots in the vicinity of the suspected cases and then destroy them,” medical health officer, Dr Pramod Patil, said.In 2019, the malaria cases reported were 36 while in 2021, it is 39. While the malaria cases have not increased drastically, dengue reported an increase by 55%. Till now, two contractors have been served with the show cause notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-dengue-cases-rising-navi-mumbai-municipal-corporation-sends-notice-to-contractors-for-shoddy-fogging-work-101636199904896.html

Kamboj claimed that Patil gave the number of Kiran Gosavi, an independent witness in the case, to Sam D’Souza and told him that Gosavi will coordinate with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Patil’s name had surfaced during an investigation on corruption allegations against NCB officials.Bharatiya, while addressing a press conference, said that he will disclose the “entire conspiracy” with all the supporting “proof”. Without naming any political party or NCP minister Nawab Malik, Kamboj said that a “narrative of lies is in the entire country.”For the past three weeks, Malik has been levelling serious allegations against Wankhede and NCB over their vigilance, discrepancies in investigation and the information related to the officer’s religion. Malik has raised serious questions over the handling of cruise drug party accused Aryan Khan by Kiran Gosavi, who is facing serious cases and a BJP office-bearer Manish Bhanushali.“The mastermind of the entire thing is a person named Sunil Patil. He has been an NCP member since its inception. He hails from Dhule and is connected with the party for 20 years,” Bharatiya said. He further claimed that Patil was a close friend of Rishikesh Deshmukh, the son of former home minister Anil Deshmukh, who was recently arrested.The BJP leader said that Patil had contacted D’souza with information on the cruise party where drugs would be consumed. “Sunil Patil sent a WhatsApp message and call to Sam D’Souza on October 1. He told D’souza that there is going to be a cruise party where drugs would be consumed. He said that he has information on 27 people and sought to connect to a narcotics department’s official. Sam D’souza spoke to NCB official VV Singh about this and informed Patil,” he said.He added further, “On October 2, Sunil Patil told Sam D’souza to connect his contact to the NCB official who will give him more details. Patil shared the number of Kiran Gosavi to D’souza and said that Gosavi will coordinate with the officials. Gosavi will share all the details with VV Singh.”Kamboj also claimed that Patil and Sam D’souza spoke to each other in August where the former was boasting about his contacts within the corridors of power in Maharashtra and with ministers.Reacting to the allegation, NCP minister Nawab Malik said a member of Wankhede’s private army is trying to misguide and divert the attention from the truth, which he is going to reveal on Sunday. “A member of Sameer Dawood Wankhede’s private army just held a Press Conference to misguide and divert the attention from the truth albeit unsuccessfully. I will reveal the truth tomorrow,” he said in a tweet.Bharatiya indirectly targeted Malik and NCP saying a narrative was built against the BJP in the entire case. “The question now is, why is the cabinet minister using Sunil Patil to create this conspiracy. A narrative of lies has been weaved since last one month-linking BJP to the raid, connecting people associated with BJP as [independent] witness, that Sameer Wankhede and BJP are hand-in-glove... The minister, who is in favour of drugs, will now have to come out and respond,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aryan-khan-case-bjp-functionary-alleges-mastermind-sunil-patil-closely-associated-with-ncp-101636199427521.html

06-11-2021||Mumbai||Couple arrested for robbing auto drivers||The Shil Daighar police have arrested a husband-wife duo who had become the bane of auto rickshaw drivers over the last one month.According to the police, the accused have been identified as Sameer Sheikh (29) and his wife Fiza (21). The police said that inquiries into the matter were initiated on October 25, when an auto rickshaw driver registered a complaint against the couple. Even as the police were investigating the matter, another similar complaint was registered on Wednesday.“In both the cases, the couple had hailed the victim’s auto rickshaw at around 1am, taken him to spots like Shil Phata or Kalyan Phata, threatened him with a blade and robbed him of all his valuables including his money, cell phone and auto rickshaw. The spots were chosen for robbery after careful examination as these spots are deserted in the early hours of the morning, poorly lit and only partially covered by CCTV cameras. The presence of a woman also helped as it made the auto rickshaw drivers less suspicious,” assistant police inspector Bhushan Kapadnis, Shil Daighar police station, said.After the police received the first complaint, the investigation team scanned all the available CCTV footage but failed to find any usable image that could aid them in their investigation. Hence, the police shared a rough description of the accused with their local informants and sought any and all information about them. By the time the second case was registered, the police already had a tip off about Sameer and Fiza behind the spate of robberies.“Acting on the information received, we reached Sheikh’s residence on Shil Mahape Road on the same day the second case was registered. It was still before dawn at the time and we camped in the area, using the cover of darkness and keeping a discreet watch on the house. The couple turned up late in the morning and we took them into custody,” an officer who was part of the investigating team said.Sameer and Fiza were questioned and allegedly confessed to having robbed several auto rickshaw drivers over the last one month. They have been placed under arrest. They also told their interrogators that they had help from one more accomplice who is currently wanted.“We have recovered both the auto rickshaws robbed from our jurisdiction from the accused, as well as four cell phones. We have also found a similar case registered against them with the Turbhe police station in Navi Mumbai. By their own admission, the accused have been committing robberies roughly every alternate day for the last 20 to 25 days, and more such cases are expected to come to light,” Kapadnis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/couple-arrested-for-robbing-auto-drivers-101636197984650.html
06-11-2021||Mumbai||NCP’s Nawab Malik alleges kidnapping, extortion in Aryan Khan case||Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik again made a serious allegation against narcotics control bureau’s (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede. He alleged that Wankhede tried to kidnap Aryan Khan and framed him in a drug bust case after failing to get extortion money from his family. He also said that skeletons from Wankhede’s closet will come out and his private army will be exposed as the state government has formed a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate his allegations.Wankhede and his team arrested Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan and a few others for their alleged involvement in the cruise drugs party on October 2.“I had demanded an S.I.T probe to investigate Sameer Dawood Wankhede for kidnapping & ransom demand from Aryan Khan. Now 2 SITs are constituted (state & centre), let us see who brings out the skeletons from the closet of Wankhede and exposes him and his nefarious private army,” Malik tweeted on Saturday morning.“Wankhede tried to extort money after kidnapping Aryan Khan and later framed him in a drug bust case after his plans failed,” Malik told HT.He was referring to a four-member team formed by the Mumbai police on October 27 to probe the allegations made by Prabhakar Sail, a key witness in the Aryan Khan case, and three others.The team is headed by ACP Milind Khetle of the Azad Maidan division. It also comprises inspector Ajay Sawant (Colaba police station), sub-inspector Prakash Gawli (cyber police) and assistant inspector Shrikant Karkar (anti-narcotics cell). It is being supervised by additional commissioner of police Dilip Sawant and deputy commissioner of police Hemraj Singh Rajput.Sail had alleged that he was forced to sign blank papers by Wankhede on the night of the raid and that the officer was part of a ₹25 crore extortion racket targeting Aryan Khan.For the past three weeks, Malik has been levelling serious allegations against Wankhede and the NCB over their vigilance, discrepancies in investigation and the information related to the officer’s religion. Malik has raised serious questions over the handling of cruise drug bust accused Aryan Khan by Kiran Gosavi who is facing serious cases and a BJP office-bearer Manish Bhanushali. On November 2, he alleged Wankhede of extorting crores by forming a private army and using expensive clothes.“Wankhede made a private army. Kiran Gosavi, Manish Bhanushali, Fletcher Patel, Adil Usmani, Sam D Souza, Illu Pathan among others were its players. It was involved in the drug business. Those in major business were allowed to run while actions were shown on small quantity cases and implicating people and extorted crores,” Malik had alleged.On Friday, the NCB decided to transfer six cases, including that of Aryan Khan, to an SIT from Mumbai zonal unit following allegations and an internal vigilance probe against Wankhede. On Saturday, new investigating officer Sanjay Kumar Singh, however, said Sameer Wankhede’s assistance will be taken in all six cases as he is the director of the Mumbai unit.“A Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising officers from Operations Branch of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Headquarters has been constituted by the Director-General, NCB to take over a total of 06 cases from NCB Mumbai Zonal Unit which have national and international ramifications, in order to conduct a deeper investigation to find out forward and backward linkages,” a statement from Singh’s office said issued on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncps-nawab-malik-alleges-kidnapping-extortion-in-aryan-khan-case-101636196666741.html

His head was damaged with some heavy object. We immediately reached the spot and started investigations. The family has revealed the names of doubtful persons but we are yet to get any lead in the case.”Senior police inspector C Kakade said, “We have checked CCTV footage but nothing has been found relating to the accused so far.

06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab AG hits back, says Sidhu obstructing govt functioning||Punjab advocate general APS Deol on Saturday hit back at Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, accusing him of obstructing the functioning of the state government and AG’s office as well as spreading misinformation to gain advantage over his political colleagues. Also read: Sidhu targets Punjab CM on delay in justice in sacrilege, drug casesIn a strongly worded statement, Deol said that Sidhu’s repeated utterances seek to derail the earnest efforts of the Punjab government to ensure justice in the “drugs matter and sacrilege cases”. “There is a concerted attempt by vested interests to malign the functioning of the Congress party in view of coming elections in the state for their selfish political gain by politicising the constitutional office of the advocate general of Punjab,” he said. Deol’s remarks came a day after Sidhu, while withdrawing his resignation as Punjab Congress president, put the former’s removal as a precondition for resuming his duties. The reply is being seen in Congress circles as a counterpunch from the advocate general who had put in his papers four days ago under intense pressure from the state chief of the ruling party. However, his resignation is still to be accepted. As a lawyer, Deol had represented former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini, who headed the state police during the incidents of sacrilege and police firing on protesters six years ago. Sidhu was opposed to his appointment as the AG by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who took the reins of the Congress government in Punjab following Capt Amarinder Singh’s resignation on September 18, for this reason and has been pressing for Deol’s removal. Sidhu had resigned from his post on September 28, triggering a fresh crisis in the state Congress ahead of the assembly elections. He had earlier indicated that Deol’s appointment along with that of IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota as the director general of police were part of the reason he quit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ag-hits-back-says-sidhu-obstructing-govt-functioning-101636191264329.html

According to government data, Delhi's air quality index (AQI) nosedived to the 'severe' category, measuring 533 on Saturday morning, two days after Diwali.Also Read | Brace for bitter cold and high pollution this winter"As an emergency measure, we've started spraying water on roads with the help of anti-smog water tanks to reduce the air pollution. We've also banned 92 construction sites for violating norms," news agency ANI quoted Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai as saying.And in more worry, many areas in the national capital recorded an AQI of over 600, making the ambient air unsuitable for breathing. The numbers were released by the Dephi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), based on data from the smog towers installed in the city.The huge structures, believed to provide clean air to nearby areas where they are installed, failed to deliver. The smog tower in Connaught Place could only reduce the PM10 level from 649 micrograms per cubic metre to 511 micrograms per cubic metre, as per the readings taken at 9 pm on Thursday, the night of Diwali.It recorded a PM2.5 concentration of 642 micrograms per cubic metre at the inlet and 453 micrograms per cubic metre at the outlet on the same day.The safe limit for the lung-damaging fine particles PM2.5 and PM10 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre and 100 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.Also Read | 10 cities with poorest air qualityExperts have pointed to the limited ability of the smog tower, saying they can reduce pollution only to a certain extent."This experiment at Connaught Place has shown that smog towers can never be a solution to the problem of air pollution. Any further wastage of money on such structures should be stopped immediately. The money should be utilised to reduce pollution at source," said Sunil Dahiya of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had inaugurated the smog tower on August 23 which, officials say, can purify air in a one-km radius around the structure at a rate of around 1,000 cubic metres per second.There is no reaction from the Delhi government about the efficiency of the smog towers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-emergency-measure-launched-smog-towers-efficacy-questioned-101636186955887.html

It is the first of it’s kind initiative in the state, enabling children at government care institutions in all the 38 districts to voice their concerns and views directly to policy makers at the district and state level. The seven day event will start on November 14 in the districts and conclude in state capital on November 20. Children and adolescents comprise more than 50% of Bihar’s total population, and the learning from events such as Bal Darbaar in form of recommendations and charter of children’s demands will be presented to chief minister Nitish Kumar. Besides , the report will also be provided to various departments including education, art and culture, health and information and public relations. “It’s been intended to create and promote awareness among various government departments about the rights and protection of children, especially those from the marginalised communities. The focus is to stop violence against children. It will also be an opportunity for the policy makers to understand the issues and experiences and views of adolescents,” Rajkumar, director, social welfare department, said. Since the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, vulnerability of children and adolescents has increased many times, he added. “Young women and girls are at greater risks of violence, physical abuse and exploitation because of pandemic while the psychological pressures and distress are also there. To address these issues the Bal Darbaar has been planned, “ he said.

Reports of child marriages, trafficking, child labourers in poor section of the society have been quite frequent,” she said. Children and adolescents are the biggest victims of disasters like pandemic or floods and have to go through deprivations at various levels due to reverse migration, making them vulnerable to abuse, Gupta added. Given these situations, there was the need for a platform where children and adolescents can share their issues, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/children-to-share-pandemic-and-flood-experiences-at-bal-darbaar-in-bihar-101636176383730.html
06-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: PM10 at alarming 654 in Connaught Place. List of other pollution hotspots||National capital Delhi, which is battling severely bad air quality days after the festival of Diwali, has more bad news. One of the most-visited places and heart of Delhi, Connaught Place (CP), recorded a PM10 level of 654 on Saturday morning, according to ANI.The news agency quoted data from Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to report that the PM2.5 levels reached 628 in CP on Saturday. The data was collected by smog tower installed in the area.In Jantar Mantar, the PM10 level was 382, while PM2.5 reached 341. Near ITO, the PM2.5 level recorded was 374, ANI further showed.PM2.5 is defined as ambient airborne particulates that measure up to 2.5 microns in size. These include a range of chemical makeups and come from a range of human-made sources, including fossil-fuel powered motor vehicles, power generation, industrial activity, agriculture and biomass burning. The microscopic size of PM2.5 allow these particles to enter the bloodstream upon inhalation, potentially causing far-reaching health effects, such as low birth rate, acute respiratory infections and stroke. PM10 are typical the dust particles.Overall, Delhi's AQI soared to 533 on Saturday morning, even two days after Diwali. On Friday, the AQI stood at 462. Such high pollution levels have led to concerns from health experts.Dr Ashok Seth, Chairman, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute said that the pollution levels are dangerous for the elderly people as well as Covid recovered patients."These are really dangerous levels. AQI levels are especially dangerous for the elderly and those with lung problems and heart disease. Pollution itself leads to chest congestion and bronchospasm. Those with asthma, bronchitis will start getting worse. It itself predisposes to further chest infections, viral infections and cases of pneumonia. We see a lot of these happening when pollution rises," Dr Seth told ANI."Covid recovered patients, too, are vulnerable. This is the time for the elderly to stay indoors, be flu-vaccinated and use air purifiers at home continuously," he added.As a thick blanket of smog shrouded the skies of Delhi the morning after Diwali, with several people complaining of itchy throat and watery eyes.As per the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the air quality would not improve until Sunday evening (November 7). The improvement would, however, just fluctuate in the 'Very Poor' category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pm10-at-alarming-654-in-connaught-place-list-of-other-pollution-hotspots-101636172610457.html

06-11-2021||Patna||Toll in suspected hooch tragedies in Bihar rises to 25||The death toll in two suspected spurious liquor consumption cases from Bihar, where total prohibition is in place, climbed to 25 on Friday with seven fresh casualties-- five from West Champaran and two from Gopalganj districts. At least 23 people have been arrested, five have been detained in both the cases and two policemen from each district have been suspended, police said.“We are waiting for the post-mortem report to reach any conclusion. Prima facie, these deaths appear to have occurred due to the consumption of poisonous substances,” West Champaran’s superintendent of police (SP) Upendra Nath Verma said. Verma confirmed five more deaths in the district took place since Thursday.West Champaran and Gopalganj have recorded 14 and 11 deaths respectively in last four days, an official said.Verma added that nine others who had taken ill after consumption of alleged toxic hooch in the Telhwa panchayat of the district were undergoing treatment. In Gopalganj’s Kushar village, four people were under treatment for severe illness due to consumption of suspected illicit hooch.Police have registered a case and a local station house officer (SHO) and one chowkidar have been suspended in West Champaran following the incident, the SP said. Verma said three persons have been arrested and five others were detained for questioning.West Champaran district magistrate Kundan Kumar said, “Medical teams have been deployed for check up and raids are on to arrest the accused.”Chief minister Nitish Kumar, on Friday, warned of strict action against those violating prohibition in the state. “We will take action. Some people are doing bad work by making spurious liquor. Raids are on and I am going to review the entire scenario...,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/toll-in-suspected-hooch-tragedies-in-bihar-rises-to-25-101636153404353.html
06-11-2021||Delhi||Cover 90% with first dose by Nov 30: Govt||The Union government has asked all states to plan to achieve at least 90% first dose Covid vaccination coverage by the end of November, stressing on the need to accelerate the immunisation drive for which several regions with low rates have launched a house-to-house canvassing effort being called Har Ghar Dastak.The advisory was issued in a virtual meeting last month and the Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, later wrote to states separately asking them to make efforts to the effect.“You would recall that in the video conference held on 18th October 2021, with all the states and Union Territories, it was advised that States/UTs should plan to achieve about 90% coverage of 1st dose by November-end and timely administration of 2nd dose,” said Bhushan in his letter issued on October 20 that HT has accessed. “…I request you to kindly direct concerned officials to initiate the process of planning for timely completion of full vaccination of all adult citizens and implement it at the earliest. I would also expect that the progress of 2nd dose administration is reviewed on a daily basis by you and your team,” it added.According to government data, at least 78% of India’s eligible population has been administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine while 38% has been fully vaccinated.“Even though there is no substantial data available globally to support a particular percentage of population that if fully vaccinated will provide the necessary safety cover. Ideally, it should be 90-95% of the population but that is not immediately possible, therefore, we should try to cover as high as possible, and as fast as possible,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.According to the Co-WIN dashboard, the coverage of first doses across Indian states ranges from 61% to more than 100%.The government data shows there are currently 45 districts in India that are still seeing a heavy lag in vaccination coverage as they are yet to administer even a single shot to more than half of their adult population. The districts belong to states such as Arunchal Pradesh (6 districts), Assam (1), Chhattisgarh (1), Haryana (1), Jharkhand (8), Maharashtra (5), Manipur (8), Meghalaya (4), Mizoram (1), Nagaland (8), Tamil Nadu (1) and Delhi (1).To plug the gap in vaccination coverage, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched the special door-to-door drive that will be held between November 3 and 30.“We have allowed the states to send their health care workers door to door to identify those who have not been vaccinated yet or those who are due to take their second shot...,” said a senior central government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cover-90-with-first-dose-by-nov-30-govt-101636152802311.html
06-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The lake isle of Chawri||Crickets are singing. The water is lapping by the shore.This is the lake isle of Innisfree. The dependable Wikipedia locates it in Ireland. While the aforementioned description is gathered from a WB Yeats poem that famously immortalised Innisfree as a place where “peace comes dropping slow.”But this evening the island has temporarily shifted to Old Delhi’s Chawri Bazar. It has made this shift solely for labourer Naeem.Here’s his currently tranquil world. It’s the 5pm rush hour. The traffic jam is looking hopeless. Nothing is moving on the road. The scooters, the bikes, and the carts are standing still. Only the pavements are rippling along with the steady flow of pedestrians. Every (unmasked) face in the crowd is looking stressed, but Naeem’s (his mask is pulled down to his chin). He is lying on the narrow space separating the road from the footpath; his slim figure is slumped between two poles. It doesn’t look like a comfortable posture, but Naeem’s expressions are surprisingly serene. His eyes are closed.“I’m free right now,” he smiles, opening his eyes. A “mazdoor” in the market’s bustling wedding card trade, Naeem transports “shaadi wale cards” from printing presses to retail shops. He makes dozens of rounds everyday on foot along the alleys, carrying the “load” on his back. The opportunities of idleness come to him occasionally, he says, and lasts for only a few minutes between the assignments. “So then I lie down and rest.” This way of “aaram (rest)” makes him so calm “that all my tensions leave me… my mind becomes khali (empty).” Not even the Chawri Bazar chaos then intrudes into this resourceful mindfulness. The traffic, the incessant blowing of bike horns, the dust, the smog, the cries of the vendors—all of these pass by him like a breeze. “Because this is ghar,” Naeem explains, pointing out that the entire market is like his home. “I work here. I sleep here.”In his 30s, Naeem arrived in Delhi 20 years ago, and started working in Chawri Bazar when he was still a child. “Papa looks after our little agricultural land (in the village in Bahraich, UP).” He chose to make a career in Chawri Bazar even though his wife and two children are in the village because “there is more money in laboury (sic) than in kheti (farming). The money I earn everyday in Dilli is ₹200 more than what I would have earned everyday as a farmer in Bahraich.”By now, the traffic has started to move. Naeem again closes his eyes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/the-lake-isle-of-chawri-101636151624528.html

06-11-2021||Gurugram||Hindu groups hold puja at designated namaz site||Members of right-wing Hindu groups on Friday organised Govardhan Puja at a designated namaz site in Sector 12, where Muslims offer prayers on Fridays. Members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also attended the rituals, which were organised by the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti.While members of Hindu groups said that the action was to mark their protest against namaz being offered in open spaces, members of Muslim communities said that they decided not to offer prayers at the site in Sector 12 due to objections raised by residents as well as protests by Hindu groups over the past few weeks.Namaz was majorly held at Leisure Valley Ground in Sector 29 besides other designated locations, while Govardhan Puja was offered at designated namaz sites in Sector 47 and DLF Phase-3, on a small scale, besides Sector 12.Heavy police deployment was witnessed at all sites and the prayers by both communities went off peacefully.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said, “No report of disruption was received from any area and majority of Muslims offered prayers at Leisure Valley Ground in Sector 29, and they did not visit the Sector 12 area on Friday as they knew Govardhan puja was organised.”Addressing the gathering of hundreds at Sector 12, BJP leader Kapil Mishra said that roads are not for religious activities. “Blocking roads is not part of any religion. People have first right to the roads,” said Mishra.Surendra Kumar Jain, the international joint general secretary of Vishva Hindu Parishad, alleged that namaz was being offered in open spaces to establish control over public land.Altaf Ahmad, a representative of the Muslim community in the city, said, “...we voluntarily stepped back as the same was advised by police... We have asked our Muslim community to show restraint and walk away in case troublemakers try to provoke or disrupt namaz.”Over the past two weeks, right-wing outfits had tried to disrupt namaz at the open site in Sector 12 and on October 29, 35 protesters were detained for attempting to disrupt Friday prayers. Representatives of the Muslim community had agreed to relocate from the site, calling for an alternative space and clearing encroachments from Waqf Board properties.Mahavir Bharadwaj, a member of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, claimed that the administration had to “bow down to their demands”. “The Muslim community has a month to make arrangements... to ensure they don’t offer namaz in open, “ he said.However, officials of the district administration said permissions were withdrawn only for eight sites, and a decision on other sites will be taken later.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that a committee, comprising a subdivisional magistrate, an assistant commissioner of police and members of religious organisations and civil society groups will discuss the issue. “The committee will also take consent from locals at the time of designating a spot for offering prayers but no concrete decision has been taken yet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hindu-groups-hold-puja-at-designated-namaz-site-101636149974061.html

06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Sack AG Deol, form fresh panel for DGP post: Sidhu sets preconditions to resume duties as Punjab Congress chief||Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday withdrew his resignation as state Congress president, but hit out at chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and put a precondition for resuming his duties. Sidhu, who stepped down from the post on September 28, said he will return to his duties as the state unit chief the day new advocate general is appointed and a new panel for (appointment of director general of police) is received (from UPSC). “It was never personal or a matter of ego. It is the question of conscience of Punjab. Without moral authority, you cannot speak truth,” the Amritsar East MLA said at a press conference here before questioning Channi over his choices for the two senior positions and steps taken by his government for delivery of justice in sacrilege cases and action against drug trafficking. The Congress leader has been opposed to the appointment of APS Deol and Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota as the state’s AG and DGP by Channi who took over as the chief minister following Capt Amarinder Singh’s resignation on September 18 amid a rift in the state unit. The PPCC chief kept pressing for their removal as both Deol and Sahota continue to hold their posts. Deol had resigned three days ago but his resignation is yet to be accepted. Sidhu’s statement came three days after he and Channi, along with Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary, visited Kedarnath Temple in Uttarakhand to put up a show of unity. On their return, the two leaders attended a meeting of Congress MLAs and praised each other. At his press conference, Sidhu said the state government was changed by people in 2017 over Bargari sacrilege and drugs and later a chief minister (Capt Amarinder) also removed over these big issues. “The offices of AG and DGP are crucial to take to logical conclusion the issue of Bargari sacrilege and drugs,” he said. He said that Sahota was appointed as head of SIT to investigate sacrilege incident by the then Badal government six years ago and their blue-eyed officer has become the DGP whereas Deol represented former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in court, who headed the police during the sacrilege and police firing incidents, and is now the AG. “What is this happening…when we go to villages, how are we going to answer people? What are we going to say? The party is demanding answers. After three special investigation teams (SITs), seven first information reports (FIRs), two commissions and six years of the sacrilege cases, are these the only officers you could find,” he asked. Questioning the delay in action in sacrilege cases and making public report on drug trafficking, Sidhu asked about the steps taken by the government in the past 50 days. “Don’t you want the report to be made public in the state assembly? Which court order is restraining you? Who is stopping?” he said. Sidhu further said that if the government does not have the guts to make the special task force (STF) report public, it should give it to the party. “I will release it .The high command has no objections. They want action on 18-point agenda,” he said. He also demanded a white paper on power purchase agreements with complete details of the circumstances in which these were inked, who signed them and why these were not renegotiated. Asked about his repeated lollipop and empty treasury barbs at Channi, Sidhu claimed his lollipop comment was aimed at (Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind) Kejriwal for promising 26 lakh jobs during one of his trips to the state. “As for khali khazana, I have talking about this from 2016 in my speeches and meetings,” he said. On using foul language against former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, he replied, “Doesn’t an 80-year-old person need to maintain dignity? You have to earn respect”. In response to a question on the Congress’ CM-face for the 2022 poll, he said that it is decided by the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sack-ag-deol-form-fresh-panel-for-dgp-post-sidhu-sets-preconditions-to-resume-duties-as-punjab-congress-chief-101636145239580.html

Around 40,000 tests are conducted daily, of which around 100 persons test positive,” said Prof Dr Mohammad Salim Khan, the nodal officer for Covid and the head of the department of community medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar.The UT is now recording around 100 cases daily as against the daily average of 80 cases in the second and third week of October. Last month, the UT recorded a total of 10 deaths while in just four days of November, J&K has already seen six deaths. “There were some deaths but these people were admitted around two weeks ago. There is no need to worry but yes alertness is the key,” said Dr Khan.The active cases are highest in the districts of Srinagar, Baramulla, Budgam and Ganderbal in Kashmir valley and Jammu district of the Jammu division.On November 4, Srinagar has 476 active cases, Baramulla 156, Budgam 85, Ganderbal 68 and Jammu 45.The districts of Shopian in Kashmir and Samba in Jammu have mostly maintained zero active cases in the past 12 days. In fact, Shopian has maintained zero active cases since October 14 and just reported a case on Thursday after over three weeks.In the past one week, the active cases in six districts – Shopian, Kulgam, Kathua, Samba, Kishtwar and Udhampur – have mostly remained five or below.“Overall, we are fine. There aren’t many new cases, even though there are gatherings and people don’t wear masks or maintain social distancing. The main reasons include vaccination coverage and an increased exposure of the community to the virus in the first and the second wave,” said Dr Khalid Abbas, block medical officer of Zainapora in Shopian.“South Kashmir’s Shopian and Kulgam were badly affected by Covid in the beginning. Increased exposure of the community led to some sort of herd immunity,” he said.Jammu and Kashmir logged 2,819 Covid infections in October. This is the lowest since February, when the first wave had receded and just 1,935 cases were reported. In September this year, around 4,011 infections had been reported from the union territory.October’s test positivity rate (TPR) in J&K– the percentage of tests turning positive out of the total tests conducted – also dropped to 0.20% from 0.27% in September. If TPR is below 5%, it indicates that the infection is under control in the community.The data reveals that on an average, 43,482 tests were conducted daily in October so far, against 49,374 daily tests in September, 53,359 in August and 56,719 in July.Overall, the union territory conducted 13.47 lakh tests in October, as against September when 14.81 lakh tests were carried out. In August, 16.54 lakh tests were conducted.Since September, the vaccination drive has been very rigorous. Around 65 lakh people have been vaccinated in J&K with one or both doses during the two months.The overall number of people who have recovered reached 3,27,232, prompting the recovery rate to reach 98.37%. Since the pandemic started, the overall cases in J&K have reached 3,32,651 and the death toll has reached 4,438. Jammu district has the highest number of fatalities with 1,145, followed by Srinagar with 850 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-2-weeks-jammu-and-kashmir-sees-22-rise-in-active-covid-cases-101636144819167.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Pollution alert: Punjab farm fires see sharp spike||With nearly 70% of paddy harvest completed in Punjab, the hinterland of the state is seeing a sharp rise in the number of farm fires, with 8,359 separate blazes reported in the past two days. The state’s air quality was, however, still better than neighbouring Haryana where cracker ban went up in smoke on Diwali night following which the AQI of 10 cities plummeted to a “severe” category. While 5,327 stubble burning incidents were reported in Punjab on Friday (till 5pm), the figure for Thursday ( Diwali day) stood at 3,032. Of the total number of farm fires this year, 65% was reported in the last five days alone. A total of 28,792 farm fires have been reported so far. It is nearly half the number that was reported for the same period, until November 5, last year. Sangrur, with 611 active fire events, reported the highest number of straw burning incidents on Friday, followed by Moga (484), Ferozepur (481) and Ludhiana (455). Punjab’s Pollution Control Board has decided to send expert teams to various parts of the state to issue challans to farmers for burning straw. While some farmers are exploring alternatives ways to handle the post-harvest straw, most medium and marginal farmer are burning it to clear their farms for sowing wheat. An official of Punjab’s agriculture department called for the need to develop a mechanism to give the farmers incentives to avoid burning their straw. “If the government wants to end this practice, it should implement a Supreme Court’s judgment on this, and give ₹100 per quintal as incentive to hand over the straw. It will help… because farmers can’t spend extra amount of money due to high input costs to clear their fields using machinery,” said Jugraj Singh, a farm leader from Samana in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pollution-alert-punjab-farm-fires-see-sharp-spike-101636144639117.html

Amarinder said that a detailed action plan must be drawn to combat the challenge. “Hope@PunjabGovtIndia, HM Punjab in particular, will come out of denial mode and take this threat seriously. With multiple consignments being sent regularly from across the border, extra vigil and a detailed action plan must be formed to combat the challenge (sic),” he tweeted. Punjab Police had on Thursday claimed to have foiled a possible attempt of a terror attack with the recovery of tiffin bomb at Ali Ke village. The recovery was made following interrogation of three persons arrested earlier this week in connection with the Jalalabad blast case. The former CM’s tweet is being seen as his response to Randhawa, who holds the home portfolio and had last month questioned the former’s repeated barbs over security concerns and the “alarmist narrative” being created about peace and security in the state. Amarinder, who was made to resign from the CM’s post on September 18 amid a rift in the state Congress, has been voicing concerns over security, condemning the present state government of being in a state of denial over security threat. “Something very wrong and dangerous was happening at the borders which the state should not ignore,” he had said in a statement last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-asks-congress-govt-in-punjab-to-come-out-of-denial-mode-over-security-threat-101636143979108.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||BJP bosses seek report on poll debacle from Himachal unit||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s central leadership has sought a report from the state unit on the party’s drubbing in the recently held bypolls to three assembly constituencies and one parliamentary segment. The state unit has sought reports from its observers, in-charges and coordinators appointed for the bypolls. Party’s national president JP Nadda has also spoken to chief minister (CM) Jai Ram Thakur and state BJP president Suresh Kashyap on the matter. Leaders from Himachal Pradesh will virtually join Prime Minister Narendra Modi, National President JP Nadda, home minister Amit Shah at the party’ national executive meeting on Sunday. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, former Chief Ministers Prem Kumar Dhumal, Shanta Kumar, union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur, state party chief Suresh Kashyap will apprise thecentral leadership on the poll debacle.The party had appointed its best poll managers in Mandi, Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai constituencies. In Mandi, Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur, who is known for his political maneuvering, was at the forefront of the campaign while education minister Govind Singh Thakur was the co-incharge. Party general secretary and CM Thakur’s close confidante Rakesh Jamwal was the coordinator and the CM himself remained at the forefront of the campaign. In Arki, former BJP president Rajiv Bindal was the in-charge while health minister Rajiv Sehjal and party general secretary Trilok Jamwal assisted him. Industries minister Bikram Singh, forest minister Rakesh Pathania and former BJP president Satpal Singh Satti were assigned Fatehpur assembly segment. In Jubbal-Kotkhai, urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj and power minister Sukhram were at theforefront. The party had carried out a preliminary assessment of factors leading to its debacle. The assessment hinted at widespread resentment among the public against inflation, and poor coordination between the government and the organisation as the reasons for the defeat. Infighting and lack of enthusiasm among the cadre and the party’s failure to nullify the sympathy for Congress nominee Pratibha Singh invoked after her husband Virbhadra Singh death were also among the reasons it lost its vote-share.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-bosses-seek-report-on-poll-debacle-from-himachal-unit-101636143919075.html

Calling him a “compromised CM”, Warring accused Amarinder of remaining in “comfort zone” with the Badals and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during his stint. “You @capt_amarinder as a compromised CM, was just like writing with black ink on a black paper...

06-11-2021||Chandigarh||On Bandi Chhor Diwas, Akal Takht jathedar expresses concern over ‘wrongful’ conversion of Sikhs||Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Thursday expressed concern over Sikhs being allegedly converted to a particular religion through “wrongful” means and asked the Sikh bodies and preachers to keep tabs on such a practice. The jathedar said this in the customary sandesh (massage) he delivered from ‘darshani deori’ of the Golden Temple’s sanctum sanctorum on Diwali, also celebrated by Sikhs as ‘Bandi Chhor Diwas’, amid talks of Christian missionaries allegedly making some members of Sikh community embrace Christianity.“Nobody can be allured, forced or misguided to change their religion. The Sikh organisations and the preachers should be careful of those behind wrongful conversion,” said Giani Harpreet Singh. The head of the highest Sikh temporal seat also exhorted the Sikh organisations to build pressure on the Centre to ensure permanent release of members of the community lodged in the country’s jails in terror-related cases. “This is very unfortunate that these Sikh prisoners are not being released despite they have completed their jail terms,” he added.Besides, Takht Patna Sahib jathedar Giani Ranjit Singh, Takht Kesgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh, Golden Temple head granthi Giani Jagtar Singh, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Jagir Kaur, Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh Khalsa and Nihang organisation Budha Dal chief Baba Balbir Singh also addressed the devotees on the occasion.Diwali was celebrated with religious farvour at the shrine. Members of Nihang organisations and other Sikh bodies participated in the festivities at the Akal Takht. Fireworks were also carried out albeit symbolically in view of the air pollution. Denied entry, parallel jathedar reads out sandesh at entranceDhian Singh Mand, the Sarbat Khalsa-appointed Akal Takht parallel jathedar was denied entry to the Golden Temple complex by the Punjab Police personnel deployed there.When Mand along with some radical Sikh leaders and their supporters starting entering the shrine, a team led by additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-1) Harjit Singh and ADCP-3 Harpal Singh stopped them citing orders from their seniors.Mand’s supporters opposed the move and wanted to be allowed to at least pay obeisance, but to no avail. It also led to a minor scuffle. Another message of Jagtar Singh Hawara, one of the convicts in the assassination of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh and appointed as (parallel) Akal Takht jathedar by Sarbat Khalsa, was also delivered by his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/on-bandi-chhor-diwas-akal-takht-jathedar-expresses-concern-over-wrongful-conversion-of-sikhs-101636143498751.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Festival rush raises concern over Covid spread in Punjab again||With Covid-19 norms being violated blatantly across Punjab during the Diwali festivities as heavy rush of people was seen in markets and other public places, the health department has raised concern over spread of the pandemic in the state once again. The cities of Mohali, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Patiala are being seen as more vulnerable as they witnessed an unprecedented rush in the past one week when the number of people getting inoculated with vaccine also came down. The department has decided to step up testing and inoculate those who have not received the Covid vaccine yet. As per official figures, at least 80% population has received the first dose while 40% have been administered the second dose. The remaining unvaccinated population (20%) is the most vulnerable to virus infection, experts said. “We will ask people to get tested for the virus infection in case they have any of the symptoms. The state was the worst-hit in the second phase of the pandemic when people in cities, towns and rural pockets were badly affected,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. It will take at least a week to 10 days to ascertain the impact of lack of adherence to the Covid-19 protocols during the festival season, said another health department official.“In the view of the festival season, various agencies have predicted the onset of the third wave of virus by November-end,” Bhaskar added. A day after Diwali on Friday, there were 219 active cases of infection and 17 new cases in the state with 2,600 people getting the vaccine. Of the 602,496 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the state since the outbreak of coronavirus, 585,715 have recovered. The death count has reached 16,562. State health director Dr Andesh Kang said the department is taking all steps to keep the spread of infection under check. “The number of people getting positive has decreased significantly but we can’t lower our guard. The department is monitoring the situation closely,” she added. 35,000 samples being collected daily The department is collecting nearly 35,000 samples every day, particularly in schools, hospitals and other public places, Dr Bhaskar said. Mansa district reported no Covid case for at least 10 days with 10-12 districts witnessing zero case on the daily basis. Gurdaspur, Muktsar and Tarn Taran districts have recorded positivity rate even less than the state’s average of 0.1%. The majority of the tests being conducted are RT-PCR, said another department official, adding that an average 1 lakh vaccine doses are being administered daily. “Earlier, the daily vaccination number was 2.5-3 lakh which came down due to the festival and the ongoing paddy procurement. We will increase the number again,” he said. With the World Health Organization (WHO) giving approval to Covaxin vaccine, the immunization rate in Punjab is expected to pick up in the coming days, say experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/festival-rush-raises-concern-over-covid-spread-in-punjab-again-101636143260703.html
06-11-2021||Dehradun||IFS officer to probe felling of trees in Corbett||The Uttarakhand forest department has directed Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi to probe allegations of illegal constructions and felling of trees in Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), an officer aware of the details said on Friday.The state forest department has also asked the bureaucrat to probe the role of forest officials in the matter and submit a report within two weeks, the officer added.“I want this matter to be investigated properly so that action can be taken against the officers responsible. So, I issued an order on November 2 in this regard. I have directed him (Chaturvedi) to investigate the matter and find out who did what and when and with whose permission,” principal chief conservator of forests Rajiv Bhartari said.Chaturvedi, who is working as chief conservator of forest at Haldwani, had made headlines during his tenure as chief vigilance officer of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, from 2012 to 2014, when he investigated around 200 corruption cases, according to news agency PTI.Winner of the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2015, the civil servant has unearthed a spate of corruption cases in public offices. He also stopped illegal construction inside Haryana’s Saraswati Wildlife Sanctuary in 2009.On October 27, the Uttarakhand high court ordered the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the state’s top officials for forest and wildlife to investigate the alleged illegal construction and illegal felling of trees in CTR.The court’s order was based on an October 22 report by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) which said that forest officers may have forged government records to allow illegal construction of roads and buildings in the reserve.The committee described the illegal construction in CTR an excellent example of “administrative and managerial failure”, recommended vigilance inquiry against Uttarakhand forest officers and recommended that the Union ministry take strong action against erring forest officers.Subsequently, the state government on October 29 directed Bhartari to take appropriate action in the matter.Supreme Court lawyer and wildlife activist Gaurav Bansal, who moved court, alleged the matter involved more than ₹150 crores as government funds were utilised for illegal construction.“The NTCA’s report clearly says that work has been done without financial sanction,” he alleged, adding that there is an urgent need to investigate why funds were used for illegal purposes.Bhartari said he cannot comment about the financial irregularities alleged by the advocate and that Chaturvedi will investigate them.The court, meanwhile, sought an action taken report from NTCA by November 9.Bansal said he had earlier approached the Supreme Court, which subsequently constituted a Central Empowered Committee to probe allegations of illegal felling of thousands of trees in Pakhrau tiger safari, and construction of structures and water body in Corbett tiger reserve landscape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ifs-officer-to-probe-felling-of-trees-in-corbett-101636142289442.html

06-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Action on crackers let up before this Diwali||The number of people arrested for violating the firecracker ban in the city in over a month in the run up to Diwali this year is only around a third of the total number of arrests recorded during Diwali last year, data from the Delhi Police showed. The number of cases registered also saw a three-fold drop in the comparative period, even as the police control room received over 1,100 calls related to bursting of firecrackers in Delhi on Thursday.According to data released on Friday by the Delhi Police, 281 people were arrested across the city in the 38 days between September 28 and November 4 in 335 cases related to bursting and stocking firecrackers. Last year’s police data available with HT shows that 850 people were arrested in 1,206 cases related to bursting crackers, and illegal sale, storage and supply of crackers just on Diwali (November 14, 2020). Delhi Police officials did not respond to calls and messages seeking a comment.The sale, storage and use of firecrackers were banned in the city following a Delhi government order on September 15 this year.Of the 281 arrests this year , 143 people were picked up in 210 cases of bursting crackers and the remaining 138 were caught in 125 cases of illegally selling and supplying crackers. A total of nearly 19,703kg of crackers were seized during the police action in the last 38 days. Instances of bursting firecrackers was witnessed in several parts of the city on Thursday and the police control room received over 1,100 calls -- averaging nearly 47 calls each hour -- related to such offences.According to this year’s police statistics, Rohini district topped the list for arrests related to bursting crackers among the 15 police districts. Of the total 143 arrests in this category, 39 were arrested in Rohini, followed by Shahdara (37 arrests in 28 cases). Nobody was arrested for bursting crackers in east and north districts though six and three cases were registered respectively in the areas. The arrest data of southeast and central districts was not available.Similarly, north district saw the maximum arrests (21 arrests in 12 cases) for illegal sale of crackers, followed by Rohini (14 arrests in 14 cases) and west district (14 arrests in 13 cases).Further, Rohini also saw the highest seizure of firecrackers, recording capture of 11,396kg of the total 19,703kg of firecrackers seized in the Capital. The seizure data of Dwarka and New Delhi districts were not mentioned in the chart that the police shared.To enforce the directives pertaining to the “complete ban” on firecrackers in Delhi, the city police said that they had formed 706 teams and held 1,351 meeting with various resident welfare associations (RWAs), market welfare associations (MWAs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) between September 28 and November 4. The teams checked 128 premises of licensees and inventory during this period, they said.Meanwhile, many residents complained that despite a centralised helpline for reporting cracker violations in the city, it was difficult to either get through to the authorities or get them to act on it.Nishata Singh, a resident of east Delhi’s Preet Vihar, said that she reached out to the Delhi Police via the 112 helpline to report massive cracker bursting in her area but the attendants insisted that she provide specific details on where exactly the bursting was happening. “I provided them the details of the area and the areas from where the cracker bursting sounds were coming, but how can I exactly tell them from which lane or which house the crackers were being burst? Despite my complaint, I could hear cracker bursting all night and no action was taken,” Singh said.Rajeev Suri, a Delhi-based environmental activist, also said that cracker noises were being heard across the city. “This was a display of our collective governance failure and a breakdown of law and order,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-action-on-crackers-let-up-before-this-diwali-101636141518307.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||AQI deteriorates in most parts of Haryana||Bursting of fire crackers despite imposition of curbs across Haryana coupled with the recent increase in farm fires worsened the air quality index (AQI) in most cities, particularly in the national capital region (NCR), on Diwali night.On Friday afternoon, 10 Haryana cities reported an AQI of over 400 categorised “severe” by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Severe AQI affects even the healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing health conditions, the CPCB said.As per the CPCB bulletin, the 10 cities reporting severe AQI post-Diwali are Gurugram (472), Faridabad (469), Ballabhgarh (462), Jind (462), Charkhi Dadri, (424), Bhiwani (437), Hisar, (405), Manesar (458), Panipat (413), and Rohtak (437).As per the CPCB data, the air quality of nine other cities in state was categorised “very poor”. These include Ambala (301), Fatehabad (330), Daruhera (383), Kaithal (377), Karnal (329), Kurukshetra (354), Narnaul (377), Palwal (314) and Sonepat (400).Of the 24 cities chosen for the air quality bulletin, Panchkula was the only city which had “moderate” air quality with an AQI measured below 200, whereas the air quality of Sirsa and Yamunanagar cities was “poor”.Farm fires on the rise?Even as the number of farm fires has gone up in the past couple of days, officials said that there are discrepancies in the data of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Haryana Space Application Centre (HARSAC).The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) officials said the state has reported 228 incidents of farm fires on November 4 and 331 on November 5, an increase of about 100 incidents as compared to last year. The number of total active fire locations is over 3,600.Additional chief secretary (agriculture) Sumita Misra said while the HARSAC satellite data showed about 50% reduction in farm fires as compared to last year, the ICAR data indicated an increase. “We need to reconcile this data before we reach a conclusion,” she said.Director general (environment) and member secretary of HSPCB, S Narayanan said though the statistics showed an increase in farm fires due to residual burning, many fires could have started because of the use of firecrackers. “We will need to verify this as well,” he said.CPCB for zero toleranceThe CPCB has taken a serious note of rising air pollution in Delhi and the national capital region. CPCB chairman Tanmay Kumar has written to the Haryana chief secretary besides the chief secretaries of Uttar Pradesh and Delhi for strict vigilance to ensure zero tolerance to air polluting activities in the upcoming winter season.“Delhi and NCR were among the worst affected regions in country by the Covid-19 pandemic causing respiratory illness since air quality in Delhi-NCR becomes susceptible to deterioration during winter months under unfavourable meteorological conditions and if effective preventive actions are not taken the situation may worsen,” reads the letter, mentioning that the air pollution in Delhi-NCR during critical winter months is a matter of serious concern.The apex pollution watchdog has expressed concerns over the incidents causing air pollution including open burning of waste, improper handling of construction waste and emission from industries.The CPCB has issued directions for strict implementation of the nine points by preparing a detailed action plan by November 10.HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said, “We have already received the communication and have circulated the same to field officers for strict implementation.”Narayanan has admitted that firecrackers burst on Diwali night was a major factor behind the deteriorated air quality, despite the ban on sale and bursting of firecrackers in 14 NCR districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aqi-deteriorates-in-most-parts-of-haryana-101636141400332.html

A magnificent 30-foot high and 80-foot wide symbolic replica of the Ram Mandir of Ayodhya was crafted especially at the Thyagaraj Stadium for the Dilli Ki Diwali celebrations,” said a statement issued by the government.The rituals were followed by a light and sound show and a cultural programme. No spectators were allowed at the venue, in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year too, the government had organised a similar event at the Akshardham temple in east Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-celebrates-diwali-with-cabinet-ministers-at-thyagaraj-stadium-101636141218294.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||BJP Rajya Sabha MP faces protesting farmers’ wrath in Hisar||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Rajya Sabha MP Ram Chander Jangra on Friday faced farmers’ ire at Hisar’s Narnaund town in Haryana where he had gone to inaugurate a community centre (dharamshala).The MP reportedly called the protesters “jobless alcoholics from villages”. Hundreds of farmers gathered near the venue carrying black flags and chanted slogans against the MP. In a scuffle between the Haryana Police and the farmers protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws, the windshield of the MP’s car was also smashed, officials said.The MP accused the farmers of smashing the windshield of his car while the protesters blamed the police.In the entire incident, a farmer identified as Kuldeep Singh, of Satrod Khurd village in Hisar district, sustained injuries and the protesters rushed him to a nearby hospital where his condition is said to be critical. A few policemen also got injured.A heavy police force was deployed to prevent the farmers from reaching the area but police failed to stop the huge crowd. The farmers also faced heat from the attendees supporting Jangra and both sides chanted slogans against each other, officials said.The Narnaund police have booked three farmers identified as Harsh Deep Gill, Kailash and Sudhir of the district and 20 others under Sections 147, 149, 148, 341, 186, 353, 427 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for vandalising Jangra’s car.The farmers have launched an indefinite dharna outside the Narnaund police station demanding withdrawal of cases.Farm leader Vikas Sisar said they were protesting peacefully against MP Jangra and some of the attendees provoked the farmers.“People accompanying the MP had thrashed our protestors in which he got injured and is undergoing treatment at a Hisar hospital. We have pitched tents at the police station and a large number of farmers will reach here at 11am to gherao it,” he added.Hansi superintendent of police (SP) Nitika Gehlout said the farmers protested the MP’s visit and his car’s windshield was damaged in the scuffle.“We have not resorted to lathi-charge and a protester fell unconscious following which he was rushed to Jindal Hospital in Hisar. He was unwell,” the SP added.On Thursday also, the BJP MP faced a similar protest in Rohtak where he had gone to attend a Diwali programme.In a purported audio clip that went viral, the MP was allegedly heard saying, “bad elements have been protesting against the government and the recent killing of an innocent Nihang at Singhu border has exposed them. The farmers are not protesting but only bad elements. I have been frequently visiting Delhi and most of the tents at protest sites are empty and this issue will be resolved soon”.Reacting to this, Jangra said the incident took place when he was on his way to another function when some miscreants threw sticks on his car, damaging his car’s windshield.“I have spoken to the Hansi SP and Haryana director general of police in this regard. This was a clear case of attempt to murder and police told me that two persons have been detained. I have demanded strict action against the detainees. I had gone to attend social functions when the incident took place. Will they (farmers) protest social functions too? After my car was vandalised, I had to cancel two other social programmes,” the MP added.After the incident, the farmers staged a dharna outside Narnaund police station while other groups blocked the Hisar-Rohtak national highway near Ramayana toll plaza, chanting slogans against the BJP MP, the state government and the local administration.BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni also reached the Narnaund police station and demanded the release of the two farmers.“We will go back after police cancel the FIRs registered against farmers. Jangra has been trying to divide the people on caste lines and he has been using abusive language against the protesters. We have started indefinite dharna at Narnaund police station,” Charuni added.Hansi police PRO Subhash said two detained farmers have been released and senior police officials are holding meetings with Charuni and other farm leaders to end the dharna.“We are hoping that the dharna will be lifted after the meeting,” the Hansi police PRO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-rajya-sabha-mp-faces-protesting-farmers-wrath-in-hisar-101636140978419.html

06-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi hospitals report fewer burn cases due to crackers this Diwali||This Diwali, Delhi hospitals reported fewer cases of burns due to crackers and diyas (clay lamps) as compared to before the pandemic, according to three major government hospitals. In preparation for Diwali, hospitals across the city had earmarked beds, kept staff on standby, and added counters to admit people with burn injuries.Lok Nayak Hospital, near Delhi gate, received only one case--that of a child with 10% burns due to a cracker bursting in his hand--according to senior doctors at the hospital.“Before the pandemic, we saw between 30 and 40 burn injuries on the night of Diwali, so we earmarked 40 beds this year as well. Last year, the hospital wasn’t admitting any patient other than those suffering from Covid-19, so I do not have a comparison between this year’s numbers and the last,” the doctor said.At Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital, the biggest government hospital in the trans-Yamuna region, 18 persons with burn injuries were brought to the hospital emergency section. “But none of them had severe burns; they all had less than 10% burns. All the patients were given first aid, their burns were dressed, and they were sent home. There were no admissions this year,” said a senior doctor at the hospital. GTB Hospital too was earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 last year.Last November, Delhi had seen the worst surge in Covid-19 cases till then, reporting over 8,500 cases a day at its peak. After that, Delhi saw a massive second wave when over 28,000 cases were recorded in a day in April this year.Safdarjung Hospital, which has one of the best burn treatment units in the city, received 50 patients with Diwali-related injuries on Thursday, of whom seven needed to be admitted. “The rest had minor burns. However, this year we saw more cases than last year when people mostly stayed home because of Covid-19. Last year, we saw 28 cases, of which eight needed hospital admission. The numbers have definitely gone down as compared to before the pandemic,” said a senior doctor at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hospitals-report-fewer-burn-cases-due-to-crackers-this-diwali-101636140745664.html

06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Diwali: 100 people suffer eye injuries, burns in Chandigarh tricity area||At least 32 people suffered eye injuries and 64 were left with burns while bursting crackers in the tricity on Diwali. However, doctors claimed that the number of cases saw a dip as compared to previous years. Dr SS Pandav, head of the advance eye centre, PGIMER ,said: “This Diwali, the number of patients reporting here with eye injuries has gone down. We have received only 15 cases, of which most are from other states. Only five cases are from the tricity, including three from Chandigarh.”Of these, only 12 people needed surgical intervention. Most of the victims were bystanders as only five were bursting crackers when injured.Last year, 27 cases were reported. “We are expecting a few cases in the coming days as well,” said Dr Pandav.Also, four people with burn injuries reported to the department of plastic surgery. Two of these patients sustained major thermal injuries, while lighting candles. Another young patient received grievous hand injury while bursting a firecracker. These patients will need multiple surgeries over the next few days.At GMCH-32, 21 patients reported with cracker injuries on Diwali.

06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Air quality in Chandigarh turned severe on Diwali night||The Air Quality Index (AQI) crossed 400 and stayed in the severe range for about an hour before showing improvement at both continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations in Sectors 22 and 25, Chandigarh, on Diwali night. Meanwhile, the average AQI at all observatories across the city remained on the lower side on Thursday and it took just around four to five hours for the air quality to improve, according to data available with the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC).The AQI was in the moderate range till 6pm on Thursday, after which it started rising. At Sector 25, it went up to 465 between 10pm and 11pm, the highest it has ever gone since this observatory was opened in 2019. After this, it remained in the very poor category and came down to satisfactory levels (below 100) around 2am on Friday.At the other real-time data observatory in Sector 22, the AQI spiked to 409 between 9pm and 10pm. After this, it dropped to the very poor bracket for two hours and came down to satisfactory levels around 2am.“This is the first time that the AQI went up to 400 on Diwali. However, weather-wise we were lucky as the pollutants cleared within a few hours,” said CPCC member secretary Debendra Dalai, adding that it was unfortunate that people had ignored the administration’s blanket ban on crackers.Due to the air getting cleared in a few hours, the average AQI also remained on the lower side as compared to previous years. At 115, it was lowest at Sector 25. It was highest at the observatories in Sector 39 (IMTECH) and Sector 12 (PEC), touching 207, though lower than that recorded last year. “This doesn’t mean that less crackers were used this year. Last year, Diwali was celebrated on November 15, which was colder weather. Temperature inversion causes AQI to increase. Further, weather conditions helped clear the pollutants and the air quality was back to normal within a few hours this year,” said Dalai.The department had also calculated the average AQI at all observatories on October 29 to get the AQI values for a normal day, and it was found that the index had dramatically increased between an average day and Diwali across all centres. The noise pollution also went up this year. The highest noise level was recorded at Sector 39 (78.2 dB). Last year, the highest noise level stood at 66.6 dB, at the observatory in Sector 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/air-quality-in-chandigarh-turned-severe-on-diwali-night-101636140741986.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Police clueless day after murder at PU||Chandigarh Police are yet to make any breakthrough a day after a Panjab University professor’s wife was found murdered at their house in Sector 14 on Diwali morning. Identified as Seema Goyal, 60, the victim was the wife of Prof Bharat Bhushan Goyal, who teaches at the University Business School (UBS). She was a homemaker.The couple lived with their daughter in an independent house that shares its rear boundary wall with the vice-chancellor’s official residence, a high-security area on the campus.On Thursday morning, the police control room received a call about a woman lying unconscious with her hands and legs tied at her house on the PU campus. “By the time, a police team reached the spot, the woman had been shifted to hospital,” said Ketan Bansal, superintendent of police (SP, city), Chandigarh. Seema Goyal had been rushed to Government Multi Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, where doctors declared her brought dead. A case was registered against the unknown assailant under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the police station in Sector 11. After the postmortem, the woman’s body was handed over to her family. According to the preliminary report, she had died of a head injury. Hand, feet were tied In his statement to police, Prof Goyal said that on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, his wife was sleeping in a bedroom of the ground floor while he was in a room on the first floor. Their daughter was not present in the house. On Thursday, around 7:30 in the morning, he received a call on his mobile phone from his milkman, who told him to collect milk packets left at the main gate. When he came down to the ground floor, he was unable to open the main door. He then went to the gate using the kitchen door and later found that the main door was locked from outside.On entering the house again, he went to his wife’s room, and reportedly found her lying unconscious on the bed, with her hands and legs tied with a cloth. Police scanning CCTV footage SP Ketan Bansal said that the investigating team is scanning CCTV footage of the area to get any clue about the accused, but has failed to make any breakthrough yet. Sources said CCTV cameras are installed outside the V-C’s residence and near a hostel situated close to Goyal’s house. Other than that, police have to rely solely on Goyal’s statement as the body had already been removed by the time they reached the spot. After noticing his wife’s condition, Goyal had apparently informed his neighbours and called a doctor before rushing her to hospital. Police have found no sign of forced entry into the house. Meanwhile, Goyal told police that his wife’s mobile phone had also gone missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-police-clueless-day-after-murder-at-pu-101636140740599.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Former BJP minister confined in Rohtak village||Haryana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president and former state minister Manish Grover, BJP general secretary (organisation) Ravindra Raju, Rohtak mayor Man Mohan Goyal and other senior leaders of the saffron party were kept confined for hours at a temple in Kiloi village in Rohtak district on Friday.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Inderjit Singh said farmers and local residents of Kiloi village started protest against BJP leaders for using a temple to fulfil their political agenda.“How a party can live telecast Prime Minister’s speech at a temple?” he questioned.The BJP leaders had assembled at Kiloi to hear the live telecast of PM Narendra Modi’s speech from Kedarnath Temple where he had gone to perform ‘aarti’ at the shrine.Farmers protesting against three farm laws locked the main entrance gate of the Shiva Temple at Kiloi village and took BJP leaders hostage. Heavy police force was also deployed to maintain law and order and both sides were at loggerheads.After the situation got tense, additional forces from Jhajjar, Sonepat and Jind were called at Kiloi village to keep peace in the village.While the farmers claimed that the stand-off situation ended after BJP leaders climbed on the terrace and apologised, Grover has denied this.Grover, after leaving the temple, said a few social organisations’ people had met them and urged to wave towards the protesters to end the deadlock.“We did not apologise to anyone. We will continue to visit the shrine,” Grover said.SKM leader Inderjit Singh, however, maintained that the protest was lifted after Grover and others apologised to the villagers. “But they took a U-turn after leaving the village,” Inderjit said.Meanwhile, a spokesperson of the Rohtak administration said the dispute which had arisen due to a misunderstanding in Kiloi village was resolved peacefully.The spokesperson said the villagers had gathered outside the ancient Shiv Temple in the village over some issue.“It was not an issue which required an apology. Rather, it was a misunderstanding,” the spokesperson said.“After coming out of the Shiv Temple, former minister Manish Grover said the dispute had arisen due to a misunderstanding. He said as soon as the villagers understood the reality, the matter was resolved,” the spokesperson said.Quoting Grover, the spokesperson said some people of the Hooda Khap came to him and requested him to wish everyone ‘Ram-Ram’ from the balcony and the matter was resolved thereafter.Grover said he did not apologise to anyone, nor was it such a matter. “It was a misunderstanding which has now been resolved. He said whenever Lord Shiva will call him to Kiloi village, he will come to this temple to pay obeisance. The temple is for all and this fact should be understood by all sections of the society,” Grover said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-bjp-minister-confined-in-rohtak-village-101636140739293.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali village: Four years after FIR, no inquiry into ₹50-crore embezzlement||It’s been four years since the registration of an FIR in the alleged embezzlement of ₹50.42 crore government funds meant for Jheorheri village in Mohali, but the Punjab vigilance bureau has failed to conduct an inquiry. The secretary, rural development and panchayat, has now taken up the issue with the higher authorities and has also written to the director general of police (DGP), vigilance bureau (VB), to look into the matter personally and issue directions.The case dates back to 2017 when Congress MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu raised the issue in Vidhan Sabha, alleging embezzlement of funds meant for development works at Jheorheri and compensation disbursed to villagers in lieu of land for construction of the international airport that began in 2009.A preliminary inquiry found that ₹50 crore had been disbursed in contravention of rules. In February 2018, the VB registered a case against former district development and panchayat officer (DDPO) Gurwinder Singh Sarao, then block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) Jatinder Singh Dhillon, panchayat secretary Ravinder Singh, former sarpanch Gurpal Singh and former panchayat samiti chairman Resham Singh for purchasing land worth ₹24 crore against rules. Scrutiny of records also found that in 2009, the then director rural development and panchayat (DRDP) Gurdev Singh Sidhu, in whose name the compensation was deposited in the bank, disbursed ₹8.94 crore to private individuals without following the mandatory procedure. The secretary, Rahul Bhandari, has stated that it a clear misuse of power and personnel department may like to take appropriate action.The letter further stated that even in 2016, the then DRDP, Sukhjeet Singh Bains, disbursed ₹11 crore to private individuals while ignoring the orders of legal remembrancer, who in 2012 held that the department should wait for the high court orders in the case. “It is clarified that the department is of the considered view that nowhere in the statute any power has been given to DRDP to hear the claim petitions filed by private individuals; therefore, such claims were settled without any power vested, through any law, on him,” stated the letter.‘Needs proper scrutiny’Bhandari has asked the higher authorities for proper scrutiny regarding the settlement of claims through the office of advocate general or any other department as the government deems fit.Regarding the expenditure of ₹6.33 crore by the gram panchayat for development works, the department got the matter inquired from the superintending engineer (panchayat secretaries). In the report submitted on November 2017, it was found that BDPOs Mohinder Singh, Malwinder Singh, Jatinder Singh Dhillon; panchayat secretaries Jasbir Singh and Ravinder Singh; and sarpanch Gurpal Singh embezzled funds amounting to ₹3.62 crore, following which the case was handed over to the vigilance bureau. Even as an FIR was registered, even after four years and several reminders, the vigilance failed to prepare any report. The secretary stated that the case involves misappropriation of funds on a large scale due to the involvement of delinquent officers and has brought a bad name to the department, and needs thorough inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-village-four-years-after-fir-no-inquiry-into-50-crore-embezzlement-101636140696216.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Panel finds loopholes in Chandigarh electric vehicle policy||A three-member committee set up to finalise the draft of the electric vehicle (EV) policy has picked loopholes in the latest draft of the policy.The committee members, in a recent meeting, questioned several key proposed features like the quantum of subsidy to be given, subsidy targets, proposal to ban petrol two-wheelers from the next financial year and the methodology on which the policy is being prepared.In September, UT adviser Dharam Pal had constituted a three-member committee comprising deputy commissioner, MC commissioner and the chief executive officer, Chandigarh renewable energy and science and technology (CREST) to prepare the final draft electric vehicle policy.The primary mandate of the committee is to examine the financial implications of the incentives to be offered under the policy and to analyse the pattern in the other states where such policy has been formulated.CREST entrusted with finalising policyNotably, earlier, the UT transport department had also prepared a draft EV policy. But later this year the CREST was entrusted with finalising the policy.The administration is to bring the policy to encourage e-vehicles to reduce pollution in the city by bringing down emissions from the transport sector.There are five categories of vehicles that include two-wheelers, cars and heavy vehicles. The official questioned how the subsidy for these different categories has been calculated.“It was suggested that rather than arbitrary fixing the subsidy, it should be calculated by incorporating actual markets costs and resale value of vehicles,” said a senior UT official privy to the committee discussions.The draft advocates subsidies to vehicle buyers, which is expected to act as a major incentive to people to move from fossil fuel-based vehicles to electric vehicles.‘Subsidy target should be practical’The members also pointed out the subsidy targets being set. “The members said the subsidy target should be practical and based on the actual new vehicles being registered. For instance, it doesn’t make sense to fix a target of say 200 vehicles per month for the subsidy when only 100 vehicles are being registered. Instead, it can be in the percentage of total vehicles being registered,” said the official.The members also asked the CREST officials to re-postulate the modalities of the fund to be set up for financing subsidies and other measures under the policy.Members for adequate charging pointsThe committee members also suggested that before the city residents are asked to favour electric vehicles over petrol/diesel vehicles, adequate charging points across the city should be there. Notably, most of the charging points are to be created in the MC parking lots and its permission to set up these were sought by the environment department only recently. Acting on it, the MC general house in its last meeting in principle approved the setting up of these on MC land. “There is also an issue with the timelines set by the draft. For instance, the provision under the draft recommending stopping of registration of petrol two-wheelers by the start of the next financial year is not feasible,” said the official.Debendra Dalai, chief executive officer, CREST, said, “We had a constructive meeting on different aspects. We are in the process of incorporating the suggestions made by the members and revising the draft.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panel-finds-loopholes-in-chandigarh-electric-vehicle-policy-101636140694737.html

However, with the Punjab government failing to announce any VAT cut, the price gap with Mohali has further widened.The Union government slashed excise duty on petrol by ₹5 and on diesel by ₹10 on Diwali eve. Following its lead, the UT administration reduced VAT on both fuels by ₹7. According to a notification issued by the excise and taxation department on Thursday, VAT on petrol has been reduced from 22.45% to 15.24%, and on diesel from 14.02% to 6.66%.Even the Haryana government announced VAT cut, which reduced the price of both petrol and diesel in the state by ₹12 per litre. Currently, prices continue to be the lowest in Chandigarh, with petrol available for ₹94.23 and diesel for ₹80.9 on Friday. The prices stood at ₹105.24 and ₹98.96, respectively, on Wednesday. Gap with Mohali widensMeanwhile, the Punjab government is yet to slash VAT, hitting fuel stations in Mohali. “We saw no customers owing to the huge gap in fuel prices. The Punjab government must act fast or declining fuel sales will directly affect its revenues,” said Ashwinder Mongia, president, Mohali Petroleum Dealers’ Association.In Chandigarh, transporters hailed the fuel price cut. “The relief is too late, but we are thankful for it. This is likely to bring down inflation. The Centre must bring fuel, especially diesel, under GST regime to prevent a repeat of such a situation,” said BL Sharma, general secretary, Chandigarh Transport Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petrol-price-down-11-diesel-s-plunges-by-18-in-chandigarh-101636140680943.html
06-11-2021||Chandigarh||Weekly Covid cases slide during festive season in Chandigarh tricity||Though the medical fraternity and government agencies feared another pandemic surge in the festival season, the number of weekly Covid-19 cases being reported in the tricity has, in fact, dipped between Dussehra and Diwali. However, experts say the risk is not yet over, as keeping in view the incubation period of infection, cases might start rising a week after Diwali.Between October 1 and 15, the tricity reported 89 Covid-19 cases besides five fatalities. In three weeks following that, from October 15 (Dussehra) to November 4 (Diwali), 145 cases surfaced with a positivity rate of 0.22%. Among the three cities, Chandigarh remained the most-affected with 62 new infections, followed by 55 in Mohali and 28 in Panchkula. However, only one fatality was reported across the tricity, after a Mohali man succumbed to the virus on Diwali eve.As far as the weekly trend is concerned, the cases have been receding since Dussehra. A total of 52 cases were reported in the tricity in the week ending on October 21. In the following week, 50 cases were reported and only 43 people tested positive in the week that ended on Diwali day.Mohali reports no new caseMeanwhile, Mohali district reported no new case or death on Friday.

Dr Mini P Singh, professor in the virology department, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said: “Due to prevalence of antibodies in adults as well as paediatric population, the transmission of Covid-19 infection is not speedy. So far, the situation is under control and there are no traces of a third wave, but keeping in view incubation period of the infection, cases might start increasing a week after Diwali.”Dr Singh said the cases will surge only if people fail to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. “People must also come forward to complete their vaccination cycle as it is the key to protect themselves and the society,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/weekly-covid-cases-slide-during-festive-season-in-chandigarh-tricity-101636140679829.html

After going through the roof with over a lakh infection in May first week during the deadly second wave, the infection trajectory in Haryana has been on constant decline for 25 consecutive weeks now. As per the health department statistics, the 95 active cases were reported last week (October 25-31). As on Friday, there are 15 districts which do not have a single active case. These include Hisar, Sonepat, Ambala, Sirsa, Yamunanagar, Bhiwani, Kurukshetra, Mahendergarh, Jind, Rewari, Jhajjar, Fatehabad, Kaithal, Nuh and Charkhi Dadri. Data showed that the health officials tested 91,690 individuals, a per day average of about 18,000 samples during the last five days. As on Friday, there were 84 active cases across 22 districts, with Gurugram alone accounting for 56 infections.The second wave of virus transmission during the devastating six-week period in April and May had thrown more than 4.21 lakh infections and over 4,200 fatalities in state. As per the data, while the virus took 249 days to hit peak in November 2020 during the first wave, it took just 93 days to peak during the second wave this May, primarily due to the virulence of the highly-contagious delta variant of the virus. The state has so far inoculated about 2.60 crore persons of which, more than 50% have got the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tracking-covid-infection-on-the-decline-in-haryana-for-25-weeks-now-101636140318133.html
06-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s wind speed may pick up today, to help clear haze||Choking on a toxic, thick mixture of fog and air pollutants, Delhi’s first hope of relief is the wind speed likely picking up from Saturday, scientists said. Weather forecasters said better wind speed from Saturday will help improve air quality by aiding the dispersal of pollutants. “Winds have started picking pace from Friday afternoon. On Saturday and Sunday both the wind speeds are expected to remain high, which will help disperse the accumulated pollution levels. While the direction of the winds blowing into Delhi will continue to be north-westerly, continuous high speed wind will ensure that the stubble smoke does not amass over the city,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services. IMD has also predicted a “visible improvement” in air quality starting November 7. “The air quality is likely to improve further on November 6 and November 7, and settle in the ‘very poor’ category due to strong winds... The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from west-northwest directions of Delhi at a speed of 10-20 kmph. The surface winds is likely to blow at a speed of 25-35kmph on November 6, with partly cloudy sky, and shallow fog in the morning,” the IMD said in its forecast for Saturday. Senior India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said on Friday, Delhi also recorded its first fog episode of the season as visibility fell to 350 metres at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. At Safdarjung weather station, that provides representational data for the entire city, visibility fell to 200 metres. On Thursday morning, the visibility fell to 600-800 metres and remained in the 800-900 metre range throughout the day, the officials said.IMD scientists said the heavy load of pollutants from bursting of crackers on Diwali, particulate matter from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana coupled with moisture in the atmosphere also contributed to low visibility. They said such “fog” conditions, when visibility falls to the 200-500 metre range, are usually seen during mid-December and January, but Thursday-Friday’s condition was caused by high pollution levels in the city and high moisture content in the air. “Such conditions are usually caused because of absence of wind and higher humidity. High pollution levels lead to poor visibility,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. Earlier, in 2019, 2017, 2016 and 2012, visibility levels in Delhi fell to 200-500 metres during October-November, IMD data showed. On Friday, a day after Diwali, Delhi’s air quality fell to 462, in the severe zone, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings. This was the highest day-after-Diwali pollution recordings since 2015, when Delhi started AQI monitoring. Experts attributed this steep fall in Delhi’s air quality to a blatant violation of the cracker ban in the Capital and the rising contribution of stubble fires to overall pollution mix in Delhi. An analysis by Climate Trends, a strategic communications initiative on climate ambition and low carbon development pathways, said on Friday with the second consecutive La Nina in India, northwest region is gearing up for intense chilly weather this season. La Nina is a weather pattern that occurs in the Pacific Ocean. In this pattern, strong winds blow warm water at the ocean’s surface from South America to Indonesia. It is usually characterised by harsh winters. “While a lower number of crop residue burning incidents and widespread rain and snow in October kept pollution under check in the region until recently, the situation is already changing. With temperature dropping and other meteorological factors like wind speed slowing down, wind direction, haze setting in, pollution levels are again in the ‘very poor’ and ‘hazardous’ categories in most cities across the Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP). The seasonal factors of firecrackers and stubble burning have, as usual, added to the problem, as the peak of crop residue burning incidents coincide with Diwali,” the analysis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-wind-speed-may-pick-up-today-to-help-clear-haze-101636140018024.html

06-11-2021||Delhi||BJP encouraged people to burst crackers, says AAP||A political war of words erupted on Friday over Delhi recording severe air quality largely due to rampant bursting of firecrackers on Diwali with the Delhi environment minister accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of encouraging people to violate the ban on firecrackers, and the opposition slamming the government for not taking adequate preventive measures. On Friday, Delhi was enveloped by a thick haze a day after Diwali when people across the city burst crackers in violation of a complete ban on storage, sale and bursting of firecrackers by the Delhi government. Gopal Rai on Friday said that the large-scale cracker bursting on Diwali night, and increased stubble fires in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana were responsible for the Capital’s ‘severe’ air quality. Rai also alleged that the BJP was behind deliberately encouraging people to burst crackers and defy the government’s ban. “Some people in Delhi burst firecrackers on purpose. BJP is behind this,” Rai said on Friday. Delhi’s AQI on Thursday night slipped into the ‘severe’ zone, crossing the 400 mark on Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality scale. The average AQI at 2pm on Friday was 463. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta slammed the Delhi government for not taking any concrete measures to curb pollution in the national capital. Referring to Rai’s statement, Gupta said, “The Kejriwal government is trying to hide its failure to curb pollution in the city. In the past six years, the government has taken no concrete steps such as improving last mile connectivity, expanding the public bus fleet, encouraging the use of battery-operated vehicles, etc, to curb pollution. “They just want to tackle the issue by temporary arrangements. Ban on fire cracker is not the solution, as it hurts the religious sentiments of people. The government has now seen the result. They should have allowed the use of firecrackers for a limited period.” He said Delhi’s AQI was in the poor category even when people were not bursting firecrackers. “It is wrong to blame people for bursting firecrackers. The AQI was in poor category even before Diwali. The government is just trying to pass the buck.” He also questioned the Delhi government on the status of its green action plan, which was introduced in 2018. “They were to take 24 measures. We want to ask the CM about the status of all the measures proposed in the green action plan for which budget was also allocated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-encouraged-people-to-burst-crackers-aap-it-s-delhi-govt-s-failure-says-bjp-101636139658394.html

This budget will be spent on further enhancing testing and labs, procuring supplies, mobilizing additional human resources, increasing health facilities in the hospitals and managing Covid care centres, among others,” said the government statement.“As a responsible government, we are taking all measures and steps necessary to fight Covid-19,” said Kejriwal in the statement.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said, “In view of the advent of a possible wave of Covid, the Delhi government is trying its best to strengthen its health systems and preparedness at every level. This move will further enhance the management of resources in Delhi and prove to be crucial in the advent of any future wave of Covid-19.”In the 2021-22 Delhi budget, that was passed by the assembly in March, the Delhi government allocated ₹50 crore for vaccinations and ₹9,934 crore (14% of the total budget outlay of ₹69,000 crore) to the health sector, for setting up new hospitals, adding beds and scaling up infrastructure. However, there was no specific allocation under a separate Covid-19 head other than vaccinations. The government had then said Covid-19 allocations were likely to be assessed around the middle of the fiscal and and appropriate decisions taken.In April, Delhi witnessed it’s worst Covid-19 wave with daily cases peaking at a seven-day average of around 25,000 and positivity rate exceeding 36%. It had left the health-care infrastructure overwhelmed -- causing shortage of hospital beds, medical oxygen, life saving drugs and ambulances -- and led to the death of thousands of infected persons. Delhi has so far witnessed four distinct waves of Covid-19 since March 2020, and recorded more than 25,000 deaths.On Friday, Delhi recorded 32 new cases against seven recoveries. There were no deaths from the diseases, which recorded and a positivity rate of 0.14%, the government’s daily health bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-approves-additional-allocation-of-1-544-crore-for-covid-19-management-101636139418206.html

It also said the concentration of different pollutants such as SO2, CO and NO2 overall showed a decrease from last year, but the concentration was higher than in 2019. “The sudden deterioration this year attributed to extremely calm conditions, change of wind direction extremely calm conditions and low ventilation co-efficient and use of firecrackers. Though the increase in trend in the concentration of pollutants like PM2.5 & PM10 was observed since the evening of the November 3, major changes were observed after 8:00 PM on Diwali when the fireworks started. Ambient Air Quality in Delhi was already in the ‘very poor’ category due to the accumulation of pollutants in the air shed,” said DPCC in its analysis on Friday, stating active fire counts this year were much higher than last year on Diwali day. “On this Diwali day, the active fire count was recorded at 3383, while in 2020, the fire count on Diwali day was just 623,” it said. DPCC says the highest PM 2.5 concentration was recorded at midnight, with pollution levels starting to dip after that, adding that Delhi’s average PM 2.5 concentration ranged from 315 µg/m3 to 960 µg/m3. While the lowest average concentration was recorded at the National stadium, the highest average PM 2.5 concentration was seen at Jahangirpuri. In terms of noise pollution, real-time noise monitoring was undertaken at 31 locations by the DPCC, finding decibels level ranges from 54.2 dB (A) at Wazirpur to 77.4 dB(A) at Karol Bagh on Diwali day.

This budget will be spent on further enhancing testing and labs, procuring supplies, mobilizing additional human resources, increasing health facilities in the hospitals and managing Covid care centres, among others,” said the government statement.“As a responsible government, we are taking all measures and steps necessary to fight Covid-19,” said Kejriwal in the statement.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said, “This move will further enhance the management of resources in Delhi and prove to be crucial in the advent of any future wave of Covid-19.”In the 2021-22 Delhi budget, that was passed by the assembly in March, the Delhi government allocated ₹50 crore for vaccinations and ₹9,934 crore (14% of the total budget outlay of ₹69,000 crore) to the health sector, for setting up new hospitals, adding beds and scaling up infrastructure.However, there was no specific allocation under a separate Covid-19 head other than vaccinations. The government had then said Covid-19 allocations were likely to be assessed around the middle of the fiscal and appropriate decisions taken.In April, Delhi witnessed it’s worst Covid-19 wave with daily cases peaking at a seven-day average of around 25,000 and positivity rate exceeding 36%. It had left the health-care infrastructure overwhelmed -- causing shortage of hospital beds, medical oxygen, life saving drugs and ambulances -- and led to the death of thousands of infected persons.On Friday, Delhi recorded 32 new cases against seven recoveries. There were no deaths from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cabinet-approves-rs-1-544-crore-for-covid-management-in-city-101636138406022.html

The condition of one of the firemen is serious, fire department officials said.The injured firemen were identified as Feroz, Sushil, Suresh, Rakesh and Mahabir. All of them were admitted to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. The condition of Sunil is serious, said Garg.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that the mishap took place around 7pm. Some houses close to the shop were evacuated as the fire engulfed two adjacent shops that sold groceries and mobile phones, and began spreading quickly.Eight fire tenders along with firemen from Tahirpur fire station rushed to the spot to douse the flames. While the firemen were carrying out the operation, a gas cylinder exploded in the shop where gas stoves were repaired.“As per information, till now seven persons, including five firemen have been injured and taken to the hospital. The blaze is under control. The people living in the affected buildings have been safely evacuated.

06-11-2021||Noida||Over 20 vehicles pile up on Delhi Meerut Expressway due to poor visibility||Poor visibility near the Masuri stretch on the Delhi Meerut Expressway led about two dozen vehicles, including cars, to pile up on Friday morning. Police said that though vehicles were damaged, no passenger sustained any serious injuries. The incident took place when several cars were moving to Ghaziabad around 8.30am on Friday. Police said thick fog engulfed the expressway and the cars on front applied brakes to slow down. “As the vehicles ahead slowed down, those coming from behind also applied brakes but one by one hit the vehicles in front. This way, about two dozen cars piled up but no passenger suffered any serious injury. The vehicles were damaged and police provided assistance,” said Yogendra Singh, station house officer of Masuri police station. “The vehicles piled up as the visibility on the stretch was very poor and people faced problems while driving. No one registered any complaint,” he added. Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board said the poor visibility was the result of thick smoke arising from the bursting of crackers and stubble burning in the neighbouring states. “It is likely that the conditions will improve by the evening of November 7, once more pollutants are dispersed. This will happen when wind speed increases,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said the expressway has indicators to assist drivers during foggy conditions. “Recently, we also installed delineator to guide drivers during the night and foggy conditions but about 80 of these were stolen by unidentified persons. The delineators were especially put up at the Dasna/Masuri stretch of the expressway as it generally experiences foggy conditions during winter,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-20-vehicles-pile-up-on-delhi-meerut-expressway-due-to-poor-visibility-101636138217622.html

06-11-2021||Noida||6 vehicles pile up as fog engulfs Eastern Peripheral Expressway||Low visibility due to fog conditions caused six vehicles to pile up on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Dankaur, Greater Noida, on Friday morning. Two people, whose car was the first to crash into a truck from behind, were critically injured and are currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Faridabad, said police. Arvind Pathak, station house officer of Dankaur police station, said the accident took place around 7am on Friday. Police said Chandan Kumar (35), a resident of Palwal in Haryana, and his wife (35), their 11-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son were going from Greater Noida to Palwal in a Hyundai i20. “Kumar could not spot a slow moving truck ahead of his car due to poor visibility and ended up ramming the truck from behind. Kumar and his wife were critically injured while their two children sitting on the rear seat of the car had a narrow escape,” said Pathak.  Police said a Toyota Innova crashed into the Hyundai i20, fllowed by a mini truck that hit the Innova, blocking off the road. As the visibility was poor, two more cars ended up in the pile-up on the same route. Pathak said people in all the other vehicles escaped with minor injuries. Some passerby informed police and also arranged for a car to rush Kumar and his wife to a private hospital in Faridabad. Police said Kumar is a head constable with the cyber cell and is posted in the Panchkula district. The truck driver managed to escape after the accident. A team from Dankaur police station reached the spot and cleared the expressway in about 30 minutes. Pathak said they have not received any complaint in the incident. Ashutosh Singh, traffic inspector, Noida, advised people to drive cautiously in poor visibility conditions. “We are creating awareness among people as November is being observed as a road safety month,” he said. Data from the Noida transport department shows that from January 1 to August 31 this year, 238 people were while 348 injured in 501 accidents in Gautam Budh Nagar.

06-11-2021||Noida||Noida: Man shot at during brawl over bursting of firecrackers||A 30-year-old man was allegedly shot at during a brawl over bursting of fire crackers in Green Park colony in Gadhi Chaukhandi village in Noida on Thursday night. The victim, Vineet (known by his first name), a resident of Khoda Colony in Ghaziabad, had come to celebrate Diwali at his maternal uncle Rajveer’s (known by his first name) place in Noida.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said Rajveer runs a grocery shop near his house. “Vineet was bursting fire crackers outside Rajveer’s house when two locals, identified as Sunil (25) and Gopal (22) (both known by their first names), reached there and also started bursting crackers,” said Chander. A little later, Rajveer and Vineet asked Sunil and Gopal not to burst firecrackers outside their residence. However, Rajveer stated in his complaint that the two people continued bursting crackers and this led to an argument, said the DCP. Vivek Trivedi, station house officer of Phase 3 police station, said Vineet and Rajveer picked up lathis and started beating Sunil and Gopal. “Sunil and Gopal barged into a neighbouring tour operator’s office to take shelter. The tour operator, 45-year-old Rajkumar (known by his first name), and his father, 70-year-old Shri Pramod (known by his first name), were sitting inside the office. Vineet and his uncle suspected that Rajkumar was known to the two persons hence, they took shelter there. Vineet and Rajveer allegedly hit Rajkumar and his father with the lathis,” said the SHO. Police said that it seemed all the four persons--Vineet, Rajveer, Sunil and Gopal--were in an inebriated state at the time of the incident. Police said Rajkumar took out his licenced revolver and opened fire to threaten the four people and warned them to leave his office. However, the four continued attacking each other. Rajkumar then fired a shot at Vineet, who sustained an injury on his chest.  Vineet was critically injured and rushed to a private hospital in Noida, said police. A team from phase 3 police station reached the spot and arrested Rajkumar and Gopal. “We have seized the licenced gun used in the crime. A case has been registered against four persons--Sunil, Gopal, Rajkumar and his father--under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the IPC. The arrested suspects will be produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said the SHO.  Police have launched a search for Sunil and Shri Pramod who are on the run. Trivedi said police will also recommend suspending Rajkumar’s weapon’s licence for its misuse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-man-shot-at-during-brawl-over-bursting-of-firecrackers-101636137677803.html
06-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Fire dept records least number of emergency calls on Diwali in 12 years||The Delhi Fire Services (DFS) on Friday said they received 152 calls--the lowest number of calls related to fire and other emergencies on Diwali in the past 12 years, and nearly 32% less than the calls received on Diwali last year.Of the total calls, 117 were related to fire incidents in the city, while the remaining 35 were related to other emergencies such as rescuing animals and birds, and road accidents, senior fire officials said. Among the 117 fire-related calls, four were about fires caused by the bursting of crackers while 35 were related to garbage fires. No major fire or casualty was reported from anywhere in the city till midnight, they added.“The 152 calls were received between the midnights of Wednesday and Thursday. The number was the lowest since 2010; that year, our control room received 169 calls. Last year, we received 222 calls,” said Delhi Fire Services chief Atul Garg, attributing the dip in such calls to the precautions taken by the public while dealing with fire and crackers, and the various public awareness campaigns carried out by the fire department before Diwali celebrations.“For us (the fire department), it’s a positive sign, which also suggests that people are becoming more aware of fire safety, and handling fire-related items with care during Diwali. We thank Delhiites for making us believe that awareness campaigns are showing positive results. This time, we deployed nearly 3,000 firefighters and 200 fire vehicles to deal with emergencies. We also deployed vehicles at 30 different locations in the city apart from the 64 existing fire stations,” said Garg.According to the fire department, the number of fire-related calls usually increases during Diwali, mainly due to people bursting firecrackers, not taking adequate precautions when lighting earthen lamps or candles, and not checking for loose wires while putting up decoration lights.According to the DFS data, most fire and emergency calls (36) were reported between 8pm and 10pm on Thursday. The lowest number of calls (7) was received between 2pm and 4pm.According to the DSF, there was a fire reported from a factory outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri area on Thursday night. The tiles stored in the basement, artificial flowers stored on the first floor and shoe manufacturing material kept on the second floor of the factory caught fire. Eight fire tenders were sent to douse the flames. No one was injured, the fire officials said.Another fire was reported from the servant quarters of the residence of the director of Doordarshan at Pandara Road in Lutyen’s Delhi around 2am Thursday. The fire department chief said that four fire tenders were rushed to the spot.“Six people were rescued by the public and the firefighters. One woman was sent to the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, as she had inhaled a lot of smoke. All were safe,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhifire-dept-records-least-number-of-emergency-calls-on-diwali-in-12-years-101636137501204.html
06-11-2021||Noida||Senior citizen couple murdered at Ghaziabad home on Diwali night||Unidentified assailants entered the house of a senior citizen couple in the Patel Nagar 2 locality of Ghaziabad and killed them while their neighbours were celebrating the festival of Diwali. The police said that it could be a case of personal enmity or dispute but not robbery as valuables in the house were found intact.Police identified the two victims as Ashok Jaidka, 72, and his wife Madhu Jaidka, 70, who lived by themselves in a ground-floor flat.According to police, footage from CCTV cameras shows that two men entered the victims’ house around 8.45pm on Thursday and left within a span of five minutes.“The body of the woman was found near the main door while the man was found dead in bed as he was bed-ridden after suffering a paralytic attack. The nature of injuries (on the heads) of both the victims initially suggested gunshot wounds. But the autopsy revealed they were attacked by a hard, blunt object. The house was not broken into, and their valuables, including the jewellery worn by the woman, were found intact,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1).Police said they received information about the couple around 1am on Friday after the daughter of the victims, who lives in Noida, called for help.“She had been calling up her parents on Diwali but they did not pick the phone. So, she called up a local washerman, who visited the house and found the couple dead. She then called the police. It seems to be a planned murder and it could be due to some personal enmity or any dispute. We have formed several teams to trace the suspects,” the SP said, adding that the couple’s daughters live in Noida and Pune.The police said that the assailants probably chose the night of Diwali so that the neighbours would be busy celebrating Diwali.They added that one of the two men seen entering the house had put on a face mask while the other did not. The police also suspect that a third person kept watch outside the house.On the basis of the complaint given by the family, the police registered an FIR under Indian Penal Code Section 302 (murder) against unidentified persons at Sihani Gate police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/senior-citizen-couple-murdered-at-ghaziabad-home-on-diwali-night-101636137320871.html
06-11-2021||Noida||Noida most polluted in India post-Diwali, Ghaziabad, G Noida not far behind||Residents in Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida breathed this season’s worst air on Friday as, for the first time since the Graded Response Action Plan came into effect on October 15, the Air Quality Index (AQI) readings of the three cities breached the “very poor” category and spiked to “severe” a day after Diwali.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Noida was the most polluted city across the country on Friday with an AQI reading of 475 (severe). The air in Ghaziabad and Greater Noida was no better, as the AQI reached the “severe” category with readings of 470 and 464, respectively. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) attributed the sudden spike in pollution levels to the bursting of firecrackers on Diwali (Thursday) and stubble burning in neighbouring states. “The air quality of the region was impacted as firecrackers were burnt on Thursday evening and the air quality continued to deteriorate till 3am on Friday. Thereafter, we witnessed a downward trend. The pollution levels have also increased because of stubble burning in the neighbouring states. It is likely, as per the pollution pattern, that the air quality will improve from November 7,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, (Ghaziabad), who is also officiating for Noida. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) in a forecast said that firework emissions on the night of Diwali degraded air quality from “very poor” to “severe” category, as predicted. “The share of stubble emissions has peaked today (Friday) at 36%. In the last 24 hours, PM2.5 level is higher as compared to 2020, but much less than that in 2018. However, it may be noted that local winds have picked up since morning and now fast dispersion is expected. Without any more firecracker emissions, AQI is likely to improve to ‘very poor’ category by tonight (Friday night) although stubble contribution is expected to remain almost the same as today,” said the Safar forecast on Friday. It added relief from “severe” pollution is expected only from the evening of November 7, but the air quality might remain in the “very poor” range. According to CPCB, on Thursday, the AQI of Ghaziabad and Noida was recorded in the “severe” category with readings of 419 and 404, respectively. Greater Noida had “very poor” air with a recording of 322. Last year on Diwali (November 14), the AQI of Ghaziabad and Noida was recorded in the “severe” category, with readings of 456 and 425 respectively, while Greater Noida’s air quality was in the “very poor” category with a recording of 394. Despite no licences, residents buy firecrackers In both Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, authorities did not issue any licence for the sale of firecrackers. However, residents managed to buy crackers and burst them till late Thursday night in both districts. Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 2 in Noida’s Sector 78, said a number of people burst firecrackers on Thursday night. “The police and administration had informed people that firecrackers were not allowed. However, people managed to get firecrackers and burst them from 8pm till midnight. This led to a rise in pollution levels and poor visibility in Noida,” said Sharma. He said on Friday morning, he drove to his office in Delhi amid such low visibility that he was hardly able to see anything even 50 metres ahead. “I was not able to clearly see the Yamuna river while driving on the DND flyover,” said Sharma. “Residents burst a lot of crackers despite the fact that no licence was issued this year or last year. There was no enforcement and the bursting of firecrackers went on until very late at night,” said Alok Kumar, a resident of Arihant Harmony in Indirapuram. According to official statistics from the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, there were 3,032 fire counts reported from Punjab, 228 from Haryana, 123 from Uttar Pradesh, 19 from Rajasthan and 123 from Madhya Pradesh on November 4. Authorities in both districts admitted people burst firecrackers on the night of Diwali but emphasised that they did enforce rules. “We will recover environment compensation cost from erring persons, who are being identified with the help of video records. There was some bursting of crackers but residents in most localities celebrated the festival peacefully. The spike in pollution is also because of the high volume of traffic on roads during the festival,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. Love Kumar, joint commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the commissionerate had not issued licence to any vendor to sell firecrackers this year. “The police deployed enforcement teams and registered cases against five vendors for unauthorised sale of crackers. In some cases, police also stopped people from bursting firecrackers. It seems somehow people managed to get firecrackers and burst them on Diwali,” he said. Health experts said with the spike in pollution levels, health ailments are expected and may include burning of eyes, watering and redness of eyes, nasal congestion, runny nose, frequent sneezing, headache, breathlessness, cough and chest heaviness among others. “The effect that air pollution has on lungs depends on the type and mix of pollutants in the air, the concentration of pollutants and how much of the pollutant gets into the lungs... the deteriorating AQI makes even non-smokers highly susceptible to the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other life-threatening lung diseases,” said Dr Sharad Joshi, principal consultant (pulmonology), Max Hospital, Vaishali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-most-polluted-in-india-post-diwali-ghaziabad-g-noida-not-far-behind-101636137138668.html
06-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Pollution peaks as norms go up in smoke||At midnight on Thursday -- after nearly five hours of cracker burning by people across the city to mark Diwali -- the hourly concentration of PM 2.5 (one of the minutest and dangerous pollutants) hit 1,984 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) in south-east Delhi’s Okhla-Phase-2, 33 times the national ambient air quality standards and nearly 397 times the WHO safe-limit.In north Delhi’s Ashok Vihar, the hourly average of the micro particle touched 1,957µg/m3 at 3am.These two were among the most polluted localities in Delhi on Diwali this year, data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) showed. Rampant cracker bursting, slow winds, high moisture content and a high contribution of pollutants from farm fires pushed Delhi’s air quality into severe zone for the first time this year since January, and the worst after Diwali since air quality records are being maintained.The 24-hour average air quality on Diwali (Thursday) at 4pm was 382. The same was recorded at 462 on Friday.Locations such as Najafgarh recorded the average PM2.5 levels at 528µg/m3, in Narela it was 654µg/m3, Bawana showed a reading of 705µg/m3, and the residential area around Aurobindo Marg recorded 791µg/m3.Other locations that showed high PM2.5 pollution include Wazirpur (1,843 µg/m3), an industrial area fairly close to Ashok Vihar, and Anand Vihar (1,714 µg/m3). Of the 37 air quality monitoring stations across the city, 36 showed air quality in the severe zone on Friday at 4pm. Only the station at DTU, north Delhi, recorded AQI of 384 in the very poor zone.Experts said though several factors could be responsible for varying concentration of particulate pollutants across areas, it is mostly indicative of cracker burning.“We have to see the area and the wind-speed and if the area is upwind or down-wind for smoke coming from stubble burning, but largely, these spikes are indicative of firecrackers, in addition to any other local emission source... With it being Diwali, industries and vehicles may not be playing much of a role and firecrackers are likely to be the major source (of pollution),” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment.HT reported on Wednesday that according to the forecast by weather and pollution monitoring agencies, the air quality in Delhi will slip into the severe zone, if the Delhi government’s ban on storage, sale and use of firecrackers was violated.This is evident from the extremely high PM 2.5 concentration recorded at Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range monitoring station (1,731µg/m3) that is situated in a largely green area. Experts said since it is flanked by residential colonies, and having no other major source of pollution around, the high PM2.5 levels are indicative of cracker bursting.To be sure, the use of firecrackers in the city coincided with more than 3,000 farm fires in Punjab and Haryana contributing to 36% of the air pollution in Delhi -- the highest this season so far.The peak pollution level across Delhi was generally recorded between midnight and 1am, but some locations also saw a spike at 3am as well, including Mandir Marg (1,600 µg/m3), Anand Vihar (1,714µg/m3), Vivek Vihar (1,604µg/m3) and Ashok Vihar (1,957µg/m3), indicating that firecrackers may have been burst at these locations well past midnight.Pramod Kohli (67), general secretary of the Federation of Ashok Vihar Residents’ Welfare Association, said that he could hear firecrackers in the area till 1am. “The spike on Thursday could well be due to firecrackers. We could hear it till 1am, and since I have breathing problems, I could not even step out and ask people to stop. We have been writing to the government for several years to act on local sources of pollution too, but nothing has happened,” he said.He added that local factors such as open burning of waste and frequent fires at the nearby Bhalswa landfill are perennial sources of pollution in the area.Professor Mukesh Sharma from IIT Kanpur, part of the team that will carry out real-time apportionment of pollution sources in the city with the Delhi government, said it is difficult to pin-point if firecrackers were alone responsible for the spike in pollution levels, but added that bursting even a few firecrackers would have led to a huge spike in the current scenario. “If the area is congested and compact, some crackers may also create an increase in pollution levels till it reaches a peak, before starting to disperse. Once the real-time source apportionment study commences in Delhi, we will be able to analyse barium, strontium and copper in the air to identify specific emissions from firecrackers,” he said.According to DPCC data, last year, the locations in Delhi which saw the biggest spike during Diwali were Vivek Vihar (1,970 µg/m3) and Mundka (1,853 µg/m3), while it was 1,798 µg/m3 in the bustling sub-city of Rohini in north Delhi.Upendra Bharadwaj, president of the Pocket B RWA in Sukhdev Vihar, Okhla, said pollution from firecrackers and the nearby waste-to-energy plant are likely to be the key factors behind Thursday’s high PM 2.5 readings. “There was a layer of ash on our cars in the morning. The waste-to-energy plant has remained a problem throughout the year, and when firecrackers are burst in large numbers, then it all combines to make the air worse,” Bharadwaj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiokhla-sees-highest-pollution-as-cracker-ban-flouted-across-the-capital-101636137019492.html

The family members accused the police of delay in taking action and recovering the body, the police personnel, on the other hand, said the delay happened due to a staff crunch. The 40-year-old man hailed from Sadguva village of the district and died by hanging himself in his kutcha house on Thursday. His uncle said the man used to live alone and was last seen on Wednesday night. “When he didn’t come out on Thursday, the family members, who live in the neighbourhood, knocked on the door. Later, they checked by removing earthen tiles of the kutcha roof and found him dead at around 4 pm on Thursday. The family members reached Pathariya police station to inform and in return, the police asked them to report with a photo. However, we didn’t take the matter of photo seriously and waited for the police till Friday morning,” said an uncle of the deceased. When they asked the police again to bring down the body, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) MK Patel reached the spot and brought down the body with the help of the villagers. Patel said the delay happened due to a staff crunch. However, sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP), Pathariya SP Shukla, said, “An inquiry has been ordered in the matter to know the reason behind the delay in recovering the body and sending it for the postmortem.” The preliminary report of the post mortem is awaited.

The police booked 10 persons, four of whom have been identified, in connection with the incident, but are yet to make any arrests.According to the police, the incident took place at the residence of a former sarpanch (village head), identified as Gopal, around 8pm, when his extended family was visiting them for drinks and dinner on the occasion of Diwali.

Balram and Sohanpal were out on bail. The main suspect was holding a grudge against them for his brother’s murder and planned to kill all the family members when they were together on Diwali night,” the SHO said.The deceased were identified as Vikas (21) and Sohanpal (35), while Balram was injured and is under treatment at a private hospital. The others who were injured were identified as Rajesh Kumar, Chauhan and Parveen.“Vikas was declared brought dead by the doctors at the hospital,” the SHO said.According to Kumar, one of the victims, the attack was carried out by Rinku, Deepak alias Bholu of Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, Manish Rana of Bhiwani, and Amit alias Gaath of Sonipat, along with others. “We were sitting inside the room when the incident took place. My nephews Balram and Sohanpal were chatting with their cousin Praveen, while his son Vikas Raghav and Balram’s eight-year-old son, Yash Chauhan, were celebrating Diwali in the lawn when we were fired upon,” he said.The police said that they have constituted three teams to trace the assailants and are conducting raids at their hideouts. The bodies were handed over to the families after a post-mortem examination.Dr Deepak Mathur, the forensic expert who conducted the autopsy, said that both died due to excessive bleeding. “Vikas suffered 16 gunshot injuries; three bullets were recovered from his abdomen and rest passed through his head, neck and chest. Sohanpal suffered two gunshots to the abdomen, leading to his death,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-killed-four-injured-in-fallout-between-gangs-in-gurugram-s-manesar-101636136299026.html
06-11-2021||Bhopal||4 killed as two families clash at MP panchayat, 8 arrested: Police||Four people were killed and eight injured in a clash at a village panchayat in Madhya Pradesh’s Alirajur district on Thursday night.The deadly fighting erupted over a dispute between two families over silver ornaments that a girl took with her when she eloped with her lover more than a year ago, police said.“Madho Bhudariya, 20, and Leela Guliya, 21, both residents of Bakodiya village, ran away from their homes to marry as per the Bhilala tribe’s tradition. Leela had taken with her silver jewellery weighing 1kg that belonged to her mother,” said Manoj Singh, superintendent of police, Alirajpur. As per the tribe’s tradition, a man or a woman can pick a life partner at a village fair and can elope. Later, a community feast is held in the village to recognise the marriage.Singh said the girl’s family had been asking her to return the silver jewellery since they eloped in June 2020, but she has refused to do so.“On Thursday, a village panchayat was called to settle the issue. As per tribal tradition, the boy’s family had to give money to the girl’s family to get their consent for the marriage,” Singh said. But during the talks, Singh said, the two families argued, resulting in an escalation of tensions. As the talks turned violent, the two families attacked each other with sticks and sharp-edged weapons, he narrated. In the ensuing fight, Madho’s cousin Ismail Bhudariya, 25, and Sukhdev Bhudariya, 22, were killed by Leela’s family members; while Leela’s grandfather Bhal Singh Guliya, 50, and her uncle Nandu Singh, 24, were killed by Madho’s family members, Singh said. All four people were beaten and stabbed to death on the spot while more than eight were injured and rushed to the district hospital, the police said.Also Read: 3 die as mini bus catches fire after hitting stationary truck in Madhya PradeshPolice booked 13 people, including the four deceased, in two separate FIRs registered under section 302 (murder) and 147 (rioting) of the Indian Penal Code.

06-11-2021||Dehradun||IFS officer to probe illegal constructions, felling of trees in Corbett reserve||The Uttarakhand forest department has directed Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi to probe allegations of illegal constructions and felling of trees in Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), an officer aware of the details said on Friday.The state forest department has also asked the bureaucrat to probe the role of forest officials in the matter and submit a report within two weeks, the officer added. “I want this matter to be investigated properly so that action can be taken against the officers responsible. So, I issued an order on November 2 in this regard. I have directed him (Chaturvedi) to investigate the matter and find out who did what and when and with whose permission,” principal chief conservator of forests Rajiv Bhartari said. Chaturvedi, who is working as chief conservator of forest at Haldwani, had made headlines during his tenure as chief vigilance officer of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, from2012 to 2014, when he investigated around 200 corruption cases, according to news agency PTI. Winner of the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2015, the civil servant has unearthed a spate of corruption cases in public offices. He also stopped illegal construction inside Haryana’s Saraswati Wildlife Sanctuary in 2009.On October 27, the Uttarakhand high court ordered the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the state’s top officials for forest and wildlife to investigate the alleged illegal construction and illegal felling of trees in CTR.The court’s order was based on an October 22 report by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) which said that forest officers may have forged government records to allow illegal construction of roads and buildings in the reserve.The committee described the illegal construction in CTR an excellent example of “administrative and managerial failure”, recommended vigilance inquiry against Uttarakhand forest officers and recommended that the Union ministry take strong action against erring forest officers.Subsequently, the state government on October 29 directed Bhartari to take appropriate action in the matter. Supreme Court lawyer and wildlife activist Gaurav Bansal, who moved court, alleged the matter involved more than ₹150 crores as government funds were utilised for illegal construction.“The NTCA’s report clearly says that work has been done without financial sanction,” he alleged, adding that there is an urgent need to investigate why funds were used for illegal purposes.Bhartari said he cannot comment about the financial irregularities alleged by the advocate and that Chaturvedi will investigate them.The court, meanwhile, sought an action taken report from NTCA by November 9.Bansal said he had earlier approached the Supreme Court, which subsequently constituted a Central Empowered Committee to probe allegations of illegal felling of thousands of trees in Pakhrau tiger safari, and construction of structures and water body in Corbett tiger reserve landscape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/whistleblower-asked-to-probe-constructions-felling-of-trees-in-corbett-reserve-101636111274351.html
06-11-2021||World||Biden hails passage of infrastructure bill as ‘monumental step forward’||US President Joe Biden on Saturday hailed the passage of his ambitious $1 trillion infrastructure plan by the House of Representatives as a “monumental step forward for the nation”.“I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to suggest that we took a monumental step forward as a nation,” Biden said on Saturday at the White House, accompanied by vice-president Kamala Harris. “We did something long overdue, that has long been talked about in Washington, but never actually done.”Under the infrastructure bill, the US will spend approximately $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years to replace all lead water supply pipes in the country; extend high-speed internet network; rebuild and repair roads and bridges; modernise the public transport system, passenger rail, and airports; build a network of charging stations for electric cars; upgrade the power infrastructure and secure the infrastructure against cyberattacks and climate change.“For all you at home who feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that’s changing so rapidly — this bill is for you,” Biden further said on Saturday. “The vast majority of the thousands of jobs that will be created do not require a college degree.”“This is a blue collar blueprint to rebuild America, and it’s long overdue,” he added. Biden went on to say that the legislation includes the most signifiant investment in roads and bridges in 70 years and in passenger rails in 50 years. The $1.2 trillion bill — $550 billion of which is new spending — will be signed by Biden “soon” at a ceremony to be attended by those who were critical to its writing and passage, such as Democratic Senator Krysten Sinema and Republican Senator Rob Portman.The infrastructure bill passed in a 228-206 vote in the Democratic-led House of Representatives late on Friday night, with the support of 10 Republicans. Though proposed by Biden,the measure had passed in the Senate in August with bipartisan support. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had supported it in the upper chamber to the consternation of former president Donald Trump, who expressed criticisms publicly . But the bill had been delayed in the House of Representatives after progressive Democrats withheld their backing in an effort to bargain for another legislative measure by Biden, the Build Back Better bill, which proposes $1.7 trillion on expanding social safety and security — such as healthcare and paid maternity leave — and climate change.The need for an overhaul of the country’s infrastructure had long been on the agenda of many former US presidents, including Barack Obama and Trump. In fact, “infrastructure week” had become something of a running joke under Trump as the administration never ever presented a plan despite the then president’s repeated promises.The infrastructure bill passed in the aftermath of a stinging defeat suffered by Democrats in elections in Virginia last week, when Republicans won the top three statewide posts including the governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hails-passage-of-infrastructure-bill-as-monumental-step-forward-101636220366859.html
06-11-2021||World||Pak court acquits 6 leaders of Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed’s JuD||The Lahore High Court on Saturday set aside a trial court’s conviction and acquitted six senior leaders of Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed’s banned Jamat-ud-Dawah (JuD) in a terror financing case.Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the terror outfit responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The anti-terrorism court Lahore in April this year had handed nine-year imprisonment each to JuD senior leaders – Prof. Malik Zafar Iqbal, Yahya Mujahid (JuD spokesperson), Nasarullah, Samiullah and Umar Bahadur - and six months’ jail term to Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki (brother-in-law of Saeed) after an FIR was registered by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of the Punjab Police.The trial court had found these leaders guilty of terror financing. They had been collecting funds and unlawfully financing the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). It had also ordered the confiscation of assets made from funds collected through terrorism financing.“On Saturday LHC’s division bench comprising Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh set aside the trial court’s decision in the CTD’s FIR 18 of 2020 against the six JuD leaders after the prosecution failed to prove the charge against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt,” a court official told PTI.The official said the division bench allowed the petition of the JuD leaders, observing “the statement of the ‘star prosecution witness’ is not reliable as there is no corroboratory evidence.”The counsel of the JuD leaders told the LHC that the Al-Anfaal Trust, of which the petitioners were members, has no “nexus with the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).”The law officer argued that the trust in question was working as a “proxy for the LeT” and the appellants were office-bearers of the trust.The JuD leaders were produced before the LHC amid strict security arrangements. They had been convicted in other terror financing cases and languishing at the Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.LeT founder Saeed has also been convicted in dozens of FIRs registered by the CTD on charges of terror financing. The CTD had registered as many as 41 FIRs against the leaders of the JuD in different cities. The trial courts have so far decided 37 of them.The ATC has sentenced Saeed to collective imprisonment of 36 years on terror finance charges under Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 in five cases so far. Saeed’s jail terms will run concurrently meaning he will not stay in jail for many years.He is serving his term in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail along with other convicted JuD leaders. He was arrested in July, 2019.The US named Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10-million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice. He was listed as a terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-acquits-6-leaders-of-mumbai-attack-mastermind-hafiz-saeed-s-jud-101636218383774.html

The incident, in which the movement of cars behind it was blocked for close to three hours, drew major criticism from several people on the internet.A shopper named Henry took it to popular social media site Reddit, to complain of the incident and some Redditors commenting under the post said that it was the Tesla owner’s fault, while some others blamed the mall administration.“Perfect, a Tesla ran out of battery and stopped at the ramp of a 5 storey car park at Westfield. It has been three hours and counting,” the original poster (u/henrylondon1988) wrote. Along with the post, the user also shared a picture of the car in which the battery had drained and the several other cars queueing behind it.“I know range anxiety is a thing, but there is no excuse for this,” one user commented. “Considering the huge range these cars have, there’s really no excuse for this,” said another. “Westfield even has a large capacity Tesla charging station,” one user pointed out.Meanwhile, one user questioned the management over the incident and wrote, “3 hours and the Westfield management couldn't find a means to tow it off the ramp? Its in their interest to keep traffic flowing.” However, the original poster later said that the car was completely dead and the cars behind it had to reverse their way out of the ramp. “The Tesla is completely dead and it is in parking mode. The management team rumbling about their solution and basically there is nothing they can do. At the end, all the car reversed out from a 5 story winding ramp. Fab day,” Henry later said in one of the comments.According to a news report in the Daily Star, the car was identified as a Tesla Model S. “Westfield London’s car park team assisted the broken down vehicle and guided 10 vehicles that were behind the Tesla around it,” the Daily Star quoted a spokesperson for Westfield as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-excuse-say-irate-shoppers-as-tesla-car-runs-out-of-battery-blocks-car-park-in-london-mall-for-3-hours-101636204118565.html
06-11-2021||World||Pakistan Taliban demand prisoner release as ground for talks with Islamabad: Report||The Tehrik-i Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have demanded the release of a number of prisoners as a ground for talks with Islamabad aimed at achieving a full ceasefire negotiation, according to news agency Reuters. The Afghan Taliban have facilitated two rounds of preliminary talks between TTP and the Pakistan government, and Haqqani Network chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is said to be close to Islamabad, was helping the talks, reported Reuters quoting people familiar with the development.Last month, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that his government was in talks with the TTP as part of a "reconciliation process".Pakistan has banned the terror organisation which has carried several attacks in the country since its formation in 2007. TTP leadership, composed largely of ethnic Pashtun militants, fled to the border areas of eastern Afghanistan after the Pakistan military intensified its operation in 2014. With suspected links to Al Qaeda, Pakistan Taliban seek to establish their harsh interpretation of Sharia law in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.The US state department has also designated the group as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO).TTP commanders have termed the demand of releasing prisoners as confidence building-measure to gauge the sincerity of negotiations."We aren't too hopeful of the immediate results of the talks but our leaders had demanded the release of prisoners if they are sincere in meaningful negotiations," Reuters quoted TTP commander from Afghanistan's Kunar province as saying.The report suggests that the two sides have agreed to not issue any statement supporting or opposing the peace process until the accord is signed.On one hand, Pakistan has long been accused of supporting the Afghan Taliban financially, militarily and by providing intelligence inputs in their fight against the Western-back Afghan government which was ousted in August. On the other, it is also wary of the threat posed by the TTP in Pakistan which has a similar motive of establishing an exclusivist set-up of Sunni Pashtuns in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.TTP terrorists have killed and wounded thousands of civilians and personnel of Pakistani security forces but the group was weakened after the Pakistan military's Zarb-e-Azb operation in 2014, reported Reuters.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-taliban-demand-prisoner-release-as-ground-for-talks-with-islamabad-report-101636203980660.html

This is the first visit of a minister from the interim government in Afghanistan after the terrorist group took over the reins of the government in Afghanistan. The news agency also said that Pakistan and Afghanistan are in constant touch to finalise details of the visit.Muttaqi is a senior Taliban leader who was part of the Doha talks last year where the withdrawal of American troops was discussed. People familiar with the developments told the news agency that his visit is part of the ongoing engagements by Pakistan with the Kabul administration.Pakistan, however, clarified that the visit should not be seen as an act of formal recognition of the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan.The news of Muttaqi’s visit comes a week after Pakistan allowed diplomats appointed by the Taliban-led government to take charge of the Afghan embassy and consulates in Pakistan. Though the Imran Khan-led government does not recognise the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan, it continues to maintain diplomatic contact with the nation. Sardar Muhammad Shokaib was appointed as the charge d’affaires in Islamabad by the interim Taliban government.Pakistan in the international forum is vocal regarding constant communication between the Taliban and the international community. On several occasions and global forums, the nation requested the world leaders to maintain relations with Afghanistan. It also recently said that it shares similar concerns like the international community which feels that the Taliban will not allow an inclusive government, protect women’s rights and not allow the Afghan soil to become a haven for terrorism in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-host-taliban-appointed-minister-to-reset-ties-between-neighbours-101636203206629.html

About 59 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been delivered already, covering 88% of those eligible, and about 78% of the total population.The positive aspect of the data revealed that kids rarely fell ill seriously and incidents of death among them were even rarer.Health Canada is currently reviewing a Pfizer vaccine for children under 12, and Tam said it was “working extremely hard to prioritise” the process and an announcement [on its approval for emergency use] could be expected within weeks.Also Read: India asks Canada to list separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice as terrorist entityThat paediatric vaccine for the age group 5 to 11, if approved, will be delivered in smaller doses than those for the rest of the population.The new data was provided as the fourth wave of the pandemic wanes in Canada. The seven-day average for daily infections is at 2,231, which is 5% cent lower than the preceding corresponding period. So far, there have been 1,725,570 Covid-19 cases and 29,095 related deaths in the country, as per latest WHO (World Health Organization) data.Tam said the latest figures suggest “the fourth wave could continue to decline in the coming weeks if transmission does not increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highest-percentage-of-fresh-covid-19-infections-among-children-in-canada-101636190544149.html

"It's a terrible, terrible accident."Images shared widely online showed several badly burned victims lying on the streets as fire blazed through shops and houses nearby. Reuters was not able immediately to verify the images.Aki-Sawyerr called the videos and photos "harrowing".The mayor said that the extent of the damage was not yet clear, adding that police and her deputy were at the scene to assist disaster management officials."My profound sympathies with families who have lost loved ones and those who have been maimed as a result," President Julius Maada Bio tweeted."My Government will do everything to support affected families."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-91-killed-in-fuel-tanker-blast-in-sierra-leone-capital-says-morgue-101636189425144.html

Further investigations are under way and the case has been referred to court," he said.Khosti did not identify the victims, but a source in Mazar-i-Sharif told AFP that at least one of the dead was a women's rights activist, whose family does not wish to speak to the media.A report on BBC Persian, citing civil society sources, said the four women were friends and colleagues who had hoped to travel to Mazar-i-Sharif airport for a flight out of the country.A rights group source told AFP on condition of anonymity that the women received a call that they thought was an invitation to join an evacuation flight and were picked up by a car, only to be found dead later.The Taliban, who seized power in Afghanistan in August after a 20-year war against the former US-backed government, are a deeply conservative Islamist movement.Under their last period of rule women were banned from public life and since the group's return to government many rights activists have fled the country.Some women who remained have held street protests in Kabul demanding that their rights be respected and that girls be allowed to attend public high schools.Taliban fighters have broken up some of the protests, and the government has threatened to arrest any journalists covering unauthorised gatherings.But the movement's leaders have insisted that their fighters are not authorised to kill activists and have promised that any who do will be punished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-women-killed-in-afghanistan-s-mazar-i-sharif-taliban-confirm-reports-101636188593136.html

Notably, the development comes even as other commodities like petrol, diesel, and sugar in Pakistan continued to become more expensive for the citizens. It forced the Imran Khan-led government on Wednesday to announce the “country's biggest-ever” subsidy package worth ₹120 billion, a move deemed desperate by opposition leaders.How expensive is electricity in Pakistan?According to Geo News, Nepra has increased the price per unit of electricity by ₹1.68 for domestic consumers under the basic tariff, while for commercial and other categories, the price per unit of electricity will be ₹1.39.The new rates have come into effect from November 1. However, some relief can be found in the fact that those consumers who use only up to 200 units of electricity a month will not be affected by the new rates. According to the report, the government expects a profit of ₹135 billion per annum after the recent hike in power prices.This comes after the latest surge in petroleum prices. According to a finance ministry notification, with the ₹8.03 increase, the new price of petrol has been fixed at ₹145.82 per litre, which has come into effect from November 5.Imran Khan criticised over subsidy announcementOn Wednesday, Imran Khan announced "country's biggest-ever" subsidy package worth ₹120 billion, providing the 30 per cent discount on ghee, flour, and pulses to support 130 million people by ebbing away from the impact of inflation. Shortly after Khan's announcement opposition leaders had criticised the move and had called it an “acceptance of the government's failure” and “nothing but a joke”, said the Pakistani publication.Taking to Twitter, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that the PM's package is “too little for 200 million people.” Following suit, former senator and PPP leader Sherry Rehman had termed PM Imran Khan's address to the nation a “bizarre speech”, and called the premier the “Blame Minister of Pakistan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-petrol-and-sugar-electricity-rates-hiked-in-inflation-hit-pakistan-101636179051980.html
06-11-2021||World||Nasa, USGS collect first Landsat 9 light images of Earth. Check here||A joint mission between Nasa and the US Geological Survey (USGS), Landsat 9, which was launched on September 27, 2021, has collected its first light images of Earth.According to a press release by Nasa, all the images, acquired on October 31 provide a preview of how the mission will help people manage vital natural resources and understand the impacts of climate change, adding to Landsat's unparalleled data record that spans nearly 50 years of space-based Earth observation.“Landsat 9's first images capture critical observations about our changing planet and will advance this joint mission of Nasa and the US Geological Survey that provides critical data about Earth's landscapes and coastlines seen from space. This program has the proven power to not only improve lives but also save lives. Nasa will continue to work with USGS to strengthen and improve accessibility to Landsat data so decision-makers in America - and around the world - better understand the devastation of the climate crisis, manage agricultural practices, preserve precious resources and respond more effectively to natural disasters,” said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson.These first light images show Detroit, Michigan, with neighbouring Lake St. Clair, the intersection of cities and beaches along a changing Florida coastline, and images from Navajo Country in Arizona that will add to the wealth of data helping us monitor crop health and manage irrigation water. The new images also provided data about the changing landscapes of the Himalayas in High Mountain Asia and the coastal islands and shorelines of Northern Australia, said the press release.Landsat 9 is similar in design to its predecessor, Landsat 8, which was launched in 2013 and remains in orbit, but features several improvements. The new satellite transmits data with higher radiometric resolution back down to Earth, allowing it to detect more subtle differences, especially over darker areas like water or dense forests. For example, Landsat 9 can differentiate more than 16,000 shades of a given wavelength color; Landsat 7, the satellite being replaced, detects only 256 shades. This increased sensitivity will allow Landsat users to see much more subtle changes than ever before."First light is a big milestone for Landsat users - it's the first chance to really see the kind of quality that Landsat 9 provides. And they look fantastic. When we have Landsat 9 operating in coordination with Landsat 8, it's going to be this wealth of data, allowing us to monitor changes to our home planet every eight days," said Jeff Masek Nasa's Landsat 9 project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center.The release informed that Landsat 9 carries two instruments that capture imagery: the Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2), which detects visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared light in nine wavelengths, and the Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2), which detects thermal radiation in two wavelengths to measure Earth's surface temperatures and its changes. These instruments will provide Landsat 9 users with essential information about crop health, irrigation use, water quality, wildfire severity, deforestation, glacial retreat, urban expansion, and more."The data and images from Landsat 9 are expanding our capability to see how Earth has changed over decades. In a changing climate, continuous and free access to Landsat data, and the other data in Nasa's Earth-observing fleet, help data users, including city planners, farmers, and scientists, plan for the future," said Karen St. Germain, Earth Science Division director at Nasa headquarters in Washington.Nasa's Landsat 9 team is conducting a 100-day check-out period that involves testing the satellite's systems and subsystems and calibrating its instruments in preparation for handing the mission over to USGS in January. USGS will operate Landsat 9 along with Landsat 8, and together the two satellites will collect approximately 1,500 images of Earth's surface every day, covering the globe every eight days, according to the release."The incredible first pictures from the Landsat 9 satellite are a glimpse into the data that will help us make science-based decisions on key issues including water use, wildfire impacts, coral reef degradation, glacier and ice-shelf retreat, and tropical deforestation. This historic moment is the culmination of our long partnership with Nasa on Landsat 9's development, launch, and initial operations, which will better support environmental sustainability, climate change resiliency, and economic growth - all while expanding an unparalleled record of Earth's changing landscapes," said USGS acting director Dr David Applegate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-usgs-collect-first-landsat-9-light-images-of-earth-check-here-101636177778435.html
06-11-2021||World||India asks Canada to list separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice as terrorist entity||India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) has formally requested Canada to declare the organisation Sikhs for Justice a terrorist entity. NIA interacted with their Canadian law enforcement counterparts this week in Ottawa and gave them information and dossiers to back their case against the front.Hindustan Times has learnt that the request was made earlier this year and the NIA team’s Ottawa visit was meant to substantiate India’s claim that SFJ was fuelling violence in India, particularly in Punjab, as part of its separatist agenda which includes spearheading the Punjab Referendum. SFJ, through its legal counsel Gurpatwant Pannun, has consistently denied any support to violence while pursuing its cause for a separate Khalistan.The NIA team was in Ottawa on Thursday and Friday at the invitation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP and it also “held additional meetings with the International Crime and Counter-terrorism Bureau of Global Affairs Canada and with senior officials from the International Affairs Division of Public Safety Canada, with a view to deepening and expanding India-Canada collaboration on counter-terrorism and interdiction of global terrorist financing,” according to a release issued by India’s High Commission in Ottawa. It is also believed to have met officials of Canada’s Department of Justice.The visit, the release said, was “for better coordinating investigation against entities and individuals suspected of terrorism and to discuss other criminal matters”. The NIA team was led by an inspector general of police and it “held detailed discussions with senior RCMP officials to collate evidence on several ongoing investigations into cases of terrorism and other serious crimes in order to bring about successful prosecution of the accused in both India and Canada.”India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria welcomed the visit and tweeted that the “India-Canada strategic partnership also leads to robust cooperation in investigating crime and terrorism.”A senior Indian official speaking on condition of anonymity said that the Canadian law enforcement was “very responsive” to India’s concerns during the “comprehensive” discussions and a “few other entities” also figured in the talks.Also Read: Canada’s Trudeau extends greetings on Diwali, Bandi Chhor DivasResponding to queries in this regard from the Hindustan Times last week, a spokesperson for Public Safety Canada, the department tasked with such listing, said the government “does not disclose what entities are being considered for listing. The assessment process for listing entities that support or engage in terrorism is on-going and entities are prioritised for listing based on a number of factors, including Canada’s national security interests.”He added that in order to be listed, the entity must meet the test of either having “knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity”, or “knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with such an entity.”While SFJ is headquartered in New York, it remains influential among pro-Khalistan elements in Canada. India banned SFJ last year under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.Public Safety Canada’s currently listed entities includes two Khalistani outfits – Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation, other than groups like the Taliban, Al Qaida and others such as Boko Haram, Haqqani Network, Hizbul Mujahideen, Indian Mujahideen, Islamic State and its offshoots, Jaish-e-Moahammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, among several others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-asks-canada-to-list-separatist-outfit-sikhs-for-justice-as-terrorist-entity-101636178062812.html
06-11-2021||World||China's Communist Party to meet next week, further cement Xi's grip on power||Chinese President Xi Jinping, the uncontested leader of the world's most populous nation, heads a pivotal plenary of the ruling party's top figures next week that will set the tone for his bid for a long-term rule.From Monday to Thursday, some 400 members of the Communist Party's all-powerful Central Committee gather in Beijing behind closed doors.The only such meeting this year paves the way to its 20th party congress next autumn -- at which Xi is widely expected to be handed a third term in office, cementing his position as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.At next week's plenary, top figures will debate a key resolution celebrating the party's main achievements in its 100 years of existence, according to state news agency Xinhua.Analysts say the resolution, only the third of its kind in the party's history, will help Xi shore up his grip on power by setting in stone his vision for China, ahead of the crucial 2022 party congress.Like all meetings of Beijing's secretive top leadership, the event will be held behind closed doors, and most key decisions are made well in advance.China's political meetings are all highly choreographed and open dissent to the official line is extremely rare.‘Natural inheritor’The content has not yet been published in full but the timing of the resolution is key – as was the case with the previous two resolutions.The first, passed under Mao in 1945, helped him cement his authority over the Communist Party four years before it seized power.The second, adopted under Deng Xiaoping in 1981, saw the regime adopt economic reforms and recognise the "mistakes" of Mao's ways.Unlike the previous two, Xi's resolution will not mark a break with the past, Harvard University's Anthony Saich told AFP.“Rather, it is intended to show that Xi is the natural inheritor of a process since the founding of the party that qualifies him to lead in the ‘new era’,” said Saich, an expert on Chinese politics.“The purpose is to consolidate Xi as the natural inheritor of the ‘glorious history’ of the CCP,” he added, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.Saich also said the resolution is likely to mark a step back from Deng's text in that it will be less critical of the Mao era from 1949 to 1976.Under Mao's grip, tens of millions of people starved as the regime sought to force the country into communes.In the decade leading up to his death, he unleashed the Cultural Revolution, an era of violence that scarred the national psyche.Under Deng, the party saw a bid to evade a repeat of Mao's personality cult – if only to ensure continuity of its rule.‘Uncontested’According to dissident political scholar Wu Qiang, who lost his job as a lecturer at Tsinghua University in Beijing over his research, the resolution's approval would mean "that Xi Jinping's authority is uncontested".Wu also believes the plenum will firm China's path back towards a more "controlled, planned" economy -- as seen in Xi's ongoing drive to regulate the country's mammoth enterprises in sectors from tech to real estate.The question of the democratic island of Taiwan -- which sees itself as sovereign but which Beijing claims as its own territory -- could also be on the meeting agenda.Regardless of next week's meeting, Xi's uncontested authority is not in question, according to Carl Minzner, a senior fellow for China studies at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations.“The core issue is: how much higher might he go?” he told AFP.“The tone and content of the resolution will likely give some suggestion as to how Xi seeks to be portrayed,” he said.“As the equal of Mao and Deng? Or merely Mao alone?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-communist-party-to-meet-next-week-further-cement-xi-s-grip-on-power-101636173081481.html
06-11-2021||World||In major win for Biden, US Congress passes historic infrastructure bill||The House on Friday passed the biggest US infrastructure package in decades, marking a victory for President Joe Biden and unleashing $550 billion of fresh spending on roads, bridges, public transit, and other projects in coming years.The vote was 228-206 and sends the legislation to Biden for his signature. Thirteen Republicans supported the bill and six Democrats voted against it, a sign of the intra-party strains that nearly derailed the legislation. It would not have passed without GOP votes.Passage capped a day in which Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to deal with a last-minute standoff between party progressives and moderates that took hours of intense negotiations and the president’s intervention to resolve.Pelosi and Biden, however, were unable to land a House vote at the same time on a more than $1.75 trillion tax and spending package that makes up much of the rest of Biden’s domestic agenda. The House instead approved a procedural measure teeing up a vote after lawmakers return from next week’s break and the Congressional Budget Office delivers a cost analysis. That was a last-minute concession to a small group of moderates who refused to vote for the spending package without the CBO score. Progressives also made a concession by supporting the infrastructure legislation before a vote on the larger spending package. “I’ve spoken to the president a number of times today and the president appreciates that we are working in good faith with our colleagues' agreement,” Representative Pramila Jayapal, head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said. “We’re going to trust each other because the Democratic Party is together on this, we are united that it is important for us to get both bills done.”A statement from the group of moderates including Representatives Stephanie Murphy and Josh Gottheimer said they would commit to voting for the economic package “in its current form” as long as a Congressional Budget Office score is consistent with White House estimates on cost and revenue.The back-and-forth throughout the day and threats from both factions to scuttle any action left some lawmakers frustrated.“We started this day thinking we had a deal, thinking that we were going to cast our votes -- were excited to cast those votes,” Representative Jared Huffman, a progressive from California, said. “And then a small cohort of our colleagues moved the goalposts.”Still, not all of the progressives were ready to go for the deal. The six Democratic “no” votes all were part of a group of progressives often referred to as the squad: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Cori Bush of Missouri, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.“I cannot in good conscience support the infrastructure bill without voting on the President’s transformative agenda first,” Omar said in a statement.The 13 Republican “yes” votes included Fred Upton of Michigan, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, and John Katko of New York.With the vote in doubt for much of the day, Biden made calls to House Democrats and put off plans to leave Washington on Friday for his Delaware home. From the White House, he continued to lobby Democrats well into the night.The public-works bill totals more than $1.2 trillion when routine highway dollars are factored in. Biden has promoted it as a vital step to taking on the challenge of a rising China, and a test of Washington’s policy-making abilities in a time of sharp partisan divides.House Republicans argued that it didn’t focus enough on roads and that passing it would “unlock” the social spending bill, which they said would generate inflation.“The Senate infrastructure bill and the massive tax and spending spree are not the will of the American people. The Democrats’ radical agenda to spend a reckless amount of money will raise costs and make it even harder for people to build a better life,” Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington State Republican, said during floor debate.Passage of H.R.3684 came after Democrats failed to meet two deadlines in September and October to act on the bill, despite personal appeals by the president.Success in breaking an impasse between Democratic moderates and progressives -- who had battled over the elements of the bigger social-spending and tax-increase bill and the timing of enacting the infrastructure one -- may provide a much-needed lift to Biden’s public standing. The president’s ratings have sagged in recent months, with the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, high inflation, and the delta variant surge.Some Democrats blamed losses in statewide elections in Virginia and a close call for the incumbent governor of New Jersey on Tuesday on the failure to enact their promised agenda.Progressives for months had effectively blocked the infrastructure bill, withholding their support -- needed for passage -- to gain leverage over party moderates in the fight over the bigger, Democrats-only bill.The so-called reconciliation bill, providing an expansion of spending on social programs and measures to address climate change along with higher taxes on companies and the wealthy, now totals more than $1.75 trillion, down from an earlier $3.5 trillion.Progressives had insisted on a deal – or even an actual vote – in the Senate on the reconciliation bill before they’d back the infrastructure legislation. With infrastructure passed, the risk is that liberals will no longer have sway over Senate moderates, who have raised doubts about Medicare, paid family leave, methane fees, nicotine taxes, and immigration measures in the other bill.“I think there’s a major concern,” Ocasio-Cortez said.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the legislation would be passed before the Nov. 25 Thanksgiving holiday. In their statement, moderates said they would allow for a vote no later than the week of Nov. 15. Yet that could delay final action into December, when Congress must grapple with a Dec. 3 government funding deadline and raising the debt ceiling, both of which will spark conflict with Republicans. The Senate is all but certain to change the legislation, meaning the House would have to vote again.The Senate had passed the $550 billion infrastructure plan on Aug. 10 on a bipartisan 69 to 30 vote. Nineteen Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined with all 50 senators who caucus with Democrats to support the bill. Among the components of the eight-year public-projects bill:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-major-win-for-biden-us-congress-passes-historic-infrastructure-bill-101636174532811.html

The US has been among the worst-affected countries and one of the top contributors in the daily infection tally.However, the data presented by Ocugen may not be enough for the FDA to grant the request, news agency AFP reported.The study was conducted in India from May to July this year to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the vaccine in the 2-18 age group. Covaxin was evaluated in three age groups: 2-6 years, 6-12 years and 12-18 years and all participants were given two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart.In the clinical trial with 526 children, no serious adverse events or hospitalisations were observed.Pfizer's shot is the only one approved in the United States for children under the age of 18.Covaxin, developed in India by Bharat Biotech, gained emergency approval from the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday and has already been cleared for use in 17 countries.It is one of the four vaccines being used in India in the nationwide inoculation programme. The other three vaccines are Covishield, Sputnik V and the one made by Zydus Cadilla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covaxin-approval-requested-in-us-for-ages-2-18-by-bharat-biotech-s-partner-101636171384750.html

Mirza Ali Ahmadi and his wife Suraya found themselves and their five children on Aug. 19 in a chaotic crowd outside the gates of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan when a US soldier, from over the tall fence, asked if they needed help.Fearing their two-month-old baby Sohail would get crushed in the melee, they handed him to the soldier, thinking they would soon get to the entrance, which was only about 16 feet (5 meters) away.But at that moment, Mirza Ali said, the Taliban - which had swiftly taken over the country as US troops withdrew - began pushing back hundreds of hopeful evacuees. It took the rest of the family more than a half-hour to get to the other side of the airport fence.Once they were inside, Sohail was nowhere to be found.Mirza Ali, who said he worked as a security guard at the US embassy for 10 years, began desperately asking every official he encountered about his baby's whereabouts. He said a military commander told him the airport was too dangerous for a baby and that he might have been taken to a special area for children. But when they got there it was empty."He walked with me all around the airport to search everywhere," Mirza Ali said in an interview through a translator. He said he never got the commander's name, as he didn't speak English and was relying on Afghan colleagues from the embassy to help communicate. Three days went by."I spoke to maybe more than 20 people," he said. "Every officer - military or civilian - I came across I was asking about my baby."He said one of the civilian officials he spoke to told him Sohail might have been evacuated by himself. "They said 'we don't have resources to keep the baby here.'"Mirza Ali, 35, Suraya, 32, and their other children, 17, 9, 6, and 3 years old, were put on an evacuation flight to Qatar and then to Germany and eventually landed in the United States. The family is now at Fort Bliss in Texas with other Afghan refugees waiting to be resettled somewhere in the United States. They have no relatives here.Mirza Ali said he saw other families handing their babies over the Kabul airport fence to soldiers at the same time. One video clip of a small baby in a diaper being hoisted by her arm over razor wire went viral on social media. She was later reunited with her parents.Ever since his baby went missing dates are a blur, Mirza Ali said. Every person he comes across - aid workers, US officials - he tells them about Sohail. "Everyone promises they will do their best, but they are just promises," he said.An Afghan refugee support group created a “Missing Baby” sign with Sohail's picture on it and is circulating it among their networks in the hopes that someone will recognise him.A US government official familiar with the situation said the case had been flagged for all the agencies involved, including the US bases and overseas locations. The child was last seen being handed to a US soldier during the chaos at the Kabul airport but “unfortunately no one can find the child,” the official said.A Department of Defense spokesperson and a spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing resettlement efforts, referred queries on the matter to the State Department, since the separation took place overseas.A State Department spokesperson said the government is working with international partners and the international community "to explore every avenue to locate the child, which includes an international amber alert that was issued through the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children."Suraya, who also spoke through a translator, said she cries most of the time and that her other children are distraught."All I am doing is thinking about my child," Suraya said. "Everyone that is calling me, my mother, my father, my sister, they all comfort me and say 'don't worry, God is kind, your son will be found.'"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-handed-to-us-soldiers-in-chaos-of-afghanistan-airlift-still-missing-101636168462008.html

Overall, during the past four weeks, it has seen a rise of more than 55 per cent in daily cases. It is, therefore, once again at the epicentre of the pandemic,” Kluge noted.The official further laid out two factors which, according to him, have led to a surge in new cases of the viral disease: ease in restrictions and low vaccination.Here are the latest updates on fresh Covid-19 surge in Europe:(1.) With more than 37,000 fresh infections on Friday, Germany saw a record single-day rise for second consecutive day, after 33,949 people tested positive on Thursday. According to the German government, the virus is quickly spreading among those yet to be vaccinated, and has thus requested people to take both doses.(2.) French President Emmanuel Macron will address the country on November 9, as the seven-day average of fresh infections has risen to 6200, as against less than 4200 in early October. On Wednesday, the French government made face masks compulsory for school children in 39 regional departments with high infection rates.(3.) On Friday, Italy saw an increase in its new cases from a day ago though the daily toll came down. There were 6764 new patients as against 5905 on Thursday. There were 51 related fatalities, down from 59 on November 4.(4.) Austria, which logged a near-record 9388 new cases on Friday, has announced that people yet to be fully vaccinated will be prohibited from entering cafes, restaurants and hair saloons. Also, the Austrian government expects a new record rise in cases in the coming days.(5.) Greece, too, has announced prohibitions for those not fully vaccinated. People need to get tested for Covid-19 twice a week. Also, a negative test report will be required to avail services from banks, shops and other establishments.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-raises-alarm-over-fresh-covid-surge-in-europe-all-you-need-to-know-101636165894157.html

Akhundzada has been the spiritual chief of the Islamist movement since 2016 but has remained a reclusive figure, even after his group seized power in Afghanistan in August.In a rare written public statement, Akhundzada has urged Taliban commanders to purge their ranks."All those elders of their groups must look inside their ranks and see if there is any unknown entity working against the will of the government, which must be eradicated as soon as possible," Akhundzada said in the statement tweeted out by multiple Taliban accounts."Whatever wrong happens, the elder will be responsible for the consequences of the actions in this world and in the afterlife," he further warned in the statement.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August (completed their military campaign by capturing the presidential tower in Kabul on August 15) just days before American troops left the country as agreed in a peace deal.Since taking over, the Taliban have issued multiple diktats reminding of their old rule when the group ruled with iron fist and suppressed any voice of resistance.As the Taliban government formed, the group was forced to recruit former foes, allied Islamist militants and young madrassa students.Now that it is the government, the movement faces attacks in its turn from hardline factions like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).The terror group claimed responsibility for an attak on a military hospital in Kabul last week in which 19 people were killed. Then there are instances where members of the Taliban have been blamed for killings, denting the group's promise of re-establishing "stability and security" in the war-torn country.In his statement, Akhundzada said Taliban unit commanders must take the time to sit down with their recruits to "try to work on their manners and behaviour so that these mujahideen can work better for his leader."Akhundzada maintains a low-profile and often gives spiritual message to the members of the group. Last month, there were rumours about his death in a clash between two factions of the Taliban. But, a few days later, Akhundzada made a public appearance in Kadahar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-message-to-taliban-commanders-akhundzada-warns-against-infiltrators-101636167078501.html
06-11-2021||World||Chinese spy convicted for plotting to steal US aerospace secrets||A spy for the Chinese ministry of state security has been convicted by a federal jury of plotting to steal trade secrets from several US aviation and aerospace companies, the justice department said on Friday.Yanjun Xu, the first Chinese operative extradited to the United States for trial, was convicted of two counts of conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage, in addition to a count of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft and two counts of attempted theft of trade secrets.The ruling means Yanjun could face up to 60 years in prison total for all violations and fines totaling more than $5 million, according to a press release. He will be sentenced by a federal district court judge.In a statement, FBI assistant director Alan Kohler Jr. said the bureau was working with dozens of US agencies to share information and resources to combat operations by the People's Republic of China.“For those who doubt the real goals of the PRC, this should be a wake-up call; they are stealing American technology to benefit their economy and military,” he said.Going back as far as 2013, Yanjun was accused of using multiple aliases to carry out economic espionage and steal trade secrets on behalf of China. Multiple US aviation and aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, a unit of General Electric Co, were his targets, the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-spy-convicted-for-plotting-to-steal-us-aerospace-secrets-101636160272508.html

06-11-2021||World||UK allows early booking of booster shots to ramp up vaccine rollout||Britain's health ministry on Saturday said it would open up bookings for booster shots a month before people were eligible to receive the shots to help speed up the rollout ahead of the challenging winter months.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is relying on booster doses as a major plank of his plan to avoid lockdown this winter through COVID-19 vaccines rather than social distancing rules or mask mandates, but has been criticised for a slow start to the programme.Around 3 in 5 eligible over-50s have had booster shots in England, with more than 9 million people getting booster doses in Britain overall so far.Over-50s and vulnerable people will still become eligible for their booster shots 6 months after their second dose. But from Monday, they can book the appointment after five months.Currently, people can only book the appointment six months after their second dose."This will accelerate the booster programme, ensure the NHS is able to vaccinate people as quickly as possible, and importantly help more people maintain protection against COVID-19 as we know immunity will dip over time," Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who sets policy in England, said.The health ministry said that the winter would be challenging for the National Health Service (NHS), owing to increased spread of other seasonal viruses such as flu.Britain is currently reporting an average of 40,000 new cases each day. Even though vaccines have greatly reduced deaths from COVID, doctors are warning that pressures are building inside hospitals.Johnson has so far resisted calls for a "Plan B" involving mask mandates, vaccine passes and work-from-home directives, and Javid has said that while the NHS faces "huge" pressure, it is not currently unsustainable pressure."COVID-19 vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and your family ahead of a challenging winter and this change to the booking system will make it as easy as possible for people to book their booster jabs," Javid said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-allows-early-booking-of-booster-shots-to-ramp-up-vaccine-rollout-101636156972252.html
06-11-2021||World||Afghan baby handed to US soldiers amid chaos at Kabul airport still missing||It was a split second decision. Mirza Ali Ahmadi and his wife Suraya found themselves and their five children on Aug. 19 in a chaotic crowd outside the gates of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan when a U.S. soldier, from over the tall fence, asked if they needed help.Fearing their two-month old baby Sohail would get crushed in the melee, they handed him to the soldier, thinking they would soon get to the entrance, which was only about 16 feet (5 meters) away.But at that moment, Mirza Ali said, the Taliban - which had swiftly taken over the country as U.S. troops withdrew - began pushing back hundreds of hopeful evacuees. It took the rest of the family more than a half hour to get to the other side of the airport fence.Once they were inside, Sohail was nowhere to be found.Mirza Ali, who said he worked as a security guard at the U.S embassy for 10 years, began desperately asking every official he encountered about his baby's whereabouts. He said a military commander told him the airport was too dangerous for a baby and that he might have been taken to a special area for children. But when they got there it was empty."He walked with me all around the airport to search everywhere," Mirza Ali said in an interview through a translator. He said he never got the commander's name, as he didn't speak English and was relying on Afghan colleagues from the embassy to help communicate. Three days went by."I spoke to maybe more than 20 people," he said. "Every officer - military or civilian - I came across I was asking about my baby."He said one of the civilian officials he spoke to told him Sohail might have been evacuated by himself. "They said 'we don't have resources to keep the baby here.'"Mirza Ali, 35, Suraya, 32, and their other children, 17, 9, 6 and 3 years old, were put on an evacuation flight to Qatar and then to Germany and eventually landed in the United States. The family is now at Fort Bliss in Texas with other Afghan refugees waiting to be resettled somewhere in the United States. They have no relatives here.Mirza Ali said he saw other families handing their babies over the Kabul airport fence to soldiers at the same time. One video clip of a small baby in a diaper being hoisted by her arm over razor wire went viral on social media. She was later reunited with her parents.Ever since his baby went missing dates are a blur, Mirza Ali said. Every person he comes across - aid workers, U.S. officials - he tells them about Sohail. "Everyone promises they will do their best, but they are just promises," he said.An Afghan refugee support group created a "Missing Baby" sign with Sohail's picture on it and are circulating it among their networks in the hopes that someone will recognize him.A U.S. government official familiar with the situation said the case had been flagged for all the agencies involved, including the U.S. bases and overseas locations. The child was last seen being handed to a U.S. soldier during the chaos at the Kabul airport but "unfortunately no one can find the child," the official said.A Department of Defense spokesperson and a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing resettlement efforts, referred queries on the matter to the State Department, since the separation took place overseas.A State Department spokesperson said the government is working with international partners and the international community "to explore every avenue to locate the child, which includes an international amber alert that was issued through the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children."Suraya, who also spoke through a translator, said she cries most of the time and that her other children are distraught."All I am doing is thinking about my child," Suraya said.

Victims often describe a range of unusual physical sensations after hearing strange sounds.A flight carrying Vice-President Kamala Harris to Vietnam from Singapore in August was delayed by a few hours due to concerns about one such incident.$10mn reward to catch DarkSide hackersThe United States government on Thursday announced a $10mn reward for help finding leaders of the high-profile ransomware gang DarkSide, authorities’ latest try at combating spiking cyber-extortion attacks.Washington blamed the Russia-based group for the online assault that forced the shutdown of the largest oil pipeline in the eastern US in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-havana-syndrome-probe-101636142629991.html

06-11-2021||World||CO2 emissions to rebound in 2022||Global CO2 emissions are set to rebound to pre-pandemic levels next year, according to an assessment published on Thursday as countries signed up to fossil-fuel cutting pledges criticised as too vague by campaigners.The grim emissions assessment was billed as a “reality check” for nations gathered at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, seen as a last chance to halt catastrophic climate crisis.Moderate progress this week was checked by the release of the Global Carbon Project’s annual report, which showed that emissions from gas and coal will rise in 2021 by more than they dropped during the pandemic.It suggested CO2 emissions could eclipse the 40-billion-tonne record set in 2019, which some have predicted - and many hoped - would be a peak.China alone will account for 31% of global emissions this year as it seeks to power its economy past Covid-19, the report said.“This report is a reality check,” co-author Corinne Le Quere, a professor of climate change science at Britain’s University of East Anglia, told AFP.“It shows what’s happening in the real world while we are here in Glasgow talking about tackling climate change.”The report came as two pledges from nations and finance institutions opened a path to accelerated movement away from dirty energy.Twenty countries, including major funders the US and Canada, vowed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022”.Unabated fossil fuel projects are those that do not deploy technology to absorb the carbon pollution they produce.China, South Korea and Japan - all major overseas fossil fuel funders - did not sign on, even though these countries have separately made similar pledges.While ending international funding is seen as a boost to the COP26 summit and key to keeping the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels, even more crucial is quickly drawing down domestic use of coal, by far the dirtiest fossil fuel.Host Britain announced that more than 40 countries had signed up to a commitment to phase out coal use within their borders within decades.Among the signatories were South Korea, Indonesia and Poland - all among the top 10 globally in terms of coal-fired power capacity. COP26 organisers say that 23 countries had promised for the first time to end their coal use, though several of these nations, including Poland, do in fact have pre-standing phase-out commitments.Smog engulfs BeijingHighways and school playgrounds in Beijing were closed on Friday due to heavy pollution, as China ramps up coal production and faces scrutiny of its environmental record at make-or-break international climate talks.A thick haze of smog blanketed swathes of northern China on Friday, with visibility in some areas reduced to less than 200 metres (yards), according to the country’s weather forecaster.Schools in the capital - which will host the Winter Olympics in February - were ordered to stop physical education classes and outdoor activities.Stretches of highways to major cities including Shanghai, Tianjin and Harbin were closed due to poor visibility.Pollutants detected by a monitoring station at the US embassy in Beijing reached levels defined as “very unhealthy” for the general population.Thunberg brands UN climate summit ‘a failure’Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg on Friday branded the UN climate summit in Glasgow a “failure” after a week of negotiations produced what some experts have called vague promises to cut emissions.“It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure,” Thunberg told thousands of youth protesters at a march in the Scottish city.She called the COP26 talks “a two-week long celebration of business as usual and ‘blah, blah, blah’”. “This is no longer a climate conference. This is now a global greenwashing festival,” Thunberg told cheering crowds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/co2-emissions-to-rebound-in-2022-101636139418548.html

06-11-2021||India||Haryana private sector quota law to take effect from Jan 15||CHANDIGARH One year after the state assembly passed it, the BJP-JJP government in Haryana on Saturday ordered that the law providing for 75% reservation for locals in private sector jobs come into force from January 15 next year.The Haryana assembly passed the legislation titled the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill on November 5 last year, and the governor gave his assent to the bill on March 2 this year.“In exercise of the powers conferred under section 3 of the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 (3 of 2021), the Governor of Haryana hereby specifies the 15th day of January 2022 for the purpose of said sub-sections,” said the state labour department in a notification.The delay in implementation of the law was on account of framing of the rules, an official said on condition of anonymity. The law provides for 75% reservation in private sector jobs to those having a resident certificate (domicile).The law will be applicable for a period of 10 years. The state government also relaxed the residency (domicile) requirement from 15 to five years for a person to get a bona fide resident certificate in the state to provide some flexibility to the private companies in hiring.The state government on Saturday also reduced the upper limit of gross monthly salary for jobs which will come under the ambit of the private sector job quota law. As per the official notification, jobs with a gross monthly salary of not more than ₹30,000 will be up for hiring from among local candidates. The bill passed by the assembly last year capped the gross monthly wages for jobs available for hiring at ₹50,000.However, following feedback from industrial houses and entrepreneurs, the state government decided to reduce the salary cap, people aware of the matter said.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the need of the hour is to create a harmonious environment for industry as well as the youth along with creating the right balance between the progress of industries and the economy.With the Haryana government notifying the law, India Inc on Saturday called for a re-look at the legislation, saying it could lead to multinational firms moving out of the state. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said: “At a time when it is important to attract investments at the state level, governments should not impose restrictions on the industry. Reservation affects productivity and industry competitiveness.” “We hope the government re-looks the legislation or at least ensures the rules are fair. As one country, there should be no imposition or restriction,” it added.The private sector job quota move was piloted by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), coalition partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-private-sector-quota-law-to-take-effect-from-jan-15-101636222408709.html

However, no rain was recorded in Mumbai’s Santacruz observatory on Saturday.The unseasonal rainfall was caused by a low-pressure area over the eastern Arabian Sea which, according to the latest IMD bulletin, will move north-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over the same region in the next 24 hours.

They said that Kuamar did not support their protest, which has gained nationwide attention since beginning last year.Activists of the Bharti Kisan Union (Kadian), led by the group’s district president Swaram Dhugga, staged a demonstration and a protest march from a local Shaheed Udham Singh Park to Swaran cinema against Sooryavanshi’s live screening, news agency PTI reported.Some among these farmers tore posters of the movie put up outside the hall, and even condemned Kumar for not speaking up backing the farmers’ protest. Moreover, the protesting farmers added that they will not permit the screening of any of Kumar’s films until the three farm laws, passed by the central government, are repealed.Notably, farmers have been protesting against the farm laws that they claim will take away their liberty at selling harvests and will give more control to corporates. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre has consistently maintained its stand of the laws being pro-farmer.The impasse continues despite both parties having as many as 11 rounds of talks.Also Read | Will occupy govt offices if evicted from protest sites: Rakesh TikaitThe protesting farmers have been camped at Delhi borders for over 11 months now, and the Delhi Police recently removed barricades from the capital’s Tikri and Ghazipur borders.In the latest update to the matter, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait has given an ultimatum to the Centre, saying that the latter has time till November 26 following which farmers will drive their tractors from their villages to the capital’s borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stop-live-screening-of-akshay-kumar-starrer-sooryavanshi-in-punjab-101636220434364.html

If they put hands on him then their hands will be chopped off: BJP MP Dr Arvind Sharma in Haryana's Rohtak on yday's incident at Kiloi pic.twitter.com/RhhZuq0PGLHis remarks come after Grover and other BJP leaders were held up for hours inside a temple in Rohtak’s Kiloi after several villagers and farmers staged a protest outside on Friday. The BJP held a protest in Rohtak against the Congress, alleging that it was responsible for the incident on Friday.“If any eye is raised against Manish Grover then that eye will be gouged out and if any hand is raised then that hand will be chopped off. Will not spare,” Sharma said, warning Congress and its leader Deepender Hooda. “There is no doubt that the Rohtak Lok Sabha seat was won because of Manish Grover,” Sharma further added.Sharma, while addressing a gathering, also said Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son Deepender Hooda were the reason behind Grover being targeted on Friday as Deepender Hooda lost the Lok Sabha polls because of Grover.The police and the district administration on Friday took hours to calm down the protesters and end the standoff following which the leaders left the premises. A report from PTI said that the protesters, who were mostly farmers, demanded Grover’s apology over an unspecified issue but the deputy superintendent of police said the demonstrators were opposed to the presence of the BJP leaders in Kiloi.Grover and other BJP leaders went to a temple in Kiloi from where they planned to watch Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiling a statue of Adi Shankaracharya at the seer's samadhi in Kedarnath live.Protesting farmers in Haryana over the past year have opposed programmes which are supposed to be attended by BJP leaders and in most cases, they also held protests to raise their opposition to the three farm laws. The groups also opposed programmes organised by BJP coalition partner in Haryana Jannayak Janta Party as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eyes-will-be-gouged-out-hands-chopped-bjp-mp-issues-warning-101636212267755.html

Suresh mother said her daughter was not keeping well and will meet the newsmen on another day. “She is not keeping well. She will meet you all on another day,” her mother Prabha S Suresh said. Many journalists were outside the jail and later her house expecting her to speak up. Earlier her mother said she was innocent and some influential people made her a pawn in their scheme. The Kerala High Court granted bail to Suresh on November 2 after it held that the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) can’t be applied in the smuggling case filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Her release was delayed due to strict bail provisions. Earlier, she was granted bail in cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the customs department. The High Court also quashed Cofeposa (Conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities act 1974) slapped on her on October 10. She is facing six cases, including one for allegedly forging her educational qualifications. The gold smuggling case surfaced in July 2020 after the seizure of 30 kg gold worth ₹15 crore hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments camouflaged as diplomatic baggage in the UAE consulate in the state capital. The case was later handed over to the NIA and it arrested Suresh and her accomplice Sandeep Nair from their hideout in Bengaluru. Five central agencies are probing the case now - NIA, ED, DRI, Customs and Income Tax. When the case surfaced, Suresh was employed at the Space Park of the government-controlled Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited in a plum position. Before this, she was employed at the consulate as the secretary of the consulate in-charge and came close to many political leaders during this tenure. After smuggling cases came up, her B Com degree was also found fake and police registered a separate case against her for forgery. The smuggling case invited enough embarrassment to the left front government after the CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was arrested by the ED after his alleged liaison with Suresh and dollar smuggling case surfaced. Later, he secured bail from the High Court. The Union and state governments locked horns on several occasions over the case and the latter even constituted a judicial commission against the ED, a first of its sort, alleging a bid to implicate many including CM Pinarayi Vijayan but later the HC quashed the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smuggling-accused-swapna-suresh-out-on-bail-after-16-month-jail-101636211427640.html

This was announced here this evening by Prof M V Chandgadkar, honorary secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The selection committee, which met here today (November 6) under the chairmanship of Mr. C.D Gopinath, was unanimous in its choice, he said.Answering questions after the announcement, Prof Chandgadkar said several names came up for consideration but the ultimate choice was unanimous. Prof Chandgadkar said India’s team for the first Test will be announced on the second day of the match between South Zone and the West Indies in Hyderabad beginning on Nov. 16. “That is the programme at present.” he added He said that Mansur Ali Khan had already been told about his selection as captain. The captain will be in Poona tomorrow when the West Indies start their tour with a match against West Zone.Pataudi regains captaincy of India after he was dropped from that position late in 1970. Because of business and other commitments he had written to the Board that he was not available for tours abroad so he was not considered for India’s tours of the West Indies and England in 1971 and also earlier this year for a repeat tour of England, all under the leadership of Ajit Wadekar who has since retired from first-class cricket. Pataudi, however played under Wadekar in three Tests in the home series against England in 1972-73.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-7-1974-mansur-ali-khan-pataudi-is-skipper-for-india-in-all-5-cricket-tests-101636208366463.html

There are studies which say that the administration of booster dose will be an effective measure to prevent Covid infection by maintaining the vaccine efficacy,” news agency PTI reported citing an excerpt from the letter.Also read | Lakshadweep may achieve full Covid-19 vaccination ahead of other states, UTs“At present, the number of active Covid cases in our country is low and under this circumstance on behalf of the medical fraternity, we appeal to you and your good office to issue an early advisory to commence the booster dose vaccination programme for Covid-19 for all healthcare workers and frontline warriors as early as possible,” the body further said.Several other countries such as the US, the UK and other European nations have either rolled out or announced a booster programme against the pandemic. Notably, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) said that the efficiency of vaccine doses decreased over time among healthcare and frontline workers.However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has objected to countries opting for boosters saying several low- and middle-income nations are yet to vaccinate their populations with a first dose. It has also expressed its concerns about global equitable vaccine distribution amid more advanced economies opting for boosters.Meanwhile, concerns about vaccine efficacy among healthcare workers have been around for a while now, given that healthcare workers in the country were the first group to be prioritised for the national inoculation drive against Covid-19 that began back in January this year. However, earlier in September director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Balram Bhargava had said that the immunisation programme should rather focus on administering two doses to all eligible populations than booster doses.“I think, currently I would say that the talk of booster (doses) is not pertinent and I said this last time also. The call of the hour is to give the two-dose vaccination, which we call as full vaccination, covering the entire adult population,” the ICMR chief said on September 30 when asked about booster doses for HCWs.The Union ministry of health and family welfare on the day said that the cumulative number of doses administered under the country's Covid vaccination drive crossed the 108-crore mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-doctors-body-urges-centre-to-start-covid-booster-vaccine-programme-for-healthcare-frontline-workers-101636207633736.html
06-11-2021||India||Congress demands further reduction in excise duty on petrol, diesel||While the government informed that Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection has gone back to pre-pandemic levels, Congress on Saturday demanded a further reduction in the excise duty imposed on petrol and diesel during the pandemic.“The government has been patting its back, boasting that the GST collection has gone back to the pre-pandemic level. You (government) used Covid as an excuse to increase the excise duty on petrol and diesel. Please reduce the excise duty of ₹13 and ₹19 imposed on petrol and diesel respectively during the pandemic,” said Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said at a press conference on SaturdayThis comes days after the government reduced ₹5 and ₹10 on the excise duty on petrol and diesel amid spiralling fuel prices, and urged states to further bring down the rates by reducing Value Added Tax (VAT).Data available from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) in the Union Ministry of Finance showed excise duty collections during April-September 2021 surging beyond ₹1.71 lakh crore, from ₹1.28 lakh crore mop-up in the same period of the previous fiscal.Data available from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) in the Union Ministry of Finance showed excise duty collections during April-September 2021 surging to over ₹1.71 lakh crore, from ₹1.28 lakh crore mop-up in the same period of the previous fiscal.The collection is 79% more than ₹95,930 crore mop-up in April-September 2019 due to the steep hike in excise duty.In light of the new Pentagon report which confirmed China’s incursion into Indian territory, Congress also accused the government of misleading the world in June last year when it gave China a clean chit and demanded an immediate withdrawal of the clean chit.“It has been 17 months since the Prime Minister gave a clean chit to China. The clean chit is a dark chapter in history because it is being used by China across the world because it came from the Prime Minister of the country whose territories are being transgressed by China,” said Khera.Citing the new Pentagon report titled ‘Military and Security Development involving the Peoples’ Republic of China’, Khera said that China has “intruded” 4.5 km within Arunachal Pradesh territory and has constructed dual-purpose villages. He explained “dual-purpose villages” as ones that accommodate not only the civilian population but also act as a cantonment area for the Chinese army.In June 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that the Chinese neither entered the Indian territory nor took any post.Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson, Gopal Krishna Agarwal, alleged that Congress always wants to believe in other countries and has no faith in the domestic institutions. “If the Prime Minister has made a statement then they should understand the sanctity of the institution. They are running after international institutions which are contrary to the domestic institution’s reports, this shows that their commitment lies outside India,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-demands-further-reduction-in-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-101636207706386.html
06-11-2021||India||Studies show pandemic-induced inflation hit urban poor hardest||Inflation, often described as the cruellest tax because it erodes income, has been falling in recent months, but average price rise during and following the peak pandemic has been higher and more broad-based than in previous years, hitting the urban poor harder, two recent studies have shown.Three components of inflation — food, fuel and core inflation i.e. price in all items minus food and fuel — have moved divergently. Food inflation fell significantly from above 5% at the start of the current financial year to 0.7% in September. During the same period, fuel inflation rose from 8% to 13.6%. Core inflation, which leaves out volatile items such as food and fuel, remained sticky near 6%.“Not only did they (inflation in various components) diverge, but their burden also varied by income group, primarily because the share of spending on each of these commodity groups differs across income classes,” said Dharmakirti Joshi chief economist, Crisil Ltd.The bottom line of this is that although broadly everyone experienced the same inflation numbers, some groups – especially the urban poor – felt inflation’s heat more because they spend a larger share of their budgets on items that got costlier, such as fuel.According to the Reserve Bank’s bi-annual Monetary Policy Report for October, mean or average inflation this year has been higher and more broad-based. It has also been very volatile.“These indicate high dispersion of inflation rates in the consumer price index basket, along with a larger number of items experiencing higher inflation rates than in the pre-pandemic period,” the RBI report said.Crisil’s researchers engaged in an interesting study to disaggregate the impact of inflation on different income groups.They segregated the population into three broad groups by expenditure — the bottom 20%, the middle 60% and the top 20% for urban and rural — using data from the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).Then, the expenditure share of each commodity group was mapped with the relevant inflation during the last and this fiscal up to September 2021. They then used these weights to calculate the overall inflation for each class.“We find that the urban poor felt the heat of inflation the most,” Joshi said.While the overall inflation declined for all income classes in FY2021-22 compared with the last fiscal year, the urban poor (bottom 20%) bore the heaviest brunt in both periods.The key culprits were fuel and food costs, which have the highest weights for the bottom 20% of the urban poor. Urban inflation in these two commodity components was higher than that in rural areas.The researchers used the NSSO’s Consumer Expenditure Survey of 2011-12, which offers the latest available data on monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) across income classes. This data has also been used to calculate weights for the latest consumer price index 2011-12 series.“The relatively higher food and fuel inflation in urban areas have meant the poor in that geography are facing more heat than their rural counterparts,” according to the Crisil study.The rural poor did face considerable inflationary pressures too, the study shows. Cereals, fuel and vegetables are the top three spending categories within food for both rural and urban dwellers. The pressure from high fuel inflation may have been offset by lower price rise in food.However, six out of the 10 commodities have seen inflation above 6% in rural areas this fiscal, Crisil Ltd observed. In urban areas, there are five such commodities. “This implies inflationary pressures are still significant for the poor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/studies-show-pandemic-induced-inflation-hit-urban-poor-hardest-101636205966481.html

India’s cumulative vaccination doses administered reached 108 crore on Saturday.“Lakshadweep (99.2 %) is close to achieving full COVID-19 vaccination of its eligible population, while Sikkim has achieved 87.8%, Goa 79.7% and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands 72.2%,” the officials said.The health ministry said that 78.7% of India's adult population received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Among all the states and Union Territories, nine of them have administered the first dose to all its 18-plus age group population.The eligible population in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Dadra and Nagar Haveli have received at least one dose of vaccine. The officials pointed out that more than 36% of the country's around 94 crore adult population have now been administered both doses.The highest number of doses were administered by Uttar Pradesh followed by Maharashtra, West Bengal, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.The ministry wrote to several states and union territories asking them to prioritise administering the second dose to people who have not gotten themselves vaccinated with the second dose even after the prescribed interval between the two doses expired, the officials mentioned above further added.The government has also launched a month-long “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign for house-to-house Covid-19 vaccination of those who are yet to be vaccinated with the first dose and those whose second dose is overdue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-may-achieve-full-covid-19-vaccination-ahead-of-other-states-uts-101636204587334.html

A fire audit had been carried out at the hospital, but all necessary systems were not in place for want of funds, an official claimed. The blaze claimed 11 lives. Most of the patients were senior citizens, and many of them were on ventilator or oxygen, which made the rescue operation more tricky. Amid panic, cries and chaotic scenes, fire brigade personnel broke the window panes and began dousing the flames using water canons, said a civic fire official whose team was the first to reach the spot after the blaze started around 11 am. About 20 coronavirus patients were undergoing treatment in the ICU, he said. There were 15 patients on ventilator or oxygen. "Saving them was the priority. But due to their critical condition, to remove the oxygen support and bring them out was a tough decision," he said. "After discussion, we decided to bring them out anyhow and later put them back on oxygen or other support systems," he added. Also Read | Death toll rises to 11 in Maharashtra hospital fire, ₹5 lakh ex-gratia announcedThere was smoke everywhere, and a senior fire brigade official said that rather than flames, the smoke might have proven more lethal. Most of those who died were aged between 65 to 83, according to hospital officials. After a devastating blaze at a Covid-19 hospital in Nashik earlier this year, a fire audit had been carried out at this hospital. Shankar Misal, Chief Fire officer of Ahmednagar municipal corporation, said they rushed two fire tankers immediately when the call came. "The fire was not that big, but there was smoke all over the place. The patients who died in the incident possibly suffocated due to the smoke and heat inside the ICU," he said. After the recent fire audit, the hospital had been asked to install an effective fire-fighting system including a pipeline and sprinkler system, he said. But the work was incomplete due to "want of funds", though the hospital had fire extinguishers, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smoke-cries-panic-at-maharashtra-hospital-as-fire-engulfed-covid-ward-icu-101636204555678.html

They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle," Yadav had said.Shukla said that Jinnah was responsible for India’s partition, claiming that no Indian would like to see or listen to him. The UP minister said that Yadav’s remark on Jinnah is not a “common incident” and the Samajwadi leader “must clarify as to under which pressure, greed, is he glorifying” Pakistan's first governor-general."I want that Akhilesh Yadav to himself come forward, and get his narco test done," Shukla said, adding that those heaping praises on Jinnah should go to Pakistan.Also Read | Row over SP chief’s ‘Jinnah’ comment, BJP accuses Akhilesh of having ‘Talibani mindset’Shukla’s narco test suggestion comes days after he alleged that the former UP chief minister is getting economic support from Pakistan’s spy agency ISI."Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has become a challenge for the Islamic world.

Deshmukh was presented before a holiday court on Saturday, which sent him to judicial remand till November 19.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) last Monday after 12 hours of questioning. The agency is probing the ₹100 crore extortion case against Deshmukh based on an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The CBI registered the FIR after allegations made by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh, who said that Deshmukh had directed dismissed policeman Sachin Waze to collect ₹100 crore every month from hotels and bars in Mumbai.Waze, meanwhile, was on Saturday sent to police custody till November 13 in the money laundering case. A case of extortion was registered against Waze on July 23. He was dismissed from service in May 2021.Deshmukh has denied all the allegations against him, but had to resign in April after the CBI registered the case.The ED called the 71-year-old politician's son Hrishikesh for questioning on Thursday. The agency had asked Hrishikesh to appear before it on Friday but he did not, said ED officials.On Saturday, Hrishikesh Deshmukh moved the sessions court and filed a petition for anticipatory bail.According to ED, Waze allegedly collected ₹4.7 crore from orchestra bar owners in Mumbai for “smooth functioning of the bars” and gave this money to Deshmukh’s personal assistant Sanjeev Palande who later handed over the money to someone in Nagpur.ED officials said its investigation revealed that through hawala channels, this money was sent to the Delhi-based Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Jain who operated bogus companies. The Jain brothers are alleged to have diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the Deshmukh family.ED officials suspect that the Jain brothers were acting on instructions of Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh Deshmukh and want to record his statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anil-deshmukh-sent-to-judicial-custody-till-nov-19-in-money-laundering-case-101636191397930.html

The team, headed by Sanjay Kumar Singh, the deputy director-general of the Narcotics Control Bureau, comprising officials from NCB headquarters in Delhi has already reached Mumbai on Saturday. The decision to shift six cases to this special team was an administrative decision, taken at a time when Sameer Wankhede is facing an internal vigilance probe on extortion charges and other irregularities, levelled against him Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik."We've taken over a group of six cases. He (Sameer Wankhede) is the zonal director of Mumbai, we'll definitely take his assistance in the investigation," Sanjay Kumar Singh said in Mumbai.  "We've taken over a group of 6 cases. He (Sameer Wankhede) is the zonal director of Mumbai, we'll definitely take his assistance in the investigation," said Narcotics Control Bureau's DDG Sanjay Kumar Singh in Mumbai pic.twitter.com/egkhfHQFhfThe central agency on Friday issued a statement and clarified that the transfer of the case has been precipitated because of the "national and international ramifications" the cases have. "No officer or officers have been removed from their present roles and they will continue to assist the operations branch investigation as required until any specific orders are issued to the contrary," it said.Is it a message to Sameer Wankhede?The timing of the transfer of these crucial cases raises the question as to whether the central agency is conveying any message to embattled Sameer Wankhede. As the decision was announced on Friday, Wankhede said, "I've not been removed from the investigation. It was my writ petition in court that the matter should be probed by a central agency. So Aryan case and Sameer Khan case are being probed by Delhi NCB's SIT. It's coordination between NCB teams of Delhi and Mumbai."An NCB official explained to ANI that Sameer Wankhede is a deputy inspector general-rank officer of the central agency and is too senior to become an investigating officer of any case. "He/She just supervises any investigation of the zone. So it's baseless to say that Sameer Wankhede will cease to investigate these six cases.

The I-T department had on October 27, carried out searches at the bank and the residence of its chairman and a director. Analysis of data available on the Core Banking Solutions (CBS) system of the bank and the statements of key persons recorded during the search has revealed glaring irregularities in opening of several bank accounts, the department said in a release on Saturday. More than 1200 new bank accounts were found to have been opened in the said branch without PAN (Permanent Account Number) and mandatory KYC (Know Your Customer) details, said the department. It has, however, not revealed the name of the bank or its chairman or the director concerned. “The investigations have revealed that these bank accounts were opened without following KYC norms and all account opening forms were filled in by the bank staff who also put their signatures or thumb impressions (on the account opening forms),” said the I-T release. “In these accounts, multiple cash deposits, each of exact denomination of ₹1.9 lakh, were made totalling ₹53.72 crore. Out of these, more than 700 identified bank accounts were opened in a series, where cash deposits of more than ₹34.10 crore were made within seven days of opening of accounts, mainly between August 2020 and May 2021,” said the release. “These deposits have been structured to avoid mandatory PAN requirement for cash deposits of over ₹2 lakh. The money was subsequently converted into fixed deposits in the same branch,” it added. Also Read: ₹63 lakh cash, jewellery found after raids on dry fruits traders The tax department said it made enquiries in a few cases of such account holders and found that these persons were not aware of the cash deposits made in accounts opened in their names and categorically denied any knowledge about the accounts. “The chairman, CMD and the manager of the bank could not explain the source of cash deposits and accepted that these were done at the behest of one of the directors of the bank, a prominent local businessman engaged in trading of grains. On the basis of the evidence gathered and statements recorded, the entire amount of ₹53.72 crore has been restrained,” stated Surabhi Ahluwalia, commissioner of I-T (media and technical policy) and official spokesperson, Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-detects-irregularities-in-maharashtra-bank-freezes-rs-53-72-crore-101636189223972.html

The meeting will take place in ‘hybrid’ form, with some attendees to be present physically, while others will attend virtually.The meeting assumes significance as it comes just a few months before five states, including four ruled by the BJP, are likely to go to polls, in February-March next year. Of these, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur have BJP governments, while Punjab is the only Congress-ruled state. In late 2022, assembly elections will take place in two more states with BJP governments, including PM Modi and home minister Shah's home state, Gujarat, and Himachal Pradesh.The meeting assumes significance also because of the party's mixed performance in the recently held bypolls for three Lok Sabha and 29 assembly seats across 13 states. The BJP won only one Lok Sabha seat, and lost the other two, including the Mandi parliamentary constituency in poll-bound Himachal. In fact, the opposition Congress completed a clean sweep in the hill state, winning the Mandi seat and three assembly constituencies for which by-elections were held.Also Read | Bypolls an endorsement of incumbent governments : BJPMeanwhile, in West Bengal, the BJP's slide continued as the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) registered ‘unprecedented’ victory in all four assembly seats, while in Karnataka, another BJP-ruled state, the JP Nadda-led party suffered defeat in chief minister Basavaraj Bommai's home district.

The French foreign minister discussed the priorities in the fight against climate change, according to a statement issued by the French embassy."At his meeting with NSA Ajit Doval on the occasion of the 35th Strategic Dialogue in Paris, French FM @JY_LeDrian stressed France's commitment to deepening the Indo-French strategic partnership in all its dimensions," ambassador of France to India Emmanuel Lenain said on Twitter.At his meeting with NSA Ajit Doval on the occasion of the 35th 🇫🇷🇮🇳 Strategic Dialogue in Paris, French FM @JY_LeDrian stressed France's commitment to deepening the Indo-French strategic partnership in all its dimensions.Statement⤵ https://t.co/19s4RiO68d“He underscored the importance of the mutual trust between France and India, as well as that of the Indo-French partnership in working to strengthen multilateralism and defend a free and open Indo-Pacific based on the rule of law,” the statement further said.Both the countries exchanged notes on critical situation in Afghanistan with France as part of European Union holding a divergent view from Britain, which played a key part in the failed Doha political process with the Talban leadership. Today, Afghanistan under Taliban and in the mentorship of Pakistani ISI is headed for a disaster of humongous proportions due to drought like conditions and no governance. Nearly three months after seizing Kabul, no country has recognised the Taliban regime despite being promoted by Pakistan, China, Qatar and Turkey.The French minister called for continued Indo-French coordination, including at the UN Security Council, on Afghanistan, the statement from the embassy said.The two advisors had a detailed discussion on both countries strengthening maritime security with France willing to supply the latest technology in the sub-surface dimensions including underwater drones and state-of-the-art submarines.It is understood that France shared its disappointment over Australia abrogating multi-billion-dollar diesel attack submarine project in favor of nuclear powered and conventionally armed submarines from US under the new AUKUS pact. However, both sides decided that maritime security should be bilaterally cemented with AUKUS running parallel to achieve the larger Indo-Pacific objective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiafrance-to-deepen-maritime-security-talk-afghanistan-101636183975789.html

Also, the idea of creating and removing binaries shall deny them equal rights of children of diverse biological needs. Second, this approach will expose children to unnecessary psychological trauma due to contradictory environments at home and in school,” NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo said in the letter to NCERT.Also Read | CBSE Term 1 Exam 2021: Notice on exam duration and important instructions issued“It is also highlighted in the manual (chapter 3) that teachers are suggested to discuss with students about puberty blockers and its availability for adolescents. Further, the background and qualifications of the members of the drafting committee was not verified,” the NCPCR letter added while commenting on the manual.NCPCR asked NCERT to “take appropriate action to rectifying the anomalies in the document”, and added that “antecedents of the members of the drafting committee may be verified”.On Friday, the manual was not available on the NCERT’s website and no immediate comment was provided by the commission. However, a senior official at the ministry of education, requesting anonymity, said, “The NCERT has informed the ministry that the document was still under process and it was inadvertently uploaded on the website. The council will provide the required response to the NCPCR. The manual has been drafted by the department of gender studies at the NCERT with all due considerations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncert-drops-transgender-inclusion-manual-from-website-after-ncpcr-rap-101636169182949.html
06-11-2021||India||'Party decides who fights from where': Adityanath on contesting UP polls||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said that he will contest the next year's assembly elections if his party decides so. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader is currently a member of the UP Legislative Council."I have always contested elections and I will contest from wherever the party will say," Adityanath said on Friday."The party has a parliamentary board and it decides who will contest from where," he added.Adityanath said the BJP government has done whatever the party promised in the run-up to the last assembly polls in 2017.On the law and order situation, he said that the state has set an example and during the past over four years there was no riot and all festivals, including Diwali, were celebrated peacefully.The remarks were made a day after BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh said the party wil fight the 2022 assembly polls under the leadership of Adityanath.The assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh is among the crucial state polls for the BJP, which recently suffered a drubbing in party-ruled Himachal Pradesh, even losing the Mandi Lok Sabha seat, which is chief minister Jairam Thakur's home turf.The BJP is know to take tough decisions, and in case of other states like Gujarat and Uttarakhand - which will also go to polls in 2022 - it changed the chief ministers. While Bhupendra Patel replaced Vijay Rupani in Gujarat in September, Tirath Sigh Rawat was switched with Pushkar Singh Dhami in Uttarakhand in July.The BJP has started preparations for UP months in advance. In October, the party's central leadership held a crucial meeting with the Uttar Pradesh unit on next year's assembly polls. The BJP leadership discussed the party's election agenda for the coming 100 days and asked the state unit to reach out to the people with positive message.The BJP has prepared a presentation listing out the welfare schemes that the government has initiated and needed to be conveyed to the voters.The meeting - attended by BJP general secretary BL Santhosh, Uttar Pradesh in-charge Radha Mohan Singh, state chief Swantantra Dev Singh and Uttar Pradesh election in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan - also discussed the allies who they will take along for the polls.The schedule of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections is expected to be announced in January. The BJP came back to power in the state in the 2017 assembly polls bagging 312 seats. The party secured a 39.67 per cent vote share in the elections. The Samajwadi Party got 47 seats, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) 19, and Congress managed 7 seats in the last assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/party-decides-who-fights-from-where-adityanath-on-contesting-up-polls-101636168797314.html

06-11-2021||India||Cochin airport, first to run fully on solar power, to launch hydro project today||The Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), which is the world's first fully solar-powered airport, will on Saturday commission its own hydroelectric project, now taking pioneering strides in the production of sustainable energy. With the hydro plant commissioned, CIAL aims to provide power to the KSEB grid from its plant at Arippara near Kozhikode.The hydroelectric plant, which is estimated to generate 14 million units of power each year, will be inaugurated at 11am today by Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Also Read | CIAL to commission its 1st hydropower projectAccording to CIAL, the hydroelectric plant is a “run-of-river” project, which uses the natural downward flow of rivers and microturbine generators to capture the kinetic energy carried by water. CIAL constructed a weir dam across the Iruvazhinji River and hydro-mechanical and electro-mechanical systems at Arippara, near Kodencheri in Kozhikode district.Being a run-of-river project, the CIAL small hydro project (SHP) works on limited storage of water causing no adverse effect on the environment, an official statement said. The scheme envisages the construction of an overflow type weir across the river, which diverts the water to an intake pool from where the intake structure and connected water conductor system (WCS) start.Also Read | Cochin airport gets global award for quality of service“A surge tank was constructed to moderate the water flow during load acceptance and load rejection time,” a statement said. “A penstock feeds two machines each of 2.25 MW capacity. A powerhouse, with horizontal turbines, is installed at the right bank of the river with an installed capacity of 4.5MW.” The site lies in Nellipoyil Village near Kodencheri in Kozhikode district at a distance of 45 km from Kozhikode City. The airport also purchased five acres of land from 32 residents in the area, the total project costing about ₹52 crore.The powerhouse is expected to generate around 1.08 lakh units of power a day during peak flow day and it is estimated that the plant could be operational in full capacity for 130 days in a year.“When the country is deliberating on power crisis, it is the leadership and guidance of the chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, as the Chairman of CIAL, which turned out to be decisive to speed up the project implementation,” S Suhas, the Managing Director of CIAL, said in a statement. “We are sure that, this will impart further momentum to set up such hydro projects across the state which has 44 rivers and numerous streams.” (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cochin-airport-first-to-run-fully-on-solar-power-to-launch-hydro-project-today-101636156037205.html

Around 12 empty cartridges were found on the crime scene. The deceased have been identified as Arif Khan of Chohala and Mohammad Sabar of Chak Mohammad Yar of RS Pura. Sabar’s brother Babar sustained critical injuries and was shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital in Jammu. “Initial investigations suggest that two policemen--Harvinder Singh of IRP (Indian Reserve Police) and Sadiq, a suspended cop, are involved in the attack. They are on the run,” said a senior police officer. “The attackers, who had come in a Mahindra Thar vehicle, intercepted the trio in their Scorpio at Kothe Chak Harnia village near the international border. The cops opened fire from their AK-47 rifles. They fired 12 rounds and as a result Arif Khan and Mohammad Sabar died on the spot. Babar was critically injured in the attack,” he added. The attackers left their Thar at the crime scene and fled in Scorpio car of the victims. An AK-47 rifle, four sharp edged weapons, a hockey stick, and police uniform were also recovered from the Thar. “Harvinder Singh of IRP had been suspended from his job but was reinstated recently,” said the officer. He informed that prima facie dispute over drug money seemed to be the reason behind the attack. The victims were also carrying sharp-edged weapons with them. The officer informed that 19 FIRs stand registered against Babar for various crimes in different police stations of Jammu. “Similarly, one FIR was registered against Arif Khan and four FIRs were registered against Mohammad Sabar,” he said. When contacted, Jammu district police chief SSP Chandan Kohli said, “An FIR has been lodged and a special investigation team (SIT) headed by SP Headquarters Ramnish Gupta has been constituted by me. The investigation has been set into motion.” Soon after the crime senior officers, including the SSP, visited the crime scene and took stock of the shootout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-killed-1-hurt-in-shootout-in-jammu-s-arnia-cops-on-suspect-list-101636145659036.html
06-11-2021||India||Centre, insurance firms willing to settle claims via mediation, SC told||The Union government and insurance companies have agreed to settle payment of compensation to victims of road accidents through mediation that may at best take over three months, the Supreme Court was told last week.A report on the proposed mechanism of mediation suggested that “trained mediators” engage both the claimant and the insurance company to arrive at a “just and reasonable” compensation and ensure an amicable settlement.The report, prepared by additional solicitor general (ASG) Jayant Sud, was presented before a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh on October 26. The court will consider the suggestions during the next hearing on November 16.The court was informed about the proposed mechanism at a time it was considering passing directions for speedy resolution of cases pending under the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT). As per the National Judicial Data Grid, nearly 25% of over 7.36 lakh MACT cases remained in the trial stage for more than three years. Of the total, at least 650 have been delayed for over two decades.In his report, Sud highlighted how the alarming situation of pendency of motor accident claims has choked the entire justice delivery system.“...further directions may be passed for not only speedy disposal of motor accident claims but also to ensure that the award amount reaches the victims expeditiously and without any deductions,” the report said.“Settling dispute through mediation is an excellent thing but you need trained mediators who can provide ‘fair and just compensation’. It should not be an attempt to coerce people into accepting whatever the insurance company has to offer,” Supreme Court advocate Gaurav Agrawal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-insurance-firms-willing-to-settle-claims-via-mediation-sc-told-101636143364367.html
06-11-2021||India||BJP questions Opposition ruled states for not cutting excise on fuel prices||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday attacked opposition parties, including the Congress, for not announcing cuts in fuel prices in states ruled by them even as those governed by it had emulated the Centre to effect substantial reductions in petrol and diesel rates by up to ₹13.43 and ₹19.61 a litre, respectively.The Union government on Wednesday announced a reduction in central levies on petrol by ₹5 a litre and diesel by ₹10 a litre from Thursday amid spiralling fuel prices, and urged states to further bring down the rates by reducing VAT (value added tax).BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia lashed out at the Congress, Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for not announcing tax cuts. “In Uttar Pradesh, chief minister, Yogi Adityanath has lowered the prices of petrol and diesel by ₹12, similarly in Gujarat and Assam prices have been reduced by ₹7. This is in addition to the cuts that were announced by the Union government,” Bhatia said, addressing the media on Friday.According to data compiled by state-run oil companies as of Friday evening, VAT remained unchanged in 14 states and Union territories -- Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Meghalaya, Andaman & Nicobar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, and Rajasthan. However, at night, Odisha announced a ₹3 per litre reduction in VAT on both petrol and diesel from midnight.A bunch of BJP rules states announced cuts ranging between ₹5 and ₹10. The announcement made on the eve of Diwali is perceived to have been done in view of the bypoll results announced on Tuesday that were a mixed bag for the BJP.“In Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Rajasthan people want to know why such steps have not been taken by the state governments…The steps that were taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and emulated by BJP-ruled states are not being implemented by other governments,” Bhatia said.While Uttarakhand, a BJP-ruled state, reduced VAT on petrol by 81 paise per litre, it did not cut VAT on diesel, according to the data. VAT reduction on diesel was a symbolic 31 paise per litre in Haryana, where the state took a ₹5.78 a litre revenue hit on petrol.Earlier in the day, the Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala posted a scathing tweet in Hindi, alleging that the Haryana government was conning the public by reducing VAT on petrol while increasing it on diesel. “Have a look at what the ‘loot jeevi’ Khattar-Dushyant government is up to. In Haryana, the VAT on petrol has been reduced by ₹1.12 and it has been raised on diesel by ₹1.78. The people of the state know these lies and understand them. Shame on such an anti-people government,” Surjewala tweeted, also sharing the notification issued by the excise department.Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien took a jibe at government’s latest move. He posted a wordplay of a famous quote from former US president Abraham Lincoln, switching “fool” with “fuel”. “You can fuel all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fuel all the people all the time,” the senior TMC leader said in a tweet, while sharing a graph comparing the prices of crude oil, petrol and diesel in January 2014 and November 2021.Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena, which shares power with the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress in Maharashtra, criticised the reduction in petrol price by ₹5 as too little. Party spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Thursday said that the Centre should have reduced it by “at least ₹25 per litre to provide relief to people… They (Centre) realised that prices need to be slashed after they lost the bypolls”.Bhatia made a reference to Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot’s tweet and said opposition-ruled states need to accept that they have the responsibility towards people, just as they have a share in the collections from tax.On Thursday, Gehlot, in a tweet, said, “With the reduction of excise duty by the Centre, the VAT levied by the states is automatically reduced in the same proportion. We demand that the Centre should further reduce excise duty to reduce inflation.”While central excise is specific at ₹27.9 per litre on petrol and ₹21.8 on diesel, VAT rates imposed by states are ad valorem, giving them windfall gains when international oil prices surge.There are two main reasons for high petrol and diesel rates in India – international oil price surge (India imports about 85% oil it processes) and high central and state levies. Through 2020, as global crude prices plunged (below $20 a barrel in April last year), the central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States, too, followed suit as their revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the central excise and state VAT (which is ad valorem) on petrol and diesel went up to 53% and 46.9% of their respective retail prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-opposition-exchange-barbs-over-reduction-of-petrol-diesel-rates-101636143071177.html

06-11-2021||India||No plan to cut fuel tax, says Kerala FM||Two days after the central government slashed excise duty on petrol and diesel, the Kerala government on Friday reiterated that it has no plan to cut sales tax on fuel considering the state’s poor financial situation.The state government had introduced many welfare programmes during peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and they will be affected if tax on fuel was cut, Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal told reporters here. He said the Centre was forced to take such a decision in the wake of setbacks the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party suffered in recent by-elections.“There is no need to reduce tax in Kerala. When the Centre reduced ₹10 and ₹5 for diesel and petrol, it has actually been reduced by ₹12.30 and ₹6.56 in Kerala due to the tax structure. The value-based structure is formulated in the state like this,” he said. He also criticised the Congress and BJP for demanding further tax cut.“Both behave as if the Centre did a big thing, but it is not. After hiking the price for almost every day, it made a small reduction. In last seven years, it increased tax by over ₹31 but reduction was only slight,” Balagopal said, adding that states were not given the share of revenue collected through additional tax.The minister said his government’s sales tax collection was not in tune with the soaring government expenditure so it can’t take any risk now.After the Pinarayi Vijayan government came to power in the state in 2016, he said the state has not increased the fuel tax.The Kerala assembly on Tuesday witnessed a war of words between the CPI(M)-led ruling front and the Congress-headed opposition over frequent fuel price hike in the country and the latter walked out of the House terming it as “state-sponsored tax terrorism.” Though the LDF government maintained that it was the Centre and not the state government which was responsible for the fuel price hike, the UDF members wanted it to forego the additional tax revenue generated on its sales for the sake of struggling commoners.

06-11-2021||India||Stalin reaches out to indigenous communities after tribal woman barred from having food at temple||As the country celebrated Diwali on Thursday, chief minister MK Stalin reached out to indigenous communities with festival gifts such as land deeds and welfare measures in Tamil Nadu’s Poonjeri village.This came following a series of events where Ashwini (goes by a single name) -- a woman who belongs to the Narikurava community -- had raised the issue of discrimination via a video after her community was prevented from having Annadhanam (concept of temples offering free food for the poor) along with others at a temple (Sthalasayana Perumal) in Mamallapuram, 50 km from Chennai, about two weeks ago.Following the discriminatory incident, the minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, PK Sekar Babu, had a feast for lunch with Ashwini and others at the same temple. Stalin visited her home on Thursday to in his words “return the dignity”.“I had expressed a wish to meet the chief minister but I never thought it would happen. There are a lot of struggles our community faces and now that he intervened we believe things will change for us,” Ashwini said, speaking over the phone.She sells beads for a living much like the rest of the Narikurava tribes. “We earn between ₹200-300 a day and some days we earn nothing.” In her video, Ashwini aired her grievances and criticised temple authorities and the society at large for treating them without dignity which circulated widely on the social media. She also spoke of the lack of opportunities such as tribal children not being able to access education.Stalin, in a tweet, recalled the discriminating incident. “What was denied for Ashwini is dignity and respect not food and it is an opportunity for the government to restore it,” Stalin said drawing in the tenets of the DMK party’s Dravidian ideology. “The role of the Dravidian Movement is to protect every single person from the downtrodden with self-respect and social justice.”On Thursday, Stalin distributed land pattas, community certificates and launched welfare and development schemes such as drinking water supply, electricity and road facilities all worth ₹4.53 crore. At the event, Ashwini was given the stage to speak of the problems faced by the community.As many as 282 people, who belong to the Narikuravar and Irular tribal communities, received their land deeds under the Chief Minister’s Special Regularising Scheme worth ₹3.52 crore. Stalin also distributed ration cards, voter ID cards to them.According to a statement from the state government, orders were issued for six people to receive old-age pensions, 88 people from the Irular community received their Scheduled Caste certificate and 34 Narikuravar people got their Most Backwards Class (MBC) certificates. For livelihood support, 12 people received a loan amount of ₹1 lakh each under the MUDRA scheme, and a bank loan amount of ₹10,000 each to 33 people under the small business scheme, among other benefits.Stalin also announced that such welfare measures will be extended to members of the community across the state over the next two weeks.Tribal activists say for generations these tribal communities have faced several problems but at the top of it are three basic amenities that they are still struggling to receive - land deeds, ration cards and community certificates. “Basically, the data with the Tamil Nadu government of the population of the state’s 36 tribes is incorrect,” says Villupuram-based tribal activist Thenarasu Sudaroli, who works with the Integrated Centre for Research, Resource and Rehabilitation.“For instance, according to the government there are 1.89 lakh of Irular tribes in the state. But every year we have a festival along the sea shore of Mamallapuram for which 3 lakh people from the Irular tribe gather. So when there is no correct Census of their population how will the social welfare benefits meant for them reach them?”However, he says Stalin’s visit and handing over of these documents was making a change on the ground. “Our organisation has received at least three calls since Friday morning from the Taluk office about pending petitions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-reaches-out-to-indigenous-communities-after-tribal-woman-barred-from-having-food-at-temple-101636139957631.html

06-11-2021||India||AP not inclined to cut VAT on fuels||Amaravati The Andhra Pradesh government is not inclined to cut Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel due to its precarious financial condition, a top official said here on Friday.Two days ago, the Centre reduced the Excise Duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 a litre, respectively and asked the states to cut VAT to give more relief to consumers.Consequently, petrol price fell to about ₹110 a litre and that of diesel to about ₹97.Many states have followed the Centre’s advise and reduced VAT.“We have not taken any decision on the issue yet, but it is highly unlikely that we will affect any reduction in VAT. Our precarious financial condition does not permit it,” said the official.On July 20 last year, the state government revised the tax structure on petrol and diesel, thereby increasing their price by ₹1.24 and ₹0.93 per litre, respectively, to mop up an additional revenue of about ₹600 crore per annum.Subsequently, a road development cess of ₹1 per litre each on petrol and diesel was levied for an additional revenue generation of ₹600 crore.The government is now seeking to escrow the road development cess revenue to secure over ₹2,000 crore loan from banks, while money has reportedly not been spent on road development works so far.“Forget about development, not a km length of road has been repaired in the state in the last two years,” Jana Sena Party Political Affairs Committee Chairman Nadendla Manohar alleged.He wondered what happened to the hundreds of crores of Rupees collected by the government in the name of road development cess, besides additional taxes on fuel.He regretted that people were forced to bear the additional financial burden in the name of cess and VAT, “despite there being no development.” “The Jagan Mohan Reddy government should tell the people to what extent it will reduce VAT on petrol and diesel, like the other states. Otherwise, we will expose the government,” Manohar warned in a statement.AP Congress Committee president S Sailajanath too demanded that the state government immediately reduce VAT on petrol and diesel and mitigate the burden on people.“We will take up an agitation if the government fails to follow other states and reduce VAT,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ap-not-inclined-to-cut-vat-on-fuels-101636139177305.html
06-11-2021||India||Karnataka withdraws night curfew, eases curbs at airports as Covid cases drop||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Friday withdrew the night curfew that has been in effect in the state since April 2021. The decision was taken considering the reduction in Covid-19 cases and case positivity rate in the state. The order issued by P Ravi Kumar, chief secretary and chairman of the state executive committee, read that the decision to withdraw night curfew in the state will come into force with immediate effect. “Night curfew, which is being imposed from 10 pm to 5 am, is herewith withdrawn,” the order read. In addition to this, the government has also allowed the resumption of horse racing in compliance with all Covid-19 safety protocols. “Number of racing patrons attending horse racing shall be strictly as per the seating capacity of the venue and only fully vaccinated people will be allowed entry into such premises,” the government said. The government has also eased restrictions at the international airports in the state. The travellers no longer need to go through SPO2 routine checks (except in cases of fever, cough, cold, difficulty in breathing, etc) at airports. In addition to this, the RT-PCR test report checking on arrival has also been discontinued, except for those from selected countries, notified by the government of India, to be conducted at the airport. The decision comes as a surprise as the Technical Advisory Committee on Covid-19 had recommended increasing testing across the state as more than two million people turned out to pay their homage to Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar and large crowds were seen during the campaign for the two bypolls. The Committee earlier had recommended conducting 110,000 tests in the state every day. It had been advised that among these 50,000 tests to be conducted in Bengaluru and 60,000 in districts with special attention to border areas. The decision has been taken to increase the Covid tests in the capital city by 20%. The government is also contemplating issuing guidelines on collecting contact numbers of people who get medicines for cold, cough, and breathing problems. Further awareness will be created to get the Covid tests done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-withdraws-night-curfew-eases-curbs-at-airports-as-covid-cases-drop-101636139118434.html

The Air Quality Index (AQI) in the state capital ranged between 342 to 385 on Thursday evening and Friday morning.Based on the directions of the Supreme Court to carry out short-term monitoring for 14 days (commencing from 7 days prior to Diwali and ending 7 days after) for the parameters namely aluminium, barium and others, the board has conducted manual monitoring in five different locations in Chennai that is in Besant Nagar, T Nagar, Nungambakkam, Triplicane and Sowcarpet to monitor the impact of Diwali celebrations by bursting of firecrackers for the Ambient Air Quality and also Noise pollution levels.There has been an increase in PM10 & PM2.5 parameters which is above the National Ambient Air standards, the board said in a statement. Similarly, they found that the noise pollution had also increased compared to 2020 on Diwali day. The PM10 values ranged from 187 to 283 ug/m3 on Diwali day against the standard of 100 ug/m. PM 2.5 results ranged from 175 to 257 microgram/m3 against the prescribed 60 ug/m3. “The PM10 and PM2.5 values are above National Ambient Air standards prescribed in all the stations during Deepavali day,” the statement said.The ambient noise level ranged from 55 to 66 dB (A) on a non-festive day which increased to 69 to 79 dB (A) on Diwali day. These values were also found to be higher this year compared to Diwali in 2020.The considerable increase in Air pollution level and AQI values are mainly due to high relative humidity (above 90%) and low wind speed and heavy bursting of crackers during the permitted timing, the department said.Gaseous pollutants were found to be well within prescribed limits.Meanwhile, the Greater Chennai Corporation collected 138.2 metric tonnes of waste that came out of burning firecrackers. In previous years, the civic body had collected 85 tonnes of cracker waste in 2017 and 95 tonnes in 2018. In 2019, 103 tonnes of cracker waste was collected. In 2020, around 98 tonnes were collected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennais-air-quality-worsens-to-very-poor-after-diwali-night-101636138941761.html
06-11-2021||India||Bommai targets Congress-ruled states over no reduction in fuel taxes||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday criticised the Congress over its stand to neither appreciate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s decision to reduce taxes on fuel nor do its own ruled states follow suit.“The Congress ruled states and those by their allies have refused to reduce taxes on petrol and diesel. This shows their anti-people approach. The Congress here (Karnataka) should clarify if this is the party’s stand. Their governments never reduced it by ₹7. Since Congress ruled states have not done this, they have no right to talk about it,” Bommai said.The statement comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government and all other BJP ruled states announced tax cuts on fuel.Excise duty on petrol and diesel was reduced by ₹10 and petrol by ₹5.The Bommai government, in a statement on Thursday, said diesel was cheaper by ₹19 in Karnataka.“Karnataka is the first state to reduce sales tax on petrol and diesel. Diesel prices reduced from ₹104.50 on 3.11.21 to ₹85.03. Reduction of ₹19.47. Petrol prices reduced from ₹113.93 on 3.11.21 to ₹100.63. Reduction of ₹13.30,” the chief minister’s office said in a statement.“Karnataka’s share of KST on petrol is reduced from 35% to 25.9% and that on diesel has been reduced from 24% to 14.34% by virtue of today’s (Thursday’s) notification,” it added.The Congress Karnataka unit had said the BJP was forced to reduce prices after it suffered setbacks in the October 30 bypolls across the country and the state.In Karnataka, the BJP lost to the Congress in Hanagal, stealing a victory in Bommai’s home district of Haveri.“Elections will be conducted for Taluk & Zilla Panchayats and BBMP in the coming days.People should remember the lesson taught by @narendramodi & cast their vote against@BJP4India,” Congress leader Siddaramaiah said in a post on Thursday.Bommai said the Congress was criticising for the sake of it. “They (Congress) say that we lost Hanagal and we (BJP) reduced prices. If I (government) did it before the elections, they would say that it was done only for the sake of elections. Those who criticise will do it no matter what we do,” Bommai said.He even said there has been no government or chief minister who has reduced fuel prices by ₹7 in the state.Bommai also said it was left to the Centre to decide any reduction in cooking gas prices.“Cooking gas cylinder has reached 1,000, food & cooking oil prices are constantly increasing.Voters have to continue to vote against @BJP4India for the above prices also to be reduced,” Siddaramaiah said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-targets-congress-ruled-states-over-no-reduction-in-fuel-taxes-101636138457740.html
06-11-2021||India||To curb flooding, CM Bommai plans overhaul of Bengaluru drainage||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said the state government will take short and long term steps to ensure more drain-related works are taken up during summer months to avoid a repeat of flooding each time it rains in Bengaluru.The chief minister held a meeting with senior officials after entire Bengaluru had flood-like conditions after Thursday night’s downpour, which stands testimony to the city’s poor quality of infrastructure and planning.“Whenever there is monsoons, low lying areas, wherever there is water logging, identify it and find the reasons for it. We have to take immediate steps for short and long-term plans and ensure water does not enter such homes,” Bommai said in Bengaluru.His statement comes at a time when Bengaluru’s crumbling infrastructure was once again put to the test during the heavy downpour in October.Despite being one of India’s largest cities and a global reputation in technological prowess, the public infrastructure in Bengaluru remains one of the poorest in the country.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), at least 18 people lost their lives in Bengaluru due to civic apathy that is more than all other major cities combined.Most streets in Bengaluru were inundated on Thursday night which authorities conveniently blamed on the sudden downpour.“When it rains, we can only do rescue operations. But we can do so much more during summer,” Bommai said.There are no elected representatives in the city corporation for over a year and may not be for at least the first half of next year. With no elected representatives and the chief minister continuing to hold onto Bengaluru city in charge portfolio, there are few alternatives to hold officials accountable for these repeated lapses.In a recent interaction with Hindustan Times, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the instances of water logging had become almost negligible in the city. On the very day, almost the entire neighbourhood of HSR Layout was underwater after the drain and nearby lake water started to overflow, destroying cars, property and leaving behind a trail of destruction.Bommai said nearly 75 km of retaining walls on stormwater drains had collapsed or were damaged.He said out of the total 842 km of retaining walls that were supposed to be built, only 389 km were completed so far.The BBMP has no dearth in expenditure as it spends hundreds and thousands of crores each year on various civic works.In the last five years, the Karnataka government has spent over ₹20,000 crore on fixing roads in Bengaluru, Bommai said during the monsoon session of the state legislature between September 13 and 24.But the condition of the roads in what is proudly called India’s IT capital, remains among the poorest in terms of quality.Bommai said he would increase the number of disaster response teams to four within the next one year from just the one currently.He added that the government would utilise the services of home guards and civil defence personnel for rescue during heavy rains in Bengaluru.The chief minister said he would double the number of rescue teams from 15 members in each of the 64 teams to 30.Bengaluru is expected to receive more rains over the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-curb-flooding-cm-bommai-plans-overhaul-of-bengaluru-drainage-101636138338472.html
06-11-2021||India||Odisha plans to enact Goonda Act to curb organised crimes||Bhubaneswar The Odisha government is considering enactment of a special law to deal with a crimes ranging from land grabbing by force, drug trafficking, immoral trafficking, child and human trafficking, cybercrimes, eve-teasing, extortion, kidnapping or abduction for ransom to illegal extraction of minerals and transportation.The Bill tentatively titled ‘Odisha Goonda and anti-social activities(prevention) Bill’ has been drafted on the lines of similar Acts passed by Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra governments that seeks curb the menace of organised crimes. HT has perused a draft copy of the Bill that is now waiting for Cabinet nod before being tabled in the assembly.Odisha director general of police Abhay Kumar refused to speak on the proposed law as it was still being vetted by law department. However, a senior police official, on condition of anonymity, said the proposed Act would take quite some time as the approval of central government was necessary.Widening the definition of anti-social activities, the new Act proposes to include the offences under Indian Penal Code, Odisha Excise Act(2005), Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act(1985), Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act(1956), the Protection of Children from Sexual offences Act (2012), Protection of Cow Slaughter Act(1960) and Odisha Money Lenders Act(1939).All offences under the new Act would be cognisable and will have to be probed by an officer not below the rank of a sub-inspector, according to the draft copy of the Bill. The omnibus Act would include offences regarding transportation of minerals that have been illegally extracted. The new Act proposes at least seven years of jail term which may be extended to 10 years and fines upto ₹50000. There would be special courts for trial of the offences booked under the proposed Act. However, the special courts can’t start trial of the cases without the sanction of state government.Under the Act, a district magistrate can attach the accused person’s movable and immovable properties if he believes that the same has been acquired by commission of offences under it even before the courts take cognisance of the cases.As per the proposed Act, a “goonda” is a person who with the intention of disturbing public order or of gaining any undue financial or other advantage for himself, either individually or in a group, by violence, or threat or show of violence or intimidation or coercion.The Act also seeks to take action against police or any public official who renders help or support in any manner to anti-socials before or after the commission offence or abstains from taking measures or intentionally avoids to carry out the direction of any court or his superior officers. Such officials would be punished with a jail term of at least 3 years which may extend upto 10 years.Similarly, any person on behalf of the anti-social person is found in possession of movable or immovable properties which can’t be accounted for would face punishment of at least 3 years which may extend upto 7 years. The property would also be liable for attachment.The offences under this Act would be held in camera and trial by special courts would have precedence over the trial of any other case against the accused in any other court. To protect the witnesses in such cases, their identity and address would be kept secret. Even their names would not be shown in case records or judgements.As per National Crime Records Bureau figures, total crimes in Odisha have gone up from 81, 460 in 2016 to 1.34 lakh in 2020. The state has a poor record when it comes to crimes against women. With 292 cases for publishing sexually explicit material, the state stood at second place in the country in 2020. It topped all the states with regard to cybercrime cases dealing with blackmailing, defamation and uploading morphed photographs of women. It also figured among top-10 states in kidnapping and abduction of women.Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Bargarh MP, a lawyer himself, said simply adding one more special law would not lead to any solution and would rather add to the burden of prosecuting agencies. “Odisha police don’t have enough people to manage regular day-to-day law and order activities as well probe crimes. Secondly, the investigating skills of the existing officials is not up-to-the-mark. How would the new law solve these basic issues,” asked Pujari.Legal experts said a special law to deal with organised crimes was a good step, but said the problem in dealing with such crimes lay with the state police. “Odisha police have a poor record when it comes to charge sheeting accused and following up on the case during trial. The existing Indian Penal Code is enough to deal with the rising crime cases. In the past, the state has enacted special Acts such as Odisha Protection of Interest of Depositors Act, but have they been able to give justice to common men?,” said senior lawyer of Orissa High Court, Pitambar Acharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-plans-to-enact-goonda-act-to-curb-organised-crimes-101636137679244.html

Sidhu had resigned from the post on September 28, triggering a fresh crisis in the Congress’s Punjab unit ahead of state assembly elections. The next day, however, Sidhu said his concerns have been resolved and the party asserted that he will continue as the head of the state unit. “At the start, I want to say that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi’s soldier has taken back his resignation... I have taken back my resignation. And I categorically state that the day a new Advocate General is appointed, I will assume charge,” Sidhu told a press conference on Friday.Sidhu has been opposing the appointment of state Advocate General A P S Deol and Director General of Police Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, considered as new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s choices. He had earlier indicated that these two appointments were part of the reason he quit. Sahota had headed the SIT formed by the previous SAD-BJP government to probe incidents of desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015. And as a lawyer, Deol had represented former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, who headed the state police six years ago during the incidents of sacrilege and police firing on protesters.“It was never personal or a matter of ego. It is the question of conscience of Punjab. Without moral, you cannot speak the truth,” Sidhu said, arguing that the offices of the AG and the DGP are crucial to take the Bargari sacrilege and drug trafficking cases to their logical conclusions.Firing a salvo against his own government, Sidhu questioned the delay in action against sacrilege cases.“What is this happening…when we go to villages, how are we going to answer people? What are we going to say? The party is demanding answers. After three special investigation teams (SITs), seven first information reports (FIRs), two commissions and six years of the sacrilege cases are these the only officers you could find,” he asked. “Don’t you want the report to be made public in the state assembly? Which court order is restraining you? Who is stopping?... I say if you don’t have the guts to make the STF report public, give it to the party and I will make it public. I have the guts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-takes-back-resignation-as-punjab-congress-chief-sets-terms-to-resume-duties-101636137499825.html
06-11-2021||India||BJP’s apex body to discuss 2022 poll strategy on November 7||On Sunday, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) key decision-making body, the national executive committee (NEC), will congregate to discuss the upcoming assembly elections in five states, including the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh, the party’s performance in the recent by-elections in 14 states, and the overall sentiment in the country over the Union government’s handling of the economy and Covid-19.According to people aware of the details, the meeting will take stock of the party’s electoral strategy for the upcoming elections in the wake of the bypoll results that have sounded an alarm for the BJP in states such as Himachal Pradesh.While the BJP won all five assembly seats in Assam, bagged two from the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and lost one; its performance in Himachal Pradesh, where the party drew a blank in three assembly and one Lok Sabha seat, was a big setback. There was more embarrassment in store for the party in Rajasthan where its candidates were relegated to the third and the fourth spot.“To read the overall results and HP in particular, as a bellwether for the upcoming elections will be wrong. However, the NEC will take stock of each and every defeat and the reasons for the voting percentages dropping in some seats,” said a national office bearer on condition of anonymity.In Himachal Pradesh the BJP’s vote share decline by 20% in the Lok Sabha bypoll in the Mandi constituency that was won by the Congress. In Dadra and Nagar Haveli too, the BJP’s vote share fell by 7%. While it retained the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh, the party again saw a dip in vote share of 7%.Himachal Pradesh is slated to go to the polls in late 2022.The party announced a reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel a day after Tuesday’s poll results. BJP ruled states such as Assam, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal, Gujarat and Goa, among others, announced cuts between Rs.5 and Rs.10 in diesel and petrol pricesWhile the slashing of fuel prices was perceived as a quick move to mitigate public anger ahead of elections in early 2022, the BJP delinked the cut from Tuesday’s electoral outcome. A second functionary said fuel prices and inflation were a pan-India concern, and if these were the determining factors, the party would not have done well in Assam. “There is a lot of support for the Modi government for its handling of the Covid crisis. The government has not dropped the ball, whether it’s been undertaking a massive vaccination drive or coming up with economic packages to revive economy,” the second functionary said, requesting anonymity.The issue of inflation and price rise is expected to be taken up at the meeting, where traditionally resolutions on pressing economic and political issues are passed.“As per the agenda that has been circulated the NEC will take up and pass a resolution on current issues but so far there is no decision of whether there will be a single resolution or not. The issue is likely to be taken up at the meeting of the national general secretaries on Saturday,” said a third functionary.The national executive committee meeting is being held after a gap of two years, owing to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. The meeting will be a hybrid congregation as only Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president JP Nadda, national office bearers and Union ministers who are part of the NEC will attend the meeting in person in the Capital’s NDMC convention centre, while state presidents, state general secretaries and other invitees to the NEC will join virtually. As per an office bearer, the decision of holding a hybrid meeting was mooted by the PM.The BJP announced the 80-member national executive committee, last month, dropping Chaudhary Birendra Singh and Varun Gandhi who were critical of the government’s handling of the farm agitation; and Subramanian Swamy who has also criticised the government on numerous occasions on issues related to economic policy.The national executive committee, which is the central decision-making body of the party, also includes 50 special invitees and 179 permanent invitees, including chief ministers, deputy chief ministers of BJP-ruled states, leaders of the legislative assemblies, state presidents among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-apex-body-to-discuss-2022-poll-strategy-on-sunday-101636137438127.html
06-11-2021||India||Congress seeks 8-point analysis from party leaders to draw by-election lessons||NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday started the process to dissect the recent results of the bypolls in 14 states and union territories to assess its performance and factors that led to its defeat in Assam, where it drew a blank. According to senior Congress members, the party will review factors such as alliances with other parties and candidate selection etc.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal has written to all the general secretaries and in-charges of state units where bypolls were held to send a detailed report on the recent results. In the letter sent on Friday, Venugopal asked the state in-charges to give detailed response, at the earliest, on the outcome of the bypolls with special focus on eight important issues such as candidate selection and impact of result in the political context of the state. HT has reviewed the letter. The party has sought response on the factors leading to bypolls. For instance, in Assam, bypolls on two of the five seats were necessitated as Congress MLAs (Mariani and Thawra) switched to BJP. The Congress has asked the state in-charges to give their analysis on factors such as candidate selection, election campaign and management, the impact of alliance with other parties on the results and role of other political parties on party’s performance.The Congress delivered a surprise win in BJP-ruled states such as Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka; it held its own seat in Rajasthan in the recent bypolls which were held in 30 assembly and three Lok Sabha constituencies in 14 states and union territories. In Himachal Pradesh, the opposition Congress won the three assembly seats that were up for grabs in the by-elections. It wrested the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segment from the ruling BJP and retained the Arki and Fatehpur assembly seats. The party’s victory in Himachal Pradesh is a huge setback for chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, for whom the election was crucial as the state heads into an election year and also the fact that Mandi is considered his home turf.Even in Karnataka, the Congress won the assembly seat in chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s home district. But the party’s defeat in Assam has become a major cause of concern. Of the five assembly seats in Assam, the ruling BJP won three and its partner United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL) bagged the other two. The Congress state unit is now planning to reorganise itself and review the reasons for its loss in the recent bypolls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-seeks-8-point-analysis-from-party-leaders-to-draw-by-election-lessons-101636137317599.html
06-11-2021||India||Air quality dips in northern plains as temperature drops, farm fires rise||Chandigarh/Rohtak/Jaipur: Air quality deteriorated from very poor to severe in several parts of the northern plains on Diwali night (Thursday night) due to poor dispersal of local pollutants and more instances of stubble burning in paddy growing areas of Punjab and Haryana, according to pollution control board officials in the northern states.Air pollution, mainly particulate matter 2.5 microns, increases during this period of the year as temperature dip, wind speeds fall, and instances of farm fires increase. Fireworks exacerbate the problem and despite a ban on their use in the National Capital Region spanning Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, people set them off till early on Friday, the officials added.According to Central Pollution Control Board, the higher pollution load caused the first major blanket of smog across the northern plains with places such as Jind (Air Quality Index of AQI of 471) in Haryana and Baghpat (440) in Uttar Pradesh recording high toxicity in air, described as severe on the national Air Quality Index (AQI). The air quality in most of the big towns in the three states neighbouring Delhi, UP, Rajasthan and Haryana, was in very poor to severe category.A Haryana government official, who monitors air quality in the state, said the fireworks ban was not strictly enforced in any of the 14 districts in the state and no case was registered for defying the ban till Friday morning. Gurugram reported an AQI of 474, Jind 471, Rohtak 448, Panipat 447, Bhiwani 433, Faridabad 428, Hisar 421 and Sonepat 406. The official said the situation may improve in the next few days with wind speeds expected to increase. An analysis by Union earth science ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Friday said that contribution of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana to the region’s total pollution load increased from 25% on Thursday to 36% on Friday. Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution peaked at 42% on November 5. In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44% of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on November 1.The Punjab government’s satellite based farm fire monitoring centre in Ludhiana said stubble burning incidents reported on Wednesday and Thursday were highest thus far this season. The highest number of farm fires on Diwali was reported from Ludhiana, followed by Sangrur, Barnala and Ferozpur.Of about 23,465 farm fires reported this season from Punjab, 55% were reported in the last five days with 3,032 reported on Diwali day, the highest for a single day so far this year. However, the number is still half of 44086 cases reported for the corresponding period (till November 4, 2020). On November 4 last year, 4,908 farm fire incidents were reported and in 2019, 5,953 cases were reported, showing a clear decline in stubble burning incidents from the paddy bowl state of India. To be sure, the lower cases this year are a result of a delayed monsoon and it’s very likely that the numbers are yet to peak.Officials said that while farmers in some districts are exploring possibilities of ex-situ and in-situ handling of straw , many farmers with small and mid-sized holdings are burning stubble. Jugraj Singh, farmer leader, said that if the government wants to end the practice of stubble burning it should implement the Supreme Court order that provided for Rs. 100 per quintal incentive to farmers to scientifically treat stubble. “This will help in long way, as small and marginal farmers can’t spend money to clear fields using machines.”Emissions from stubble burning from farms in Punjab and Haryana in India and from Pakistan travel with air to the northern plains of the country, increasing the air pollution levels and creating smog weather conditions. “This is what has exactly happened in the last two days,” said Gufrain Beg, who heads SAFAR’s air pollution monitoring unit. “Local pollution coupled with stubble emissions and bursting of crackers has created smog conditions in the NCR region.”Normally, stubble burning incidents decline in first week of November as farmers start sowing the winter crop. However, this year due to delay in paddy harvesting in Punjab and Haryana, the stubble burning started late and its peak coincided with Diwali.Member secretary of Rajasthan Pollution Control Board, , Anand Mohan said that in 2020 there was a restriction on movement of people due to Covid-19 during Diwali “This year there were no restrictions and therefore, the air quality in Jaipur and Jodhpur was in very poor category,” he said. He added the situation will worsen if the smog from NCR disperses to other regions.The bad air even affected the hills of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.Dehradun in Uttarakhand saw an AQI of s 227, 10 points higher than on Diwali day in 2020. Shimla in Himachal Pradesh reported AQI of 320, five points more than in 2020. Bihar’s capital city of Patna and Muzaffarpur recorded very poor quality with index value of 302 whereas air quality in Kolkata dipped to 174. Air quality in Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur was in poor category. Air quality in Mumbai entered the ‘poor’ category, recording 215 on the air quality index (AQI), SAFAR said. This is up from a ‘moderate’ reading of 164 the day prior. Chennai’s air quality was satisfactory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-dips-in-northern-plains-as-temperature-drops-farm-fires-rise-101636137201691.html
06-11-2021||India||Farmers hold BJP leaders hostage, damage MP’s car in Haryana||The ongoing protest over the Centre’s contentious agricultural laws in Haryana escalated on Friday after a group of protesting farmers allegedly held a few Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders hostage in Rohtak, while another reportedly smashed the windshield of the vehicle of party legislator in Hisar district, police said.Providing further details, police said former state minister and state BJP vice-president Manish Grover, party general secretary (organisation) Ravindra Raju, Rohtak mayor Man Mohan Goyal and at least 40 others confined for at least five hours at a temple complex as farmers staged a protest outside against the agricultural laws, in Rohtak’s Kaloi villageThe BJP leaders had gone to the complex to watch the live telecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech at Kedarnath temple when the incident occurred at around noon.The protesting farmers, who were demanding an apology for using a temple to fulfill their political agenda, locked the entrance gate of Shiva temple at Kiloi village, police said. A contingent of police was deployed at the spot to maintain law and order and additional forces from Jhajjar, Sonepat and Jind were summoned after the situation turned tense when more farmers arrived in tractors outside the temple and outnumbered the BJP leaders.The farmers claimed that the standoff ended after BJP leaders went to the terrace and apologised to them for using a temple for a political programme.“How can a party live telecast Prime Minister’s speech at a temple?” Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Inderjit Singh said.Also Read| Five killed in Kurukshetra road mishapHowever, state BJP vice-president Grover claimed that they did not apologise to anyone.“We did not apologise to anyone. We will continue to visit the shrine,” he said.Rohtak police spokesman Sunny Loura said the BJP leaders were locked inside a temple at Kiloi village and the protest ended in the evening.“The police controlled the tense situation bravely. No untoward incident was reported. There is peace in the village. Khap leaders played a vital role in helping to end the deadlock between locals, farmers and BJP leaders,” he added.In Hisar, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Ram Chander Jangra faced the ire of farmers over his alleged remark that those protesting were “jobless alcoholics from villages”.The legislator made the comment on Thursday after attending a Diwali programme in Rohtak. “There’s no opposition to the farm laws. Those protesting are jobless alcoholics from villages. The bad elements have been protesting against the government and the recent killing of an innocent Nihang at Singhu border has exposed them. The farmers are not protesting... but only bad elements. I have been frequently visiting Delhi and most of the tents at the protest sites are empty... this issue will be resolved soon,” the MP said, according to an audio circulated on social media and heard by this reporter.On Friday, Chander was greeted with black flags and slogans when he arrived to inaugurate a community centre at Narnaund town in Hisar, officials aware of the matter said.The windshield of his vehicle was also broken in a scuffle between farmers and police, they added. While the legislator held the farmers responsible for the damage, the cultivators blamed the police.Two farmers were detained in this regard but released later, police said.Few policemen were also injured in the incident. While a large contingent of force was deployed in the area, they failed to contain the crowd, they added.The MP said that he was on his way to a public event when some farmers threw lathis (sticks) on his vehicle, damaging the vehicle’s windshield.“I have spoken to Hansi superintendent of police and Haryana director general of police in this regard. This was a clear murder attempt and police told me that two persons have been detained. I have demanded strict action against the detainees. I had gone to attend social functions when the incident took place. Will they (farmers) attack functions too?. After my car was vandalised, I had to cancel two other social programmes,” he said.Farm leader Vikas Sisar from Hisar said one farmer, identified as Kuldeep Singh of Satrod Khurd village in Hisar district, sustained injuries and was taken to a private hospital where his condition is believed to be critical.Following the incident, police detained two protesters and later released them after a probe, Hansi superintendent of police Nitika Gehlout said.Narnaund Police said they have booked at least 23 people under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for vandalising Jangra’s car.Demanding the withdrawal of cases, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Charuni rushed to Narnaund police station to stage an indefinite dharna with the farmers and also called for a mahapanchayat on Saturday outside the premises.“We will go back after the police cancel the FIR registered against the farmers. Jangra has been trying to divide the people along caste lines and he has been using indecent language against the protesters. We have started an indefinite dharna at Narnaund police station,” he said.Also Read| Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Police give security to 60 witnessesFarmers also blocked the Hisar-Rohtak national highway, near Ramayana toll plaza, seeking release of their aides.Taking note of the escalating tension, police released the two detainees and said senior officials were holding meetings with Charuni and other farm leaders to urge them to end the dharna.“We are hoping that the dharna will be lifted after the meeting,” he said.Reacting to the incidents, former Haryana Congress legislature leader and Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry accused the state government of provoking the farmers by using “indecent language” against them.“One farmer got injured in the Narnaund incident and he is battling for life. The government has been making all attempts to weaken the farmers’ protest,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-hold-bjp-leaders-hostage-damage-mp-s-car-in-haryana-101636136957841.html
06-11-2021||India||Toxic haze engulfs New Delhi||Delhi recorded its worst day-after-Diwali air quality since 2016, with the air quality index, or AQI, soaring to 462 on the back of a sharp increase in stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, and a blatant violation of the fireworks ban in the national capital.Lower temperatures and non-existent winds did not help.Delhi police control room data showed that on November 4, till midnight, at least 1,100 complaints of people using firecrackers was reported from across the city – averaging 47 an hour.According to CPCB, which started tracking AQI in 2015, the day after Diwali saw a reading of 445 in 2016. That was also the year when Delhi witnessed one of its worst pollution spells, recording its most polluted day ever on November 6 when the AQI rose to 497.On Thursday (Diwali day), the overall AQI in Delhi was 382, in the “very poor” zone.CPCB data showed the 24-hour average AQI entered the “severe” zone at 9pm, gradually rising each hour as a haze enveloped the Capital. It was 404 at 9pm, 422 by midnight, 428 by 2am, 444 by 6am, 446 by 7am, and 451 by 8am on Friday.Other cities and towns in the national capital region (NCR) fared no better, with Faridabad (AQI 469), Ghaziabad (470), Gurugram (472), Greater Noida (464) and Noida (475) — all in the severe zone, according to CPCB’s 24-hour average AQI at 4pm.An AQI of 51-100 is categorised as “satisfactory”, 101-200 as “moderate”, 201-300 as “poor”, 301-400 as “very poor”, and above 401 as “severe”.Nasa’s satellite imagery recorded over 3,500 farm fire events across the northern plains on Thursday, with northwesterly winds carrying pollutants from these to the National Capital Region. According to the Union earth science ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), stubble burning accounted for 25% of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) on Diwali day and 36%, the day after. Prior to this, the highest contribution from stubble burning in Delhi’s air was 20%, on October 29. Interestingly, SAFAR said emissions from fireworks were “almost of the same magnitude”.Farm fires ragingWhile the contribution of fireworks to pollution will decline, that of farm fires is expected to increase. The paddy harvest is 70% complete, and instances of stubble burning are peaking; 55% of total cases of stubble burning this year have been reported in the last five days.The number of farm fires thus far this year, at 23,465, is still almost half of 44,086 cases reported for the corresponding period (till November 4) last year, but most officials expect it to increase over the coming week.On November 4, 3,032 farm fire events were captured by satellite in Punjab. In 2019, there were 5,953 active fires on the same date, and in 2020 there were 4,908 -- indications of how high the number could go.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday blamed large-scale setting of fireworks and the peaking of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana for the steep fall in the Capital’s air quality. He also blamed the Bharatiya Janata Pary for “deliberately encouraging” people to flout the fireworks ban on Diwali.This October, residents in NCR experienced the cleanest air ever on record, according to government figures. The reasons: unseasonal October rains and a delayed harvest (and therefore delayed stubble burning) season in Punjab and Haryana. HT reported on October 27 that Delhi was headed towards an air emergency with stubble fires expected to peak around Diwali.“Delhi did not record a single bad air day in October. Impact of 3,500 farm fires around Delhi was visible in national capital today…There was also deliberate violation of the cracker ban in the city, encouraged by the BJP,” Rai said.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta slammed the Delhi government for not taking any concrete measures to curb pollution. Referring to Rai’s statement, Gupta said, “The Kejriwal government is trying to hide its failure to curb pollution in the city. In the past six years, the government has taken no concrete steps such as improving last mile connectivity, expanding the bus fleets, encouraging the use of battery-operated vehicles, etc, to curb pollution. They just want to tackle the issue by temporary arrangements. Ban on fire cracker is not the solution, as it hurts the religious sentiments of people. The government has now seen the result. They should have allowed the use of fire crackers for a limited time period.”The level of PM 2.5, a common air pollutant and a major respiratory health risk, in the national capital over the last 24 hours was the highest in three years, SAFAR pointed out.PM2.5 is fine, inhalable particulate matter. It is about 30 times smaller than a strand of human hair. PM 2.5 pollutants are made up of hundreds of chemicals. Construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, and smokestacks or fires, power plants, factories, and automobiles emit these pollutants into the air. The pollutants can enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system and cause asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease.The SAFAR analysis said that while PM2.5 levels were the highest in the three years they were still “much less” compared to 2018. It added while the levels have peaked much faster this Diwali, the dispersion is also expected to be fast. “...local winds have picked up since morning (on Friday) and now fast dispersion is expected,” the analysis said. “Without any more firecracker emissions, AQI (Air Quality Index) will improve to ‘very poor’ category by tonight (Friday) although the stubble contribution is expected to remain almost the same as today (Friday)...”The analysis showed between 10am on Thursday and 10am on Friday, Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels climbed to 457ug/m3. This was higher than 298ug/m3 in 2020 and 377ug/m3 recorded a day after Diwali in 2019. In 2018, the PM 2.5 levels spiked to 624ug/m3.SAFAR’s analysis said relief was expected only from Sunday evening.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), says such an episodic smog event had been forecast by agencies, owing to unfavourable weather conditions and a northwesterly wind, which is bound to heighten the impact of stubble burning. “The share of farm fires is increasing and wind speed is low which is not allowing dispersal of pollutants and firecrackers added additional emissions in Delhi’s air. All of this got trapped, leading to this season’s first ‘severe’ pollution event.”In addition to these two major sources of pollution, Delhi had to fight high moisture content in the air, resulting in the season’s first shallow fog on Thursday morning, with visibility dropping to 500 metres at both Safdarjung and Palam. On Friday, it dropped even further, to just 200 metres. While IMD only classifies fog based on visibility, the high contribution of pollutants and toxic chemicals in the air is likely to be a major factor in reduced visibility, making this more smog than fog. Fog is generally rare at this time of the year, with the winter’s first moderate to dense fog spell usually seen in late December.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said, “Fog conditions this morning (November 5) have intensified in Delhi NCR, with moderate fog with visibility levels of 200 to 500 metres reported at its two airports – Safdarjung and Palam -- till 5.30am. IGI Palam airport recorded a drop in visibility towards the city side to 200 metres,” said Jenamani.Okhla-Phase 2 in south-east Delhi saw the biggest hourly spike in PM 2.5 concentration on Diwali day as the PM2.5 concentration touched 1,984 micrograms per cubic metre – over 33 times the acceptable level of 60 micrograms per cubic metre and nearly 397 times the new WHO standards of 5 micrograms per cubic metre. This was followed by Ashok Vihar in north Delhi, where the hourly PM 2.5 concentration touched 1,957 micrograms.The number of people arrested in the last one and a half months until midnight on Diwali is much lesser that the police action taken on Diwali last year. In the last one and a half months, police arrested around 300 persons for stocking and bursting crackers. On Diwali last year, police arrested 850 for the two offences. On Thursday, Diwali day, the police registered 1,206 .Despite repeated calls and messages, Delhi Police refused to comment.IMD says wind speeds are expected to pick up only from Saturday onwards but may reach 25-35km/hr.A visible improvement in air quality might be seen from Sunday, forecasters said.“There will still be some mist on Saturday morning but wind speeds will increase to 30-40 km/hr during the day and this will help disperse pollutants,” said a met department official who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toxic-haze-engulfs-capital-101636133295891.html
06-11-2021||India||55% of total stubble burning cases in Punjab this year reported in last 5 days||With the paddy harvest almost 70% complete, the spike in the farm fires is visible in the hinterland of the agrarian state of Punjab, with 3,032 farm fires were reported on the Diwali Day; 55% of total cases of stubble burning this year have been reported in the last five days.The number of farm fires thus far this year, at 23465, is still almost half of 44086 cases reported for the corresponding period (till November 4) last year, but most officials expect it to increase over the coming week. .On November 4, 3,032 farm fire events were captured by satellite in Punjab. In 2019, there were 5,953 active fires on the same date and in 2020, 4,908 -- an indication of how high the number could go.Many farmers with smaller holdings are burning straw instead of exploring ex-situ (away) and in-situ (onsite) handling and there is a need to offer incentives for farmers who don’t burn straw said a Punjab agriculture department official.“If the government wants to end this practice, it should implements the Supreme Court judgment and give Rs. 100 per quintal as incentive for handing of straw. This will help, as farmers can’t spend extra due to the high cost of clearing fields using machinery”, said Jugraj Singh, farmer leader from Samana.The highest number of farm fires on Diwali were reported from Ludhiana, which saw 292 cases. Sangrur recorded 283, while neghbouring Barnala recorded 237. Ferozpur recorded 278 cases.The Punjab Pollution Control Board is sending teams to penalise erring farmers.Meanwhile, the number of farm fires has also gone up in Haryana with the state reporting 228 such incidents on November 4, taking the number of fires so far to 3,666. State government officials claimed there has been a 45% decline in farm fires this year, as against 6,581 incidents of stubble burning reported from September 15 to November 4 last year. A delayed season is at least partially responsible for this too.System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, said that on Friday, the share of stubble fire smoke in Delhi’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels peaked to 36% - the highest in this season so far. On Friday, Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) peaked to 462, in the severe category. Experts said that large scale cracker bursting in Delhi-NCR along with peak stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana were responsible for this deterioration.Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune’s Decision Support System has also forecasted that from November 5 to November 9, stubble burning share in Delhi’s pollution is likely to be around 45-47%.“Today (Friday) over 3,500 stubble fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana. In the next three days, air quality is expected to be poor in north and central India,” said Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/55-of-total-stubble-burning-cases-in-punjab-this-year-reported-in-last-5-days-101636132035581.html
06-11-2021||India||An hour-by-hour account of how Delhi’s air quality tanked on Diwali||Delhi woke up to one of its most polluted mornings this year after Diwali, according to Air Quality Index (AQI) data, with farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, and the use of fireworks on Diwali night (Thursday) contributing to the spike.To be sure, AQI is not the best metric for comparison if data for all pollutants is not available. This is because AQI is simply the highest among the sub-indices for different pollutants. If the data for one or more significant pollutants is not available, we might just be looking at the highest sub-index among available data. Still, on the basis of available data, two things are clear: this was among the most polluted Diwalis in Delhi and fireworks are not the only cause for the spike in pollution.HT analysed hourly PM 2.5 concentration levels and wind speed and the number of farm fires per day from three days before Diwali for 2019 (October 27), 2020 (November 14) and 2021 (November 4) to reach this conclusion. The analysis is based on data from five monitoring stations – Aya Nagar station of the India Meteorological Department, and the Najafgarh, Narela, Punjabi Bagh, and Sri Aurobindo Marg stations of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee – which have hourly data for all three years.Delhi air was cleaner on Diwali eve in 2021 than it was in 2019 and 2020. Things went downhill rapidly. At midnight on Diwali, the average PM 2.5 level in Delhi was 613.2 micrograms per cubic meter, higher than what it was at Diwali midnight in 2019 and 2020. However, what is more remarkable is the fact that pollution levels kept rising even after midnight. One would assume that cracker bursting reduced if not completely ended by this time. Average PM 2.5 level reached 729.6 micrograms per cubic meter between 3 am and 4 am hour on November 5, much higher than what it was during Diwali in 2019 and 2020.Low wind speed did not helpSo, is it just crackers that are to blame? Data does not support such a claim. Take wind speed for instance. Pollution levels fall with a rise in wind speed. This year there was hardly any wind to carry the pollutants away. This was especially true during the evening when crackers would have had the maximum impact on pollution.More farm fires this yearPollution levels started rising even before Diwali in Delhi. The biggest reason for this has been an increase in number of farm fires in neighbouring states. Not only has the number of farm fires increased significantly during the past few days, this number is significantly higher for this Diwali than in 2019 and 2020. Data from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) shows that farm fires contributed 25% of PM2.5 in Delhi’s air on Diwali (November 4). This is the biggest contribution on any day this year since October 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-hour-by-hour-account-of-how-delhi-s-air-quality-tanked-on-diwali-101636131135665.html
06-11-2021||India||PM Modi visits Kedarnath, says decade belongs to Uttarakhand||More pilgrims will visit Uttarakhand over the next decade than in the past century and the rapid development in the hill state will reverse the outward migration of young people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday while on a visit to the Kedarnath shrine. Modi also inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of projects worth ₹409 croreat Kedarnath, months before Uttarakhand goes to the polls. It was his fifth visit to Kedarnath after becoming Prime Minister and the first of his second term.“The third decade of the century belongs to Uttarakhand. Take it from me. I am saying this from a holy land,” Modi told a gathering at the temple, where he performed Rudrabhishek puja before unveiling a 12-feet and 35-tonne statue of Adi Guru Shankaracharya, an 8th-century spiritual leader and philosopher. A live telecast was carried from the sanctum sanctorum of the temple where he performed the puja.He cited the under-construction Char Dham all-weather road and the Rishikesh-Karnaprayag rail link projects and hailed the development agenda of the state government, which is run by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),He said new facilities at Kedarnath will make the Char Dham Yatra, a pilgrimage to the four holy Hindu shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri, easier for the pilgrims. “The protection wall constructed near the Mandakini river will prevent a 2013 like tragedy (floods) and will make the yatra secure. Also, the lodging facilities developed for the pilgrims will also provide more comfort to the pilgrims. Not only this, the permanent accommodation constructed for the priests of the temple will solve their problems in the bone-chilling cold.”Modi referred to the damage caused to the temple by the 2013 floods, which killed over 4,000 people,  and added that he always believed Kedarnath would rise once again. The floods were triggered by a cloudburst, few kilometres above the temple.“The damage caused during the tragedy was unimaginable. I was then the chief minister of Gujarat...came here after the tragedy and witnessed the pain of people.” Modi said people were then asking whether Kedarnath will be able to rise again. He added he had a firm belief in Lord Shiva that his temple will once again rise. “I am fortunate that the land which raised me when I was nothing has now given me the opportunity to serve it with the reconstruction works which are being done with the blessings of Lord Kedarnath.” Modi asked people to visit sacred places and those related to the freedom struggle. “We are celebrating Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav (marking 75 years of independence) in which people are encouraged to visit historical places related to the country’s independence. But I want to urge them to visit sacred places like Kedarnath to make the new generation aware of the centuries-old ancient and glorious spiritual and cultural heritage of India,” he said. Modi spoke about Shankaracharya’s contribution to spiritual enlightenment. “When the country was losing its unity, Adi Guru Shankracharya, at a young age, visited various parts of the country along with his pupils to spread spiritual enlightenment and unify the country religiously. His principles are relevant in today’s age.”The PM said India was getting back its lost spiritual glory with the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and development work in Varanasi, including the Kashi Vishwanath corridor.“Not only this, significant works are being done at Kushinagar, Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and other sacred Buddhist places to create a Buddhist pilgrimage circuit. Once completed, it will help in attracting thousands of Buddhist pilgrims and spiritual leaders.”Modi commended the Uttarakhand government for completing 100% first dose vaccination against Covid-19.Dhami thanked Modi for the reconstruction and development work. “Under his leadership, reconstruction and development work worth ₹225 crore has been completed under the first phase in Kedarnath while those worth ₹185 crore would soon be completed under the second phase.” He added ₹245 crore has been approved for development work in Badrinath temple and hundreds of crores more for the Gangotri and Yamunotri shines. Dhami thanked Modi for his “special love for Uttarakhand.”The opposition Congress, meanwhile, launched a scathing attack on the Prime Minister for “crossing boundaries by allowing live telecast from the sanctum sanctorum of Kedarnath temple”.“We welcome PM Modi to visit the highly sacred and revered Kedarnath temple. But the way he breached its sanctity with a live telecast of him performing puja at its sanctum sanctorum is highly condemnable. He broke the age old customs of the temple and crossed the boundaries of our faith with his act,” Congress leader Harish Rawat said. “We expected him to announce some relief package for the Kumaon region which was affected by the recent floods in October in which at least 77 people were killed. But we were utterly disappointed when he did not make any such announcement,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-pilgrims-to-visit-char-dham-shrines-in-10-yrs-than-over-last-century-modi-101636114454610.html
06-11-2021||India||Those evicted from Darrang were encroachers, not victims: Assam govt to HC||The Assam government has told the Gauhati high court that those evicted from Dhalpur Char in state’s Darrang district and their ancestors had not migrated there from native lands lost to floods and land erosion, as was being claimed. The government said that not only was there no official record to substantiate such claims, but that in reality, those portrayed as victims were “encroachers” who were legally evicted by the government as per existing provisions of Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886. Two civilians including a 12-year-old died and 18 others including 8 policemen had sustained injuries during clashes between police and families at Dhalpur on September 23 during a drive to evict settlers occupying nearly 77,000 ‘bighas’ of government land for decades. Following the deaths during the eviction drive, Debabrata Saikia, the leader of opposition in state assembly, petitioned the court claiming the evicted were from marginalised sections who had migrated there years ago to escape floods and erosions in the areas where they resided earlier. In response, the HC had directed the state government to file an affidavit by November 3. “The claim that the occupants of Dhalpur Char (sandbar) and their ancestor were forced to migrate from their respective original place of residence due to devastating floods and land erosion is not true as this is not found in revenue records,” the government affidavit filed by Kamaljeet Sarma, circle officer of Sipajhar revenue circle in Darrang district, said. The government affidavit said that any victim of erosion and flooding who becomes landless in the process has to report it to local revenue authority, which certifies them as erosion affected and landless while maintaining such record. “However, the occupants of Dhalpur Char and their ancestors have never produced such certificates issued from their original place where they claim to have migrated from. Hence the claim of forced migration due to flood and erosion is not true,” Sarma’s affidavit said. “The evicted occupants of Dhalpur area have migrated to these areas from different parts of the state and since the land in this area is fertile, they gradually occupied and grabbed the large fertile areas. In the garb of being landless, some individuals have also become land grabbers,” the government affidavit added. The affidavit also told the court that a rehabilitation policy for erosion affected families was made in 2020 and it was restricted to displacement from 2014-2015 onwards and didn’t cover displacement from government land. The eviction drive at Dhalpur was carried out to make way for a composite community farming scheme called Gorukhuti Project. On the first day of the drive on September 20, 788 families and 48 shops were removed without any violence but the second day on September 23 led to violent clashes between families and authorities. The government in its affidavit also refuted allegations that eviction notices were served hours before the drive and that authorities had razed down homes while the families were busy with dismantling themselves. The affidavit reiterated the government stand that only after the eviction party was attacked with stones, sticks and machetes, that the police first used mild baton charge, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the mob before finally resorting to “controlled firing” in which two civilians were killed and other civilians and policemen were injured. Also Read: Sachin Tendulkar donates retinal cameras to district hospital in AssamIt added that on humanitarian grounds, basic facilities like plastic sheets to build tents, tube wells, toilets and a mobile medical team have been provided to the evicted families. An area of nearly 1000 ‘bighas’ has also been earmarked in southern part of Dhalpur to relocate them, the affidavit said. “The matter is related to encroachment and eviction only and is not at all related to acquisition of land. Therefore, the question of resettlement, rehabilitation and compensation etc. as per the Land Acquisition Act, is irrelevant,” the affidavit said ruling out any obligation to pay compensation on its part.Another affidavit filed by Rupam Phukan, additional superintendent of police, Darrang, also reiterated that the police resorted to firing on September 23 only as a last resort to control attacks by the evicted families. The Assam government has already ordered a judicial inquiry into the violent eviction drive. A photographer engaged by the district administration, seen jumping on an injured civilian in a viral video, has been arrested apart from three residents accused of instigating violence during the drive. The matter will come up for hearing in HC court again on December 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/occupants-of-assam-s-evicted-land-are-encroachers-not-flood-victims-govt-tells-gauhati-hc-101636114213673.html
06-11-2021||India||Accident compensation claims to be settled via mediation, Supreme Court told||The Union government and insurance companies have agreed to settle payment of compensation to victims of road accidents through mediation that may at best take over three months, the Supreme Court was told last week.A report on the proposed mechanism of mediation suggested that “trained mediators” engage both the claimant and the insurance company to arrive at a “just and reasonable” compensation and ensure an amicable settlement. The report, prepared by additional solicitor general (ASG) Jayant Sud, was presented before a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh on October 26. The court will consider the suggestions during the next hearing on November 16.The court was informed about the proposed mechanism at a time it was considering passing directions for speedy resolution of cases pending under the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT). As per the National Judicial Data Grid, nearly 25% of over 7.36 lakh MACT cases remained in the trial stage for more than three years. Of the total, at least 650 have been delayed for over two decades.In his report, Sud highlighted how the alarming situation of pendency of motor accident claims has choked the entire justice delivery system. “...further directions may be passed for not only speedy disposal of motor accident claims but also to ensure that the award amount reaches the victims expeditiously and without any deductions,” the report said.The report suggested that the insurer files the offer for settlement before MACT within 30 days of receipt of the detailed accident report from police or MACT. “Within a week after receiving the offer, the Tribunal shall refer the claimant and insurer to the Motor Accident Mediation Cell or Online Dispute Centre to consider the insurance company’s offer,” it said. Following this, trained mediators shall engage both the claimant and the insurance company to arrive at a “just and reasonable” compensation based on the principles for computing compensation as laid down by the courts in the past, it added.The report said the Mediation Cell or Online Dispute Centre will have to submit a report to MACT within 30 days, indicating the consent of parties and the justification for arriving at the proposed compensation. The parties will also have the option to refuse the offer during mediation. If the parties arrive at an amicable settlement, the MACT will act upon the Mediation Cell’s report and pass an order, recording consent of both parties before closing the case, the report said.From the time the insurer gets details of the case to make a settlement offer till the final decision by MACT, the process is expected to take less than three months, provided the time-frame under the suggested scheme is scrupulously followed. The suggestions can be implemented after the court’s approval, it added. Sud also said that a framework must be prepared by the law ministry to appoint mediators and decide on the fees payable to them.“Till the time such framework is made, one-half of fees prescribed as per the Fourth Schedule of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, can be considered,” the ASG told the court.The report also proposed that the mediation fees shall be paid by the insurance firm if the settlement amount is below ₹25 lakh. In cases involving amounts over ₹25 lakh, the burden of fees shall be borne jointly by the claimant and insurance firm, it added. The top court had earlier allowed the General Insurance Council (GIC) to launch a mobile application where first information reports (FIRs), detailed accident reports and photographs can instantly be uploaded by police and MACTs across the country. The mechanism will allow uniform access to insurance companies for speedy processing of claims.The GIC, an umbrella body of 43 public and private insurance firms, was on October 26 included as a party to the court proceedings. “Settling dispute through mediation is an excellent thing but you need trained mediators who can provide ‘fair and just compensation’, a requirement under Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act. It should not be an attempt to coerce people into accepting whatever the insurance company has to offer. For this, there is need to create a pool of retired trial court judges which can inspire confidence in the mediation process,” Supreme Court advocate Gaurav Agrawal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accident-compensation-claims-to-be-settled-in-3-months-as-per-new-proposal-101636112414333.html
06-11-2021||India||Eye on Taliban: India to host regional summit on Afghanistan on November 10||India will host the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan on November 10, bringing together senior security officials of regional countries to discuss developments in Kabul following the Taliban takeover, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.India had formally invited the NSAs of Russia, Iran, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan for the meeting.However, Pakistan’s National Security Adviser (NSA), Moeed Yusuf, on Tuesday, said he will not attend. A formal response to an invitation to China is also awaited, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity on Friday.Islamabad’s decision is not being perceived as a dampener in New Delhi, as Russia, Iran and key Central Asian states have confirmed their participation in the meeting that will be chaired by India’s NSA Ajit Doval. This will also be the first time that all Central Asian countries – and not just Afghanistan’s immediate land neighbours, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – are participating in discussions in this format, the people cited above said.Also Read: Bomb targets Taliban, kills two in IS-K hub“There has been an overwhelming response to India’s invitation,” one of the people said. “The enthusiastic response is a manifestation of the importance attached to India’s role in regional efforts to promote peace and security in Afghanistan,” the person said.Two earlier meetings in this format were held in Iran in September 2018 and December 2019. The third meeting in India could not be held as scheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The upcoming meeting is being seen as part of Indian efforts to remain relevant in addressing the fallout of the developments in Afghanistan.Though Pakistan has not formally responded to India’s invitation to the meeting, Yusuf told a news briefing in Islamabad on Tuesday that he would not attend.“I will not be going,” Yusuf said after a meeting with his Uzbek counterpart Victor Makhmudov.“A spoiler cannot try to be a peacemaker,” he added, in an apparent reference to India. Yusuf also told the briefing that Pakistan has identified India as a hurdle to regional efforts to establish peace and security.The person cited above described Pakistan’s decision as “unfortunate but not surprising”. The person added, “It reflects [Pakistan’s] mindset of viewing Afghanistan as its protectorate. Pakistan has not attended the previous meetings of this format.”Yusuf’s comments against India were an unsuccessful attempt to deflect attention from Pakistan’s “pernicious role in Afghanistan”, the person said.The high-level participation in the upcoming meeting also reflects the widespread and growing concern of regional countries about the situation in Afghanistan and their desire to consult and coordinate with each other, the people said. India has an important role to play in this process, they added.The Indian government has cautioned the global community not to rush into any formal recognition of the set-up created in Kabul by the Taliban following the group’s takeover of the country in mid-August. It has also urged the international community to ensure that the Taliban deliver on their commitments that Afghan soil will not be used by terror groups, especially Pakistan-based organisations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Islamabad has also not acted on New Delhi’s proposal to ship 50,000 tonnes of wheat as humanitarian aid to Afghanistan via Pakistani soil. India has insisted that all humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people should be routed through the UN and international organisations and distributed without discrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-taliban-india-to-host-regional-summit-on-afghanistan-on-november-10-101636112114318.html

06-11-2021||Today's||On Covid-19 vaccination, don’t be complacent||The one billion Covid-19 vaccine dose landmark is a significant achievement, but it shouldn’t eclipse the long way ahead. The government plans to fully vaccinate the entire adult population by December. This represents 940 million people or 1.8 billion doses — not including potential booster doses or children’s vaccination. At the current pace, it will take five months to complete this target. But the more the vaccination rate increases, the more challenging it becomes to vaccinate the remaining groups.
