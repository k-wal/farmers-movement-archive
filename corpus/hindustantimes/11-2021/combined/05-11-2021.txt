It started from early evening and went on till after midnight. I called the police control room and the station house officer concerned several times, but I did not get a proper response. Around 10.30pm, I called the emergency number 112 as I was having respiratory problems, but I did not get a response. The festival turned into a health hazard for the elderly and sick,” Parimal Bardhan, a 75-year-old resident of H Block in DLF Phase-1, said. Ruchika Sethi, a resident of Sector 50, said she made several calls to the police to stop bursting of crackers near her locality but to no avail. “On Diwali day, it did not seem like there was a ban on bursting of crackers at all. From 8.30pm to around 10.30pm, I kept calling the police officials, who were also busy on rounds, but bursting of crackers did not stop. On Friday morning, the officials inspected the area and admonished residents against whom complaints were made. After that, bursting of crackers reduced significantly in and around the society. However, firecrackers are being incessantly burst in neighbouring Tigra village today (Friday) evening.” The police officials said that they had formed 29 teams who were on rounds across the city, but that they did not book anyone on the day of the festival. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said, “We had formed 29 teams who were continuously patrolling the city. There might have been a delay in attending to the complaints of residents as we were getting a lot of calls and teams were being immediately sent to the spots. We received at least 244 calls from residential areas across Gurugram on Thursday regarding bursting of crackers.” Health experts also raised concerns about the increased pollution levels during Diwali. Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said, “As usual, this Diwali also, the air quality is becoming poor. There is already a rise in number of respiratory cases like viral pneumonia, asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] attacks and chest infections. They present with breathing difficulty, cough, fever, increased sputum and sleep disturbances. People should wear masks, continue preventive therapies and consider vaccination for flu and pneumonia after consulting a doctor. They should restrict outdoor activities to a minimum.”Dr Ashutosh Shukla, senior director for internal medicine and medical advisor, Max Hospital, said, “People need to be extra vigilant over the next few days as these high air pollution levels will take around a week to clear. On high pollution days, the best thing you can do to reduce your exposure to air pollution is to avoid main roads and busy streets when possible. Wearing face masks has become a routine amid the pandemic, and is also helpful in avoiding effects of pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/blanket-ban-police-checks-fail-to-dissuade-gurugram-s-firecracker-enthusiasts-101636136358926.html
05-11-2021||Gurugram||Cracker bursting, stubble fires drag down Gurugram’s air quality||An increase in stubble burning and extensive use of firecrackers, despite a ban in the National Capital Region, on Diwali dragged down the air quality in the city to the ‘severe’ levels of the Central Pollution Control Board’s classification, with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 472 on Friday. This was also the worst air quality recorded around Diwali since 2016, as per the CPCB data.On Thursday, Gurugram’s AQI was 395 (‘very poor’), which was already on the brink of ‘severe’ levels, also the worst reading recorded on Diwali since 2016, according to the data. The air quality in the city started deteriorating on Thursday evening, with levels of particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5) increasing and reaching severe levels of concentration after 9pm.Officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) attributed the spike in pollution to the bursting of crackers in the city, while experts pointed to an increase in stubble fires.Despite a complete ban on the sale and use of all kinds of crackers in 14 Haryana districts located in the National Capital Region (NCR), there was widespread use of crackers not only in the city but also in neighbouring Delhi and NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh.S Narayanan, member-secretary of HSPCB, said, “Along with unfavourable weather conditions, the spike in air pollution levels is mostly due to bursting of crackers across the region. I am yet to get the complete report on how many challans were issued for bursting of crackers and the exact impact, but looking at the 24-hour average, it can be concluded that this is due to bursting of crackers. In the past 24 hours, increase in farm fires in the state have also been marginal, with around 100 cases increasing, but the change of air quality today (Friday) is quite steep compared to Thursday; so it is mainly crackers that have contributed to it.”The official said that on Thursday, the state recorded 228 farm fires and on Friday, there were 331 cases of farm fires.A weather bulletin issued on Friday evening by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR stated, “The contribution from firecrackers, biomass burning and unfavourable weather conditions brought AQI in severe category.”The air quality, however, is likely to improve on Saturday and Sunday, due to a prediction of strong winds, and remain in the ‘very poor’ category, with PM 2.5 as the primary pollutant. The contribution of biomass burning is also likely to increase as winds will be westerly from Friday onwards.Experts said that the bursting of crackers intensified the accumulation of pollutants in the lower levels of the atmosphere.Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said, “Cracker bursting intensified the PM2.5 accumulation at the lower atmosphere in night hours, which lead to peak values of PM2.5 crossing 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) mark at most of the locations in the National Capital Region. But as the relative index AQI has a maximum limit of 500, which means whether it’s 501 or 50,001, the air is hazardous. Smog was also visible in the morning and poor wind allowed particles to stay afloat in the breathing space, as dispersion is not fast. These toxic compounds can cause severe health hazards.”Meanwhile, Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer for HSPCB for Gurugram (north) said that two additional sensors were installed in sectors 48 and 25 for monitoring air quality levels seven days before and after Diwali.“To understand the exact impact of different factors, such as vehicular emissions and dust, two additional sensors have also been set up where we are monitoring all the parameters. This year, we saw that with decrease in temperature and wind speed late evening around 11pm, the air quality index levels started increasing. The pollution levels were higher during the night hours compared to day hours on Thursday,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cracker-bursting-stubble-fires-drag-down-gurugram-s-air-quality-101636136357371.html

Action has been taken in colonies located in sectors 1 to 57,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner. In another development, officials said that a building in DLF Phase-2, where violations were carried out, was sealed on Wednesday. DTCP officials said that changes to the structure were carried out by the owner after obtaining occupancy certificate.“The owner of the house had made rooms in stilts and extended the cupboards in the balconies of the floors.

They were demanding action against the accused and financial help for the treatment of the victims. As finance and taxation minister Manpreet Singh Badal was the chief guest at the function, police did not allow the families to reach the venue. The protesters alleged that Congress workers had also manhandled them for agitating. Prahlad Kumar, a relative of the victim, stated that a Hyundai i20 car had hit a three-wheeler with seven passengers, including two children and the driver, outside Basti Jodhewal police station on October 31.

05-11-2021||Kolkata||Mentoring Mamata Banerjee and much more, Subrata Mukherjee was man for all seasons||As the Indian tricolour flew at half-mast across West Bengal and the police offered a gun salute, veteran politician and Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Subrata Mukherjee, 75, was cremated in Kolkata on Friday evening. Even as politicians cutting across parties and Mukherjee’s fans and followers - to whom he was ‘Subrata Da’ or, simply ‘Dada’ (elder brother) – lamented the end of a chapter in Bengal’s Congress-era politics, those who knew the veteran closely during his five-decade-long career had recollections of an ever-smiling person who lived beyond parties and regiments, loved sweets and sports and believed in ghost stories. Despite holding the still unbroken record of becoming Bengal’s youngest minister at the age of 26 in 1972, Mukherjee never lost relevance because he remained grounded, his colleagues said. For most people, Mukherjee, who is survived by his wife Chhandabani, was a wonder because the son of a teacher from South 24 Parganas district came to Kolkata’s Bangabasi College to study anthropology in the 1960s when politics adopted him and pushed his career to the pinnacle. “Bengal was going through political turbulence at that time. The Naxalites were rising. Subrata Da became a close follower of the prolific Congress student front leader Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi. They toured every district and strengthened the student units. This helped the Congress come to power in 1972. Dasmunsi died in 2017 after a prolonged illness. We have lost the second architect of that success,” said author and college professor Nirbed Roy, who, like Mukherjee, left the Congress and joined TMC. Dasmunsi and Mukherjee were both known to be close to Indira Gandhi because of their leadership role in Bengal. In 1972, chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray, who was often described as the architect of the Emergency, appointed Mukherjee deputy minister in as many as 11 departments, including home and information. Mukherjee was also entrusted with the crucial task of vetting reports that the Bengal media published during the Emergency. While he criticised the Emergency later in life, Mukherjee acknowledged that he came to know the media better during those years. “People often don’t realise how important the role of the media is in our society,” Mukherjee told HT a few years ago. “Indira Gandhi was very affectionate towards me. I travelled with her many times. She hated liars and those who she suspected of stealing party funds,” Mukherjee said during an interview to a television channel earlier this year. Dasmunsi and Mukherjee also played a significant role in mentoring Mamata Banerjee and helped her rise as a youth Congress leader, said Congress and TMC veterans. In 1984, when nobody in the Congress was ready to challenge CPI(M)’s Somnath Chatterjee at the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency, Mukherjee proposed Banerjee’s name. She wrested the seat and, at 29, became the youngest member the Parliament had seen till then. Mamata Banerjee broke away from the Congress and formed the TMC in 1998. In 1999, Mukherjee joined her after the Indian National Trade Union Congress, of which he was a national general secretary for 30 years, denied him a second nomination to the International Labour Organisation (ILO). He was elected mayor of Kolkata in 2000 and was soon recognized as one of the best civic administrators the city had seen. He increased revenue generation and solved water logging problems that persisted for decades. “Darkness descended on the night of lights,” murmured the Bengal chief minister at Kolkata’s SSKM hospital on Thursday night when Mukherjee died while Kolkata was celebrating Diwali. She stayed away from the funeral on Friday, saying she could not bear the sight of Mukherjee’s lifeless body. Mukherjee wrested an assembly seat for the first time in 1971, contesting the Ballygunge bypoll. He won the seat again in 1972. Defeated in 1977, when the nation rejected the Congress, Mukherjee made a comeback from Kolkata’s Jorabagan in 1982 and represented it thrice. In 1996, he shifted to the Chowringhee seat and emerged a winner. He won the seat again in 2001, this time for the TMC. Mukherjee had his differences with Mamata Banerjee as well. He left the TMC in 2005 and returned to the Congress but could not win the Chowringhee assembly and Bankura Lok sabha seats in 2006 and 2009 respectively. He returned to the TMC and never looked back although he could not win the Bankura seat in 2019 when the BJP wrested 18 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, creating a record. To the masses, Mukherjee, apart from being a politician for all seasons, was a colourful, dhoti-clad gentleman who held the Ekdalia Evergreen Club community Durga puja in south Kolkata and the famous Mohun Bagan football club close to the heart. “Strangely, he was afraid of ghosts and used to sleep with the lights on,” said TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee. Mukherjee was never hesitant to experiment. Ignoring his signature husky voice, he agreed to act in the lead opposite actress Moon Moon Sen in a 14-part television serial, Chowdhury Pharmaceuticals, in 1989 that was pulled off the air by Doordarshan because officials found the episodes meandering from the sanctioned script. “I have lost a dear friend,” Sen, the actor-turned TMC leader, said on Friday. Incidentally, she wrested the Bankura Lok Sabha seat from the CPI(M)’s Basudeb Acharia in 2014, a feat Mukherjee failed to achieve a decade ago. Mukherjee took oath as a minister for the last time on May 1 after winning his Ballygunge seat by around 72,000 votes, which, again, was a record. Mamata Banerjee put him in charge of four departments, including panchayat and rural development. On May 9, Raj Bhawan said Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar accorded prosecution sanction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against TMC legislator Madan Mitra, Subrata Mukherjee, minister Firhad Hakim and former party leader Sovan Chatterjee. On May 17, Mukherjee was arrested along with the others. “He could not accept the arrest. He used to tell how deeply it hurt him. The episode probably affected his health as well,” said TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh. Couldn’t Subrata Mukherjee be the chief minister of West Bengal, people often asked. “I never aspired for the post because by default I was always the second man in the leadership strata. I love to work in the field. Dasmunsi was my mentor but unlike him, I did not leave the Congress. With Mamata, I always shared a different relationship. So, when the Congress was almost folding up in Bengal, I joined her,” Mukherjee said in an interview after winning the Ballygunge seat six months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mentoring-mamata-banerjee-and-much-more-subrata-mukherjee-was-man-for-all-seasons-101636134138462.html
05-11-2021||Chandigarh||Will move resolution against Tytler in Vidhan Sabha: Sukhbir||Attacking the Congress for appointing Jagdish Tytler, whose name had earlier figured in connection with the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, as one of the 37 permanent invitees to the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday said that his party will move a resolution in the forthcoming special assembly session on November 8, demanding action against the Gandhi family. Sukhbir, along with Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Jagir Kaur, reached Ludhiana to attend a ceremony at Gurdwara Sri Singh Sabha, Dugri. Addressing a press conference along with the victims of the 1984 riots, Sukhbir said that SAD MLAs will propose the resolution, which hopefully would be passed unanimously. “I am surprised that even when it is clear that Gandhi family had orchestrated the attack on Sikhs and their properties in November 1984, no action had been taken against them even after 37 years. Tytler, who is a key accused in the anti-Sikh riots, should immediately be put behind bars,” he added. Taking a dig at Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, the SAD president said that he should clear his stance on Tytler’s appointment to a top Congress panel. “They should tell the people of Punjab why they supported his appointment. I urge all the Sikhs in the state to boycott the Congress,” he added. The SAD chief further said that the Punjab CM should follow the pattern of other states and the Centre and slash VAT on petrol and diesel by ₹10 per litre. He said that since the CM claimed that Punjab treasury is full, he should not have any problem in effecting an immediate reduction in state VAT on petrol and diesel prices.Badal further claimed that if brought to power, the SAD-BSP government would form a welfare board to address the grievances of the victims of the anti-Sikh riots. Meanwhile, commenting on Punjab transport minister Raja Warring, Sukhbir said he was acting in a vindictive manner against Akali leaders and he won’t take action against any buses owned by Congress leaders. Badal, meanwhile, appointed Ludhiana-based industrialist Gurmeet Singh Kular as his adviser on the industrial affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-move-resolution-against-tytler-in-vidhan-sabha-sukhbir-101636134076731.html

05-11-2021||Chandigarh||AQI plummets as smoke chokes Ludhiana on Diwali||The bursting of crackers turned the city into a gas chamber and did more damage than the stubble burning, indicates the air quality index (AQI) that turned from bad to worse on Diwali.Despite strict guidelines from the authorities to control pollution and limit the timing of bursting of crackers, the pollution level remained on the higher side on Diwali as compared to last year. In 2019 and 2020, Diwali saw the maximum AQI at 263 and 346 points, whereas this year the maximum AQI level crossed over 400 points, showed an air quality website, though the Central Pollution Control Board website showed the peak pollution level at 293 points.The pollution level began to worsen from 3pm on Thursday when the AQI was recorded at 259 points. However, the density of particulate matter in the air reached 280 points at 8pm. The air quality deteriorated further and crossed over 300 points as the clock struck 10 and reached an alarming level at the midnight. Senior citizens and those suffering from allergies experienced \runny nose and watery eyes while many complained of breathing discomfort. While AQI level was 300 at 10am on Friday, the pollution level improved marginally and was logged at 295 at 1pm.On October 28, 2019, the AQI was 306 points at 7am. However, the AQI was recorded at 346 on the day of Diwali last year. According Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head of department of climate change and agricultural metrology at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), they were now waiting for some western disturbance or strong wind speed, otherwise suspended particulate matter will keep hanging in the air. “We now need to wait for any western disturbance that could bring rain and settle the suspended particulate matter,” she said. Gagnish Singh Khurana, an RTI activist based in the city, claimed that Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (CAAQMS) installed at PAU, Ludhiana, showed varying readings throughout the night of Diwali. “It is pertinent to mention here that there are three available methods of observing AQI. First being PAU website, then CPCB website and third one is Purple Air, where one can select Ludhiana and PAU monitoring stations and easily observe the AQI prevalent in Ludhiana at a given time,” he added. Khurana claimed that the data were being displayed differently at the websites mentioned above.As pert the AQI standards, the air quality between 0-50 is considered ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, 201-300 ‘poor’, 301-400 ‘very poor’, and 401-500 ‘severe’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aqi-plummets-as-smoke-chokes-ludhiana-on-diwali-101636133356373.html
05-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: 43 distress calls keep firefighters on their toes on Diwali||Forty-three distress calls kept the firefighters of Ludhiana busy on Diwali. At least 11 incidents of fire at fabric and hosiery factories in Shivpuri, Kali Sarak, Focal Point, Azad Nagar, Dhuri Line, Rama Road, and Upkar Nagar were reported on Thursday evening, officials said. Other than these, seven calls were received pertaining to fire in residential areas and a few incidents were witnessed at vacant plots, garbage dumps, shops and houses. Though no casualty was reported according to the officials, goods and machinery worth lakhs were gutted.In one such major fire accident at a hosiery factory located in Santokh Nagar’s Street 9, Shivpuri, entire stock of goods, including jackets and sweatshirts, kept on the ground floor was gutted after a sky cracker landed on them through the grilles of a ventilator around 8.30pm. The furniture of the shop along with a shed in the factory and heavy machinery perished in the fire. “We have lost our complete stock which was ready for sale for the winter season. Everything placed on the ground floor has been destroyed. We were already struggling with finances amid the Covid pandemic and now this fire has left us devastated,” said Parvesh Tyagi, brother of the owner. He added that children were bursting crackers on the street outside his factory. Meanwhile, MC zonal commissioner Jasdev Sekhon said that fire department teams did well to control the situation, but the narrow lanes of the area and cars parked in the passage caused a lot of trouble for the fire tenders to reach the spot. In another similar case, a fire broke out at Adi Knit Fab factory located on Kali Sarak, where goods worth lakhs were gutted. Rajinder Singh, leading fireman in Ludhiana, said it took around two hours to douse the violent flames. “The reason behind the incident is yet to be ascertained, but it took four fire tenders to douse the blaze,” said the fireman. Additional fire officer Swaran Chand said the fire team received the first call at 7.30pm related to a fire in a shop at Dana Mandi and the last distress call was made at 4.30 am.“Since our teams were already deputed at the prime locations in the district, we managed to control the situation in time. At least 150 fire tenders were used to extinguish the flames on Diwali, Chand said. The Ludhiana fire department that is equipped with 17 big fire tenders, four small fire tenders and four motorbikes to control the blaze, is struggling with shortage of staff. Electrician dies of power shockAn electrician was electrocuted to death while installing LED lights at a house in Iqbalganj area on the occasion of Diwali, police said on Friday. The victim has been identified as Ajay Kumar, 23, of Kutbewal in Jalandhar.ASI Sahib Singh, who is investigating the case, said that Ajay used to install Diwali lights on houses. “Some of the families of Iqbalganj area had called on him to decorate their houses with fancy lights,” he added.

Sale and consumption of liquor is banned in Bihar since April 2016. West Champaran and Gopalganj have recorded 13 and 11 deaths, respectively, in the twin hooch tragedies around Dipawali, an official said. West Champaran’s superintendent of police (SP) Upendra Nath Verma confirmed four more deaths in the district took place after the ninth death reported late Thursday evening. “We are waiting for the post-mortem report to reach any conclusion. Prima facie, these deaths appear to have occurred due to the consumption of poisonous substances,” he said, adding that nine others who had taken ill after consumption of alleged hooch in the district were undergoing treatment. In Gopalganj, four people were under treatment after consumption of suspected hooch. A station house officer (SHO) and a police chowkidar have been suspended in West Champaran following the incident, SP Verma said, adding that three persons have been arrested and five others detained for questioning. West Champaran district magistrate Kundan Kumar said, “Medical teams have been deployed for check-ups and raids are going to arrest the other accused.” This is the second such incident in West Champaran since July this year. At least 16 people died and four others lost eye sight due to consumption of spurious liquor in villages of Lauriya and Ramnagar block in July this year. In Gopalganj, officials said over a dozen villagers complained of nausea, headache, vomiting and vision issues in Kushar village of the district after allegedly consuming spurious liquor, and were rushed by their kin to private hospitals in Gopalganj and Motihari. “The SHO (Shashi Ranjan Kumar) of Mohammadpur police station and a chowkidar have been suspended,” said Anand Kumar, superintendent of police (SP), Gopalganj. In all, 20 people have been arrested in the Gopalganj case, he said. In a related development, a joint team of Gopalganj police and excise department conducted raids on 63 locations and seized 572 litres of liquor, both countrymade and Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL). The Gopalganj district administration has prepared the list of suspected liquor consumers across the district. “With the help of chowkidar and police officials, all the suspected liquor consumers have been identified and a list has been prepared. Those found drunk would be arrested,” said Dr Nawal Kishor Choudhary, district magistrate (DM), Gopalganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-hooch-deaths-6-more-die-toll-at-24-101636130177709.html
05-11-2021||Other||Special land survey in Bihar to be completed by Dec 2023||PATNAThe ongoing special survey for updating land records being carried out in a phased manner across Bihar will be completed by December 2023, state’s revenue and land reforms department informed chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday.The comprehensive survey is being conducted after an aerial survey to reduce land dispute cases, update records of transfers of ownership and better upkeep of land records. The CM was chairing a review meeting on initiatives being taken by the revenue and land reforms department, which was attended by revenue and land reforms department minister Ram Surat Kumar, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, additional chief secretary (revenue and land reforms) Vivek Kumar Singh and other officials. As per an official press release, the ACS (revenue and land reforms department) briefed the CM on the status of the special survey underway in different parts of the state. The special survey work under phase-1 started in September 2020 at 5228 villages, 207 camps spread over 89 circles in 20 districts while under phase-2, work started in July 2021 at 4,668 villages, 197 camps in 90 circles spread over 20 districts. “Under phase -3, survey will start in around 10,000 villages in 114 circles covering 18 districts,” the ACS said during his presentation. In Bihar, the last cadastral survey, a process to ascertain land boundaries of through manual survey, was held 1911, during the British rule. In the last one century, a few revisional surveys have been held. During thr review meeting, the chief minister recounted how maximum number of complaints received during his early days of “Janata ke durbar mein Mukhyamantri” in 2006 after coming to power were related to land dispute cases, which prompted his government to make new legislation and also carry out the special survey. He said 60% of the crime incidents are related to land disputes. Consolidation of land holdingsThe revenue and land reforms department has started giving a push to the land consolidation exercise, a process where land holdings of a person scattered in different places could be readjusted to make a consolidated land holding for the land owner. This can be done when there is consensus among residents of any village with other villages to opt for exchange of land parcels to make it one consolidated land tract by mutual agreement and valuation of land. Revenue and land reforms minister Ram Surat Kumar said a software was being developed through the help of IIT-Roorkee, which would help in accurate measurement of the land to be exchanged among different parties and their valuation as per circle rate. The minister said the use of the software would minimise the role of amins (officials who assist in survey work) and also weed out manipulation in identifying the land and its plot size to be readjusted. The practice of land consolidation was prevalent in 1970s in Bihar, with a large number of villagers opting for exchange of their small land parcels to make a big land holding in the vicinity of their villages. Land consolidation also helps increase agricultural yield of crops and income of farmers. “We are keen on popularising land consolidation process as it is good for farming. We will give it momentum once the survey work gets completed in phases as updation of land records is required. The work is going on,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/special-land-survey-in-bihar-to-be-completed-by-dec-2023-101636130176961.html

Minister for excise and prohibition, Sunil Kumar, acknowledged 21 deaths occurred due consumption of spurious liquor. “We are not trying to hide anything. Whatever the truth, it is presented before the media,” he said. The minister said the state government is enforcing prohibition laws with all seriousness and more than 700 employees of excise department have been suspended for laxity in enforcing the law.The Opposition, meanwhile, alleged a nexus between the liquor mafia and officials. Leader of opposition in state assembly, RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, said liquor smugglers were calling the shots in Bihar government. “More than 50 deaths have occurred due to spurious liquor in the last three days only under the rule of those who harp on prohibition. Instead of acting tough on mafias, smugglers and erring officials, CM is himself threatening to teach a hard lesson to drinkers,” said Yadav.

Gaya recorded cleaner air with “satisfactory” air quality. National capital Delhi recorded “severe” air quality, with index value of 462.On Diwali, Patna’s AQI hovered between 240 to 270 9 pm onwards.Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) is conducting 14-day special monitoring in Patna to assess air and noise pollution before and after Diwali from October 28 to November 7 and analysis report will be released by November 10, said an official.BSPCB’s chairman Ashok Ghosh said, “AQI in the state seems better in comparison to last year’s Diwali. Overall AQI remained ‘poor’ in Patna on Diwali for two years in a row but index value stood at 233 this year which was 276 last year.” “Ban imposed on crackers bursting remained ineffective in the state as fireworks sight and sound were visible commonly. Muzaffarpur’s worst AQI indicates high rate of cracker bursting while the state capital may have witnessed comparatively lower cracker bursting”, he said.Ghosh said Bihar’s air quality, however, is much better than Delhi and adjoining regions post-Diwali due to meteorological conditions.“Weather transition has accelerated in northern region but it’s slow in Bihar. This can be one of the major factors for vast difference in air quality of Delhi and Bihar. Air quality is likely to deteriorate in coming days after onset of winter season,” he said.Ankita Jyoti, senior programme officer at Centre of Environment and Energy Development (CEED), said, “There is hardly any improvement in air quality of the state from last year during Diwali festivities. Though overall air quality of Patna is categorised ‘poor’ but several air monitoring stations in recorded ‘severe’ air quality for long hours on Diwali and post Diwali.”“Ban on crackers were totally ineffective as crackers were easily accessible locally. We need to bring behavioural change in public by regular sensitisation before imposing ban as several people burst crackers just to flout the norms. We need to aware masses about hazardous impact of firecrackers and their impact on environment,” she said.

05-11-2021||Lucknow||Gaikwad continues his good run with the willow||Fearless batting seems to have become a habit for young batter Ruturaj Gaikwad, whose good run with the willow continued even on Friday as he stroked his second half-century to help Maharashtra win their first game (against Punjab) in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy here. Having scored a 30-ball 51, laced with eight boundaries and a six against Tamil Nadu in the opening match of the Elite Group A on Thursday, Gaikwad was on song on Friday and his 54-ball 80, which contained eight boundaries and three mighty sixes, remained a treat to watch. The batter, who scored 419 runs for the side last season and remained the second highest run getter in the tournament behind Devdutt Padikkal (580 runs) got down to business from the very second ball of the innings. He cut, drove and pulled at ease against all the six bowlers of Punjab. With a crashing four through the covers on a full-pitched delivery off pacer Sanvir Singh, on the very second ball of the innings, Gaikwad, who scored the most runs in the IPL in the 14th season and won the Orange Cap, made his intentions very clear on the red soil pitch of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium. Before hitting Siddharth Kaul’s over pitched delivery on the leg side for another cracking boundary, Gaikwad pulled Arshdeep Singh’s slower one for a boundary in the fine leg region. He didn’t allow spinners Abhishek Sharma and Mayank Markandey to settle, hitting powerful sixes, including the one in the extra cover area, which also helped the batter complete his 15th fifty in this format of the game in the 60th encounter. By the time Gaikwad, who added 85 runs for the second-wicket with Naushad Shaikh (23, 23b, 1x4) and 48 runs for the third wicket with Azim Kazi (28*, 26b, 2x4), offered a straight catch to substitute Karan Kaila off Kaul at point in the 17th over, Maharashtra were within distance to win the 138-run chase. Earlier, Punjab never got going, as barring opener Shubhman Gill (44, 39b, 3x4, 1x6) and stylish Gurkeerat Mann(41, 32b, 2x4, 2x6), others kept struggling against a disciplined Maharashtra bowling attack. Both Divyang Hinganekar (2/17) and Asha Palkar (2/30) kept bowling on right spots to keep Punjab batters in check before restricting them for 137/6. Meanwhile on the B Ground, defending champions Tamil Nadu scored their second consecutive win in the tournament, defeating Odisha in a one-run thriller. BRIEF SCORES Punjab 137/6 in 20 overs (S Gill 44, G Mann 41, D Hinganekar2/17, A Palkar 2/30) lost to Maharashtra 138/3 in 17.3 overs (R Gaikwad 80, A Kazi 28*, A Sharma 1/13).

A crucial run out of all-rounder Saurabh Kumar (20, 15b, 1x4, 1x6) in the 18th over changed Uttar Pradesh’s fortunes.Uttar Pradesh’s wickets fell at regular intervals. Opener Abhishek Goswami was trapped in front of the wicket on the very first ball of the innings by Unadkat and by the time the six-over power play could come to an end, two more batters Madhav Kaushik and skipper Karan Sharma were back in the pavilion, scoring identical 13 runs.India’s captain at the Under-19 World Cup in 2019, Priyam Garg, once again failed with willow. After scoring just nine in the game against Chandigarh on Thursday, Garg could score just 10 in 13 balls with the help of one boundary before being stumped by Sheldon Jackson of DA Jadeja. Former UP skipper Akshdeep Nath tried to accelerate the run-scoring, striking run-a-ball 19 with two fours, but his innings was cut short by Unadkat, who forced the batter for an easy catch to Parth Bhut.Saurashtra batters were on target from the very first ball, for after being invited to bat first on the easy surface of Gurugram Cricket Ground, they raced to 51/0 in just 30 balls. Openers Himalaya (23, 22b, 5x4) and Vishvarajsinh Jadeja (26, 20b, 2x4, 1x6) laid a solid foundation, stitching together 53 runs for the first wicket. Thereafter, Prerak Mankad (34*, 30b, 3x4) and Samarth Vyas (29, 28b, 2x4, 2x6) kept the scoreboard ticking and helped the side post a challenging 147/7 in 20 overs.Pacers Mohsin Khan (2/31) and Shivam Mavi (2/32) bowled well, whereas left-arm orthodox spinner Shivam Sharma bagged 2/20.

Urging people to wear masks to protect themselves from both Covid and pollution, Guleria said bad air can also have a major impact on respiratory health, especially on people with lung diseases and asthma.“Pollution can lead to more severe cases of Covid. Should wear a mask as it will help in protection from both Covid-19 and pollution. It has a huge effect on respiratory health especially on people with lung diseases, asthma as their disease worsens,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Pollution has a huge effect on respiratory health especially on ppl with lung diseases, asthma as their disease worsens. Pollution can also lead to more severe cases of Covid. Should wear mask as it'll help in protection from both Covid & pollution: Dr Randeep Guleria, AIIMS Dir pic.twitter.com/T02hYub3kuThe AIIMS director also talked about the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) emergency use listing of Covaxin calling it a “proud moment for our country”. “We've got approval for a made in India vaccine. Earlier India was a vaccine manufacturing hub but in the last 18 months, we've shown that we can do a lot of high-quality research also,” Guleria said.Delhi witnessed a record rise in air quality index (AQI), which rose to 462, on Friday evening, the highest since 2016. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) blamed opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for encouraging people to burst crackers despite a blanket ban being put in place by the government.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai also accused Opposition parties of giving a “religious colour” to the issue of a cracker ban. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier urged people to not burst firecrackers till January 1.The BJP, however, hit back at AAP, alleging that Delhi’s pollution levels were in the “hazardous zone” before Diwali and the current predicament is not due to bursting firecrackers."Delhi's AQI was in a hazardous zone even before the crackers came out. Anyone suggesting otherwise is trying to make Arvind Kejriwal look good, who has unleashed a diabolical campaign to dissuade Delhiites from bursting crackers. Poor air quality is a result of anything BUT Diwali," BJP’s national IT in-charge Amit Malviya wrote in a tweet on Friday.Air quality in the national capital was expected to drop rapidly as stubble burning in the neighbouring states coincided with Diwali. Around 9pm on Thursday the national capital’s AQI dropped to ‘severe’ for the first time this year.An analysis done by Hindustan Times suggested that air quality will marginally improve from Sunday evening and fluctuate within the ‘very poor’ range. It also found firecrackers to be the major contributing factor in deterioration of air quality in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-aiims-director-warns-against-severe-cases-of-covid-worsening-lung-ailments-101636124802243.html

The UP rural development department, aiming for higher women’s participation in MGNREGS, has trained 18,000 Mahila Mates and deployed 3,010 on job sites.Mahila Mates are women assistants for management and supervision of MGNREGS jobs and job sites.So, how is UP the worst performer? And how would Mahila Mates make a difference?During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019-20, Uttar Pradesh had employed a whopping 1.11 crore people under the MGNREGA, but the workforce was male-dominated.“The state had generated only 32.52% of women person-days of the 30.55 crore person-days of work generated in the year. At the 28th position, UP was the lowest in the country with only J&K and Lakshadweep ranking lower on the women’s employment index under the MGNREGS. But then we decided to bring in a change. Mahila Mates was one of the top ideas for this”, said Yogesh Kumar, additional commissioner, MGNREGS, UP.In March, this year, the rural development department announced that it will appoint Mahila Mates on job sites. By June, the appointment process was completed, and till now 18,000 Mahila Mates who were selected have been trained. Of these, 3,010 have begun working on their respective job sites.“We believe that the Mahila Mate concept will go a long way in increasing women’s participation in the rural employment scheme. First of all, these 18,000 Mahila Mates are getting direct employment in the scheme. Secondly, once the women in villages know that job sites are being managed by women, it will inspire women in villages to opt for work under the scheme because job sites headed by women will change the social structure of a job site and address the hesitancy among prospective women workers. We had observed that men-dominated worksites do make women shy from participating in work even if they wanted to,” he said.He said that apart from Mahila Mates, the department is also introducing a few more women-friendly factors in MGNREGS such as creating an all-women worksites and women-specific work projects.The rural development department had ordered that all job sites with less than 40 workers will have a Mahila Mate to supervise the site and work there. Sites with more than 40 workers will have two Mahila Mates.To make the appointment fast and smooth, the department had selected the Mahila Mates from existing women SHGs (self-help groups) in the panchayats.Kerala, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu were the top-ranking states offering women work under MGNREGS with 91.41%, 87.04%, and 84.88% women person-days respectively last year.During these times of pandemic, with a focus on employment generation under MGNREGS, UP had registered a whopping 87% increase in person-days generated in 2019-20 against the previous year. But women’s share remained unchanged in the last five years.“Yes, over the last five years, women’s participation in the MGNREGS has consistently been low and lower than the national average,” said Yogesh Kumar.The national average in 2019-20 had been 52% women person-days, UP’s was 32.52%. “Now we aim for 34 to 38%,” said Kumar.He said: “Socio-cultural set-up and physical intensive works are inhibiting factors behind the low participation. Women do not like to work at male-dominated worksites and on physically gruelling jobs. So, we have decided to introduce all-women worksites and women-specific works--such as plantation, gardening, nutrition gardens, nurseries or organic cultivations.”All the Mahila Mates that were selected have been trained in how to do their work--making muster roll, record attendance, making a layout for work, measuring of work done, or how to update the work demand, and how to encourage women to work. The department will also promote horticulture, floriculture, vegetable cultivation, animal husbandry, and fisheries under convergence of MGNREGS and the Rural livelihood mission as these jobs are not as physically intensive and also interest women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-women-s-participation-in-mgnregs-backed-by-govt-training-mahila-mates-set-to-attract-rural-workforce-101636125135546.html

Also read: Air quality deteriorates to ‘severe category’ across Haryana after DiwaliThe average AQI of Punjab this Diwali was 268 (poor) as compare to 328 (very poor) in 2020. Jalandhar worst hit, Patiala shows improvementAccording to the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), Jalandhar recorded very poor AQI this time as the ban on firecrackers that was imposed in the district because of poor air quality, went up in smoke with residents flouting it. Last Diwali, the AQI of Jalandhar, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala remained in the very poor category. However, this Diwali, the AQI of only two cities of Amritsar and Jalandhar was in the very poor category. The maximum AQI reduction was observed in Patiala by 27.8% and the minimum was observed in Jalandhar by 0.3%). Punjab saw an average AQI reduction of 18.3% as compared to last year. People adhered to time limit to burst crackers “People followed the time limit fixed for bursting firecrackers. The PPCB thanks people of Punjab for following the advisory and using green crackers this Diwali, resulting in overall improvement in air quality as compared to last year,” PPCB secretary Krunesh Garg said. Six stations were set up in the state to observe the Diwali AQI in real time. The PPCB allowed the window from 8pm to 10pm to burst crackers and urged people to let off only green crackers.

05-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi records worst Diwali since 2016, air quality jumps above 450||The national capital recorded its worst Diwali since 2016 with the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) spiking to a reading of 462 (severe) on Friday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily 4 pm bulletin – a sharp spike from a reading of 382 (very poor) on Diwali day. The last time Delhi had a higher AQI the day-after Diwali was in 2016 when it touched 445 (severe) the very next day.CPCB data shows last year, despite the ban on firecrackers being violated, Delhi’s AQI touched a high of 414 (severe), while it touched 390 (very poor) the day after Diwali in 2018. Experts say firecrackers are not the only contributing factor at the moment as meteorological conditions and a spike in farm fires have played a key role.Professor Sachchida N Tripathi from the civil engineering department at IIT Kanpur, who is also a member of the steering committee for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), says the average PM 2.5 concentration began rising in the last week of October and has shown a steady increase, owing to an increase in farm fires. This, aided by low temperatures, helped trap pollutants over Delhi. “The AQI was already on the rise and if you combine a day of farm fires and firecrackers, there is bound to be a sharp increase in pollution levels,” said Tripathi, stating wind speed is low at the moment, which is keeping ‘haze’ intact.According to the CPCB, an AQI between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and beyond 400 is ‘severe’, with the index capping off at an upper limit of 500.In 2016, Delhi did not have a firecracker ban in place, however, Diwali occurred on October 30, nearly a week earlier. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy says late rains have played a key role this year, pushing the stubble burning period to a short window in November. CPCB data shows this October, with an average AQI of just 173, is the cleanest in the last seven years. “October saw late rains and a late withdrawal of monsoon. Farmers were unable to burn stubble residue then and now you are suddenly seeing a spike in farm fire events. This has coincided with Diwali, creating this season’s first smog event,” said Chowdhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-worst-diwali-since-2016-air-quality-jumps-above-450-101636119736306.html
05-11-2021||Other||‘Winning people is more important than winning elections’: Goa Congress president||Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar spoke to HT about the party’s ability to bounce back from setbacks, the threats faced from rivals and its plans for the upcoming elections. Here are the excerpts from the interview. Q: You have been reduced to four members in the Goa Legislative Assembly. The big question facing your party is can the Congress bounce back?A: Congress has the inbuilt capacity to bounce back and in the past, we have proved it. In 2000, we were reduced to four. A breakaway group led by MLA Francisco Sardinha (present Congress MP from South Goa) split from the party and Sardinha became CM with the support of the BJP. We bounced back and now after these ten people left (the ten that merged with the BJP) we have taken a bold stand for the first time that they will not be taken back as per the wishes of the people of Goa. Our agenda is simple. Winning people is more important than winning elections. The moment you win the people, winning elections becomes easy. I know I had a lot of pressure… somewhere you have to be firm. Our partymen stood by us. Our Delhi leadership stood by us and we are here now. Q: Many of these leaders who left were brought up by the Congress party. Today, almost 90% of the present BJP legislators had a past association or were members of the Congress. Do you think this trend of the Congress grooming leaders, only to have them hijacked by other parties, is a blot on the party? A: The moment your personal greed clashes with your party ideology and the interest of Goa, when you compromise for money, such people cannot be trusted. And that’s why we’ve built a new team. We have brought many youngsters, new faces. We are building them very strong. Even now, some of our members have left (to the TMC). We want to build a very clean Congress and in the process, I feel all these people, whoever wants money, or has greed for money, today or tomorrow, they will leave. It’s better to leave today and we provide that opportunity to others. Nobody is indispensable. Q: How much of a dent do you think parties like TMC, AAP, which have been primarily working in areas where the Congress is strong? A: Nehru ji said, people of Goa are very wise. Why did he say this? He felt that Goans were wise, they will not be carried away and I’m confident that this time also they will not be carried away with TMC’s poster or hoarding campaign. The last time the AAP tried, they projected themselves to be (winning) 35% (of the vote share). They didn’t succeed. Goans are very wise. Unless you serve them, they don’t accept anybody. We had to struggle for 18 years after coming to Goa. People didn’t accept us for 18 years. Only after we started serving them, working for them, did people start believing in us. And that was the same for all the parties. So, you just cannot come overnight and put-up hoardings, and buy people from here and there. A party cannot be built on that.Q: Last time the Congress was not able to form the government, that is now being used as a stick to beat the Congress withA: Last time we never had the chance… the Governor was biased. The BJP converted Raj Bhavan into BJP bhavan. They used her (former Governor Mridula Sinha) to suppress the people’s mandate. As they laid down the principle or precedent that the single largest party is invited to form the government. This was bypassed. Why was it bypassed? Why was the single largest party not invited to form the government? If we failed, then they could have invited the BJP. Try to understand the background. The people of Goa defeated the BJP and you (Governor) have imposed on them the same party against their wishes by using Raj Bhavan, by using the home ministry and by using money power. It was not our mistake. If we had 21, we would have immediately gone and staked a claim. They didn’t have a majority. They bought the number by horse-trading. Actually, we are the victims. We are not the culprits. But the BJP has conveniently made us the culprits when we are the victims. It was our chance to serve the people of Goa who were was robbed. Your house is robbed and you are blamed. It is the same mentality of the BJP when the CM blamed the girl’s parents (for a crime against a girl who was out late at night). They are the victims and the CM made them the culprits by blaming them. This is the BJP culture. Q: Congress has said it is willing to form an alliance against the BJP softening its earlier stance. What prompted this decision? A: We had a discussion in Delhi where our leader Rahul Gandhi and others were present. We explained the present situation in Goa and how we can defeat the BJP and definitely we will move ahead getting those parties who are willing to come on board together. All those options are being exploited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/winning-people-is-more-important-than-winning-elections-goa-congress-president-101636118596356.html

Last year, the AQI on the following day of Diwali was recorded at 435.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government in the national capital had imposed a blanket ban on bursting firecrackers, including green ones, on Diwali and till January 1. However, the prohibition was openly violated by the citizens of the city.On Thursday, around 9pm, the air quality of Delhi dipped to “severe” category for the first time this season. The AQI started increasing as the night rolled on and so did the bursting of firecrackers. By early Friday morning, the Janpath area – located in the central part of the capital, recorded an air quality index in the “hazardous” category, news agency ANI reported. The particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentration was recorded at 655.07 and as per government standards, exceeding the 380-mark is deemed as “severe”.Hindustan Times reported earlier in the day that the PM 2.5 levels over the previous 24 hours in Delhi was also the highest in three years as the capital faced a double whammy of firecracker bursting as well as stubble burning, an analysis of the Union earth science ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) revealed.However, the analysis also showed that the PM 2.5 concentrations in this year’s Diwali was “much less” compared to those recorded in 2018.The air quality in several places of Delhi continue to remain in the “severe” category, according to data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The AQI in Anand Vihar was recorded at 467 at 6pm on Friday, at 443 in Chandni Chowk, at 481 in Jahangirpuri, at 457 in NSIT Dwarka, and at 465 in Sirifort, among other stations.Meanwhile, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that “some people had intentionally” asked the citizens of the capital to burst firecrackers during Diwali. “The Delhi Government has already made several appeals to the people regarding the pollution condition, but opposition parties just for the sake of politics encouraged people to burn firecrackers, which now resulted in deteriorated conditions,” he told reporters on Friday, according to ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/day-after-diwali-delhi-s-aqi-touches-five-year-high-at-462-101636117434157.html

He said the party is neither appreciating Centre’s move nor trying to follow suit in states it rules.“Congress-ruled states and those by their allies have refused to reduce their taxes on petrol and diesel. This shows their anti-people approach. The Congress party here (Karnataka) should clarify if this is the party’s stand. Their governments never reduced it by ₹7. Since Congress-ruled states have not done this, they have no right to talk about it,” Bommai said.The statements come a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government and all other BJP ruled states announced tax cuts.Excise duty on petrol and diesel was reduced by ₹10 and petrol by ₹5, respectively.The Bommai government, in a statement on Thursday, said that diesel was cheaper by ₹19 in Karnataka as a result of cuts both at the centre and state.“Karnataka is the first state to reduce sales tax on petrol and diesel. Diesel prices were reduced from ₹104.50 on 3.11.21 to ₹85.03. Reduction of ₹19.47. Petrol prices were reduced from ₹113.93 on 3.11.21 to ₹100.63. Reduction of ₹13.30,” the chief minister’s office said in a statement.“Karnataka’s share of KST on petrol is reduced from 35% to 25.9% and that on diesel has been reduced from 24% to 14.34% by the virtue of today’s (Thursday’s) notification,” it added.The Congress in Karnataka said that the BJP was forced to reduce prices after it suffered setbacks in the October 30 bypolls across the country and the state.In Karnataka, the BJP lost to the Congress in Hanagal, stealing a victory in Bommai’s home district of Haveri.“Elections will be conducted for Taluk & Zilla Panchayats and BBMP in the coming days.People should remember the lesson taught by @narendramodi & cast their vote against@BJP4India,” Siddaramaiah said in a tweet on Thursday.Bommai said that Congress was criticising it for the sake of it.“They (Congress) say that we lost Hanagal and we (BJP) reduced prices. If I (the government) did it before the elections, they would say that it was done only for the sake of elections.

The liquor ban is just a drama. There are officials and bureaucrats in the system who are running this liquor syndicate,” Jha told news agency ANI.He added that if people are losing their lives in the state and consuming the spurious liquor then it is the “failure of the state government”.“There is no full stop on the ban, the officials of the state government are involved in this,” Jha was quoted as saying.On Friday, the death toll due to the suspected spurious liquor consumption shot up to 12 with six more people losing their lives due to related complications.Superintendent of police (SP) Upendra Nath Verma told Hindustan Times his department is awaiting the post-mortem reports of the latest deceased persons to reach any conclusion. “Prima facie, these deaths appear to have occurred due to the consumption of poisonous substances,” he said.The tragedy was reported for the first time on Thursday when 10 people passed away in West Champaran and Gopalganj districts. While six fatalities were reported from West Champaran, as many as four lives were lost in Gopalganj district.Meanwhile, four persons, including two women, have been arrested and five others have been detained, West Champaran district officials said. Verma said a local station house officer (SHO) Manish Kumar and one chowkidar were suspended owing to the incident.On Friday, Bihar minister Janak Chamar said a conspiracy is underway under the pretext of spurious liquor. “Those who consume it are poor. When action is taken and raids are done, the weak are nabbed…Unfortunate,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Last month, five people died and several others fell ill after consuming spurious liquor in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district.The government, led by Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) had banned manufacture, sale and consumption of all forms of liquor in the state in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-liquor-deaths-rjd-leader-says-nitish-kumar-govt-involved-in-syndicate-101636113711855.html
05-11-2021||Other||BJP Rajya Sabha MP faces protesting farmers’ wrath in Hisar||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Rajya Sabha MP Ram Chander Jangra on Friday faced farmers’ ire at Hisar’s Narnaund town in Haryana where he had gone to inaugurate a community centre (dharamshala). The MP reportedly called the protesters “jobless alcoholics from villages”. Hundreds of farmers gathered near the venue carrying black flags and chanted slogans against the MP. In a scuffle between the Haryana police and farmers protesting against the centre’s three contentious farm laws, the windshield of the MP’s car was also smashed, officials said.The MP accused the farmers of smashing the windshield of his car while the protesters blamed the police. In this entire incident, a farmer identified as Kuldeep Singh of Satrod Khurd village in Hisar district sustained injuries and the protesters rushed him to a nearby hospital where his condition is said to be critical. Few policemen also got injured.A heavy police force was deployed to prevent the farmers from reaching the area but police failed to stop the huge crowd. The farmers also faced heat from the attendees supporting Jangra and both sides chanted slogans against each other, officials said. The Narnaund police have booked three farmers identified as Harsh Deep Gill, Kailash and Sudhir of the district and 20 others under sections 147, 149, 148, 341, 186, 353, 427 and 120-B of the Indian penal code (IPC) for vandalising Jangra’s car. The farmers have launched an indefinite dharna outside the Narnaund police station demanding withdrawal of cases.Farm leader Vikas Sisar, said they were protesting peacefully against MP Jangra and some of his attendees provoked the farmers.“ The people accompanying the MP had thrashed our protestors in which he got injured and is undergoing treatment at Hisar hospital. We have pitched tents at the police station and a large number of farmers will reach here at 11 am to gherao it,” he added.Hansi SP Nitika Gehlout said the farmers protested the MP’s visit and his car’s windshield was damaged in the scuffle.“ We have not resorted to lathi-charge and a protester fell unconscious following which he was rushed to Jindal hospital in Hisar. He was suffering from illness,” the SP added. On Thursday also, the BJP MP faced a similar protest in Rohtak where he had gone to attend a Diwali program. In a purported audio clip that went viral, the MP was allegedly heard saying, “bad elements have been protesting against the government and the recent killing of an innocent Nihang at Singhu border has exposed them. The farmers are not protesting but only bad elements. I have been frequently visiting Delhi and most of the tents at protest sites are empty and this issue will be resolved soon”.Reacting over the incident, Jangra said the incident took place when he was on his way to another function when some miscreants threw sticks on his car, damaging his windshield.“I have spoken to Hansi SP and Haryana Director General of police in this regard. This was a clear murder attempt and police told me that two persons have been detained. I have demanded strict action against the detainees. I had gone to attend social functions when the incident took place. Will they (farmers) protest social functions too?After my car was vandalised, I had to cancel two other social programmes,” the MP added.After the incident, the farmers staged a dharna outside Narnaund police station while other groups blocked the Hisar-Rohtak national highway near Ramayana toll plaza, chanting slogans against the BJP MP, state government and administration.BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni also reached the Narnaund police station and demanded the release of the two farmers.“ We will go back after the police to cancel the FIRs registered against farmers . Jangra has been trying to divide the people on caste lines and he has been using abusive language against the protesters. We have started indefinite dharna at Narnaund police station,” Charuni added.Hansi police PRO Subhash said two detained farmers have been released and the senior police officials are holding meetings with Charuni and other farm leaders to end the dharna.“ We are hoping that the dharna will be lifted after the meeting,” the Hansi Police PRO added.Meanwhile, in a separate incident, former BJP minister, Manish Grover, Rohtak Mayor Man Mohan Goyal and other senior leaders of the BJP were kept hostage at a temple in Kaloi village in Rohtak. The BJP leaders had gone to hear the live telecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech from Kedarnath temple where he had gone to perform ‘aarti’ at the shrine.The farmers protesting against three farm laws locked the main entrance gate of the Shiva temple at Kiloi village and took BJP leaders hostage. A heavy police force was also deployed to maintain law and order and both sides were at loggerheads. After the situation got tense, additional forces from Jhajjar, Sonepat and Jind were called at Kaloi village to keep peace in the village.The farmers claimed that the hours-long stand-off situation ended after BJP leaders climbed on the terrace and apologised. BJP leader Manish Grover, after leaving the temple, said people from some social organization met them and urged them to waive at protesters to end the deadlock.“We did not apologise to anyone. We will continue to visit the shrine,” he added. A spokesperson of the district administration said that the issue has been resolved and was a result of some misunderstanding. According to the spokesperson, after coming out of the Shiv Temple, former minister Manish Grover said that the dispute had arisen due to a misunderstanding. He further elaborated that as soon as the villagers understood the reality, the matter was resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-rajya-sabha-mp-faces-protesting-farmers-wrath-in-hisar-101636111394024.html
05-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi air pollution: Oppn ‘encouraged’ people to burst crackers, says minister||Delhi environment minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator Gopal Rai on Friday hit out at opposition parties for “encouraging” citizens to burst firecrackers on Diwali leading to the deterioration in the national capital’s air quality despite the government’s best efforts.Delhi’s air quality deteriorated rapidly after Diwali as the average air quality index (AQI), rose to 462, the highest since 2016, a day after Diwali. The national capital’s AQI breached the ‘severe’ category around 9pm on Thursday for the first time this year.“Some people had intentionally asked people to burst firecrackers during Diwali. The Delhi Government has already made several appeals to the people regarding the pollution condition, but opposition parties just for the sake of politics encouraged people to burn firecrackers, which now resulted in deteriorated conditions," Rai told reporters on Friday.Rai alleged that even though citizens mostly resisted bursting crackers, some partook in the activity on Diwali after adding “religious colour” to the issue. "Most of the citizens of Delhi didn't burn crackers on Diwali but yes several people after giving religious colour into it, intentionally burned the firecrackers,” Rai saidChief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced a complete ban on firecrackers till January 1, citing the deteriorating air quality in the national capital during winter. Kejriwal’s order was met with resistance from traders’ body which took the matter to Delhi high court but the plea was ultimately turned down.However, experts had cautioned that the ban might not be able to help Delhi’s AQI as people had easy access to crackers being sold in the markets of neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.Stubble burning is also at its peak in the neighbouring states, which adds to the deteriorating air quality. "According to NASA pictures, there are almost 3,500 stubble burning incidents taking place in neighbouring states," Rai said acknowledging the impact of stubble fires on Delhi’s AQI.An AQI of 401 is categorised as ‘severe’. The level of PM 2.5, a common air pollutant, rose to record levels in the last 24 hours, due to a combination of stubble burning and bursting of firecrackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-pollution-oppn-encouraged-people-to-burst-crackers-says-minister-101636110956647.html

I have been asking these questions from day one and raising these issues regularly.” Sidhu went a step further and said: “After three special investigation teams (SITs), seven first information reports (FIRs), two commissions and six years of the sacrilege cases, are these the only officers you could find?

Fire department data shows that in 2019, 245 calls were received until midnight on Diwali. Atul Garg said that among the major fire-related calls received on Diwali was a blaze at a factory in Nilothi in west Delhi, and it was likely not related to firecrackers. For this year’s Diwali, nearly 2,800 personnel of the DFS were deployed across the Capital and 30 fire posts were set up in addition to the existing 64 fire stations in the city, Garg had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-delhi-s-fire-department-gets-152-calls-on-diwali-over-fire-related-incidents-101636087331833.html

Also read: PM Modi unveils Shankaracharya’s statue at KedarnathHaryana additional chief secretary, excise and taxation, Anurag Rastogi said that the reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel meant a per litre decrease of ₹7 in petrol and ₹2 in diesel. “Thus, the total decrease is ₹12 per litre each for petrol and diesel,” he said. Before reduction in taxes a litre of petrol cost ₹106.94, while it now costs ₹94.93 a litre. Similarly, a litre of diesel cost ₹98.60 till Diwali eve and is now available for ₹86.57 per litre .A notification issued by neighbouring Himachal Pradesh government on Thursday said that VAT on petrol and diesel has been cut by 7.5% and 8%, respectively. “Petrol will be cheaper by ₹12 and diesel by ₹17 per litre in the state,” chief minister Jai Ram Thakur tweeted. Before the cut, petrol cost ₹101.88 a litre, while now it costs ₹95.97. A litre of diesel cost ₹88.64 earlier and now costs ₹80.54 per litre. The Centre had reduced excise duty on petrol and diesel on Diwali eve to bring down the prices of the two petroleum products that had crossed the ₹100 per litre mark. Inflation hit BJP campaign in byelections VAT rates differ from state to state, leading to differential rates of fuel. The Centre had urged the states to slash VAT rates to provide relief.

05-11-2021||Patna||24 die in Bihar after consuming suspected spurious liquor||At least 24 people have died and several others fell ill after consuming suspected spurious liquor in Gopalganj and West Champaran districts of Bihar, where total prohibition is in place, in the last two days. Eight persons died on Thursday after allegedly consuming hooch in Telhua village at Bettiah, the headquarters of West Champaran district, while the toll in another incident of consumption of suspected spurious liquor in Gopalganj climbed to 16 on Thursday with six more deaths being confirmed by the district authorities. The administrations of both districts have not confirmed the cause of the deaths so far. The Telhua hooch tragedy is the third incident such incident in north Bihar in the last ten days. Bihar minister Janak Ram rushed to Gopalganj. He later told reporters “I have visited the houses of persons who died allegedly because of consuming spurious liquor. It could be a conspiracy to defame the NDA government.” Gopalganj superintendent of police Anand Kumar said, “Some people have died under mysterious circumstances in Muhammadpur village in the district in the last two days. The cause of their death cannot be confirmed as autopsy reports are still awaited. Three teams are probing the case.” Some of the bodies have been cremated by their families, the local police said. They said that four persons died on Thursday when they were undergoing treatment and another two on way to the hospital. Prima facie these deaths appear to have occured due to the consumption of some poisonous substance and the police have registered a case. Four persons have been arrested in connection with the incident which took place between Tuesday and Wednesday, the police said. Over 20 persons, mostly belonging to scheduled castes, had allegedly consumed spurious liquor being sold by local traders in the area and have been identified by the police. The dead in West Champaran have been identified as residents of wards 2, 3 and 4 of Telhua village. In this incident too the district administration is yet to confirm the reason for their death. West Champran superintendent of police Upendra Nath Verma said that investigation into the case is on and senior officials of the district administration and police are camping at Telhua. Villagers claimed that all the victims had consumed liquor at Chamartoli area of Telhua village on Wednesday evening. “After consuming liquor, the condition of eight of them deteriorated and they were taken to the nearby hospital where they died today”. There are reports that some more villagers who too consumed liquor, have been admitted to different hospitals in the area. Eight persons died since October 28 in a hooch tragedy at Rupauli village in Muzaffarpur district and four are undergoing treatment in different hospitals in Muzaffarpur, officials said. From January till October 31 this year, around 70 people have died and many others lost their sight after consuming alleged spurious liquor in Nawada, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Siwan and Rohtas districts, they said. Nitish Kumar on Monday told reporters in the sidelines of his weekly outreach programme that the ban on alcohol is in the interest of the society. “We introduced prohibition in the state since alcohol is a dirty thing. The ill-effects of liquor get multiplied when consumed in an adulterated form. I know that majority of people are in favour of the liquor ban in the state. There are only a handful of people who violate it”. The Nitish Kumar government had on April 5, 2016 banned the manufacture, trade, storage, transportation, sale and consumption of liquor in the state. The chief minister appealed to the people to cooperate in the mission as "liquor is bad for health and society". Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav alleged that the state government has failed to stop the sale and supply of spurious liquor in the dry state. “Police is disposing of the bodies of the dead without conducting the post-mortem of the dead. Is Nitish Kumar who is making tall claims on prohibition, not responsible for these deaths?” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/24-die-in-bihar-after-consuming-suspected-spurious-liquor-101636086145943.html

05-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality drops to ‘severe’ as Capital marks Diwali with firecrackers||New Delhi’s air quality dropped to the “severe” category on Thursday - at around 9pm - for the first time this season as the Capital celebrated Diwali with people flouting a ban on firecrackers. While New Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 382, which is “very poor”, according to a 4pm bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), calm wind conditions and contribution from stubble burning, which touched a season high of 25% on Thursday, further deteriorated the air quality. By evening, emissions from firecrackers began to be added to New Delhi’s air as the city’s PM 2.5 concentration levels spiked to over 33 times of what is deemed the safe limit. CPCB data showed the 24-hour average AQI touched “severe” at 9pm, gradually rising each hour as a smoky haze enveloped the Capital. The AQI was 404 at 9pm, and then it rose to an average of 422 by midnight, 428 by 2am, 444 by 6am, 446 by 7am, and 451 by 8am on Friday.On Friday, New Delhi’s AQI shot up to 462 - which is in the “severe” category - at 11am. It is predicted that the AQI could rise further.Also Read: Delhi’s air quality recorded in ‘hazardous’ category in some places after DiwaliThe CPCB uses a 24-hour rolling average to ascertain the air quality index of the last 24 hours. The CPCB classifies an AQI of 51-100 as “satisfactory”, 101-200 as “moderate”, 201-300 as “poor”, 301-400 as “very poor” and above 401 as “severe”.Agencies had forecast New Delhi’s air to reach the higher end of the “very poor” category on Diwali, even without firecrackers, as the wind direction changed to northwesterly in the last 24 hours. It meant contribution from stubble burning, which dropped to just 8% on Wednesday, was up at a season-high share of 25% on Thursday. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), run by the ministry of earth sciences, had said in its Diwali forecast that if even 50% of the firecracker load from 2019 was burst this year, the air quality would plunge to “severe” category and would remain in that range on Friday as well. As per SAFAR’s model, the share of stubble burning is expected to touch 35% on Friday and 40% on Saturday. “The extremely calm wind conditions in Delhi, combined with a 25% stubble share (from 2,293 fire counts) are two major factors today,” said SAFAR in its forecast on Thursday. “Relief is expected only from the evening of Saturday, but the AQI will still fluctuate within the ‘very poor’ range.”Okhla Phase 2 in southeast Delhi saw the biggest hourly spike in PM 2.5 concentration on Diwali day as it touched 1,984 micrograms per cubic metre - over 33 times the national standard of 60 micrograms and nearly 397 times the new World Health Organization standard of 5 micrograms. It was followed by Ashok Vihar in north Delhi, where the hourly PM 2.5 concentration touched 1,957 micrograms. As per the fire department, around 152 fire-related calls were received on Diwali till midnight, after which, about 36 more calls came in. New Delhi also saw the season’s first shallow fog spell on Thursday morning, which helps trap pollutants, along with a layer of haze, combining to form “smog” on Friday morning. On Thursday, visibility at both Palam and Safdarjung had dropped to 500 metres - dropping a further 200 metres on Friday morning. RK Jenamani, a scientist at the Indian Meteorological department (IMD) said, “Fog conditions this morning (Friday) have intensified in Delhi NCR… with visibility levels of 200-500 metres reported at its two airports – Safdarjung and Palam till 5.30am. The IGI Palam airport recorded a drop in visibility towards the city side to 200 metres.” The IMD said wind speeds are expected to pick up only from Saturday and may reach 40kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-drops-to-severe-as-capital-marks-diwali-with-firecrackers-101636083851260.html
05-11-2021||Mumbai||CFR still a concern in Maharashtra despite steady drop in Covid cases||The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for Covid-19 continues to be a matter of concern for health authorities in Maharashtra even though the state has seen a steady drop in daily cases over the last two months, officials said.In the last four days, 129 Covid-19 deaths were recorded alongside 4,221 new cases. In October, Maharashtra recorded 60,222 Covid-19 cases and 1,149 deaths, registering an average CFR of 1.9%. Back in September, a total of 85,980 cases were confirmed with 1,754 deaths, taking the CFR to 2.04%.Experts say a CFR of less than 1.5% indicates that the Covid-19 pandemic is under control. The CFR measures the severity of a disease by calculating the number of deaths as a proportion of the number of cases at any given point of time. Experts say the CFR turns out to be high when there are relatively more deaths of senior citizens or those with comorbidities.Also Read: Many call for resuming physical classes as DU declares open book examsMaharashtra has been reporting 30-40 daily Covid-19 deaths over the last few weeks.Dr Om Srivastava, infectious disease expert who is a member of the state-appointed Covid-19 task force, said, “We are seeing an overall decline in the CFR. [But] ideally, we should be having a CFR of less than 1.5 %.”State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said authorities want to bring the Covid-related death rate to zero. “We get around 1,000 new Covid-19 cases daily and the deaths we are seeing is mostly of senior citizens or those with comorbidities getting infected with the Covid-19 virus,” he said.Nagpur witnessed zero positive cases on Thursday, but authorities are calling for caution due to crowded marketplaces and Diwali gatherings during the festive season.It marked the second time Nagpur reported zero daily cases and deaths from Covid-19 after September 29.Doctors and experts said gatherings related to festivities, which were at their peak since Tuesday, could be crucial in the fight against the disease.After last year’s muted Diwali celebrations, the enthusiasm seen among the people this year could prove to be dangerous, warned Dr Uday Bodhankar said.Nagpur was one of the worst-hit districts in the state in terms of CFR. Its cumulative CFR - with 140,345 deaths and 6,615,299 cases - was 2.12 %. Maharashtra on Friday recorded 1,141 cases and 32 deaths. The city of Mumbai reported 252 new cases and six deaths, taking its total tally to 6,615,299 infections and 16,265 fatalities.The state carried out 100,229 tests as reported on Friday, while the number of recoveries stood at 1,163. The total number of active cases in Maharashtra was 15,062. Of them, the highest was in Mumbai (4,160), followed by Pune (3,190) and Ahmednagar (2,015).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-cfr-still-a-concern-in-maharashtra-despite-steady-drop-in-cases-101636081571284.html

The particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentration was recorded at 655.07 in Janpath on Friday morning, according to news agency ANI. As per government standards, PM 2.5 concentrations over 380 are marked as “severe.”The Delhi government’s complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers, including green crackers, on the day of Diwali, went for a toss after the people were seen celebrating the festival by bursting crackers on the streets, according to several news reports.The bursting of crackers further aggravated the degrading air quality in the city, amid the increased contribution from farm fires and stubble burning, the ANI report showed.Also read | Delhi chokes for breath as cracker ban goes for toss in DiwaliSeveral people in the national capital reportedly complained of itchy throat and watery eyes after a thick blanket of smog shrouded the Delhi skies, the report also showed.“The overall air quality of Delhi is plunged into the upper end of very poor category...

An Italian touch to celebrations “I am planning to celebrate Diwali in a small gathering with my family and friends in Delhi. We will enjoy a nice meal that will definitely include Indian delicacies and sweets such as gulab jamun, which is my favourite! We will decorate the house with colourful mandalas and light many diyas, hoping that they will bring positive energy and light to our days. We will wear Italian [outfits], giving a touch of Italian lifestyle to Indian festivities!” - Vincenzo de Luca, Italian Ambassador to IndiaRelishing Indian sweets with family “I’m eagerly looking forward to my first Diwali in India. I’ll be celebrating with family, including our new puppy, a Rampur Hound, enjoying meals and lighting diyas at my residence. Now, Diwali is for more than just one community. I remember, when my nephew was young, he used to sing ‘Diwali is coming’. I look forward to familiarising myself with Indian sweets and learning more about this great festival” - Alex Ellis, British High Commissioner to IndiaDressing up in ethnicwear“I have to admit, I like Diwali very much! My wife Agnieszka and I usually attend many parties and meet our friends. We plan to do the same this year, too. We will dress up in desi style [outfits] — fancy and colourful. Also, we love Indian sweets and we will try all of them. What I like the most about Diwali is its universal message — victory of life, victory of light!” - Adam Burakowski, Polish Ambassador to IndiaDiwali in Denmark“We are in Denmark, so we will be missing the festival of Diwali and celebrations taking place in India. However, the light means a lot to us, as we come from a part of the world where in winters, we have long hours of darkness. For us, the light stands for a hopeful future. We will light candles here in Denmark to celebrate the festival” - Freddy Svane, Danish Ambassador to India||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/diplomats-ready-to-revel-in-festive-fervour-101636052359172.html

05-11-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Skimming the creamy layer off the global climate crisis||We live in such times that I must have two cancers, a heart ailment, a debilitating skeletal condition (with titanium implants in two, preferably three of my four limbs), and yet live a normal life overcoming all odds, being a role model with human frailties for my children, winning ultra-marathons in arctic conditions while delivering 200% results as a vice-president for a global company, personally leading a 1,000 people to glory while gaining the grudging admiration of peers and competitors, even while frequently breaking down due to mental pressures, but overcoming the breakdowns soon enough - all of this being known and followed by millions of people every day … for anyone to take my opinions and advice, seriously enough to take action or make a change in their lives.What then can a common person fighting ordinary battles expect from the world? Battles such as abject poverty, malnutrition, joblessness, discrimination, lack of access to education and opportunities? And why is it that billions of people face such hardship when millions of others have more than enough resources to take care of the world?Because it’s a matter of ownership and a clash of values.There’s stuff I don’t share either. I won’t think twice about sharing memories or food or opportunities or resources, but ice cream I eat alone. I don’t like sharing ice cream, even with my children. They can have all else, but not ice cream. Not one spoon. And I mean not one spoon from my three litres. I eat vanilla, mango and plain chocolate and I buy a litre of each and I eat two maybe three bowls of each at a sitting. Thankfully, it’s a once or twice a year occurrence.Topping the list of stuff, I don’t share is Diary Milk and Five Star chocolates.On the face of it, I have no reason for this behaviour and these are luxury items not necessities by any stretch of the imagination. But it gives me peace to keep these to myself.I think everyone with means in the world has stuff they don’t share. Some won’t share land, some won’t share natural resources, others won’t share equal opportunities or prosperity.And so, it is also with nations.I have been reading about COP26, climate action reports, G20, the activists and the pressure groups and it seems to me there are two different value systems at work: On the one hand are developed nations who see themselves as the leaders, caretakers and progressive moral nurturers of the world, the ones who have envisioned and shaped the chocolates of the world and don’t want to give up their chocolates but want others to pay for their desires in the name of a better world. On the other hand, is the rest of the world- developing, somewhat developed and poor nations.There was a time when chocolate was a handcrafted item that had meaning, cultural value and social significance. Today it is a mass-produced pedestrian addiction that contributes millions of metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, deforestation, and questionable labour practices in developing countries where the core ingredients are obtained from. The higher-up-the-value chain industry that reaps the benefits meanwhile sits in developed countries.Keeping aside the ridiculous trade imbalance thus created, there is also a related emissions imbalance created - the bulk of the emissions in some industries typically happen at the raw material stage, the rest being at production, storage and distribution stages. Since developing and poor nations are typically forced to sell raw materials at low prices for large volumes, and then have to buy finished goods at high prices, they do not have the money to develop themselves or buy technology to improve their lot and are thus dependent on the nations that get richer and richer propagating the same values to their children and grandchildren - to speak values and sharing but suck resources as a birth right due to trade agreements and then be the benevolent caretaker of the world.The way I have understood it, I should stop consuming chocolate (among many other things I do not need to exist) to save the world, but if I do, it impacts jobs and industry in developed and developing nations and so wise people are now deciding how much chocolate I should eat till when so that all is good with the world and also who is going to pay how much to whom to ensure that the chocolate industry improves itself by sourcing responsibly and greenly and bluely so that we can all keep eating chocolate and still save the world, together.I love how such skewed ‘we’ narratives are created by people and organisations mandated to lead the world. As the world stumbles from one economic crisis to another, they ‘advise’ resilience.It’s confusing for common people like me.I think leaders of the developed world have to make up their minds. Is climate change a serious threat or not? If it is, developed nations have to stop playing trade negotiations 101, 201, 301 with developing nations. In case they haven’t noticed, we have really strong leaders of our own now.I don’t share industry processed chocolates and ice cream because I consider them to be an unhealthy choice given the number of complex industrial processes involved. I am happy to indulge myself occasionally but I don’t want others to pick up the habit. I share specific traditional sweets and unbranded churned ice creams like kulfi with friends, family and acquaintances because they are still handmade with locally sourced and seasonal ingredients in traditional ways that were always eco-friendly since harmony with nature and no-wastage is a traditional approach to life. Sustainability is a new global branding exercise. But if one digs into the traditional practices of most world cultures, we would discover that they were all harmonious with nature, to begin with. Developed nations forced non-harmonious methods of advancing convenience over the world for their prosperity.I am conscious that I don’t need chocolate to lead a contented life. And millions more are aware that they don’t need or want the low-end opportunities created by such industrial products.It’ll take a lot more than arm-twisting and loud rhetoric from developed nations to make the rest of the world abandon its logic and home-grown values now - that’s how we got here in the first place.Sanjay Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

05-11-2021||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar: A political force not far from financial controversy||On November 2, the Income Tax (IT) department provisionally attached properties including an office building at a prime location in Mumbai, a flat in an upscale Delhi locality, a resort in Goa, and agricultural land and a sugar mill in Maharashtra allegedly linked directly or indirectly to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. According to officials in the investigation wing of Maharashtra’s IT department, the value of the properties, spread over the three states is ₹1,000 crore.The action was taken after the department allegedly discovered unaccounted income of about ₹184 crore during searches it carried out at 70 premises of two Mumbai-based real estate groups and individuals linked to Pawar (including his son, Parth) in October. At the time, Pawar had said that the raids conducted in the premises of his three sisters in Pune and Kolhapur, were “politically motivated”. “I am hurt by the IT department’s actions,” he had said. Soon after the November 2 raid however, Pawar’s lawyer Prashant Patil issued a statement stating that no property related to the state’s deputy chief minister was attached by the I-T department, and Pawar had received no notice.“None of his properties were attached by the I-T department nor has he received any notice in this regard. The I-T department has sought clarification related to some issues. An appropriate response will be given on that particular letter. Appropriate action will also be taken through administrative and legal means,” the statement read.In a political career spanning three decades, 62-year-old Pawar’s name has cropped up in other allegations that have attracted probes by central agencies. However, these recent raids seem to be the biggest challenge facing the state’s deputy CM. They come at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in power at the Centre and the Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress coalition (referred to as the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi or MVA) are locked in a seemingly inexhaustible battle of accusations and counter-accusations. Ajit Pawar is fourth MVA leader to face a probe by central agencies, after former home minister Anil Deshmukh (who was recently arrested by the Enforcement Directorate), transport minister Anil Parab and Sena MP Bhavana Gawali.A skilled political organiserKnown for his skills as a political organiser, as a strategist who is good at ground level management to handle elections, as a minister who is lauded by the bureaucracy for his fast decision-making style, Ajit Pawar, took a long time to come out of the shadow of his charismatic uncle Sharad Pawar. He played a significant role in the 2004 assembly elections — from picking candidates to handling election management— following which the Congress-NCP combine returned to power. An ambitious politician, he became deputy chief minister in 2010. Son of Anantrao Pawar, Sharad Pawar’s younger brother, Ajit was the only member of the Pawar family that the NCP chief permitted to enter politics. He began at the gram panchayat level before he was elected as a Member of Parliament from Baramati Lok Sabha constituency in 1991. It was a brief stint and he took control of the assembly segment in a bypoll when Sharad Pawar shifted to national politics the same year to serve as the defence minister in PV Narasimha Rao’s government.Since then, Ajit Pawar has represented the Baramati assembly constituency for seven consecutive terms. He first became a minister in 1991 in Sudhakarrao Naik-led Congress government in Maharashtra. His role as Sharad Pawar’s key aide began after the latter broke away from the Congress to form the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 1999. While the NCP had senior leaders such as Padmasinh Patil, Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, it was Ajit Pawar who became his uncle’s most trusted aide. Till 2006, when Sharad Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule entered politics, Ajit Pawar was seen as the undisputed political heir of the NCP chief. With her emergence in national politics — she has been part of three successive Lok Sabhas and is currently serving her third term — a silent power tussle developed between uncle and nephew. The emergence of Rohit Pawar, grandson of another of Sharad Pawar’s brothers, as a new-generation leader from the family and his victory from Karjat-Jamkhed assembly seat in the 2019 state elections, added to Ajit Pawar’s woes.The bond was certainly strained enough for Ajit Pawar to switch sides after the 2019 assembly election results and partner with the BJP. High political dramaIn 2019, shortly after the assembly poll results were announced, the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party — long-time allies — split up. The Sena (which won 56 seats) had been angling for a CM post, but the BJP, which had won 105 seats, refused. Together, the two parties had a comfortable majority over the Congress (which had won 44 seats) and the NCP, which had garnered 54 seats. As Uddhav Thackeray began to hold talks with Sharad Pawar and the Congress, former CM Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP — who had helped expose an irrigation scam worth ₹70,000 crore allegedly carried out by the erstwhile Congress-NCP government and initiated an Anti-Corruption Bureau inquiry into this soon after taking over as CM in 2014 — reached out to Ajit Pawar. On November 23, 2019, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar were sworn in as Maharashtra chief minister and deputy CM, respectively. This came hours after the Sena, NCP and Congress arrived at a consensus to form the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, with Thackeray as CM. The following day, nephew and uncle locked horns on Twitter.Ajit Pawar insisted that he was in the NCP and that the BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable government in Maharashtra. “I am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and @PawarSpeaks Saheb [Sharad Pawar] is our leader. Our BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable government in Maharashtra for the next five years which will work sincerely for the welfare of the State and its people,” he tweeted.Less than an hour later, Sharad Pawar shot back and ruled out any possibility of an alliance between the NCP and BJP. “There is no question of forming an alliance with @BJP4Maharashtra. NCP has unanimously decided to ally with @ShivSena & @INCMaharashtra to form the government. Shri Ajit Pawar’s statement is false and misleading in order to create confusion and false perception among the people,” he wrote.At a joint press conference with Thackeray, Sharad Pawar said his nephew had acted on his own and didn’t have the support of either the family or the party. “Ajit Pawar’s decision is an act of indiscipline. No NCP worker is in favour of the NCP-BJP government. NCP MLAs who support the BJP should know this move attracts provisions of anti-defection law,” he said.Over the following two days, Sharad Pawar managed to get all rebel MLAs who had followed his nephew to the BJP back into the party and Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar were left with no option but to tender their resignations.“I never left the party. I was with the NCP, I am with the NCP and will remain with the NCP,” he told reporters outside the Vidhan Bhavan where he arrived to be sworn in as an MLA, a few days later. His cousin, Sule, greeted him with open arms and smiled widely at the clicking cameras. Order seemed to have been restored in the Pawar clan.“BJP was of the view that Ajit Pawar will return to them. They also thought that the MVA government will not last for more than a year, but now they have realized it won’t happen. If they have to maintain the perception that the BJP can return to power then they will have to target senior leaders and break them. This will help in keeping their flock together, especially those who joined them from Congress and NCP,” said Abhay Deshpande, political analyst.“Ajit Pawar has more command than Supriya Sule over the party. There is a major chunk of the cadre who follows Ajit Pawar. Such attacks by the BJP will create a fear among leaders who are likely to pressure their respective leadership to reconsider their decision of staying in MVA,” Deshpande added.Three main important probes Though Ajit Pawar’s power accrues to his family legacy, he is also known to be a strong political force in Maharashtra. Yet, he has never been far from allegations — none have been proved till date — of financial irregularities. In 2012, Ajit Pawar became embroiled in an alleged ₹70,000-crore irrigation scam. Pawar, who was deputy CM at the time, resigned but returned to the post the same year. The scam had many parts to it: One, though ₹42,500 crore had been spent over the course of a decade, the state had brought only 0.1% of the targeted land under irrigation. Two, a nexus of contractors, officials and politicians had allegedly siphoned off thousands of crores meant for irrigation projects. Three, Ajit Pawar, the water resources minister since 1999, had cleared cost escalations of 32 irrigation projects by more than ₹17,000 crore. When Devendra Fadnavis became CM in 2014, he ordered a Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) enquiry.In December 2019, after Pawar’s short-lived rule as deputy CM, the ACB filed affidavits before the Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC stating that no criminal liability could be found against the NCP leader. In February 2020, the court also rejected a public interest litigation that challenged ACB’s clean chit. On July 1, 2021, the ED attached assets worth ₹65.75 crore belonging to Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sakhar Karkhana (cooperative sugar mill) in Satara district in connection with an alleged ₹25,000-crore Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank scam. The mill operating out of the attached property was linked to Pawar, a statement issued by the ED stated. Ajit Pawar’s uncle and Nationalist Congress Party’s supremo, Sharad Pawar, said the ED raid was a bid to “harass” him.The alleged MSC bank scam came to light in 2011 and a charge was made against the bank’s board directors — of whom Ajit Pawar was one — for disbursing loans to sugar mills in blatant violation of prescribed rules. MSC bank is the apex co-operative bank in the state and controls credit in the entire co-operative sector, forming the backbone of the rural economy.A committee led by a retired principal district judge Panditrao Jadhav was formed and a departmental probe of the state Cooperation department conducted an enquiry into these allegations. In February the committee gave a clean chit to Ajit Pawar and other directors of the Bank. Soon after the ED raid, Maharashtra BJP unit chief Chandrakant Patil wrote a letter to the union home minister Amit Shah on July 3 alleging corruption in the auctioning of 29 other sugar factories in the state. He asked that action be initiated as the factories were sold at throwaway prices to the directors of the MSC Bank board who were also politicians. “The factories, which were auctioned by MSC Bank were purchased at throwaway prices by its directors, who happened to be politicians. Despite the 2019 Bombay high court order directing the economic offences wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police to take action, the cases against these 30 factories were closed. With action against Jarandeshwar sugar factory taken, the hopes of citizens of action against [accused’s] misdeeds have revived. I would request you to initiate similar action against 29 more such factories which were part of the court hearing,” the letter stated.On October 22, Pawar categorically denied any wrongdoing in the auctioning of sugar mills by MSC Bank. He said that multiple investigations by agencies found no irregularities. He also claimed that many of the cooperative sugar factories were sold for ₹3 crore to ₹8 crore to private firms during BJP’s rule in the state, but no questions were raised then.“The Jarandeshwar sugar mill was bought by Guru Commodities for ₹65.75 crore and handed over to BVG, another firm, to run, but they gave it to some other firm after a year owing to the financial losses… Since me and my family members are linked to Jarandeshwar sugar mills, I am clarifying this to everyone in the state… The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing the auction and the truth will come out after it,” he had said.“The auction of Jarandeshwar sugar factory was done as per the order of the Bombay high court after the management failed to repay the debts of Mumbai District Cooperative Bank despite two opportunities given to them. A special leave petition filed against the auction was struck down by the high court and subsequently by the Supreme Court. Around 12-15 companies participated in the tendering process and the highest bid was offered by Guru Commodity Private Limited,” he added.Ajit Pawar also clarified that the CID (crime investigation department), anti-corruption bureau (ACB), economic offences wing (EOW) as well as a retired judge committee probed the allegations of the Bank scam, “but found nothing”.The deputy CM said that noise was only being made over a few select sugar factories to mislead the people. “There were 65 cooperative sugar factories of which eight were auctioned or given on lease by the respective banks or the state government. Many of these mills were sold during the BJP rule between 2015 and 2019 for a paltry amount, but nobody is talking about it. Even now the MSC Bank has floated a new tender for 11 cooperative sugar mills and textile mills to run for a period of 25 years,” he said.In October 2020, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) filed a closure report after its special investigation team probing the alleged bank scam found no criminal aspect against any of the The 76 people named as accused in the case including Ajit Pawar. The ED opposed the move and pointed out Pawar’s conflict of interest: he was a director of MSC Bank. The highest bidder for the mill, Guru Commodity Private Limited, leased the mill out to a company owned by Pawar’s maternal uncle Rajendra Ghadge on an annual lease of ₹12 lakh only, the ED’s application stated.“ED had strongly opposed the closure report by filing an intervention application but it was rejected by the court of special judge Ajay Daga,” said Advocate Satish Talekar, who appeared for petitioners such as Anna Hazare and Surendra Arora in the case.The most recent IT raids however seem to pose another problem for Ajit Pawar.According to the IT department, it has found highly incriminating documents, evidencing unaccounted income of about ₹184 crore in the raids that were conducted at Mumbai, Pune, Baramati, Goa and Jaipur and continued for more than five days starting October 7.“A preliminary analysis of the flow of funds indicates that there has been an introduction of unaccounted funds in the group by way of various dubious methods like introduction of bogus share premium, suspicious unsecured loans, receipt of unsubstantiated advance for certain services, collusive arbitration deals out of non-existent disputes, etc,” a statement by the agency stated.“The funds, introduced in a dubious manner, have been utilized for acquisition of various assets such as an office building at a prime locality in Mumbai, a flat in a posh locality at Delhi, a resort in Goa, agricultural lands in Maharashtra and investments in sugar mills. The book value of these assets aggregates to about ₹170 crore,” said Surabhi Ahluwalia, commissioner of I-T (media and technical policy) and official spokesperson, Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT).Responding to the raids, Ajit Pawar said on October 7: “It is true IT has raided a few firms related to me. It is their right... I don’t know whether they were conducted for political purposes or they want more information as we have been paying taxes on time. However, my only grief is that they conducted raids on the premises related to my three sisters. One of them stays in Kolhapur and other two in Pune. If raids were conducted because they are my sisters, then people of the state should think about the level the central agencies are being misused.”Centre v statePolitical analyst Hemant Desai said that the action by central agencies is clearly politically motivated, but the involvement of Ajit Pawar and others must still be probed.“The way information is leaked in public through BJP leaders before action by the central agencies clearly shows the political intention. Recently, state BJP president Chandrakant Patil indicated that ED will take action against PWD minister Ashok Chavan in Nanded. Since it has failed in toppling the MVA government, the BJP is intent of creating a perception of corruption and irregularities by targeting MVA leaders one by one. Their strategy is to ruin their image and benefit from that in the upcoming local bodies’ polls as well as assembly polls scheduled in 2024,” Desai said.The MVA government has been rocked with a series of attacks by the Opposition. In March, Fadnavis claimed that state ministers were involved in a money-for-transfer scam in the state police department. The previous month, former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh allegations that former home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh ran a ₹100-crore extortion ring. This allegations were probed by central agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation and the National Investigation Agency respectively.Hitting out at the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre over the alleged “misuse of central agencies” against the MVA, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said last month: “The raids on my three nieces are on for the sixth day. The teams of I-T department have not found anything in the raids and the officers want to wind up the operation. But their bosses from Delhi have instructed them to continue the raids. My nieces are apolitical and have nothing to do with the sugar mills or other businesses facing action. Teams of up to 18 members are raiding the houses of my nieces who live in small houses. We are not against the action, but it should not cross the limit.”EOMEOM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-a-political-force-not-far-from-financial-controversy-101636050668593.html
05-11-2021||Mumbai||Father in custody, ED summons Anil Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh on Friday||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday summoned former state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s son, Hrishikesh Deshmukh, to show up at the ED office for questioning on Friday in connection with the money laundering case in which his father has been arrested and is in the agency’s custody till November 6.According to ED, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze allegedly collected ₹4.7 crore from orchestra bar owners in Mumbai for “smooth functioning of the bars” and gave this money to Deshmukh’s personal assistant Sanjeev Palande who later handed over the money to someone in Nagpur.ED officials said its investigation revealed that through hawala channels, this money was sent to the Delhi-based Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Jain who operated bogus companies. The Jain brothers are alleged to have diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the Deshmukh family.ED officials suspect that the Jain brothers were acting on instructions of Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh Deshmukh and want to record his statement.The agency also intends to confront him with his father and quiz the two together, an ED official said, adding that the agency will decide if there is a need to place him under arrest after questioning him.Hrishikesh Deshmukh was earlier summoned twice by the agency, but like his father, he too failed to appear before the federal agency mandated to probe money laundering.His father, Anil Deshmukh, was arrested by ED after questioning him for 12 hours on Monday on grounds that he was being evasive.It was the first time that the former home minister appeared before ED officials who had issued multiple summons seeking his appearance over the last four months.ED’s case against Deshmukh is based on an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on allegations by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh. Singh alleged that Deshmukh asked Vaze and other police officers to collect ₹100 crore every month from restaurants and bars in Mumbai.Apart from arresting Deshmukh, his personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde were arrested by ED earlier in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/father-in-custody-ed-summons-anil-deshmukh-s-son-hrishikesh-on-friday-101636049108408.html
05-11-2021||Kolkata||Bengal minister Subrata Mukherjee, 75, dies. Heartbroken, says Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Veteran Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and Bengal minister Subrata Mukherjee, died of a heart attack on Thursday night at the state-run SSKM Hospital in Kolkata. He was admitted to the hospital on October 25 after he complained of a breathing problem.“After doctors detected a blockage in Mukherjee’s artery, they implanted a stent. He was recovering but his condition suddenly deteriorated this evening,” said Bengal minister Aroop Biswas.Mukherjee was rushed from the hospital’s Woodburn Ward to the intensive critical care unit of the cardiology department on Thursday evening but doctors could not save him. He was declared dead around 9.22 pm, Biswas said. He is survived by his wife.“I am heart broken. His contribution was immense. I cannot imagine he is no more,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee who was performing Kali puja at her residence in south Kolkata’s Kalighat area when she heard the news and rushed to the hospital.Subrata Mukherjee, who was Bengal’s minister of panchayat and three other departments, served as mayor of Kolkata from 2000 to 2005 when the Left Front was in power. He was counted among the best mayors the city has had because of his administrative skills.Mamata Banerjee always referred to Mukherjee as “Subrata Da” (Dada means elder brother in Bengali) as he was not only senior to her in the Congress to which they both belonged before TMC was formed in 1998 but also figured among those who groomed her during her early years in the Youth Congress.“His body will be preserved at Peace Heaven tonight. Tomorrow the body will be taken to his residence and then kept at some places so that people can pay their last respects before the cremation. I will not be present anywhere. I cannot bear the sight of his lifeless body. I could never accept the death of those I loved,” said Mamata Banerjee before leaving SSKM hospital.“I always found Subrata Da smiling. I saw many ups and downs in life but this is a loss that I cannot handle,” the chief minister added.TMC ministers, legislators and members of Parliament started arriving at SSKM hospital after 10 pm. Many of them broke down, saying they lost their guardian.All of them described Mukherjee as a colourful person who had an identity beyond Bengal’s politics in which he never lost relevance since the late 1960s. He became a minister in the Siddhartha Shankar Ray government in 1972 when he was only 26.Opposition leaders also paid tributes to Mukherjee, describing him as an evergreen figure. “Subrata Mukherjee’s death marks the end of an era. What impressed me most is that he was a friend to everyone, even members of parties he was opposed to. The word enemy did not exist in his life,” said Dilip Ghosh, national vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party that targeted Mukherjee after he was named in the charge sheet filed by the CBI in the Narada bribery case and arrested in May along with three other TMC leaders.TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh recalled how the CBI probe and the arrest affected him.“He could not accept the arrest. He used to say how it deeply hurt him. The episode probably affected his health as well,” said Ghosh. “Bengal lost one of the most successful politicians and I lost a friend of 54 years. There is a void,” said Saugata Roy, one of the most senior Lok Sabha members of the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-minister-subrata-mukherjee-dies-at-75-heartbroken-says-mamata-banerjee-101636045148320.html
05-11-2021||Mumbai||Here’s why Covid cases in Maharashtra are declining||Easing of restrictions, opening up of public transport, schools and colleges, overcrowding in public places such as markets, and a precipitous fall in vaccination numbers in October led policymakers to worry about a third Covid-19 wave in Maharashtra, with the state task force repeatedly issuing warnings. Yet, Maharashtra has been recording a steady decline in both daily fresh cases as well as fatalities.Public health experts attribute this trend to a combination of multiple factors – the receding second wave, widespread infection in the population and the overall coverage of vaccination. Virologist Dr T Jacob John from Christian Medical College in Vellore believes that Maharashtra and many other Indian states surpassed the herd immunity threshold at the end of June. “Maharashtra is now in the endemic phase,” Dr John said. The US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define endemic as “the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area”.Until November 4, Maharashtra recorded 6,615,299 cases and 140,325 deaths, making it the worst-affected state in India. The state with the next highest number of cases is Kerala with over 4.9 million, with nearly 33,000 deaths. Karnataka has nearly three million cases and over 38,000 deaths.In October, Maharashtra saw an average of 1922 new cases daily, down from 3424 cases per day in September. The first four days of November averaged just 1055 new cases.“Vaccinations are a recent addition to tackle the pandemic,” Dr John said. “The virus moved much faster and a large majority of the people were already infected and had antibodies due to the infection. This phenomenon has been the same in urban and rural areas as well as the adult and children population. Therefore, despite overcrowding and mingling of the population, we are not seeing a spike, as almost everyone has some level of immunity.” He added that the herd immunity threshold to the initial Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 was surpassed in the end of 2020 and to the more infectious Delta strain by end of June.There are nearly 92 million people in the state eligible for vaccination. As of November 4, 34% of this population was fully vaccinated. However, the number of vaccinations slowed down in October with a 41% decline in daily average doses administered through the month as compared to September. From a daily average of 760,955 doses administered in September, vaccination dropped to 536,704 daily doses in October. State health officials have attributed the decline to the Navaratri festival and the harvesting season.“Maharashtra resembles the national scenario, barring Kerala, Mizoram, Sikkim and Meghalaya where the decline in cases has been slow,” Dr John said.But medical experts warn that a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 may still shock the system. “Caution is therefore extremely necessary,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force.According to Dr Joshi, the second wave is receding in the state and there has been substantial vaccination coverage, which has helped in keeping the numbers low. “Largely, our population has antibodies against the Delta variant and its derivatives as it was the most dominant strain through the second wave. But if the variant changes, we may be back to square one,” he said.Serological surveillance studies carried out in congested cities such as Mumbai have shown that more than 85% of the population have antibodies. A serosurvey conducted in Pune showed 51.55% seroprevalence in August. Even as the overall cases are on the decline, there has been no corresponding decline in daily cases in Mumbai and Pune. Nearly half of Maharashtra’s 15,062 active cases are currently in Mumbai (4160) and Pune (3190) as of Thursday, November 4.“The virus continues to be around and a lot of cases in the endemic phase are re-infections,” said Dr John. Doctors treating Covid-19 patients also said that hospitalisations have reduced considerably and they are mostly seeing mild infections.Some health experts also cautioned about the reduced testing in districts. For instance, the Pune district has been carrying out 15,000 Covid-19 tests over the past two to three weeks. Prior to that, its daily testing numbers had touched 35,000. “People are not willing to test if they don’t have symptoms,” said Dr Bhagwan Pawar, Pune’s district health officer. “We have therefore started concentrated testing in areas where positive cases are coming from,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/heres-why-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-are-declining-101636040527445.html
05-11-2021||World||Two-month-old baby handed to US soldiers in chaos of Afghanistan airlift still missing||It was a split second decision. Mirza Ali Ahmadi and his wife Suraya found themselves and their five children on Aug. 19 in a chaotic crowd outside the gates of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan when a US soldier, from over the tall fence, asked if they needed help.Fearing their two-month old baby Sohail would get crushed in the melee, they handed him to the soldier, thinking they would soon get to the entrance, which was only about 16 feet (5 meters) away.But at that moment, Mirza Ali said, the Taliban - which had swiftly taken over the country as US troops withdrew - began pushing back hundreds of hopeful evacuees. It took the rest of the family more than a half hour to get to the other side of the airport fence.Once they were inside, Sohail was nowhere to be found.Mirza Ali, who said he worked as a security guard at the US embassy for 10 years, began desperately asking every official he encountered about his baby's whereabouts. He said a military commander told him the airport was too dangerous for a baby and that he might have been taken to a special area for children. But when they got there it was empty."He walked with me all around the airport to search everywhere," Mirza Ali said in an interview through a translator. He said he never got the commander's name, as he didn't speak English and was relying on Afghan colleagues from the embassy to help communicate. Three days went by."I spoke to maybe more than 20 people," he said. "Every officer - military or civilian - I came across I was asking about my baby."He said one of the civilian officials he spoke to told him Sohail might have been evacuated by himself. "They said 'we don't have resources to keep the baby here.'"Mirza Ali, 35, Suraya, 32, and their other children, 17, 9, 6 and 3 years old, were put on an evacuation flight to Qatar and then to Germany and eventually landed in the United States. The family is now at Fort Bliss in Texas with other Afghan refugees waiting to be resettled somewhere in the United States. They have no relatives here.Mirza Ali said he saw other families handing their babies over the Kabul airport fence to soldiers at the same time. One video clip of a small baby in a diaper being hoisted by her arm over razor wire went viral on social media. She was later reunited with her parents.Ever since his baby went missing dates are a blur, Mirza Ali said. Every person he comes across - aid workers, US officials - he tells them about Sohail. "Everyone promises they will do their best, but they are just promises," he said.An Afghan refugee support group created a "Missing Baby" sign with Sohail's picture on it and are circulating it among their networks in the hopes that someone will recognize him.A US government official familiar with the situation said the case had been flagged for all the agencies involved, including the US bases and overseas locations. The child was last seen being handed to a US soldier during the chaos at the Kabul airport but "unfortunately no one can find the child," the official said.A Department of Defense spokesperson and a spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing resettlement efforts, referred queries on the matter to the State Department, since the separation took place overseas. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.Suraya, who also spoke through a translator, said she cries most of the time and that her other children are distraught."All I am doing is thinking about my child," Suraya said. "Everyone that is calling me, my mother, my father, my sister, they all comfort me and say 'don't worry, God is kind, your son will be found.'"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twomonthold-baby-handed-to-us-soldiers-in-chaos-of-afghanistan-airlift-still-missing-101636133961763.html
05-11-2021||World||'It is not a secret': Climate activist Greta Thunberg labels COP26 'failure'||Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg on Friday branded the UN climate summit in Glasgow a "failure" during a mass protest in the Scottish city demanding quicker action from leaders to address the emergency.Thunberg said that pledges from some nations made during COP26 to accelerate their emissions cuts amounted to little more than "a two-week long celebration of business as usual and 'blah, blah, blah'.""It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure," she told the thousands of people gathered at the protest."This is no longer a climate conference. This is now a global greenwashing festival."Delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Glasgow to hammer out how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.The first week of talks saw countries announce plans to phase out coal use and to end foreign fossil fuel funding, but there were few details on how they plan the mass decarbonisation scientists say is needed.The promises followed a major assessment that showed global CO2 emissions are set to rebound in 2021 to pre-pandemic levels."They cannot ignore the scientific consensus and they cannot ignore us," said Thunberg."Our leaders are not leading.

Late on Thursday it asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval to deploy a total of 7,774 satellites for the project.On Monday, Amazon asked the FCC for approval to launch and operate two prototype satellites by the end of 2022.Amazon said in its filing the satellites "will serve households, hospitals, businesses, government agencies, and other organizations around the world, including in geographic areas where reliable broadband remains lacking.""Although connectivity has improved on a global basis, only 51% of the global population, and 44% of the population of developing countries, are online," the company filing said.In 2020, the FCC approved the Project Kuiper plan for the constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to compete with the Starlink network being built out by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Amazon has sparred with Musk, recently accusing the billionaire of ignoring a variety of government-imposed rules.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk are rivals in the private space launch business. Bezos' Blue Origin had challenged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's decision to award a $2.9 billion lunar lander contract to SpaceX but a judge rejected the challenge on Thursday.SpaceX has deployed more than 1,700 satellites.Earlier this week, the FCC approved Boeing Co's application to launch and operate 147 satellites to provide high-speed broadband internet access.Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation of mostly low-Earth orbit satellites.Boeing said this week it "sees a multi-orbit future for satellite technologies. As the demand for satellite communications grows, diversity will be required across orbital regimes and frequencies to satisfy unique customer demands."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-seeks-us-approval-to-deploy-4-500-additional-satellites-for-internet-project-101636131553719.html
05-11-2021||World||US says no plans to reopen consulates with Biden-Xi Summit||The US and China are not considering reopening shuttered consulates in each country, the White House said Friday, after a report that said the move was under consideration as part of an upcoming virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.“The meeting is part of our ongoing efforts to responsibly manage the competition between our countries, not about seeking specific deliverables,” Dean Lieberman, a spokesman for the US National Security Council, said in a statement.It was issued after a report in Politico that consulate reopenings were likely to be announced, a move that would be one of the biggest steps yet to repair fractured ties between the global powers. Politico’s report cited sources it did not identify. The US is also seeking to make progress on trade and climate issues, as well as start a bilateral nuclear weapons dialogue -- something Beijing has resisted. The US flatly denied any such pending announcement. “This is false. Reporting on reopening consulates is inaccurate. No such thing is even being considered or discussed,” the NSC spokesman said. “In advance of the meeting, we’ve been discussing a number of agenda items, and I can assure you that reopening consulates has not been part of that discussion.”Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to questions about the Politico report by saying “many incidents unilaterally provoked by the previous US administration gravely undermined China-US relations.” “We hope the US will redress its mistakes and work in the same direction with China to bring bilateral relations back on the right track,” Wang added at the regular press briefing Friday in Beijing. Wang said he had no new information on plans for a meeting between Xi and Biden.The Pentagon warned Wednesday that China is expanding its nuclear weapons capabilities more rapidly than previously believed, a development that comes after the US’s top uniformed military officer, General Mark Milley, said China’s test of hypersonic systems was close to a “Sputnik moment” for America. A group of four Democratic lawmakers wrote a letter to Biden urging him to make nuclear risk reduction measures with China a top priority in his meeting with Xi, which has yet to be scheduled. China, which resisted joining US-Russia arms control discussions last year, sees such moves as “dragging” China into “unfair arms talks” to contain China and justify American moves to strengthen its nuclear capability, the Communist Party-backed Global Times said in a report Friday.Still, overall US-China exchanges have increased after relations hit rock bottom in the final year of Donald Trump’s presidency, as he poured pressure on Beijing after the pandemic hit during his re-election campaign. In July 2020, Washington told China to shutter its consulate in Houston, prompting Beijing to retaliate with an order for a US diplomatic facility in the southwestern city of Chengdu to close. The Trump administration said the move was necessary because China directed criminal and covert activity to steal trade secrets and carry out malign influence operations across the US, though it never provided evidence of that.The two nations also traded visa restrictions on students and journalists during Trump’s time in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-no-plans-to-reopen-consulates-with-biden-xi-summit-101636117213227.html

Many Taiwanese companies derive profits from doing business with the mainland. Tens of thousands of Taiwanese currently work in the mainland,” a Reuters article pointed out.In October, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China can and will be reunified, sending out a word of warning to the so-called Taiwan secessionists who “betray the motherland” but holding off on the threat to use force.“It has never ended well for those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland, or split the country,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Saturday.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly sent nearly 200 aircraft for drills near Taiwan in October.Late October, China said it “firmly” opposes military links between Taiwan and the US after it emerged that American troops were training soldiers on the self-governed island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diehard-taiwan-separatists-criminally-liable-to-be-punished-says-china-101636112714085.html

He also possessed confidential materials without authorisation and engaged in superstitious activities for a long time,” the earlier report said.The accusation of “deserting” his post during the fight against Covid-19 - which first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019 - did not clarify what exactly he had done to attract such strong accusations from the authorities.“The investigation showed that Sun never stayed true to the party’s ideals and faith, displayed extremely inflated political ambition and very poor political integrity, issued groundless criticisms of the party’s policies, and spread political rumours,” the earlier report said.“The circumstances were particularly serious, the nature was particularly pernicious, the impact was extremely bad and the case must be handled with extreme seriousness,” it said.Sun “sold official posts, accepted a large amount of money and property, attended banquets and high-end entertainment activities that could affect the impartial performance of official duties, and indulged in a luxurious lifestyle for a long time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-arrests-ex-minister-who-had-deserted-post-during-covid-outbreak-in-wuhan-101636110674351.html
05-11-2021||World||Pfizer says antiviral pill cuts risk of severe Covid-19 by 89%, to seek FDA nod||A trial of Pfizer Inc's experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19 was stopped early after the drug was shown to cut by 89% the chances of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of developing severe disease, the company said on Friday.The results appear to surpass those seen with Merck & Co Inc's pill, molnupiravir, which was shown last month to halve the likelihood of dying or being hospitalized for COVID-19 patients also at high risk of serious illness.Full trial data is not yet available from either company.Pfizer shares surged 11% to $48.55, while those of Merck fell 8.5% to $82.80. Shares of vaccine makers also took a hit, with Moderna Inc, Pfizer's German partner BioNTech SE and Novavax all down nearly 7%.Pfizer said it plans to submit interim trial results for its pill, which is given in combination with an older antiviral called ritonavir, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the emergency use application it opened in October.That filing is expected to be submitted before Thanksgiving, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview with CNBC.The combination treatment, which will have the brand name Paxlovid, consists of three pills given twice daily.The planned analysis of 1,219 patients in Pfizer's study looked at hospitalizations or deaths among people diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 with at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or older age.It found that 0.8% of those given Pfizer's drug within three days of symptom onset were hospitalized and none had died by 28 days after treatment. That compared with a hospitalization rate of 7% for placebo patients. There were also seven deaths in the placebo group.Rates were similar for patients treated within five days of symptoms - 1% of the treatment group was hospitalized, compared with 6.7% for the placebo group, which included 10 deaths. Bourla said that works out to being 85% effective.The data compared favorably to Merck's oral antiviral in a similar patient population, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen said in a note.With the virus still circulating widely and current therapeutic options requiring access to a healthcare facility, antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with COVID-19 out of the hospital are critically needed, Chen said.Antivirals need to be given as early as possible, before an infection takes hold, in order to be most effective. Merck tested its drug within five days of symptom onset."We saw that we did have high efficacy, even if it was five days after a patient has been treated ... people might wait a couple of days before getting a test or something, and this means that we have time to treat people and really provide a benefit from a public health perspective," Annaliesa Anderson, head of the Pfizer program, told Reuters.The company did not detail side effects of the treatment, but said adverse events happened in about 20% of both treatment and placebo patients. Ritonavir's possible side effects include nausea and diarrhea."These data suggest that our oral antiviral candidate, if approved by regulatory authorities, has the potential to save patients’ lives, reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of ten hospitalizations," Bourla said in a statement.Pfizer said it was currently expecting to produce more than 180,000 packs by the end of 2021 and at least 50 million packs by the end of 2022, of which 21 million would be produced in the first half.Infectious disease experts stress that preventing COVID-19 through wide use of vaccines remains the best way to control the pandemic, but only 58% of Americans are fully vaccinated and access in many parts of the world is limited.Pfizer's drug, part of a class known as protease inhibitors, is designed to block an enzyme the coronavirus needs in order to multiply.Merck's molnupiravir has a different mechanism of action designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus. Merck has already sold millions of courses of the treatment, which was approved this week by U.K. regulators, to the United States, the U.K. and others.Britain said earlier this month it had secured 250,000 courses of Pfizer's antiviral.Pfizer is also studying whether its pill could be used by people without risk factors for serious COVID-19 as well as to prevent coronavirus infection in people exposed to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-antiviral-pill-cuts-risk-of-severe-covid-19-by-89-to-seek-fda-nod-101636109444165.html

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said in a statement on Friday that people named in a list of supporters of Taiwan’s independence will face sanctions, reported Reuters.Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang, parliament Speaker You Si-kun and foreign minister Joseph Wu have been named in the list drawn up by China for being "stubbornly pro-Taiwan independence." For the first time, China has spelt out punishment for people deemed to be in favour of Taiwan’s independence, and thus, are against its ‘One-China’ policy under which it considers the self-ruled island as its territory.China has been pushing to implement the Hong Kong system in the self-governing island which considers itself as sovereign. While Hong Kong, a former British Colony, had returned to Chinese rule on condition of higher autonomy, Beijing has severely curtailed it through various laws, the latest being the national security law.Also Read | China to have at least 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030: US defence reportMeanwhile, the self-ruled island has been reporting repeated incursions by the Chinese air force in Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) as Beijing has become more assertive on the reunification of Taiwan with China under “one country, two systems.”Zhu said that China will now prohibit the “pro-Taiwan independence” people from entering the mainland and China's Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, reported Reuters. They will also be barred from cooperating with people or entities from the mainland, the spokesperson added.China wants to send a message, Zhu said, to the supporters of Taiwan independence that "[t]hose who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland and split the country, will never end up well and will be spurned by the people and judged by history."(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-punish-taiwan-independence-supporters-as-tension-with-island-grows-101636108713569.html
05-11-2021||World||Google account update: Here's what will change from Nov 9||Tech giant Google will soon end the one-click login for your account. The company has, however, introduced a new way to login to your account. According to reports, a person having a Google account will need to go through a two-step verification (2SV) process. This new way of login is expected to provide an additional layer of protection to your Google account.“For years, Google has been at the forefront of innovation in two-step verification (2SV), one of the most reliable ways to prevent unauthorized access to accounts and networks. 2SV is strongest when it combines both "something you know" (like a password) and "something you have" (like your phone or a security key)," Google had said in a blog post in October.- Once the 2SV is auto-enrolled to sign in to your Google account, login with a password first.- You will then need to give your mobile number. An OTP (one-time-password) will be sent via text, voice call, or Google’s mobile app.- After receiving the OTP, you will need to provide the code in the login bar.Many people have already gone through the 2SV earlier while logging into their Google accounts for the first time recently or using a new device to sign in. Starting November 9, the process will be activated on all Google accounts and users will need to go through the two-step verification to be able to access their accounts.The two-step verification is meant to ensure security from possible attacks from hackers. The process, which includes your password as well as your phone number, will ensure that hackers cannot access your information even if they have your password. Even if someone has your password, they will need to know the verification code sent on your phone to access your account while logging in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-account-update-here-s-what-will-change-from-nov-9-101636107463876.html
05-11-2021||World||China LGBT rights group shuts down amid hostile environment||An influential LGBT advocacy group in China that has spearheaded many of the legal cases pushing for greater rights is halting its work amid growing restrictions on social activism.LGBT Rights Advocacy China announced it was ceasing all activities and shutting down its social media accounts in an announcement on social media Thursday.“We are deeply regretful to tell everyone, Queer Advocacy Online will stop all of our work indefinitely,” the group said on WeChat, using the name of its social media account. It closed its accounts on WeChat and Weibo, two widely used platforms in China.A member confirmed that all the group’s activities have been shut down. The member, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, declined to say why. Group founder Peng Yanzi did not respond to a request for comment.LGBT Rights Advocacy China did work across the country, pushing for the rights of gay people and raising awareness about the community. It advocated for same-sex marriage and fought workplace discrimination by helping individuals sue their former employers.While there are many other groups focused on helping LGBT individuals, LGBT Rights Advocacy is one of a handful who focused on changing law and policy.The Ministry of Civil Affairs announced Friday that they have dealt with 3,300 illegal social organizations, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The ministry also shut down some 200 illegal websites and individual social media accounts that were not registered with any government entity.It is unclear if the group was shut down as part of the government campaign. The ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.The group mentioned they were in trouble a few months ago, said a 30-year-old LGBT activist who knows the group's founders and who spoke on condition of anonymity. Lawyers who helped the group with cases had also stopped their work then.LGBT Rights Advocacy China was co-founded by Peng and another activist named AQiang in 2013, and focused their efforts on securing legal rights for LGBT individuals through strategic lawsuits.One of their most high profile cases came early on in 2014, when Peng himself went undercover to a facility that claimed it could “treat” homosexuality with electroshock therapy. He sued the company and won.The group often brought landmark cases to the court, challenging the law to make space for non-traditional families, and often helped start public discussions on those issues.In April last year, they helped a lesbian sue for custody rights for her children, after her partner took them and stopped communicating with her. She had given birth to one of the two children. Under Chinese law, she could claim she was the birth mother of one child, but wanted to fight for the right to see the other as well. Her case is still lingering in court.The group also helped a young woman sue textbook publishers for writing that homosexuality was a disorder in a high profile case that gained national prominence and was reported on by state media. She lost the case in February, after years of litigation.“In the entire community, they gave us a lot of hope and guidance, giving everyone the confidence to go out there and do something" said a 34-year-old man, who sued his former employer in 2018 for discrimination and won with the help of the group. He declined to be named out of fear of retribution, citing the current environment.Homosexuality is not a crime in China, and in bigger cities, there’s a vibrant social scene where LGBT individuals can socialize without much fear or discrimination. However, restrictions on advocacy groups and online censorship have grown.In July, WeChat shut down dozens of accounts run by university students and non-profit groups on LGBT topics.One LGBT blogger, who also declined to be named out of fear of retribution, said it's getting increasingly difficult to run an LGBT group in current circumstances, noting that WeChat and other social media platforms are deleting related content.Shanghai Pride canceled its annual event in 2020 and said it would no longer hold it without explanation after 11 years of operation.Another well-known group, True Self, which often held events to teach families how to accept their LGBT children, would tell people to not mention the word “gay” in publicizing their events, said the man who had previously sued his employer for discrimination. “The space for acceptance for sexual minorities is less and less, it’s not like before.”Pandemic restrictions also played a role in cutting down on the number of events the groups would hold, he added.For now, groups are struggling to operate within the constraints.“The future may bring more uncertainties, we await the day when we can lift the clouds and see the daylight," LGBT Rights Advocacy China said in their post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lgbt-rights-group-shuts-down-amid-hostile-environment-101636103090001.html

The U.S. is also seeking to make progress on trade and climate issues, as well as start a bilateral nuclear weapons dialogue -- something Beijing has resisted. Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to questions about the Politico report by saying “many incidents unilaterally provoked by the previous U.S. administration gravely undermined China-U.S. relations.” “We hope the U.S. will redress its mistakes and work in the same direction with China to bring bilateral relations back on the right track,” Wang added at the regular press briefing Friday in Beijing.

05-11-2021||World||Canada’s Trudeau extends greetings on Diwali, Bandi Chhor Divas||After Covid-19 prevented the traditional celebration of Diwali last year amid restrictions and lockdowns, the Indo-Canadian community marked the festival this year with fireworks as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined the festivities at an event in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).Fireworks for Diwali were permitted this year in several municipalities, including those in the GTA like Brampton. Trudeau, along with minister of national defence Anita Anand, joined a celebration in the town on Thursday.“This joyful holiday celebrates the triumph of light over darkness – good over evil and right over wrong – and the power of freedom, hope, and knowledge. On this special occasion, families and friends would typically gather to feast, exchange gifts, and pray, as they light up their homes with diyas,” Trudeau said in a message released by his office.Anand, who became the first Hindu to feature in the federal cabinet when she was appointed in 2019, also wished those celebrating on Twitter. “This is a time to celebrate light over darkness, good over evil. May your day be bright and beautiful!” She wrote.Trudeau also sent out greetings for Bandi Chhor Divas, saying, “This celebration is also a reminder of the values Canadians hold dear – freedom, inclusion, and respect. It gives us an opportunity to thank Canadians of the Sikh faith for their contributions to our country, and to learn more about their traditions.”Minister of international development Harjit Sajjan also tweeted his wishes: “As diyas brighten our homes, we are reminded of the triumph of light over darkness.”In-person celebrations were possible this year as the Public Health Agency of Canada had earlier issued guidelines for small gatherings of those who are fully vaccinated.While the community did celebrate, they were careful to institute measures like social distancing. Brampton resident Milan Patel said, “Restrictions have opened up which is kind of a relief for the community. These are not large or grand celebrations but on a smaller scale but we hope next year things will be closer to normal.”Canada Post has also issued a special commemorative stamp to mark Diwali this year. Designed by Seung Jai Paek, it is layered with a Rangoli pattern and features a lotus, symbolising new beginnings, which forms both the outline and inset, along with a ring of heart-shaped diyas expressing love and gratitude; and a spice box in the centre alluding to the food shared during the Festival of Lights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-trudeau-extends-greetings-on-diwali-bandi-chhor-divas-101636101973144.html
05-11-2021||World||Covid-19 to push Canada’s health care spending to record levels||Driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, health care spending in Canada is expected to reach a historic high of CAN$308 billion (US$247 billion) by the end of this year, translating to CAN$580,000 every minute. The Ottawa-headquartered independent non-profit organization Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) described this as a “new record” in total health spending for the country.“Covid-19 resulted in the single biggest increase in health spending we have ever seen in this country. An aging population and the continued pandemic will no doubt put more strain on our health systems and take up a larger proportion of government budgets. Challenges lie ahead, no doubt — but so do opportunities as improved technologies, pharmaceuticals and models of care can lead to better health outcomes for Canadians,” said CIHI president and CEO David O’Toole in a statement.Health spending is expected to have increased by nearly 12% between 2019 and 2020, a rate of increase not witnessed in three decades. “This is triple the growth rate experienced from 2015 to 2019, which was steady at approximately 4% per year. This historic spending increase took place alongside a contraction in the economy, both due in part to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” the CIHI statement noted.Health care is in the public domain in Canada and accounts for about 40% of provincial and territorial budgets. Hospitals, drugs and physicians were the three highest areas of spending and, combined, were expected to represent over half the total outgo in 2021. “But a new spending category, referred to as Covid-19 response funding, will make up about 7% — or $23 billion — of total health spending. This category includes costs for things like Covid-19 treatment, contact tracing and vaccinations,” CIHI said.So far at least 88% of eligible Canadians have received at least a dose of a Covid-19 jab, with nearly 84% now fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-to-push-canada-s-health-care-spending-to-record-levels-101636100592929.html

The report also highlighted that Beijing is taking “incremental and tactical actions to press its claims” at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India despite participating in talk to resolve the crisis.“The accelerating pace of the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) nuclear expansion may enable the PRC to have up to 700 deliverable nuclear warheads by 2027,” the US defence department said in its annual report on China released on Wednesday. “The PRC likely intends to have at least 1,000 warheads by 2030, exceeding the pace and size the DoD (Department of Defence) projected in 2020.”The report further said that China has possibly already established a “nascent nuclear triad” with a a nuclear capable air-launched ballistic missile and improvement of its ground and sea-based nuclear capabilities. Additionally, developments in 2020 suggest that China “intends to increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces by moving to a launch-on-warning posture with an expanded silo-based force”, the report said.China’s nuclear policy is currently based on a strategy to survive the first strike and then respond with overwhelming force to inflict “unacceptable damage” on the enemy to deter it from launching another attack. Beijing publicly declared a “no first use” policy and it had undertaken not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear armed state or in a nuclear-weapon free zone. But the report pointed to continued ambiguity when these conditions will not be applied.China currently has an estimated 330 nuclear warheads, according to an updated count by the Federation of American Scientists. It has the third largest stockpile after the United States and Russia, and even at the accelerated pace of acquisition, China will remain at that position. France with 290 warheads, the United Kingdom with 225, Pakistan with 165, India with 160, Israel with 90 and North Korea with 45 are the other nuclear-armed countries.The US defence department report also talks at length about China’s border dispute with India, reiterating Washington’s long-held position that it blames China for starting the ongoing tensions through incursions. “Beginning in May 2020, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army, as the Chinese military is called) launched incursions into customarily Indian-controlled territory across the border and has concentrated troops at several standoff locations along the LAC,” the report said.It highlights Chinese attempts to continue pressing its claims at the LAC even as it participates in talks to resolve the situation. “Despite the ongoing diplomatic and military dialogues to reduce border tensions, the PRC has continued taking incremental and tactical actions to press its claims at the LAC,” it said, pointing to a large 100-home civilian village China has constructed “inside disputed territory” between Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh.The report notes that Beijing seems keen, at the same time, to prevent the border standoff from developing into “into a wider military conflict” and wants to “return bilateral relations with New Delhi to a state of economic and diplomatic cooperation it had perceived to be improving since the 2017 Doklam standoff”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-faster-than-anticipated-us-defence-report-101636098972765.html

He pointed to the dossier, some of which remains uncorroborated or has been discredited, as evidence of a tainted probe driven by Democrats.But the dossier had no role in the launching of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation, which was placed in the hands of special counsel Robert Mueller.While Mueller ultimately found questionable ties between Trump's campaign and Russia, he concluded there was not sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.Democrats have lambasted the Durham probe as politically motivated, but the Biden administration has not stopped it.Durham's probe has already indicted a cybersecurity lawyer accused of making a false statement to the FBI and an FBI lawyer who admitted to altering an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-authorities-arrest-analyst-who-aided-ex-donald-trump-russia-probe-101636091302071.html
05-11-2021||World||Jack Ma, Trump and Xi: The story of Chinese billionaire's fall||This was supposed to be Jack Ma's finest hour: a year ago to the day, his Ant Group was meant to go public in a $37 billion blaze of glory. Instead Beijing reined in his empire, abruptly clipping the wings of corporate China's biggest star.Now, to the cautious cheer of investors, the billionaire Alibaba e-commerce tycoon is taking his first tentative steps back on to the global stage with a low-key trip to Europe where he's cultivating hobbies like horticulture.It's a far cry from the height of Ma's statesman-like powers in 2017 when he travelled to New York to meet President-elect Donald Trump for one-on-one talks in Trump Tower days before inauguration and promised to create a million American jobs.That high-profile outing had roiled the Chinese government, which first learned of the meeting and jobs pledge along with the rest of the world when Ma held an informal televised Q&A session with reporters in the lobby of the skyscraper, according to four people close to Alibaba with knowledge of the matter and one Beijing government source.Alibaba's government relations team was subsequently told by Chinese officials that Beijing was unhappy about Ma meeting Trump without its prior approval, two of the people close to the company said.Ma's charitable foundation, which handles his media queries, did not respond to a request for comment.The State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. All the sources declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter.The meeting on Jan. 9 came at a time of taut tensions between the two countries after Trump was critical of China during his election campaign, blaming it for the loss of American jobs.A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.The four people close to Alibaba said they believed the meeting was a negative turning point in the relationship between Ma and Beijing. They did not elaborate on their thinking.Investors are hungry for clues about Ma's situation: the mere sighting of the businessman on the Spanish island of Mallorca last month, his first trip abroad in over a year, immediately saw Alibaba gain as much as $42 billion in value.The story of his fall from official favour helps illustrate how rapidly China has transformed under Xi Jinping, as he nears what could be a precedent-breaking third term as leader of the economic powerhouse and exerts greater control over some of its most innovative companies. 'A NATURAL FIRST TARGET'Authorities cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October last year accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation. Regulators suspended the $37 billion listing of his fintech firm Ant Group two days before the planned debut on Nov. 5, ordered that Ant be restructured and launched antitrust investigations into Ma's businesses, eventually leading to a record $2.75 billion fine for Alibaba in April.The clampdown has spread across the private sector, with officials tightening oversight of companies in technology, real estate, gaming, education, cryptocurrencies and finance."Given that Jack appeared too provocative, out of step with the new approach to governance espoused by Xi, he was a natural first target to signal that a major change had begun," said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory firm BDA China and author of a book on Alibaba and Ma."Jack was rubbing shoulders regularly with foreign presidents, prime ministers, royalty, celebrities at places like Davos or on his own visits overseas. There was a constant stream of VIP visitors to see him in Hangzhou too."Ma's global outreach did not end after the Trump meeting, though.Between 2018 and 2020 he held talks with a host of high-profile figures, including U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, Queen Rania of Jordan, Malaysia's veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad and then Belgian premier Charles Michel, according to Alibaba's news portal Alizila and media reports.At Alibaba's Hangzhou headquarters, it has a building housing the company's museum where Ma and his business partner Joe Tsai would take foreign visitors and show them around, according to another person close to Ma.Tsai did not respond to a request for comment via Alibaba.Ma had viewed meetings with foreign politicians as "unofficial diplomacy" for China, which he enjoyed doing, the person added.Alibaba told Reuters it had a guest reception facility widely known as Pavilion 9 that offered a visual tour of its history and an overview of its businesses. It has hosted a wide variety of guests at the exhibition hall in its headquarters, it added.The company did not respond to other queries for this story.'JUST LIKE YOU AND ME'In a sign of how life has changed for one of China's most successful and influential businessmen, Ma requested an audience with at least two people in Xi's inner circle in the weeks following the blocking of Ant's listing, but his requests were turned down by both, said two separate sources briefed by those people. The billionaire subsequently wrote directly to Xi earlier this year offering to devote the rest of his life to China's rural education, according to a government source who said the president spoke about the letter at a meeting of the country's senior leaders in May.Reuters could not determine whether Xi approved of or responded to the offer, which has not been previously reported, or precisely when Ma, a former English teacher, penned the missive.The Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post said last month Ma was visiting Europe on an "agriculture and technology study tour related to environmental issues", citing a person familiar with his itinerary.Last week the paper published pictures of Ma wearing a white protective gown and holding flowerpots. It said he would continue touring European companies and research institutions involved in agricultural infrastructure and plant breeding, citing people familiar with his plans.Tsai, the co-founder of Alibaba, played down his long-time associate's influence in a rare interview about the elusive billionaire with CNBC's Squawk Box show in June."He's lying low right now. I talk to him every day," Tsai said. "The idea that Jack has this enormous amount of power, I think that's not quite right," he added."He is just like you and me, he's a normal individual."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jack-ma-trump-and-xi-the-story-of-chinese-billionaire-s-fall-101636089433245.html
05-11-2021||World||Covid-19 outbreak in China continues to spread as cases near 800||China’s latest Covid-19 outbreak continues to grow as it shifts east through the nation’s rust belt, prompting officials to implement increasingly stringent prevention measures in an effort to control it. The country’s health commission reported 68 local confirmed cases on Friday, plus 22 additional infections that didn’t cause any symptoms. Heilongjiang province in the northeast, which accounted for more than one-third of the total, has become the latest epicenter as a mysterious cluster that emerged in the northern border town Heihe ballooned despite a city-wide lockdown.  The latest wave, driven by the highly infectious delta variant, has reached 20 mainland provinces and is now the broadest outbreak since the virus first appeared in Wuhan in 2019. Nearly 800 people have been diagnosed in the past three weeks. While the number of infections may seem low compared to the west, where tens of thousands of cases are reported daily, the zero-tolerance approach pursued in the world’s second-largest economy means the rising case count is cause for concern. China still embarks on mass testing whenever a single case of the deadly pathogen is detected, quarantines everyone that could be infected and limits transportation to other locations to cut off possible transmission. Beijing reported zero cases for the past two days, after the country ring-fenced the political hub with escalating restrictions, including halting inbound trains from more than 23 locations where infections have been found during the latest outbreak. Hebei, which borders Beijing, reported 10 days on Friday.Many municipal governments have urged residents not to travel across provinces and discouraged unnecessary departures from their cities. Wuzhen Scenic Area, a popular tourist spot in eastern Zhejiang province, said it was temporarily shut after one visitor tested positive for the virus. There is no indication about when it will resume operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-outbreak-in-china-continues-to-spread-as-cases-near-800-101636084151004.html

And internal studies spotlighted the potential risks of its Instagram photo-sharing app for teen girls. The company, valued at $934 billion, rebranded itself as Meta last month.“The disturbing thing is that people have said a long time ago that Facebook was doing this, but people said, ‘Well, they didn’t understand or they didn’t measure it,’” Schmidt said. “And what we learned in those disclosures is that these companies -- and Facebook in particular -- knew what it was doing.”Still, Schmidt said he opposes trying to regulate the tech industry. “The regulation is always either too soon or too late,” said the executive, who was CEO and chairman of Google from 2001 to 2011 and executive chairman of the company until 2018. “What I would rather have is sort of proper industrial restraint,” he said.Haugen, a former Facebook employee, testified last month before a panel of the Senate Commerce Committee. At the hearing, she criticized the company for not prioritizing the well-being of its users over profits. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has denied the characterizations, saying they’re “just not true.”Schmidt, 66, is the co-author of a new book called “The Age of AI” -- along with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and computer scientist Dan Huttenlocher -- that examines how artificial intelligence is transforming human society for better and for worse.Schmidt remains a technical adviser and top investor at Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc., and he’s chairman of the Broad Institute research center. While at Google, he orchestrated the acquisition of YouTube, another social service with billions of users that has drawn criticism for spreading misinformation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-knew-what-it-was-doing-former-google-ceo-eric-schmidt-101636082506053.html

All you need to know about the drug||The UK has approved a Covid-19 antiviral pill jointly developed by US-based Merck & Co Inc and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to become the first country in the world to recommend the drug, molnupiravir.The nod is the first for an oral antiviral treatment for Covid-19 and the first for a coronavirus disease drug that will be administered widely in the community."We are now working across government and the NHS to urgently get this treatment to patients initially through a national study so we can collect more data on how antivirals work in a mostly vaccinated population," UK vaccines minister Maggie Throup told parliament.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommended molnupiravir for use in people with mild to moderate Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness, such as obesity, older age diabetes, and heart disease.Also watch | Britain approves anti-covid oral pill for mild to moderate patientsThe agency said, citing clinical data, that it will be administered as soon as possible following a positive Covid-19 test and within five days of the onset of symptoms of the viral disease. It is to be taken twice a day for five days.Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the National Health Service (NHS) in England, said the drug would be administered to patients at higher risk of complications. Powis added that a wider rollout will follow if it is clinically and cost-effective in reducing hospitalisations and death.Also read | Merck Covid-19 pill sparks calls for access for lower income countriesThe antiviral pill, which will be branded as Lagevrio in Britain, targets an enzyme the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, uses to reproduce itself, inserting errors into its genetic code that slow its ability to spread and take over human cells. That genetic activity has led some independent experts to question whether the drug could potentially cause mutations leading to birth defects or tumours.Merck has said that viral sequencing done so far has shown molnupiravir is effective against all variants of the coronavirus, including the more-infectious Delta, which is responsible for the worldwide surge in hospitalisations and deaths recently. The company has not disclosed details on molnupiravir’s side effects but said that rates of those problems were similar between people who got the drug and those who received dummy pills.Also read | Alarm bells in 53 European, Central Asian countries, WHO warns of new Covid waveMerck announced preliminary results in September showing its drug cut hospitalisations and deaths by half among patients with early Covid-19 symptoms.

The exact number of staff involved is unclear.The aide, who tested positive via a rapid test, is in quarantine in Scotland and awaiting a follow-up PCR test, a White House official said. The aide is not believed to have had close contact with the president. Biden himself tested negative on Tuesday, the official said Thursday evening. The aide is on the National Security Council staff, according to the people. Staff members who had contact with the aide have so far tested negative, the official said. They were supposed to fly back to Washington with Biden Sunday on Air Force One or a support plane, but have since returned on other government aircraft.   White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki intended to travel with Biden but remained home in Washington after family members contracted Covid-19. She was infected herself over the weekend, she announced. Psaki said Thursday she had symptoms, including fatigue and chills, but has been working from home since the day she got her positive test. She is fully vaccinated and recently received a booster shot.Officials don’t think the NSC aide’s illness is tied to Psaki’s, several people familiar with the matter said.The people familiar with the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because the White House has not publicly disclosed the positive case in Europe or any measures taken to prevent further transmission.Psaki has said that the White House would make public infections among “commissioned officers” on Biden’s staff, which generally means senior aides with the words “assistant to the president” in their titles. That includes Psaki herself.The White House on Thursday night declined to say if the aide is a commissioned officer. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti also tested positive for Covid-19 while at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, according to his spokesperson.Former President Donald Trump faced significant criticism for efforts by his White House to conceal the extent of a coronavirus outbreak among his staff before he stood for re-election last November. Several other foreign leaders skipped the Group of 20 summit in Rome and the UN climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, at least in part out of concern about the continuing pandemic. But Biden said he thought it was important to attend the meetings in person, and he chided China’s president, Xi Jinping, in particular for not participating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-official-who-accompanied-biden-in-glasgow-summit-tests-positive-for-covid-101636072406199.html

Europe is back at the epicentre of the pandemic, where we were one year ago,” WHO's Europe head Hans Kluge told reporters from the WHO Europe headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark.Kluge said case counts are beginning to near-record levels again and the pace of transmission in the region, which stretches as far east as the former Soviet republics in Central Asia, is of “grave concern.”Also read | Biden admin mandates compulsory Covid jabs or tests for private firm workersEuropean countries must work harder to prevent the coronavirus from spreading further as deaths and new cases surge, Kluge added. He said the difference now is that health authorities know more about the virus and have better tools to combat it.

From division, unity. From despair, hope,” Biden wrote in a post on Twitter that also has a picture of him and First Lady Jill Biden lighting the ceremonial lamps at the White House.He added: “To Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists celebrating in America and around the world — from the People’s House to yours, happy Diwali.”Vice-President Harris’s post was longer with a video message: “Greetings everyone. I want to extend my warmest wishes for a happy valley to everyone celebrating the festival of lights here in the United States and around the world.“This year Diwali arrives with even deeper meaning in the midst of a devastating pandemic. The holiday reminds us of our nation’s most sacred values, our gratitude for the love of family and friends, our responsibility to lend a hand to those in need and our strength to choose light over darkness, to seek knowledge and wisdom and to be a source of goodness and grace. Let’s remember to honor the light within one another. From our family to yours I wish you a joyous Diwali.”This is their first Diwali as president and vice-president.On Wednesday, three Democratic members of the House of Representatives announced plans to introduce legislation, Deepavali Day Act, making Diwali a federal holiday.

The United States of America is about celebrating the different cultures that make us one.”Ro Khanna, the other Indian American in the US House, said, “I am proud to co-sponsor this bill with Representative Maloney to recognise Diwali as a federal holiday and know how meaningful this will be to many families across the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-lights-a-diya-at-white-house-on-diwali-harris-has-a-video-message-101636042027630.html
05-11-2021||India||In 31 countries, 28mn years of lives lost in Covid year||At least 28 million years of life were lost in 31 rich countries last year, a study published in the journal BMJ recently has found, offering a new perspective on the human cost of the Covid-19 pandemic that has caused at least 5 million reported fatalities till now.Known deaths are certain to be an undercount and researchers expect the true toll to be two-to-four times higher. The new study, by researchers from Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard, now shows that in 31 of the 37 nations they analysed, life expectancy has plummeted, giving a better picture of the magnitude of premature deaths. India was not among the countries covered by the study“Reduction in life expectancy in men and women was observed in all countries studied except New Zealand, Taiwan, and Norway, where there was a gain in life expectancy in 2020... The highest reduction in life expectancy was observed in Russia (men: −2.33, women: −2.14) and the United States (men: −2.27; women: −1.61)...” the authors wrote.In Denmark, Iceland and South Korea, life expectancy levels remained constant. The countries where it fell, apart from Russia and US, included Bulgaria, Lithuania, Spain, Italy, Belgium, England and Wales, Sweden, France Israel and Germany.The change in life expectancy was based on the expected life expectancy in 2020 as per historical trends in the 2005-19 period, and what was recorded in reality. The drop in life expectancy was also portrayed as excess years of life lost (YLL) – which takes into the total years that people who die prematurely would have otherwise lived, a number that came to 28 million in the 31 countries.“Our findings of a comparable or lower-than-expected YLL (years of life lost) in Taiwan, New Zealand, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and South Korea underscore the importance of successful viral suppression and elimination policies, including targeted and population based public health policy interventions,” the authors wrote. “As many of the effects of the pandemic might take a longer time frame to have a measurable effect on human lives, continuous and timely monitoring of excess YLL would help identify the sources of excess mortality and excess YLL in population subgroups,” they added.Nazrul Islam, research fellow at University of Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Population Health, and one of the authors of the study, said in a tweet: “Overall, excess years of life lost to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 were more than five times higher (2,510 per 100,000) than those associated with the seasonal influenza flu epidemic in 2015 (458 per 100,000)”.In Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania and the US, the excess YLL in people younger than the age of 65 was relatively higher than in all other countries, which means that a disproportionately larger number of younger people was affected in these countries. In all countries, the drop in life expectancy was higher in men than women. The report comes weeks after another Oxford University centre, the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, analysed data from 29 countries spanning most of Europe, the US and Chile and found and found that the drop in life expectancy was the biggest since the second World War in several Western European countries.The authors of the latest study make a case of reliable data. “Our study was restricted to countries with reliable data for the whole study period of 2000-20. Therefore, we did not include most countries from Asia, Africa, and Latin America,” they wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-31-countries-28mn-years-of-lives-lost-in-covid-year-101636136056535.html

The case was filed under Section 13 of UAPA, besides various sections of the penal code.No reaction from the Tripura police was available on the PUCL statement over the case against the lawyers from Delhi who are part of a group, ‘Lawyers for Democracy’.In its notice that told Mukesh to appear for questioning by November 10, the Tripura police said: “During the investigation, your involvement has been found in connection with the case. As such, there are reasonable grounds to ascertain the facts and circumstances relating to the case.”The state police have booked 71 people and filed five criminal cases over alleged fake and provocative posts on social media.“..police have invoked the draconian provisions of UAPA law only because of the findings of the FFT (fact-finding team) that the large scale violence which destroyed numerous homes, shops, mosques and other properties of Muslims in many towns in Tripura was the result of orchestrated violence unleashed by Hindu majoritarian groups like the VHP and HJM, against minority Muslims with the tacit connivance and conscious abdication of their duties by the Tripura police, “ PUCL said in its statement.The fact finding team of advocates Mukesh, Ansar Indori, Ehtesham Hashmi and Amit Srivastav came to Tripura on October 29 , three days after vandalism of a mosque, few houses and shops at Panisagar in North District.The National Human Rights Commission has sought a report from the state government to seek details of the action taken on the violence at Panisagar within four weeks. The Tripura high court also took suo moto notice and sought a detailed report from the state government by November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pucl-criticises-tripura-police-for-booking-lawyer-part-of-fact-finding-group-101636135817089.html

05-11-2021||India||‘India aims to raise exports of technical textiles from $2 bn to $10 bn in 3 years’: Goyal||Union commerce and textiles minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said the time has come to target a five times increase in export of technical textiles to $10 billion in three years, an official statement said. Production-link incentives (PLIs) for the textile sector will help the states in offering affordable infrastructure for textile manufacturing such as cheap land and power, he said while speaking to representatives of the Indian Technical Textile Association (ITTA) in Delhi on Friday.The Cabinet in September approved a PLI scheme worth ₹10,683 for domestic technical textiles firms, and manufacturers of fabrics and apparel in the man-made fibre segment provided they make a specific investment in greenfield projects and achieve stipulated turnover. Technical textiles are engineered textile products for specific applications using basic raw materials such as jute, silk and cotton, polymers, carbon, glass, and metals. Technical textiles are the technology of the future.“We should align [our units] with best standards in textile manufacturing. There should be no difference in the quality of textile meant for international and domestic consumers,” the statement quoting Goyal said. The minister suggested the public-private participation (PPP) model in the research and development of technical textiles. The technical textile in India has gained momentum in the last five years and it is currently growing at an 8% per annum rate, the statement said. India’s target is to hasten this growth to a 15-20% range in the next five years. The government’s National Technical Textiles Mission, launched in February 2020, also aims to boost India’s textile sector. “Our aim is to transform India into a major player in innovations, technology development, applications in key areas (agriculture, roads and railways, water resources, hygiene and healthcare, personal protection) with emphasis on higher education and skilled workforce,” Goyal said. Due to policy efforts, the technical textile trade balance that was negative ( ₹2,788 crore in 2018-19 and ₹1,366 crore in 2019-20), turned positive with ₹1,767 crore in 2020-21, he said. During the year 2020-21, India’s major share of exports is in PPE kits, N-95 masks and surgical masks. Talking about the policy efforts to promote technical textiles, the minister informed that 92 items have been made mandatory for use by government organisations covering agriculture, highways, railways, water resources, medical applications.Goyal said the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) has issued standards for 377 items and another 100 are in the pipeline.Based on their area of applications, technical textiles in India are divided into 12 categories, including packaging textiles (Packtech) with 38% share, geotechnical textiles (Geo-tech) 10%, agricultural textiles (Agrotech) 12%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-aims-to-raise-exports-of-technical-textiles-from-2-bn-to-10-bn-in-3-years-goyal-101636129096914.html
05-11-2021||India||Odisha mulls Goonda Act that keeps witness identity secret, hold in camera trial||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik government is considering enactment of special legislation to introduce stringent provisions to deal with hardcore criminals and “anti-social” elements who were committing crimes and going unpunished due to loopholes in the legal system, people familiar with the matter said.The proposed bill, tentatively titled “Odisha Goonda and Anti-social Activities (Prevention) Bill”, has been drafted on the lines of similar laws enacted by Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra to restrict crime syndicates. It will be placed before the state cabinet after the legal department vets the draft bill and once cleared, will be tabled in the assembly. The proposed law comes against the backdrop of the government’s sharp criticism by opposition parties over the law and order situation.According to the proposed bill, a person will be counted as a “goonda” under the legislation if they use violence, threat, intimidation or coercion to disturb public order or gain any undue financial or any other advantage.A statement of objectives of the proposed bill cited deterioration in law and order in cities, particularly in the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, where crimes such as extortion, land grabbing, illegal money-lending, contract killings, immoral trafficking, child trafficking and sexual exploitation have increased.“The recent incidence of builders and land mafia taking over possession of land by manufacturing forged documents, kidnapping and abduction for extortion, harassment of senior citizens by criminals, activities of stalking and eve-teasing of girls and cybercrimes against them have resulted in several suicides in the state. These serious incidences of crime also appear to have been perpetrated with aid of public servants who either support the commission of these crimes or by wilful omission, facilitate the commission of these crimes by refraining from performing their duties,” the proposed bill said, laying down the context for the special legislation.HT has reviewed a copy of the proposed bill.The proposed bill has proposed a minimum sentence of seven years for people convicted under the special law and seeks to give district magistrates power to attach properties of the accused if they believe that the same has been acquired through proceeds of crime even before the court takes cognisance of the charge sheet.The government will need to give its sanction before a designated special court can try the accused.The special law seeks to give the district magistrates the power to seize assets believed to have been bought from proceeds of crime, proposes a minimum three year prison term - 10 years will be the maximum punishment - for officials who help criminals by their action or inaction, or intentionally avoid carrying out directions of any court or superior officer.Similarly, any person found to be in possession of assets for anti-social elements which they can’t account for will also face a minimum jail term of three years. The property will also be liable for attachment.The trial under this special law will be held in camera and tried by special courts which will have precedence over other pending trials against the accused. The proposed law also mandates that the identity and address of witnesses will be kept secret and their names will not be reflected in case records or court verdicts.The draft bill said the special law can be invoked for offences under a long list of laws including Indian Penal Code, Odisha Excise Act (2005), Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (1985), Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act (1956), the Protection of Children from Sexual offences Act (2012), Protection of Cow Slaughter Act (1960) and Orissa Money Lenders Act (1939). It added that such offences are likely to cause, directly or indirectly, a feeling of insecurity, danger or fear among the general public and pose danger to the safety of individuals or cause loss or damage to the public exchequer.The draft bill also seeks to prosecute accused for offences such as ​assaulting employees or owners of public or private enterprises, violence to collect loan or interest, illegal weapons, counterfeit currency, violation of cow slaughter law, child pornography, acid attack on women, cyber stalking or other offences under Indian Penal Code that are punishable with at least five years imprisonment.It said existing laws enacted by the state as well as the central government are found to be inadequate to deal with “hardcore criminals who fearlessly commit crimes and easily escape from the clutches of law finding loopholes in the legal system.”Odisha director general of police Abhay refused to speak on the proposed law, saying it was still being vetted by the law department.A senior police official said the proposed law would take quite some time to be implemented since the state would require clearance from Delhi.Legal experts said a special law to deal with organised crimes was a good step, but said the problem in dealing with such crimes mostly lies with the state police.“Odisha police have a poor record when it comes to filing charge sheets against the accused and following up cases during trial. The existing Indian Penal Code is enough to deal with rising crime cases. In the past, the state has enacted special Acts such as Odisha Protection of Interest of Depositors Act, but have they been able to give justice to common men,” asked senior lawyer Pitambar Acharya.BJP leader and Bargarh MP Suresh Pujari said just adding one more special law would not lead to any solution and may rather add to the burden of prosecuting agencies.“Odisha police don’t have enough people to manage regular day-to-day law and order activities as well as probe crimes. Secondly, the investigating skills of the existing officials is not upto the mark. How would the new law solve these basic issues,” asked Pujari, who trained as a lawyer before switching to politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-mulls-goonda-act-that-keeps-witness-identity-secret-hold-in-camera-trial-101636127655872.html

05-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 11, 1999 — Pope John Paul II’s arrival in India sparks no fireworks||New Delhi- The changed protocol did not allow an elaborate welcome ceremony at the airport and, in the 13 years that passed since he last landed in Delhi, Pope John Paul II had aged enough to lean on a walking stick as he slowly walked down from the special Alitalia aircraft this evening. The temporal head of the Holy See and the supreme spiritual leader of one billion Catholics worldwide arrived at the Delhi airport without so much as a whimper of the protests that have marred the long period of preparations for his visit. The Pope’s quiet arrival at the Palam technical area proved to be an anticlimax for all those who were expecting fireworks at the airport. There were no frenzied protestors demanding apologies, no placards and banners announcing arbitrary bans on conversions. The elaborate security arrangements ensured that no miscreant entered the seven kilometre area from the airport to the Vatican embassy where the Pontiff would be staying during his three-daylong visit. The Archbishop of Delhi Reverend Alan de Lastic led the group of priests in black to welcome the Pope. The chairman of the organising committee of the Pope’s visit to India Dr Dominic Emmanuel received other members of the Pope’s entourage while Sister Dolores represented the religious sisters with Delhi laity leader A. C. Michael representing the Catholic men and women of the city. The Minister of State for External Affairs Ajit Panja extended the state’s welcome to the Pontiff while a posse of policemen held the cameramen and other media personnel at bay. A gleaming black limousine waited at the tarmac while the Pontiff was being greeted by scores of bishops from the across the country. Unlike the last time when the Pope had quickly bent and kissed the ground minutes after he landed in India, he merely stood glancing reverently at the soil while the cameras flashed around him. The Pope had last come to Delhi in February, 1986 and had been welcomed at the airport by the President and the Prime Minister. Elaborate speeches were made at that time both by the Heads of Indian State and by the Pontiff.‘’I have come to meet as many beloved Indian people as well as to come to a deeper understanding of the rich culture of your country,” the Pope had said in his speech made at the airport on February 1, 1986. Since security considerations have led to a change in the protocol, the Pope would now be received as a State Guest at the Rashtrapati Bhavan tomorrow mornmg. The 79-year-old Pontiff has come to India with the specific purpose of proclaiming the document Eccleia in Asia (Church in Asia) which marks the conclusion of the Synods of Bishops for Asia. The Asian Synod was held in Vatican City in May, 1998. The Pope’s visit this time is much shorter compared to the last time when he had spent ten days in India. He would be meeting the President K. R. Narayanan tomorrow and the heads of various religions in India, including the Shankaracharya of Prayag Peeth Madhavananda Saraswati. As a State Guest, the Pontiff would be given a formal reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Vice President Krishan Kant and PM AB Vajpayee would call on the Pontiff during the visit. Scores of people have gathered in the city to have a glimpse of the Pontiff. While there was no statement from the Vatican Embassy or the Media Committee on whether the Pope would be granting them an audience separately, it was assumed that due to tight security, the Pontiff would not be able to mingle with the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pope-john-paul-ii-s-arrival-in-india-sparks-no-fireworks-101636127056544.html

Talking to newsmen in the state capital, state finance minister KN Balagopal said the government had introduced many welfare programmes during the peak of the pandemic and they will be affected if the tax on fuel was cut. He said the Centre was forced to take such a decision in the wake of setbacks the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party suffered in recent by-elections. “There is no need to reduce tax in Kerala. When the Centre reduced ₹10 and ₹5 for diesel and petrol, it has actually been reduced by ₹12.30 and ₹6.56 in Kerala due to the tax structure. The value-based structure is formulated in the state like this,” he said. “Centre did not do a big thing. After hiking the price for almost every day, it made a small reduction. In last seven years, it increased tax by over ₹31 but the reduction was only slight,” he said, adding states were not given the share of revenue collected through additional tax. He said the government’s sales tax collection was not in tune with the soaring government expenditure so it can’t take any risk now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-cut-fuel-tax-says-kerala-finance-minister-101636126817323.html

05-11-2021||India||‘Why have the opposition-ruled states not cut fuel prices?’ BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday attacked the opposition parties, including the Congress, for not announcing cuts in fuel prices in states ruled by them just as the BJP ruled states have. A bunch of BJP ruled states have announced a cut ranging between ₹5 to ₹10 on petrol and diesel prices. The announcement that was made on the eve of Diwali is perceived to have been taken in view of the by-poll results announced on Tuesday that were a mixed bag for the BJP. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia lashed out at the Congress, TMC and the AAP for not announcing a cut in the fuel prices even as these parties had been criticising the BJP government at the centre for failing to announce cuts in the prices of fuel that had steadily increased.“In Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has lowered the prices of petrol and diesel by ₹12, similarly, in Gujarat and Assam too the prices of fuels have been reduced by ₹7. This is in addition to the cuts that were announced by the union government,” Bhatia said addressing the media.He said the BJP has shown responsibility and sensitivity towards the people during the challenging Covid pandemic.“Free ration has been provided to 80 crore people. ₹19 lakh crore has been given to the beneficiaries through direct benefit transfer. Each rupee that is collected as tax is used in the development of the country and for the people. Another example is the vaccine. It is a matter of pride that 108 crore vaccines were provided free of cost and the government is committed to providing free vaccines to the rest,” he said.Attacking the opposition for not announcing similar cuts in fuel prices he said, “In Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Rajasthan people want to know why such steps have not been taken by the state governments… the steps that were taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and emulated by the BJP ruled states are not being implemented by other governments,” he said.He made a pointed reference to Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot’s tweet and said the opposition ruled states need to accept that they have the responsibility toward people, just as they have a share in the collections from tax. Gehlot previously tweeted, “With the reduction of excise duty by the Center, the VAT levied by the states is automatically reduced in the same proportion. We demand that the Center should further reduce excise duty to reduce inflation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-have-the-opposition-ruled-states-not-cut-fuel-prices-bjp-101636124836450.html

Increasing the petrol cost by ₹30, then bringing it down by ₹5 is just a lollipop,” news agency ANI quoted Baghel as saying in Raipur.All India Congress Committee general secretary KC Venugopal said the cut on excise duty has not been significant, adding the party will continue its agitation over the fuel prices.“It has not decreased much. During the UPA rule, excise duty on petrol was ₹9.48/litre & diesel ₹3.56/litre. They should reduce it more. LPG rates are still the same and need to be reduced. We'll continue our agitation and start a massive campaign from November 14,” ANI quoted Venugopal as saying.Also read | After Centre, BJP-ruled Haryana, Himachal cut fuel rates furtherA report by news agency PTI stated the latest cut was the highest-ever reduction in excise duty. It rolls back a part of the ₹13 and ₹16 per litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel effected between March 2020 and May 2020 to avoid passing on to consumers the sharp fall in international oil prices at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report added.That hike in excise duty took central taxes on petrol to their highest level of ₹32.9 per litre and that on diesel to ₹31.8 a litre.Notably, the tax cut came after an unrelenting hike in international oil prices, pushing pump rates across the country to their highest-ever levels. Petrol soared to above ₹100-a-litre-mark in all major cities, while diesel crossed that level in more than one-and-a-half dozen states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-a-lollipop-congress-says-centre-s-excise-duty-move-on-fuel-an-eyewash-101636112458136.html

05-11-2021||India||Fuel price reduction: Opposition questions government’s move, overall handling||Opposition parties slammed the government on Friday, questioning its intention and its overall position on handling fuel prices in the long run, two days after the Centre slashed the prices of petrol and diesel.The Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala on Friday posted a scathing tweet in Hindi, alleging that the Haryana government was conning the public by reducing value added tax (VAT) on petrol while increasing it on diesel. “Have a look at what the ‘loot jeevi’ Khattar-Dushyant government is up to. In Haryana, the VAT on petrol has been reduced by ₹1.12 and it has been raised on diesel by ₹1.78. The people of the state know these lies and understand them. Shame on such an anti-people government,” Surjewala tweeted, also sharing the notification issued by the excise department.Also Read: Gehlot urges Centre to reduce excise duty further on petrol, dieselOn Wednesday, a day before the country celebrated Diwali, the Centre slashed excise duty by ₹5/litre on petrol and by ₹10/litre on diesel. The move was followed by several states cutting VAT.Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien also took a jibe at government’s latest move. He posted a wordplay of a famous quote from former US president Abraham Lincoln, switching “fool” with “fuel”. The TMC leader wrote, “You can fuel all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fuel all the people all the time.” He shared a graph comparing the prices of crude oil, petrol and diesel in January 2014 and November 2021.Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut criticised the reduction in petrol price by ₹5 as too little, arguing that the Centre should have reduced it by “at least ₹25 per litre to provide relief to people… They (Centre) realised that prices need to be slashed after they lost the bypolls”. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia reacted to the criticisms, saying, “The Centre along with the BJP-led states, took the initiative of reducing VAT on fuel prices for the common people. So why isn’t the Congress doing the same in their ruling states? Why can’t Congress, Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal ji take a bold step like us?”“While the public received our decision joyously, the Opposition parties - Congress, AAP, TMC - opposed our decision and politicised it for their own benefit,” Bhatia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-price-reduction-opposition-questions-government-s-move-overall-handling-101636110553914.html

Rai also alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had encouraged people to defy the ban on bursting crackers in the city. “Some people in Delhi burst firecrackers on purpose. The BJP is behind this,” Rai said on Friday. The copy will be updated with BJP’s response to these allegations. The minister also said that an increase in the number of stubble burning instances in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana also worsened the city’s air. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) satellite imagery shows that on Thursday, over 3500 farm fires were reported from Punjab and Haryana. “Impact of 3,500 farm fires around Delhi was visible in the national capital today,” Rai said.

05-11-2021||India||Delhi PM 2.5 levels highest in three years after Diwali 2021: SAFAR analysis||The levels of PM 2.5, a common air pollutant and a major respiratory health risk, in the national capital over the last 24 hours was the highest in three years as farm fires peaked amid firecracker bursting during the Diwali festivities despite a ban on them, said an analysis of Union earth science ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Friday.PM 2.5 is fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters of 2.5 microns. It is about 30 times smaller than a strand of human hair. PM 2.5 pollutants are made up of hundreds of chemicals. Construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, and smokestacks or fires, power plants, factories, and automobiles emit these pollutants into the air. The pollutants can enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system and cause asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease.The analysis said the PM 2.5 levels were the highest in the three years but “much less” compared to those recorded in 2018. It added while the levels peaked much faster this Diwali, the dispersion was also fast. “...local winds have picked up since morning (on Friday) and now fast dispersion is expected,” the analysis said. “Without any more firecracker emissions, AQI (Air Quality Index) will improve to ‘very poor’ category by tonight (Friday) although the stubble contribution is expected to remain almost the same as today (Friday)...”The analysis said relief was expected only from Sunday evening even as AQI will fluctuate within “very poor” range.” It added while firecracker emissions were the primary contributors to Delhi’s pollution on Thursday and Friday, rising stubble burning instances in Punjab and Haryana also added to Delhi’s woes.“As per SAFAR framework model, the share of stubble emissions has peaked today (Friday) to ~36% and additional firecracker-related contribution is almost of the same magnitude.”Air quality forecasts in the run-up to Diwali suggested Delhi was headed towards an air emergency as stubble fires were also expected to peak coinciding with the festival when pollution levels usually spike with the bursting of crackers.Delhi’s air quality dropped to the “severe” category on Thursday around 9 pm for the first time this season.Low temperatures and stubble burning for quickly clearing fields for the next cropping season in the agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana are among the causes of deterioration in pollution levels around this time of the year in Delhi and surrounding areas.

05-11-2021||India||From Nowshera LoC, PM Modi red-flags PLA hybrid warfare||From 80 brigade headquarters in Nowshera, south of Pir Panjal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sensitised the troops on the revolution in warfare with a focus on what in American parlance is called non-kinetic battles in the future. He talked about hybrid warfare, which goes beyond the spectrum of land, air, sea battles, into cyber and information warfare.PM Modi’s speech came at a time when a Pentagon report on China confirmed Indian intelligence reports that PLA had laid optical fibre cables all along the contested 1597 km Ladakh Line of Actual Control (LAC) for faster war deployment and decision making. A 2009 Chinese report on “Lectures on Joint Campaign Information Operations”, which was translated and published by the US air force’s China Aerospace Studies recently, laid bare PLA plans and capability to conduct extensive non-kinetic warfare operations in any future conflict against the United States.According to this 438-page Chinese report, the US military’s “strike chain” of the time it takes from the discovery of enemy target, to aim, then attack and lastly evaluation was 100 minutes in the 1993 Persian Gulf war. This was reduced to 10 minutes in the 2003 Iraq war.By linking the forward defence localities to command headquarters in hinterland Tibet with optical fibre, the Chinese have speeded up the decision-making process on the Ladakh front and with it its capacity to respond to Indian airpower in case of an attack. One must remember that the PLA has stationed one regiment of Russian S-400 air defence system in Gar Gunsa airbase close to Ladakh LAC and another system at Nyingchi, close to Arunachal Pradesh LAC. In simple terms, faster decision making will lead to a rapid response from the PLA in a worst-case scenario.From Nowshera, PM Modi was making the troops and their division and brigade commander aware that future wars will not be slugged out artillery battles of the bygone World War II era. Future wars will be stand-off battles with a strategy seeking information dominance over enemies as a major weapon that will be a key factor in determining victory or defeat in battle.The Chinese report states: “The manifested forms of joint campaign information warfare operations mainly are electronic warfare, network warfare, intelligence warfare, psychological warfare, physical destruct warfare. Among these, electronic warfare and network warfare are the main forms of information operations.”With the objective of information warfare to seize and control information power by damaging the enemy’s information systems, the PLA plans to launch electronic attacks, wage computer network warfare, conduct psychological operations and employ military deception. The attacks, the report states, will seek to influence, damage, interrupt and deprive the enemy of its human and automated military decision making. Information warfare will require protecting PLA systems from foreign electronic and networks attacks. Targets in conflict will be radar and communication nodes on land, sea, air, cyberspace and space.“Electronic attacks mainly include electronic jamming, counter-radiation weapon attack, and special information warfare weapon attack. Network attack includes information stoppage, network infiltration and virus attack to either damage or destroy enemy’s information management through loopholes or backdoor of the existing network,” the report states.Psychological attacks, which the PLA is quite proficient in, mainly includes psychological propaganda, deception, and threat.Simply put, the front-line troops will be used only for preventing the enemy from making unilateral changes in borders while the main hybrid battle will be fought from remote cyber command centres. In this context, India needs a dedicated cyber warfare centre under the Indian military with experts from not only the services but also from the private sector. It needs synergised theatre commands for rapid decision making. The existing silos within the army, navy and air force must be broken down or else Indian forces will be up for a surprise from PLA like in May 2020. Indian intelligence needs off the air interceptors to pick up information from across the LoC and LAC as well as use firewalls in sensitive areas so that enemy propaganda does not enter the public narrative through social or propaganda media. This is what is done presently by the Communist Party of China or even Pakistan on the LoC albeit it will be very difficult in democratic India. But then the enemy is not obliged to fight on Indian terms and conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-nowshera-loc-pm-modi-red-flags-pla-hybrid-warfare-101636092167834.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva to inaugurate a number of key infrastructure projects.Built in the 8th century by Jagad Guru Adi Shankaracharya, Kedarnath Temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range on the banks of the Mandakini river. According to a legend, the temple was originally built by the Pandavas—Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva—the sons of Pandu, the king of Kuru kingdom, as acknowledged in the epic Mahabharata.Also read | ‘All maths and jyotirlingas are connected with us today': PM Modi at KedarnathThe temple, also known as the holiest shrine of Shiva, is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. It is open to devotees only between the months of April and November due to extreme weather conditions.During the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand, the temple managed to stand erect and suffered little to no damage even as the surrounding areas bore the brunt leading to major damages. The flood, considered one of the worst natural disasters to have hit the country, was caused by a cloudburst leading to floods and landslides in the state.The Prime Minister, during his visit on Friday, unveiled the statue of Adi Shankaracharya at the premises of the Kedarnath Temple. The samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya has been reconstructed after its destruction in the 2013 Uttarakhand floods.Before the inauguration, the Prime Minister offered prayers and performed 'aarti' at the ancient temple. He paid obeisance to Lord Shiva and undertook circumambulation of the Kedarnath shrine after offering prayers.Modi arrived at the Dehradun airport in the morning and was received by Uttarakhand Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd), chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and his cabinet colleagues Subodh Uniyal and Ganesh Joshi, besides Uttarakhand Assembly Speaker Premchand Aggarwal.PM Modi will also lay the foundation stone of reconstruction projects worth over ₹130 crore at the Himalayan temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-pm-modi-visits-kedarnath-temple-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-shrine-101636090090217.html

BMC has asked police to ensure that there is no crowding while issuing guidelines for low-key celebrations.“Keeping in mind the crowding witnessed at sea shores during Chhath Puja, following the Covid-19 protocol including maintenance of social distancing would not be possible, hence, mass celebration of Chhath Puja at sea shores should be avoided and the police must ensure that there is no crowding.

05-11-2021||India||'Priyanka Gandhi’s women-centric promises only meant for UP polls'||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s women-centric promises ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are unlikely to be fully replicated nationally, for now, two leaders of the party said. “As of now the poll promises have been made only keeping the Uttar Pradesh election in mind,” said a Congress leader, requesting anonymity.Congress has promised women 40% of tickets and a similar quota in jobs if the party comes to power in the state. Priyanka Gandhi has been at the forefront of the attempts to revive the party there. She has pledged three free cooking gas cylinders annually to women, free travel on state government buses as well as scooties and smartphones for girl students. Priyanka Gandhi also promised monthly ₹10,000 for Asha and Anganwadi workers, who form a critical workforce for health and social welfare in the hinterland, widow pension of ₹1,000 per month, and 75 vocational schools.Party insiders said the promises are aimed at creating a class-based vote bank for the Congress that lost its base to Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, and Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the 1990s.The Congress has not made such promises so far in another key poll-bound state of Punjab, where it seeks to retain power.Also Read: ‘Out of fear’: Priyanka Gandhi on Centre’s move to slash petrol, diesel prices“There would definitely be some sops from the Congress for women in every state and national polls. But Uttar Pradesh promises were crafted to make them a trademark Priyanka Gandhi move. She is the face of the Congress in this (Uttar Pradesh) state polls. She had to make a big announcement,” said a second leader, requesting anonymity. “In other states, the Congress might need to craft manifestoes differently looking at other political considerations.”A third insider said the women-centric announcements were part of a strategy in which both Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were involved.The Congress has been out of power in Uttar Pradesh for over three decades. In the last assembly polls, the Congress bagged just 6.25% of the votes and seven seats in a 403-member House. In the 2019 national election, Congress got just one out of 80 seats and 6.36% votes. Rahul Gandhi lost his pocket borough of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh in 2019 but was elected to Lok Sabha from Kerala’s Wayanad. He had come up with the Nyuntam Aay Yojana scheme for financial aid to the poor ahead of the 2019 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-s-women-centric-promises-only-meant-for-up-polls-say-insiders-101636084691424.html
05-11-2021||India||Expert says petrol, diesel prices will increase again in coming months: Report||The prices of petrol and diesel will increase again in the coming months, said energy expert Narendra Taneja on Thursday.Speaking to ANI, Taneja said, "It is to understand that we import oil. It is an imported commodity. Today, we have to import 86 per cent of our total oil use. The prices of oils are not in the hands of any government. Both petrol and diesel are de control commodities. In July 2010, Manmohan Singh's government implemented the deregulation on petrol. In 2014, the Modi government decontrol diesel."He said the Covid pandemic is the major reason for the rise of oil prices in the international market."Whenever there is an imbalance in demand and supply, prices are bound to increase. The second reason is the lack of investment in the oil sector as governments are promoting renewable/green energy sectors like solar power. Crude oil will be more expensive in the coming months. In 2023, the price of crude oil can rise by ₹100," he stated.Asked about the reason for Centre's move to decrease excise duty on petrol and diesel, Taneja said, "When oil prices are low, the government increases the excise duty, when oil is too expensive, the government reduces the excise duty. The consumption and sale of oil had come down to 40 per cent during the time of Covid. Later, it had come down to 35 per cent. When the sales have reduced, the income of the government will automatically decrease. But now that sale is back like the pre-Covid era.""Secondly, the GST collection is indicating positive sign for the economic recovery. The government is relatively in comfortable position than earlier. Plus, our economy is based on diesel. If the price of diesel goes up that increases the price of everything. The inflation is high. Considering these things, the government has taken this step," he emphasised.Taneja believes that petrol and diesel should be included in GST so that more relief can be obtained and there will be more transparency.In a relief to consumers, the Finance Ministry on Wednesday announced a ₹5 per litre cut in excise duty on petrol and a ₹10 per litre cut in excise duty on diesel. Amid record-high fuel prices, this is the first cut in central excise duties in over three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-says-petrol-diesel-prices-will-increase-again-in-coming-months-report-101636084240624.html

PM Modi will also unveil a magnificent 12-feet statue of Guru Shankaracharya, the 8th-century seer who attained Moksha at Kedarnath.The statue weighs 35 tonnes and it has been made by Mysore-based sculptors from chlorite schist, a rock that is known to withstand rain, sunshine and harsh climate, according to officials. The original statue of Adi Guru Shankaracharya samadhi was washed away in the 2013 floods. It has been built by excavating land just behind the Kedarnath temple and in the middle of the samadhi area.The unveiling of the statue will be streamed live at the 12 jyotirlingas, four Shankaracharya mutts (monasteries), his birthplace and several prominent temples across the country."We will all welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PM Modi will reach here in the morning. He will do the Maha Rudra Abhishek and pray for the welfare of the nation. He will also unveil the statue of Adi Shankaracharya,” Bagish Ling, a priest of Kedarnath Temple, told news agency ANI.After the unveiling of the statue, the Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone of Kedarpuri reconstruction projects worth over ₹400 crore. He will also inaugurate other key infrastructure projects including Saraswati Retaining Wall Aasthapath and Ghats, Mandakini Retaining Wall Aasthapath, Tirth Purohit Houses and Garud Chatti bridge on the Mandakini river.The Kedarpuri construction project is reportedly PM Modi's one of dream projects.

05-11-2021||Today's||A free trade pact with the US?||India wants to extricate trade talks with the United States (US) from the current morass of endless recriminations and negotiations. It has been testing the waters recently for a free trade agreement (FTA) as part of an expanded trade relationship. Although a formal offer has not been made yet, senior Indian officials have pitched the idea in closed-door settings. Washington DC is unlikely to jump at it because, it is being said, there is little appetite for a trade deal in either the Joe Biden administration or US Congress at this moment. That’s probably why the administration has ruled out, for now, a Phase Two deal to follow up the Phase One of the US-China agreement signed by President Donald Trump.India and the US can discuss the idea, and decide to drop it altogether or put it on pause for now at the upcoming meeting of the India-US Trade Policy Forum on November 23 in New Delhi. US trade representative Katherine Tai is leading the US side at this meeting of the top platform for trade negotiations for the two countries; Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal will lead the Indian side.India currently has FTAs with five countries bilaterally and 18 countries multilaterally — 11 member-countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and seven of the South Asia Free Trade Agreement. Four more are under discussion; these include bilateral deals with Australia, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates and a multilateral arrangement with the European Union, which has 27 members. The US has 14 trade agreements with 20 countries, including a bilateral trade agreement with China.An FTA obligates signatory countries — bilaterally or multilaterally — to a set of mutually agreed conditions pertaining to trade in goods and services among them. Terms can include tariff levels, and removal of measures and provisions that act as trade barriers. India and the US have plenty of such issues that can, theoretically, be resolved by an FTA. Or, as one expert argued, disagreements can outlive FTAs.Even if Indian and the US were to agree today, an FTA will still take years to be signed and then some more years — perhaps even 10 to 15 — to be operationalised.Or longer. Or never. India and the US have some history here. The two countries began discussing a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), which seeks to protect and promote private investment among signatory countries, during the last years of President George W Bush’s tenure. And they are still nowhere near a text. The US put talks on hold as it overhauled its model BIT and then India decided to do so as well. Both countries have their respective model BITs now, the US since 2012 and India since 2015. But they are not discussing it anymore; an abandoned enterprise.An India-US FTA may or may not face the same fate.
