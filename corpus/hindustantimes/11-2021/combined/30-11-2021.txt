A senior BMC official confirmed that the person is asymptomatic and is currently at Seven Hills Hospital. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department said, “The S gene is not missing in this patient’s sample collected for RT-PCR test. This itself is an indicator that he is not positive for Omicron. However, to be absolutely certain, BMC has sent his sample for genome sequencing.”The person is a resident of the suburbs of Mumbai. BMC will now begin tracing contacts of this person, and those who came in immediate contact with him have already been quarantined.About 800 beds at the jumbo facility at Richardson and Cruddas at Byculla have now been exclusively reserved for quarantining international passengers who test positive for Covid-19, as BMC moved out existing Covid patients from this jumbo facility to Kasturba Hospital. This comes at a time when concerns are rising over the Omicron variant. While there are no cases of Omicron in Mumbai yet, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday tightened testing and screening guidelines for international passengers arriving in Mumbai from countries of concern.BMC also identified 15 to 20 two and three-star hotels around the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport on Tuesday, where international passengers can be quarantined and would want to pay for a facility instead of opting for a municipal jumbo facility. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department said, “We have located and spoken to 15-20 hotels, which were also on board with BMC during the first wave, to offer their rooms for quarantining those who opt to pay, in case international passengers test positive.”Currently, all passengers arriving from ‘countries of concern’ will mandatorily undergo RT-PCR test at the airport. If they test positive, they will have to be quarantined institutionally and their samples will be sent for genomic sequencing.In the last 15 days, 466 people arrived from ‘countries of concern’. Of these, 100 are from Mumbai and none of them is positive. From Wednesday, BMC is also launching a campaign to ensure all employees of private and public establishments are fully vaccinated. The municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal will write to all public establishments in Mumbai on Wednesday, directing them to allow only fully vaccinated employees to attend office and to ensure all social distancing norms and Covid-19 hygiene is followed on their premises.A senior civic official from BMC’s public health department said, “A letter signed by the municipal commissioner will be sent to all head of departments at public offices urging them to ensure all employees are fully vaccinated.” Ward officers have been asked to locate clusters of private establishments in their areas and send copies of this letter (signed by the municipal commissioner) to these establishments. BMC will offer help to private and public establishments to ensure all their employees are fully vaccinated, including arranging vaccination camps on the premises of these offices, if requested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/one-tests-positive-bmc-prepares-jumbo-facilities-hotels-to-quarantine-int-l-passengers-101638296855224.html

Safety and security of the people is axiomatically paramount for them to lead a good, dignified life. Owing to delinquency, the society is losing faith in the system. The offenders, thus, need to be dealt with a stern hand. Even one life lost, is an irreparable loss we bear as a nation forever,” the bench said in a 16-page judgment.According to the prosecution, in July 2012, when the witness and the deceased, who worked at a factory, were returning from work, the accused approached them on a motorcycle and “forcibly searched” the pocket of the witness. They subsequently snatched and robbed the mobile phone of the victim, and one of them stabbed the victim in the thigh.The court said that there was “no shadow of a doubt” that the bodily injury inflicted by the appellants was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature and was not caused accidentally but with intention and motive to rob the mobile phone of the deceased victim.Assailing the trial court judgment, convicting and sentencing them for murdering the victim, the appellants argued that there was no light at the spot of the incident and therefore the witness could not have possibly seen any of the alleged assailants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/society-losing-faith-in-system-delhi-hc-as-it-upholds-murder-conviction-of-two-101638296794204.html

Weather officials forecast that calm conditions from Wednesday will see the pollution take a turn for the worse, adding that Delhi could receive light rain on Thursday, as a western disturbance approaches.“Local surface winds were relatively strong on Tuesday, leading to an improvement, but the AQI remained within the ‘very poor’ category. On December 1 and 2, winds are likely to be calm, reducing ventilation and leading to deterioration in the air quality,” said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a body under the ministry of earth sciences.Also Read | Cocktail of slow winds, stubble fires gives Delhi its worst November AQIGufran Beig, founder and project director at Safar said stubble burning season in northern states was at its end, with farm fires contributing to just 1% of Delhi’s PM2.5 (ultra-fine polluting particles) count on Tuesday.“Only 186 fires were recorded across the northern plains. Wind speeds will again drop from Wednesday and a low mixing layer will also influence pollution levels,” he said.Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 9.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, while the maximum was 25.6 degrees, both around the normal mark for this time of the year.“Delhi is expected to see two western disturbances in the first week of December. While the first may bring light rain on December 2, the second could bright light rain on December 6,” said RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, stating showers will drop the day-time temperature, but minimum temperature will rise during these two spells. He said while November tends to see one to two WDs each year, December generally sees two to three WDs. “We are already expected to see two of these WDs and this can help the air quality,” he added.According to the seven day forecast by the Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi, the air quality will remain in the ‘very poor’ category, unless Delhi receives significant rain.“From December 1, the air quality is likely to deteriorate but will remain in the ‘very poor’ category and PM 2.5 will be the prominent pollutant during this period,” said the daily bulletin released by the EWS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-pollution-drops-to-7-day-low-but-stays-in-very-poor-zone-101638296555870.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||Mamata visits Siddhivinayak temple, meets Aaditya, Raut||Mumbai On a drive to develop a national footprint and occupy a prominent space at the opposition, West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) president Mamata Banerjee arrived in Mumbai on Tuesday to meet Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray. The three-day visit will also see Banerjee meeting leading industrialists to invite them for the ‘Bengal Global Business Summit’ scheduled in April next year. After landing in Mumbai, Banerjee visited the Siddhivinayak Temple. She said she had prayed for the health of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is recuperating after spine surgery. She raised slogans hailing Maharashtra and Bengal and paid her respects at the memorial of Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Tukaram Omble, who was killed in action while nabbing Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab during the 26/11 terror attacks. Later, she met Maharashtra environment minister and CM Thackeray’s son Aaditya Thackeray and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut. Speaking to reporters after the around half-an-hour meeting, Aaditya said that no political discussions had taken place between them. He added that Banerjee met them whenever she came to Mumbai. Banerjee had also called on Thackeray during her previous visit in 2017. He said that Banerjee wanted to meet Thackeray, but this could not materialise due to the bio-bubble restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Around two-three years ago when she had come to Mumbai, Uddhav saheb and I had come to meet her. Uddhav ji and Mamata didi share a good bond. Both the leaders have been in touch and have good coordination, whether it is in Covid or otherwise...It was a good meeting and we want to take the ties between them forward,” he said. He added that the West Bengal chief minister had conveyed her good wishes for the recovery of her Maharashtra counterpart. Though the Shiv Sena and AITMC parted ways with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) later, the two parties were part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee. NCP chief spokesperson and minister for minority development minister Nawab Malik said that Banerjee was scheduled to make a courtesy visit to Pawar on Wednesday at 3 pm. This will take place at Pawar’s residence ‘Silver Oak’ in South Mumbai. Pawar was planning to campaign for Banerjee during the assembly elections in Bengal earlier this year but had to drop his plans due to health issues. Incidentally, the Shiv Sena had planned to contest the West Bengal Assembly polls earlier this year, but later decided against it and instead announced support to the AITMC. Banerjee will also meet industrialists on Wednesday at a five-star hotel in central Mumbai. She is also expected to participate in the wedding reception of Raut’s daughter. The outreach to both, the Shiv Sena and Pawar assumes significance in the wake of the AITMC’s national ambitions, its growing distance from the Congress and gradual poaching of Congress leaders from states like Goa and Haryana. The party has weaned into its fold former Goa chief minister and senior Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro and former Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar. In Meghalaya, the Trinamool Congress walked away with 12 of the 17 MLAs to become the principal opposition party. The Congress is the third partner in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) regime in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mamata-visits-siddhivinayak-temple-meets-aaditya-raut-101638296554555.html
30-11-2021||Lucknow||Rare bird spotted in Muzaffarnagar’s Haidarpur wetland||MEERUT Two local bird watchers spotted a rare bird in Haiderpur wetland in Muzaffarnagar on Saturday. Ashish Loya and Ashish Gujjar of Bijnor visit the Haiderpur wetland almost every day and on Saturday they saw a group of Smew (mergellus albellus) in the backwaters of the wetland. Loya said these birds were uncommon. They were small diving ducks and frequented lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. They were shy, often found alone or in small groups. The female had dark rusty brown head with big white throat and cheek patch. He said one female was spotted among a group of tufted ducks and claimed that these were some of the most beautiful ducks in the world and a rare winter visitor to India. In 2020, a female Smew was spotted at Gajoldoba Barrage in West Bengal and an individual was spotted in Jhajjar area of Haryana in 2014. He said not many records were available of its sightings. In Haiderpur wetland, the bird has been sighted for two years in a row. Last year, a male was spotted by Ashish Loya. The Haiderpur wetland is situated on the confluence of the Ganga and its tributary Solani river on the border of Muzaffarnagar and Bijnor and is home to rare and endangered bird species. It was developed with funds of Muzaffarnagar development authority and opened formally for tourists on November 14, 2019 by the then divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar. The bird species’ count in and around the wetland has risen from 172 to 322 in the past few years. The backwater wetland is spread over 18,000 acres and receives more than 50,000 migratory birds during winter. Recently, a large herd of over 150 swamp deer ( state animal of UP) was also spotted in Haiderpur wetland.. The wetland has some endangered species like smooth coated otters, swamp deer, fishing cat, gharial and is reported to have the biggest stock of greylag goose and bar-headed goose in one single wetland in India ( easily above 4,000 each). In 2020, a dolphin safari was also started below the barrage and tourists from nearby districts, bird watchers and photographers from all over India have begun to visit this rare natural jewel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rare-bird-spotted-in-muzaffarnagar-s-haidarpur-wetland-101638296434069.html
30-11-2021||Delhi||Entry-level admissions to private schools in Delhi to begin on December 15||The registration process for admission to entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten and Class 1 — for the 2022-23 academic year in private schools across the national capital will begin from December 15, the Delhi government said on Tuesday. According to the circular issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE), the admission forms will be available from December 15 -- on the school’s website and campus -- and the last date for submission of forms is January 7.The school websites will upload the first list of selected candidates on February 4, a second list on February 21, and, if required, a final list will be announced on March 15. The admission process will conclude on March 31.Entry level admissions to government schools have already begun in the city, and are being conducted in phases.The DoE circular issued on Tuesday has made it mandatory for schools to charge only ₹25 for the application form and have made it optional for parents to purchase the school prospectus.According to the circular, DoE has fixed an upper age limit of 4, 5, and 6, as of March 31, 2022, for admission in nursery, kindergarten and Class 1, respectively. The minimum age for admission in these classes is 3, 4, and 5 years as of March 31, 2022, respectively. In line with previous years, age relaxation of up to 30 days for admission in the minimum and upper age limit for these classes can be granted by the head of school, for which parents can submit a physical application.As per the circular, private schools have also been given autonomy to decide their criteria for admission, and upload them on the DoE website by December 14. The circular also warns them against including several criteria abolished by the Delhi government in 2016, including parents’ education, profession, income, food habits, and written or oral interviews of both students and parents. Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, and the chairperson of the National Progressive School’s Conference which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said that the schedule had been announced well within time. She said application forms will be available both on the school website and on campus. “The process is quite long and no new changes seem to have been introduced this year. It’s good that the process has been initiated earlier this time. Last time, it was delayed because of the pandemic,” said Acharya. She said that schools will need to take extra efforts to familiarise children with the school environment after nursery since many parents did not enrol children into playschool or other preparatory classes amid the pandemic.Bharat Arora, general secretary of the Action Committee of Unaided Schools, said that the timely announcement of the admission schedule will help bring the academic cycle back on track. “Private schools are all set to initiate the process as per the schedule and we pray for the normal start of the next session. We hope that admission continues as per the schedule,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/entrylevel-admissions-to-private-schools-in-delhi-to-begin-on-december-15-101638296314174.html
30-11-2021||Delhi||Stubble fire count in north India at five-year high, Nasa satellite data shows||With the farm fire season in the northern plains at its close, this year is set to be the worst year in terms of the total number of fires recorded in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the last five years, National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (Nasa) satellite data analysed by an environmental think-tank shows. The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), which looked at stubble burning data from the three states between October 1 and November 28 using the VIIRS satellite, found that there have been 90,984 fires cumulatively in the three states this year, almost 7,000 more than last year’s 84,525. To be sure, a bulk of these fires came from Punjab.Punjab has so far recorded 76,427 fires, up from last year’s figure of 74,183 and behind only 2016 (86,379). Similarly, Haryana’s count of 9,869 fires is significantly up from last year’s count of 5,335 fires, but behind 2016 (13,130).The count is the highest in the three states since 2016, which saw 108,298 fires, CEEW data showed. In comparison, the figure was around 54,000 in 2019, showing the efforts put in to curb stubble burning have largely not yielded any major results. Data shows while the count in Uttar Pradesh this year (4,695) has largely been consistent with last year’s figure (4,701), Punjab and Haryana have fared worse than they did in 2020. Adeel Khan, research analyst at CEEW says Firozpur in Punjab saw the most stubble fires across the state, recording around 9,000 blazes, followed by Sangrur, Bathinda and Moga. “Ludhiana [in Punjab] also reported a marked rise in farm fires this year, touching 5,400, compared to around 3,900 in last year. In Haryana, Fatehabad reported a maximum of around 2,000 fires followed by Kaithal, Jind and Karnal districts. Shahjahanpur in UP reported a maximum of 470 farm fires, compared to 170 last year,” said Khan.Experts however also said that crop stubble fires are almost over in Punjab and Haryana, Uttar Pradesh was still recording a decent number. Data for November 28, released by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), showed that Punjab logged five fires, Haryana nine, while UP recorded 241.“We are still recording over 100 fires per day in Madhya Pradesh and over 200 fires per day in Uttar Pradesh,” Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR) at Nasa said.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the impact from stubble burning in Delhi’s air is also now negligible, with stubble burning contributing at an average of 4% to Delhi’s air between November 23 and 27. During this period, local sources contributed 78 percent to the total pollution load.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/stubble-fire-count-in-north-india-at-five-year-high-nasa-satellite-data-shows-101638296253515.html
30-11-2021||Delhi||Four of family found dead in outer Delhi, cops suspect murder-suicide||Four members of a family — husband, wife and their two minor children— were found dead at their rented home in outer Delhi’s Samaypur Badli on Tuesday morning, police said, adding that prima facie, it appeared to be a case of murder-suicide, the motive for which is still being investigated. Police suspect that the 45-year-old man poisoned his 38-year-old wife and their children — a five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter— before killing himself by hanging. Police said they are yet to find evidence of an outsider’s role in the deaths, but further investigation is on in the case and they were also trying to ascertain the type of poison that may have been used and also the motive. “We reached the spot after receiving a call from the dead woman’s sister, who lives in a different portion of the same house. A man was found hanging from the ceiling fan, while the others were found lying unconscious. The girl had frothed from her nostrils, but there were no injury marks on her body. Prima facie, it appears to be a case of poisoning and suicide, subject to verification by a post-mortem examination,” said Brijendra Kumar Yadav, deputy commissioner of police, (outer-north).Police said the bodies have been sent for an autopsy and they are awaiting the reports.The woman’s mother said she too got a call from her elder daughter alerting her that her second daughter’s husband was seen hanging from the ceiling fan, while the others were lying unconscious on the bed and sofa. “I was shocked to get that call. I still did not believe her and rushed to their house. When I saw police around the corner, my worst fears were confirmed,” said the mother. She told HT that her second daughter had left her marriage for another man, who lives in Mundka, two months ago. “He had promised her a luxurious life and she was lured by those promises. But she started everyone at home and so she returned on Saturday. I was there with her and my son-in-law all through Saturday to help them sort out their differences. Towards the end of the day, they agreed to start afresh. Little did I suspect that something like this would happen,” she said. The woman’s elder sister lives in a separate portion of the house in Samaypur Badli with her husband and three sons. “ My niece used to come visit me every morning around 8am, but on Tuesday, when she didn’t turn up till 8.45am, I went knocking on their door. Troubled by the lack of response, I asked my younger son to open the lock from inside after breaking open a window near the door. He did as I asked and was shocked to see my brother-in-law hanging from the ceiling fan and the others lying unconscious,” said the sister. She said she immediately informed the police and relatives. “We rushed to the spot. It looks like the man murdered the three members of his family and hanged himself. Their neighbours said that the family lived in the rented house for the past 20 years. Relatives said the family was financially distressed as well,” said a police officer associated with the case, asking not to be namedAll four of them were rushed to the hospital where they were declared brought dead, police said. Teams from the forensics unit and crime branch also inspected the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-of-family-found-dead-in-outer-delhi-cops-suspect-murdersuicide-101638296134807.html

The figures of illegal infiltration are higher this year compared to the 131 intruders recorded in the previous year. Of the 131 intruders, 85 were Indians and 46 were Bangladeshi nationals. “The number of intruders have increased this year. Among them, many are smugglers, criminals. The BSF jawans are maintaining vigil across the border,” BSF inspector general Sushanta Kumar Nath told the media persons at BSF headquarters in Agartala. In 2019, a total of 236 people were apprehended for illegally crossing the international border. The northeastern state shares 856 kilometre-long border with Bangladesh of which 67 kilometres are yet to be fenced. Most of these unfenced border patches are scheduled to have single row fencing as there are people living within 150 yards of the border in many of these places. Composite fencing and composite border outposts are being erected on the eastern side of Tripura.“We hope all work will be over by the end of 2022”, IG Nath said.The Border Security Forces (BSF) seized different contraband items worth Rs. 12.94 crores from Tripura’s border this year of which 60,812 are Yaba tablets, 12,067 kilograms processed cannabis, 30,070 bottles of contraband cough syrup, 8,351 liquor bottles. They also seized 2,288 cattle worth Rs. 2.34 crores. During the period, they also destroyed cannabis saplings worth Rs. 7.76 crore jointly with state police and the forest department.

30-11-2021||Delhi||With list of dos and don’ts, Delhi pollution body asks residents to join air pollution fight||To encourage public participation in the Capital’s fight against pollution, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has released a list of dos and don’ts that people can follow according to the air quality of the city at any point of time.A senior DPCC official said that the list, which uses pollution level benchmarks similar to the scales of the Supreme Court-mandated Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), is an advisory for the public.Also Read | Delhi’s pollution drops to 7-day low but stays in ‘very poor’ zone“Delhi usually sees high pollution levels during the winter season and over the last few days, the air quality in the city has slipped into the ‘severe’ zone on several days. While the government agencies have a set action plan to follow when the air quality crosses a certain stage, if the public also participates in the government’s fight against pollution, we will be able to get better results,” said the official.The list suggests that when the pollution levels in Delhi reaches the ‘moderate to poor’ category, which means the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) are between 6µg/m3 and 120µg/m3, or the PM 10 levels (coarse particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) are in the range 101-350µg/m3, people should adopt measures such as keeping engines of their vehicles properly tuned, maintain proper air pressure in tyres, keeping the pollution under control certificates of their vehicles updated, turning the ignition of their vehicles off when waiting at red lights and not dump garbage in open spaces.Also Read | Cocktail of slow winds, stubble fires gives Delhi its worst November AQISimilarly, when the pollution levels are in the ‘very poor’ category — PM 2.5 levels in the range 121-250µg/m3 or PM 10 levels in the range 351-430µg/m3 — the general public is advised to minimise the use of private vehicles and use public transport, ensure that the air filters of their vehicles are regularly replaced and avoid undertaking local construction activities such as repairs and extensions.The list says that when the pollution level hits ‘severe’ (PM 2.5 levels greater than 250µg/m3 or PM 10 levels greater than 430µg/m3) the general public is advised to carpool, walk, cycle and use public transport; work from home if possible; not use wood or coal for heating; owners of independent houses are advised to provide heaters to security guards to prevent open burning; and combine errands to reduce trips.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi resident welfare association joint front, said that the residents group is also conducting awareness drives to encourage residents to use public transportation and refrain from garbage dumping and burning.“It’s good that the government is creating awareness but they should also promote action. They should conduct meetings with the RWA where they should listen to what we have to say and we will also take note of their side. A document must be prepared based on this discussion and action must be initiated based on this,” Vohra said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, also said that public participation is essential to ensure that pollution control measures yield maximum benefits.“Government agencies and public will have to work together to control pollution. The begining of this will have to be creating awareness so that people know the impacts of air pollution. Compared to a decade ago, public knowledge has increased, now there is a conversation around pollution and its impacts. The more we involve citizens, the more successful would the preventive measures be,” Roychowdhury said.November has been the cruellest month this year in Delhi, with 11 days showing severely polluted air on the monitors of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the highest since detailed records have been maintained by the pollution watchdog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-list-of-dos-and-don-ts-delhi-pollution-body-asks-residents-to-join-air-pollution-fight-101638295714481.html
30-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Over 7,000 North MCD teachers stop online classes to protest salary delay||Over 7,000 teachers from different municipal schools under the jurisdiction of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (north MCD), stopped teaching online classes from Tuesday, affecting at least 150,000 students. The agitating teachers alleged that they did not receive salaries for the last three months.Kuldeep Singh Khatri, the president of Shikshak Nyay Manch – the umbrella teachers’ association of all municipal corporations – said that despite repeated requests, teachers did not receive their salaries after August this year. “The municipal authorities have not given us annual Diwali bonuses since 2018 either. They have not implemented a hike of 17% in dearness and housing allowances, despite clearance from the Central government five months ago. This is the reason that many of our senior teachers joined Delhi government schools, after taking trained graduate teacher (TGT) promotions,” he said.He also alleged that municipal authorities have not yet given any ex-gratia compensation to families of the teachers who lost their lives due to Covid-19. “Why would we spend ₹500 every month on Internet, if the MCD doesn’t give us an allowance for that? Besides, teachers of the north MCD schools have been deployed to District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), for which they are compelled to travel even 100 kilometres a day. Due to pending salary dues, many teachers are unable to pay EMIs for loans they took,” he said.Khatri also said that if all the pending dues of the teachers are not cleared within seven days, the teachers will begin an indefinite strike outside the Bharatiya Janata Party’s state headquarters.When contacted, Alok Verma, the chairman of the education committee in the north MCD, also said that the teachers have not been paid in the last three months or given their hiked allowances since July. “But, what can we do if the Delhi government does not release the funds? I respect the feelings of the teachers, but the ball is in the Delhi government’s court. We need additional funds of at least ₹80 crore to meet the teachers’ demand. They should knock the doors of the chief minister and his deputy for it,” he said.The Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to request for comment.He also said that because of the protest, the education of at least 150,000 students will be hampered. “We are trying to resolve the teachers’ issues. But, we can’t guarantee for any timeline,” Verma said.Sanjay Goel, the north MCD commissioner, was not available for comments, despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-over-7-000-north-mcd-teachers-stop-online-classes-to-protest-salary-delay-101638295594302.html
30-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s one wrong decision led to revocation of Article 370: Omar||The National Conference vice-president and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, on Tuesday attributed the revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A to People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s ‘one wrong decision’ which he said was to form a coalition government with the BJP. Quoting the famous couplet at a public rally in Chatroo of Doda district, Omar said, “They (BJP) took advantage of our weakness and I knew it. That’s why I offered my hand of friendship to late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed sahib. Soon after 2014 assembly elections, I had cautioned him that the path being chosen by him (exploring possibilities of forming a coalition government with the BJP) would be very dangerous for J&K and we may not survive by this decision of yours.” “I told Mufti Sahib I had no greed for power. I had already served for six years as a CM and I told him that we don’t want any of our MLAs and MLCs as ministers in the government. I told him that we will support you unconditionally, but please don’t bring them (BJP) here (in J&K),” he added. “He (Mufti Mohammad Sayeed), however, might have had some compulsions at that time. Lamhon ne khata ki, sadiyon ne saza paayi...Now, we do not know for how long we will be punished for that one wrong decision because not even a single promise made to us post-revocation of Article 370 has been fulfilled,” Omar said. “If the NC had come to power in the last assembly elections, there would have been no revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A, no land allotted under the Roshni Act would have been taken back and no jobs would have gone to the outsiders,” he said. In 2014 assembly elections, the PDP had won 28 seats, the BJP got 25 seats, the NC 15 and the Congress 12. On February 27, 2015, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sealed an alliance between the PDP and the BJP to form a coalition government. On March 1, 2015, Sayeed took oath as the chief minister of the PDP-BJP combine in a ceremony that was attended by PM Modi and other leaders. However, on June 19, 2018, the three-year-old coalition government collapsed after the BJP pulled out of the alliance over worsening security scenario and bitter political feuds between the two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mufti-mohammad-sayeed-s-one-wrong-decision-led-to-revocation-of-article-370-omar-101638295414433.html
30-11-2021||Chandigarh||Hurriyat Conference objects to ‘acquisition’ of land for CRPF camp||The Hurriyat Conference on Monday expressed serious concern on the land of south Kashmir village being ‘taken away’ for setting up a CRPF camp. Villagers of Oukhoo had been protesting against the same for the past few days. “The authorities are set to take over a large tract of agricultural land in Oukhoo village of Pulwama for setting up a big CRPF establishment. This has put their livelihood in great peril which the locals are resenting,” Hurriyat Conference spokesperson said in a statement. The Hurriyat Conference asked the authorities to revoke the “anti people order”. Meanwhile, Pulwama DC refuted that private land is being taken away and said fake narrative is being circulated. “The administration has categorically refuted the fake narrative being circulated in the social media that land of people is being handed over to the CRPF. The public is informed that land in question at Oukhoo is exclusively state land and is not proprietary land of any individual. The Pulwama administration is committed towards people’s welfare and anyone with a counter agenda of spreading baseless rumors and propaganda will be aptly dealt with,” Pulwama DC Baseer ul Haq Choudhary said in a tweet.

30-11-2021||Dehradun||My decision, says Dhami on scrapping Char Dham law. Then makes a promise||DEHRADUN: Hours after going public with his plan to scrap the controversial Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday asserted that it was “solely his decision” taken in the interest of the state.“I want to tell you that I am the mukhya sevak (chief servant) to the people of Uttarakhand and this was my decision in the state’s welfare considering the time and situation,” chief minister Dhami said at a Press conference on Tuesday evening.Dhami also credited the committee led by former Rajya Sabha member Manohar Kant Dhyani which studied the law with “working hard for the last three months”.The panel submitted its report two days ago. “The report was then analysed by the cabinet sub-committee led by the minister of religious affairs Satpal Maharaj which submitted its report to me yesterday before I took the final decision based on all the aspects related to the welfare of the state.”The law, which was introduced by the Trivendra Singh Rawat-led government in 2019, allowed the board to act as the highest governing body, to look after the shrines while framing policies and sanctioning expenditure. Priests of the Char Dhams — Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri — opposed the board, saying it was an infringement upon their traditional rights over the Himalayan temples.Dhami, who was elevated as the chief minister in July this year after his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat was told by the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership to step down, also promised that the government will consult people associated with the Char Dham shrines and other temples on “how to improve the facilities for pilgrims” before taking any steps.One of the prime criticism of Trivendra Singh Rawat for the law was that the state government did not engage the priests when the Char Dham law was first enacted in 2019.Rawat elaborated. “This will be done by involving all the parties including our priest and saint community in the process. All required steps will be taken to develop our Devbhoomi into the spiritual capital of the world”.Dhami’s decision to scrap the law comes just as the deadline set for him by the priests was to end on Tuesday. In an effort to pressurise the government to withdraw the law, the priests had announced their decision to field candidates in the upcoming state assembly polls in 2022. On Saturday, they held a Janakrosh rally in Dehradun under the umbrella of their body named - Char Dham Teerth Purohit Haq Haqooqdhari Mahapanchayat while observing November 27 as a black day because it was the same date last year when the BJP government had passed the Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/my-decision-says-dhami-on-scrapping-char-dham-law-then-makes-a-promise-101638294456340.html

As per the guidelines, the travellers testing negative will be sent for home quarantine of seven days and retested on the eighth day, whereas, the Covid positive patients will be sent to institutional quarantine centres for 15 days and their samples will be sent for genome sequencing at ICMR-designated testing laboratories. It was emphasised that de-boarding from international flights must comply with the Covid appropriate behaviour and set protocols and a special Covid helpdesk is forthwith established at the Srinagar airport. Secretary, disaster management, has also been directed to monitor the situation and submit a daily report for timely intervention of the agency concerned. The health department has been stressed upon to establish genome sequencing facilities at government medical colleges in Srinagar and Jammu to fast-track the detection of Omicron variant and other mutations. Moreover, district administrations of Budgam and Srinagar were asked to establish government quarantine centres and further explore arrangements for paid quarantine facilities for institutional quarantine to deal with any emergent situation. The health and medical education department was asked to conduct equipment audit to establish functionality of Covid-related infrastructure, including dedicated hospitals, ventilators, oxygen supported beds, and oxygen plants. The department was directed to ensure readiness of manpower and machinery to cater to a peak caseload of at least 7,500 patients per day and firm up the inventory of oxygen supply and medicines. Deputy commissioners were instructed to enhance testing rate and contact tracing for positive patients to trace infection trajectory and establish micro-containment zones at an early stage. Additionally, they were directed to reduce the daily reported cases through strict enforcement of Covid-apt behaviour, SoPs and protocols, and micro-containment zones. Additional chief secretary Vivek Bhardwaj said, “We have already instituted strict surveillance systems at the airports and other entry points including Lakhanpur—the gateway to J&K.” “RTPCR test has been made mandatory for all foreign travellers coming to J&K.

30-11-2021||Lucknow||BJP will roll out six yatras to assess public mood in UP||LUCKNOW The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to take out six yatras across all the 403 assembly segments of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh (UP), chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced at a party meeting on Tuesday. The party had also taken out these yatras prior the 2017 UP polls, said top leaders who attended the meeting. The party’s UP election panel head and education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and information & broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur, a key member of the panel, were present on the occasion. “At that time, the yatra was to expose the previous government. But this yatra would be to tell the cadres about our achievements and to seek people’s blessings,” said Adityanath at the UP BJP headquarters in Lucknow. BJP’s Dalit MLC Vidya Sagar Sonkar will coordinate these yatras that will possibly start from six places from each of the six organisational regions and culminate in Lucknow with a rally by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Leaders who would lead these yatras are yet to be decided but the motorised chariots would have cutouts of Modi and Yogi for sure. Prominent leaders will make speeches at various yatra stopovers,” a party leader said. Two deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were also present during the brainstorming session. A section of BJP leaders believes they could contest these elections along with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The RSS would be involved in galvanizing the masses for these yatras, which would also focus on 78 seats BJP or allies failed to win in 2017 UP polls, as well as areas and constituencies where the ruling party might be feeling the heat of anti-incumbency more. “These yatras, which would precede the ticket distribution, would also help the party assess the public mood,” a party leader said. To beat anti-incumbency, the BJP is expected to change sitting lawmakers in various assembly segments and these journeys would help the “party generate local feedback about the lawmaker and their likely replacements.” The yatras would be supplemented with innovative catch lines. “Like in Baghpat Anurag Thakur ji coined one such line. He said: “Pehle Samajwadi Party dange karatey thaiy, bhajapa dangal karati hai (earlier there were riots in SP time, now wrestling matches are held in BJP days).” A BJP leader pointed out that the yatras would specially focus on opposition bastions like Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha constituency of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi as well as Azamgarh, the Lok Sabha constituency of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav. “The nitty gritties are yet to be finalised but our allies could also be part of these yatras,” said a BJP leader. SHAH TO ADDRESS BOOTH PRESIDENTS Union home minister Amit Shah would address booth presidents in Saharanpur on December 2. BJP chief JP Nadda and defence minister Rajnath Singh have already addressed similar booth meetings in Gorakhpur, Kanpur (where Nadda addressed), Sitapur and Jaunpur (where Rajnath addressed), said party leaders.“We welcome these yatras as they would help the BJP and its leaders realise the people’s sentiments, rampant corruption at the local level and growing resentment against price rise among other things. We hope these yatras travel through regions like Hathras, Lakhimpur Kheri where unspeakable atrocities were heaped on the poor, dalits and farmers by the ruling party and its insensitive leaders. We hope these yatras travel through those ghats where people, after not getting even wood for last rites, started burying the dead in sand during the Covid surge,” said Zishan Haider, Congress spokesman. “These days all political parties are resorting to yatras. Through these journeys, they are able to connect with the masses better and possibly all gather crucial feedback ahead of the polls. BJP is no stranger to yatras,” said Prof Manuka Khanna of political science department of Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-will-roll-out-six-yatras-to-assess-public-mood-in-up-101638292534219.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh and Sachin Vaze meeting: Cops in Vaze’s escort team guilty of negligence||A Mumbai police team inquiring into the Param Bir Singh-Sachin Vaze meeting on Monday concluded that the latter’s escort team is guilty of dereliction of duty. On Tuesday, Mumbai police sent a report to their Navi Mumbai counterparts seeking action on the four escort team personnel. A sub-inspector and three police constables of Navi Mumbai police had escorted Sachin Vaze – prime accused in Thane trader Mansukh Hiran’s murder case and industrialist Mukesh Ambani security scare case – to the Justice KU Chandiwal commission’s courtroom in Fort, south Mumbai. Vaze is currently lodged at Taloja jail, Navi Mumbai. A person aware of the report said the four police personnel were present in the room where Singh and Vaze privately met and talked for an hour. “The policemen knew Vaze faces serious charges,” the source said. “They should not have allowed anyone to speak to him without the permission of NIA court. This is serious dereliction of duty.” On Monday, Mumbai police had appointed Pandurang Shinde, assistant commissioner of police, Colaba division, to begin an inquiry soon after it came to light that Singh and Vaze had met each other for an hour in the Old Secretariat Building where the Chandiwal Commission sits. Shinde recorded statements of the escort team and other witnesses, and submitted a report to deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Dr Hari Balaji N, who sent it to Navi Mumbai Police commissionerate for action. Sources said the DCP’s report suggested that disciplinary action be taken against the guilty cops. Both Dr Hari and ACP Shinde did not respond to phone calls. Navi Mumbai police commissioner Bipin Kumar Singh said, “We have received a report from Mumbai police. I have ordered the DCP (headquarters) to inquire further. Based on the findings, we will take appropriate action.” The Chandiwal commission was constituted in March 2021 to look into the allegations of corruption levelled by Singh against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. Both Vaze and Singh are witnesses in the commission’s inquiry.The meeting between Singh and Vaze reportedly lasted for an hour, people present in the building said. Deshmukh’s lawyers opposed it and raised the issue before the commission. The judge asked Vaze to stay in the room where commission’s proceedings are going on and to not speak to anyone else.Leading criminal lawyer Majeed Memon said, “It’s absolutely illegal. No one can meet an accused who is in judicial custody without the permission of the concerned court. Moreover, in this case, the person (Singh) who met the accused is himself an accused in several cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-and-sachin-vaze-meeting-cops-in-vaze-s-escort-team-guilty-of-negligence-101638292414510.html

Even though lockdowns can prove to be a temporary measure in pausing the virus in its tracks, new mutant variations are likely to re-emerge from under-vaccinated areas and in populations with unaddressed co-morbidities.In such a scenario, only a high rate of immunisation can help a certain population reach ‘herd immunity’, since the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve such a stage keeps changing all the time due to the extent of the virus' impacts.The total number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered across India has now crossed 124 crore. Over 72 lakh doses were administered on Tuesday till 7pm, and according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, the daily vaccination tally is expected to increase further with the compilation of the final reports for the day by late in the night.As for Maharashtra, the state on Tuesday reported 678 fresh Covid-19 infections and 35 related fatalities, 14 more compared to the previous day. With the latest additions, Maharashtra's tally of infections rose to 66,35,658 and the Covid-19 death toll to 1,40,997, according to the official bulletin issued daily by the state's health department.

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||3Ms – Yamunanagar police’s formula for showing drug addicts the right path||Adopting a “3M” (medication, meditation and mainstreaming) model, the Yamunanagar police and members of the civil society have been working on a war footing to help drug addicts here kick the habit.Explaining the initiative, termed “Sahi Raah – From Hell to Heaven, a journey towards better self”, superintendent of police (SP) Kamaldeep Goyal said other than physically identifying addicts, the department launched a helpline (8818-001-383) last month. “We have already received more than 250 calls from addicts, their families and locals with tip-offs about peddlers. Of them, roughly 150 have been identified, registered and are undergoing medication under our supervision, depending on their condition. Eight are admitted in hospitals for treatment. A batch, comprising seven men of different age groups, also attended an indoor camp in Kalesar,” the police official said. Following the camp, conducted by Art of Living at Kalesar’s Kaleshwar Mahadev Math on the foothills of Shivalik Hills, a valedictory celebration was organised by Ambala Range IG Bharti Arora.Daily review meetings and biweekly open house sessions for the affected families are also being organised at the mini-secretariat, while the SP also plans to host dinners for a couple of recovered addicts and their families. The initiative also aims to eradicate drug peddling through legal and social approaches.Frequent drug recoveries by the police and door-to-door visits to dissuade peddlers were putting societal pressure on many, said Surender Madaan, one of the members of Hamida Peace Committee that has been roped in for the initiative. “We have been going from house to house, warning sellers against destroying the lives of youths. Similar drives will be initiated in other areas that are also infamous for peddlers,” Madaan said.SP Goyal said a 50-year-old woman, Nasreen, from old Hamida was nabbed with 60gm of smack last week. Her son-in-law, Allah Banda, 28, was also arrested with 100gm smack last year, in one of the biggest drug recoveries in the district.He said such measures will organically develop awareness among addicts and peddlers regarding the devastating effects of drugs.“Most of the drugs supplied here are from Uttar Pradesh. The addicts are mostly from the lower-middle class and a lot of them are auto-rickshaw drivers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3ms-yamunanagar-police-s-formula-for-showing-drug-addicts-the-right-path-101638287496645.html

The suit has claimed that the content of the hoardings which were put up from July 1 to 4 at prominent locations in the city tarnished the reputation of the bank as it attributed alleged irregularities of ₹123 crore to the bank.The suit has stated that though the police had concluded that the allegations of irregularities were based on mistaken facts and closed the case, the hoardings gave the opposite message and hence the bank was aggrieved. The HC has asked Malik and others to respond to the suit within six weeks.According to the suit, hoardings had been put up at Ballard Pier and Ghatkopar (W) on July 1 showcasing a news article which stated that no investigation had been conducted on an alleged complaint of financial irregularities of the bank in 2015. The hoarding also had the photographs of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator and leader of opposition in the Maharashtra legislative Council, Pravin Darekar, who is also current chairman of Mumbai Bank, shown behind bars.The suit has claimed that the hoardings had been up till July 4 during which the contents were seen by a large number of people and thus tarnished the image of the bank.When the defamation suit came up for hearing before the single judge bench of justice Riyaz Chagla on Monday, advocate Akhilesh Chaubey informed the bench that an interim application had been filed in the suit seeking an injunction against Malik and others from tarnishing the image of the bank and its office bearers and also to issue a public apology for the putting up the hoardings.The bank in its suit has stated that the hoardings were put up at the instance of Malik and others.The defamation suit has sought directions to Malik to issue an unconditional apology to the bank, to retract the allegations against the bank made through the hoardings and to pay ₹1,000 crore as damages to the bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bank-sues-nawab-malik-for-1-000-crore-101638287014454.html

According to the convenors, an application had been submitted to the administration for permission in September to hold the event at the Gandhi Maidan, but there has been no response.“We had requested the administration for space at the Gandhi Maidan. But still, there has been no response to our request letter. We had to cancel the event as the ground was not available,” Amarendra Jha, secretary, CRD, said.Jha said that most of the leading publishers had insisted that they will only be part of the book fair if the event is held at Gandhi Maidan. “We had earlier tried to host the book fair at Patliputra ground in the city. Even in 2018, we hosted the event at Gyan Bhawan. But all these venues failed to match the charm of Gandhi Maidan,” he said.Amit Jha, another member of the organising committee, said that the event was planned considering the decrease in Covid-19 cases in the state. “Things seemed to be getting back to normal. So we planned book fair by the year-end,” Jha, said. But it is learnt that the Gandhi Maidan is not being allotted for any social or cultural event for several months due to Covid-19 pandemic, he added.The CRD secretary said that in case the administration accepts their request, the Patna Book Fair could be held in February 2022. “We can’t hold the event in January 2022. The ground will not be available due to the Republic Day function and its preparations,“ he said. Not just that, no leading publisher would be available in January as events like World Book Fair in Delhi and Kolkata Book Fair have already been planned at that time, he added.An official from the district administration, who did not want to be named, said that no social and cultural activities have been allowed at Gandhi Maidan ground since March 2020. “ No point requesting for permission to hold the book fair at the ground,” the official said.The Patna Book Fair is being held in the state capital since 1985 and in the over 30-year long journey, it’s been mostly held at the Gandhi Maidan. In 2020, the book fair was not held due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/unavailability-of-gandhi-maidan-forces-organisers-to-cancel-patna-book-fair-101638286953888.html

He refused to share the date of removal of eyes. Dr Sumit Kumar, assistant professor at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) at Bettiah, described panophthalmitis as a severe inflammation of all coats of the eyeball, including intra-ocular structures. “Such infections are quite grievous and likely to be caused among the patients afflicted with diabetes, HIV and low immunity. However, poor sterilisation of instruments used may well cause panophthalmitis after cataract surgery and the disease has all the potentiality to impair the eye sight,” said Dr Kumar. The matter came to light on Monday after victims’ family members approached the civil surgeon office, complaining about the doctors’ negligence at Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital. HT spoke to some of the victims’ kin and learnt of a common thread in the tragedy.A resident of Muzaffarpur, Kaushaya Devi, in 70’s, suffered excruciating pain along with swelling and frequent water discharge from her left eye (operated) hours after she was discharged after cataract surgery at the Muzaffarpur hospital on November 22. “We took her to Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital and were told the need for immediate removal of the eye as it has gone post redemption and may affect the sight of other eye,” said Chandan Kumar, Kaushaya Devi’s grandson. Some others whose eyes had to be removed after cataract surgery are Savatri Devi (Muzaffarpur), Harendra Rajak (Vaishali), Meena Devi (Muzaffarpur) and Kaushalya Devi (Muzaffarpur). Jaitun Khatoon and Jumarati Miyan, residents of separate villages of Muzaffarpur district, complained of extreme pain. “I feel like losing sight completely,” said Jaitun Khatoon. Dr Subhash P, one of the four members of the probe team, said, “During preliminary investigation, it was found that as many as 65 patients underwent surgery at the hospital on November 22 itself. We have come across 13 cases in which either patients’ eyes have been removed or are undergoing treatment so far.” The management of Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital admitted all of them were operated there. “In the wake of the complaints from some patients after the operation, they were referred to other hospitals in Patna. In the meantime, we had to remove the eyes of four patients at our hospital itself,” Deepak Kumar, assistant manager, Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital, said. Muzaffarpur district magistrate Pranav Kumar said a team has been constituted for probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/seven-lose-eye-sight-after-cataract-surgery-in-muzaffarpur-fate-of-six-others-in-dark-101638286894907.html
30-11-2021||Patna||Empty liquor bottles on found in Bihar assembly premises, barbs fly||The Nitish Kumar government in Bihar faced acute embarrassment on Tuesday following the recovery of empty bottles of liquor in legislature premises of the state where a total ban on liquor was imposed in April 2016.The bottles were found under a tree in the area earmarked as parking lot for two-wheelers, officials said. Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav raised the matter in the post lunch session of the state assembly, saying it was outrageous. Chief minister Nitish Kumar informed the house that he was not aware of recovery of liquor bottles on the premises of the state legislature and said a probe could be ordered on permission from Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha to ascertain how the liquor bottles found their way inside the legislature premises and who all were involved. “We will ask the state police chief and chief secretary to carry a through inquiry,” he said. In response, Yadav said, “Please ensure that lower-level officials are not made scapegoats and the big fish do not go unpunished.” Sources said the chief minister held a meeting with director general of police S K Singhal and chief secretary Tripurari Sharan in the assembly in the afternoon. In the evening, the DGP told reporters that the place where empty bottles were recovered was not under CCTC coverage but all angles were being probed.Yadav accused the government of failing to implement the liquor ban. “This is outrageous. The spot is less than 100 metres away from the chief minister’s chamber. Only yesterday, the chief minister presided over a farce wherein NDA legislators took the pledge, inside the central hall here, against liquor consumption. Within 24 hours, liquor bottles have been found in the same premises,” the leader of opposition told reporters later outside the house. “Prohibition in Bihar is a total failure and administering oath not to drink liquor to people is all a sham.The government will not give a logical reply and dub the entire episode of recovery of liquor bottle in the assembly premises as a conspiracy by the opposition. The chief minister must resign as he is also the home minister,” Yadav said. Yadav’s party Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and other opposition parties, including the Congress, have been critical of the state government, especially for the last one month over which the state has seen 40 alleged hooch deaths in Gopalganj, West Champaran and Muzaffarpur districts.Two MLAs exchange expletives in public The state assembly premises on Tuesday witnessed unsavoury scenes when RJD legislator Bhai Virendra and BJP’s Sanjay Sarougi indulged in an ugly spat,exchanging expletives in full view of media persons before the assembly sat for the day. Reports said the trouble started when Bhai Virendra passed a caustic comment against Sarougi, calling him a person having adulterated roots. The latter hit back, accusing Virendra of being corrupt. The spat soon turned ugly and both the legislators started hurling expletives before they were pacified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/empty-liquor-bottles-on-found-in-bihar-assembly-premises-barbs-fly-101638286893684.html

30-11-2021||Mumbai||State orders probe in use of official car by Param Bir Singh; suspension process underway, says minister||Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse-Patil said that a probe has been ordered into the use of an official car by the former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh while appearing for inquiry into a complaint against him two days ago, as well as his ‘meeting’ with Sachin Vaze, suspended assistant inspector, who is an accused in Antilia explosive scare case. Walse-Patil also said that the process of suspension of the IPS officer is underway.He said Singh has not communicated with the state government about his returning to the state service. However, Singh visited the office of home guards, as its director-general, but did not take charge of the post. (Singh had been appointed as director-general (home guards) after his removal as Mumbai Police chief.)“Singh is neither on duty nor has he communicated with the state government after returning. He had indeed gone to the home guard office two days ago, but he has not taken charge of the post. He was sitting in the waiting room. It is also true that he used his official car while appearing for the inquiry against him (last week.) It was inappropriate, as he is not on duty. A probe on this has been ordered. He is facing an absconding warrant issued by the court,” he said.Singh appeared in the Mumbai crime branch office on November 25 and was grilled for over five hours in an extortion case. On Monday, Singh and suspended police officer Vaze, reportedly, had a ‘meeting’ when both had come, to appear before the Chandiwal Commission. Vaze is key accused in Antilia explosive scare case and Hiran murder case.Walse-Patil said that he does not want to speak about the suspension of Singh, but the process was underway. The home minister said that any accused needs the permission of the court before meeting anybody. “He (Vaze) is in judicial custody and had not taken any such permission from the court. I have ordered an inquiry into the meeting between the two. I have asked the Mumbai Police commissioner to inquire into it,” he said.Walse-Patil said that there was no pressure on the police while probing Singh. “There should not be any reason for any such pressure. Singh has taken protection (from arrest) from the Apex court and has been appearing before the investigating officers in various cases registered against him,” he said in reply to the question about the pressure on the investigating officers.When asked about the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) complaint on the non-cooperation from the Mumbai Police, the home minister said, “Mumbai Police are doing their duty, CBI is doing its duty. We are cooperating with the central agency and every process is being followed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-orders-probe-in-use-of-official-car-by-param-bir-singh-suspension-process-underway-says-minister-101638285873834.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||Centre asks states to ramp up tests, screen international passengers||Mumbai The Union health ministry directed the State government to enhance surveillance on international passengers and increase RT-PCR tests for early identification of positive cases and for effective containment of Omicron variant.The ministry held a meeting with all health secretaries of the states and Union Territories on Tuesday.A health department official said that the centre directed the states to prepare hospital infrastructure and increase medicine capacities. “The new variant is said to be more virulent and rapid in transmission. Therefore, the ministry has directed the states to remain prepared with additional health infrastructure, including beds, ICUs, medical use oxygen, ventilators etc. Besides, the focus should be on rural areas and paediatric cases as per the emergency Covid-19 response protocol,” the senior official said, requesting anonymity. Another senior health department official said that the ministry strictly asked the states to adhere to the Covid guidelines. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that the variant can be detected in an RT-PCR, meanwhile, studies are ongoing on whether there is any impact on Rapid Antigen Tests. “The Centre has asked states to increase tests, increase surveillance, effective contact tracing, and have institutional and home quarantine. Besides, we have to push the vaccination drive and push information, communication and education activities to promote Covid-appropriate behaviour to tackle the threat of Omicron,” said the official, who did not wish to be named. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government would follow the guidelines strictly. “They have asked us to increase RT-PCRs, quarantine the international passengers, re-do the RT-PCR test on the eighth day, promptly send positive reports for genomic sequencing, etc. We will follow the guidelines,” said Tope. The minister added that the state has mandated a seven-day institutional quarantine for international passengers coming from ‘at-risk’ countries.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with all district collectors and city commissioners on Omicron preparedness on Sunday.

30-11-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM Dhami scraps Chardham Devasthanam Board||The Uttarakhand government led by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday ordered scrapping of the Chardham Devasthanam Board, reversing the 2019 decision of his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat.Dhami’s decision led the Congress to term the scrapping of the Board as "defeat” of the saffron party's “arrogance” even as the Chardham priests hailed the decision, terming it as their “victory” and thanking Dhami for it while distributing sweets among themselves.They also offered prayers at Gangotri and Yamunotri temples in the Himalayas praying for Dhami’s long life."After studying all aspects of the issue, we have decided to withdraw the Chardham Devasthanam Board Act," Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said.Chardham priests had been demanding scrapping of the board ever since its creation in 2019 saying it was an infringement of their traditional rights over the temples.A high-level committee constituted by Dhami to look into the Devasthanam Board issue had submitted its recommendations to him in Rishikesh on Sunday."We went through the details of the report submitted by the panel headed by Manohar Kant Dhyani. After considering all aspects of the issue, our government has decided to withdraw the Act," Chief Minister Dhami said.Constituted during the tenure of former Chief Minister Rawat, the Chardham Devasthanam Board managed the affairs of 51 temples across the state including the famous Himalayan temples of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.Chardham priests described the scrapping of the Board a result of the sustained pressure they had mounted on the government to scrap it."It is a historic decision. A unique incident of Indian democracy where a government had to withdraw its own decision under the public pressure," Chardham Teerth Purohit Hak Hakookdhari Mahapanchayat spokesman Brajesh Sati said.He, however, thanked the chief minister for the decision.Gangotri Mandir Samiti president Harish Semwal and Yamunotri Teerth Purohit Mahasabha president Purushottam Uniyal said it was a victory of "Sanatan dharma". They said they thank the chief minister on behalf of the entire priest community for scrapping the board and protecting the sanatan dharma. Chardham priests had agitated long for scrapping of the board. They had hooted and shown black flags to former Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in Kedarnath earlier this month forcing him to return from there without a "darshan".They had also performed "sheershasana" outside Cabinet minister Subodh Uniyal's residence in Dehradun recently demanding scrapping of the board besides staging a protest rally on Saturday. Congress' campaign head for Uttarakhand and former Chief Minister Harish Rawat described it as a victory of the priests community. "As in the case of the three agri laws, arrogance has once again been defeated. The BJP has taken the decision sensing its imminent defeat in the coming polls. It is a victory of the priests who refused to budge. I congratulate them," the AICC general secretary said.Aam Aadmi Party's chief ministerial candidate Col (Retd) Ajay Kothiyal also congratulated priests for their victory saying their letter written in blood to the President and the Prime Minister had finally borne fruit. He also said by scrapping the board, the BJP government has confessed that it had committed a crime by constituting it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-cm-dhami-scraps-chardham-devasthanam-board-101638283765739.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||How can we check commuters’ vax certificates, ask bus, taxi drivers||MUMBAI Although the BrihanMumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) asked its 27 bus depots in the city to check vaccination certificates before allowing passengers to board buses, commuters and bus conductors have raised doubt over its feasibility. They have also pointed out the potential overcrowding outside bus depots and bus stops, long queues and delay in the operation of buses.Maharashtra government on Saturday issued an order allowing only fully vaccinated passengers to travel by public transport. Bus operators, black and yellow taxi drivers have raised their apprehension about the order and said that they have already suffered losses during the lockdowns. They can’t afford to allow only vaccinated commuters. The BEST on late Saturday evening circulated the Maharashtra government order to its bus depots. However, a few conductors and bus drivers said that they were not aware of any such order and if implemented, it would create confusion.“We do not know about any such order yet but it is nearly impossible to check all the passengers. Checking and permitting passengers will lead to long queues at bus stops, particularly, during office hours,” said a BEST conductor who did not want to be named.The employees pointed out BEST needs to develop a mechanism to check the certificates to avoid delay and confusion. Passengers have stated that though allowing vaccinated passengers in buses and other public transport is a good measure, but the implementation is difficult.“The implementation would not be practical due to the number of passengers travelling during peak hours,” said Aarti Sharma, a Bandra resident.Shirish Deshpande of the Mumbai Grahak Panchy (MGP), stated that although the government’s quick action is appreciated, passengers should be permitted to travel at their own risk. “The government can put stringent measures and charge fines but there could be some unreasonable restrictions. Social distance outside the bus stops could also be reduced,” said Deshpande, chairman, MGP.BEST officials have stated that a process will be developed in the coming days which would be implemented across the bus depots. “The initial order of the state government was circulated to the depot managers. We will develop a process as to how vaccine certificates will be checked,” said a senior BEST official.Taxi unions have stated that they have asked drivers to display a placard stating ‘no vaccination, no ride’ but said it is impossible for drivers to check vaccination certificates.“The drivers have suffered severe losses throughout the lockdowns. It is impossible to check every passenger’s certificate as it will increase the monetary loss. All coronavirus protocols will be followed by taxi drivers,” said AL Quadros, leader of the Mumbai Taximen Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-can-we-check-commuters-vax-certificates-ask-bus-taxi-drivers-101638282213617.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||Dip in HIV tests, diagnosis during pandemic: Experts fear surge in advanced infections||The pandemic and the ensuing lockdown restrictions severely impacted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in Mumbai. Data from the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) shows that the testing for the infection has dropped by 50% from 475,540 tests in 2019-2020 to 236,392 tests in 2020-2021. The reduced testing had a direct impact on the detection of new cases — the city recorded 4,473 new cases in 2019-2020 and the number fell to 2,063 in 2020-2021. With the decline in Covid-19 cases and the lifting of lockdown restrictions, Mumbai’s HIV programme has shown some signs of recovery. From April to October this year, the city has conducted 190,691 tests and made 1,659 new cases detections. However, the experts are now worried about a surge in the cases of advanced disease among the population that remained undiagnosed. “We started seeing some recovery in the programme from July onwards when restrictions were largely lifted and transportation norms were relaxed,” said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS. “But we are worried about people coming with advanced stages of the infection, as they may have delayed their testing and treatment,” she said. HIV attacks the immune system. Its chronic and advanced stage is known as the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which is now termed Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) by the World Health Organization. Mumbai has 36,674 people living with HIV AIDS (PLHA) who are on lifelong anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Many faced disruptions in their treatment regimen as they migrated back to their hometowns or could not access the ART centres due to the lockdown restrictions and fear of the SARS-CoV-2. “Treatment retention was our main focus in the past 20 months,” said Dr Acharya, adding that a notification allowing the patients to travel on trains by showing the treatment card helped tremendously. She said that her staff was in touch with the patients on phone, to coordinate and help them access the treatment. In addition to this, the MDACS, for the very first time, used postal services to deliver drugs to 96 patients on ART and nearly 300 patients were delivered the medication by MDACS staff, by meeting them at a public place nearest to their homes. “During the surging Covid-19 waves, testing and new case detections almost came to standstill not just in Mumbai but across the country,” said health activist Ganesh Acharya adding that the pandemic has led to a severe setback to the HIV programme and the government will now require to undertake intensive interventions. “Some of the basic, cheap drugs given for opportunistic infections found in HIV patients are not available in centres. Such lacunae will only lead to worse outcomes,” he said. Tuberculosis is the number one cause of mortality among HIV/AIDS patients. But the current preventive therapy — known as the Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) — has a very high pill burden with 180 doses for six months. “There is another promising preventive therapy known as 3HP, which includes a course of 12 doses spread over 12 weeks, but that is not available in India,” said Eldred Tellis, director of the Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, a non-profit that works in the field of prevention of drug abuse and blood-borne diseases. “The added burden of the undiagnosed population during the pandemic also calls for better strategies to tackle the existing loopholes like lack of drugs, rolling out effective drug regimens etc,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dip-in-hiv-tests-diagnosis-during-pandemic-experts-fear-surge-in-advanced-infections-101638281913476.html

"The report we have to submit to the Centre is getting ready. We may ask for ₹1,100 crore as relief," he said. Speaking to reporters here, he said, the memorandum seeking compensation under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) norms will be submitted in three to four days. According to preliminary data, the recent deluge has resulted in 26 people losing their lives, 5.81 lakh hectares of crop loss and 2,339 km of damaged roads. Officials say these figures have been updated and are being compiled. Karnataka received 142 mm rainfall in November against the 39 mm it gets on average, which is nearly a 263 per cent deviation from the norm. Pointing out that the government has so far released a crop loss compensation of ₹318.87 crore to 4.61 lakh farmers, Ashoka said, "Earlier, it used to be paid once a month or once in three months. We have introduced a new system to pay input subsidies to farmers. We are now making immediate payments in instalments that are released once every three or four days." All deputy commissioners have been asked to release timely payments to people affected by rains and floods, he said, adding that Deputy Commissioners of districts have ₹681 crore in their personal deposit accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-likely-to-seek-rs-1-100-crore-rain-relief-from-centre-minister-101638280926914.html
30-11-2021||Lucknow||Prospering wedding season lifts the spirit of designers||The long and busy wedding season has not only brought smiles on the faces of fashion designers but also added hope to other businesses related to it. With weddings getting bigger and pre-and-post wedding functions also being held, it’s turning out to be a thriving time for the designers. “I have a lot of friends in the fashion and apparel industry and everyone is reporting huge volume of growth that’s keeping them extremely busy. Buyers are looking for customised dresses as well as OTT boom and Bollywood weddings are playing a big role in it. Marriage season always brings a big boost to industry but after nearly two years of low-key functions things are back with a bang,” says Akhilendra Pratap Sonkar, assistant professor at National Institute of Fashion and Technology (NIFT), Raebareli. At Ajara by Aditi Kumar the reported footfall and walk-in conversions have reached to pre-pandemic level. “Now big-fat wedding and pre-wedding functions are back resulting in not just brides, grooms but their close and extended family members going for customized designer stuff. Only big is that people are not investing too much and fearing the third wave they are keeping money handy,” says Kumar. The long wedding season of Hindu marriages is also a big boost for them as marriages are to happen till May 2022 with only lesser dates in March. “Muslim weddings are also scheduled in large numbers till March which will come to halt from Ramzan (April 2022). People are spending less but requirements are high so they are getting back to designer stuff,” says fashion designer Arshi Jamal. Newlywed Sanchita Kumar says that she chose an eight-kali (pleat) lehnga to complete her look for the D-Day. “For my posts on Insta as well as photography I need to wear the best.” Monu Sial, creative head and founder of Azzura, adds, “We have seen a huge difference in the way people are shopping for weddings since last year. Then it was about intimate festivities where brides chose toned down outfit for max one or two functions. This year has been huge at our atelier as we have seen brides opting for heavy couture which is heirloom worthy and can be passed down through generations,” she adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prospering-wedding-season-lifts-the-spirit-of-designers-101638280054720.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt plans policy to allow use of fruits and flowers for distilling liquor||Consumers in the state may soon be spoilt for choice with a range of niche liquors manufactured from fruits and crops like cashew, apples, jamun, mango, berries and mohua flowers hitting the shelves. The state government is working on a policy to allow the use of traditional crops for distilling liquor. “We are planning to allow the distillation of indigenous liquor using cashew fruits, mohua flowers and other traditional crops. This will be a separate category of liquor and will entail a lower license fee and comparatively liberal excise duty regime if these distilleries do not blend other liquor in these products,” a senior state government official said. While promoting agro-based industries and boosting the local economy by channelising investments and creating alternate avenues for farmers to sell their products, this will also make fruit-based and crop-based liquor available for tipplers, as against the conventional molasses-distilled one. At present, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) is charged excise duty at 300% of manufacturing cost or ₹350 per proof litre, whichever is higher. This indigenous liquor will be taxed at a lower, concessional rate to promote investment in the setup of distilleries and ensure that the end products are cheaper. Valsa Nair Singh, principal secretary, state excise, confirmed that the policy was under consideration. It will be placed before the state cabinet for its approval, she added. This is part of the state’s larger policy to allow the use of fruits, flowers and stems for manufacturing alcohol. In 2019, the state government had decided to charge a nominal excise duty of ₹1 per bulk litre as a duty on fruit and mead (honey) wines. Earlier, there was no such tax holiday for these fruit-based dessert wines, which were charged duty at 100% of manufacturing cost, plus goods and services tax (GST), which ensured that they were costly compared to grape-based wines, which have been exempted from paying excise duty till 2021-end. In 2018, the state government had extended the definition of wine to cover those wines made from fruit, flowers, stems and honey. In May, the state government had removed mohua (mhowra) flowers from the purview of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949. This deregulation on the collection, purchase, sale, and transport of these flowers, which are fermented by tribals in parts of Vidarbha to brew country liquor, meant that like earlier, no permits were needed to be sought for the purpose. Shekhar Nikam, Nationalist Congress Party, Member of Legislative Assembly from Chiplun, who has a demonstration unit manufacturing fruit-based wines, said fruits grown locally like jackfruit, mango, jamun, and berries, could be used for producing liquor. “Once the government lays down its policy and allows the distillation of such liquor, feni can be distilled from cashew fruit grown in the Konkan, much of which goes waste,” he explained. In 2020-21, around 32 crore litres of country liquor (CL) was sold in Maharashtra, followed by beer (30 crore litres), IMFL (20 crore litres) and wine (70 lakh litres). The state excise department has a revenue collection target of ₹19,500 crore for the present financial year. In 2020-21, the actual collections were at ₹15,089 crore due to the Covid-19 lockdown, which saw liquor retailers down their shutters, and economic distress. IMFL sales contribute to around ₹8,500 crore in revenues, followed by ₹4,000 crore for CL, and ₹2,200 crore for beer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-plans-policy-to-allow-use-of-fruits-and-flowers-for-distilling-liquor-101638278853325.html

30-11-2021||Jaipur||After boy’s complaint, Dausa administration stops child marriage||The marriage of a 19-year-old boy was stopped by the Dausa district administration in Rajasthan on Tuesday, four days after he sought intervention from the state child rights commission saying he does not want to marry and wants to pursue his college education, officials said. The legal age of marriage for boys is 21 and for girls, it is 18 years. The boy, a resident of Sikrai town in Dausa district, is Class-XII pass out and was to be unwillingly married on Tuesday to a girl of his parents’ choice. The boy approached the commission last Friday saying he want to study further and join the Indian Army.Following the complaint, the commission directed the Dausa district administration to take action and stop the marriage. Dausa collector, Peeyush Samariya, said on Sunday, a police team was sent to the boy’s residence and both the families were told that they cannot hold the marriage as one of them was not of the eligible age to get married. The girl was of the same age as him, therefore, she was eligible for marriage.A compliance report was submitted in the local court as the action was taken under the Prohibition of the Child Marriage Act. “It was surprising as for the first time a boy had called authorities to get the marriage stopped. He acted pro-active to stop the marriage,” the collector said Chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Sangeeta Beniwal said, “In my tenure as the chairperson, and even in general, this probably is the first time that a boy has approached the commission to stop his marriage.” She said through social media, he got her mobile number and called her to help him stop his marriage on November 30. The boy told that he wants to prepare for the army and has made all attempts to convince his parents but failed. She said the boy was not willing to get married till he settled professionally.Beniwal said the boy asked her to send the police as early as possible to stop the marriage. “He had sent his Class-XII mark sheet to confirm his age, and also shared that the bride is also of his age,” she said, adding that the boy also shared his wedding card. Kriti Bharti, who runs a non-government organization (NGO) working against child marriage, said this is not the first time a boy has approached to stop his marriage. “Over 50 times, roughly, boys have approached me to get their marriage stopped. In child marriages, both girl and boy are victims, but certainly, the girls are more active to approach,” she said. Bharti recalled, “In 2012, a 14-year-old boy had to stop his marriage. When we reached the venue in Jodhpur, the family members presented some other boy but luckily we had his photo. Later in the night, the family tried again to marry him, he informed, and our team rushed again late night.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/after-boy-s-complaint-dausa-administration-stops-child-marriage-101638276154742.html

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||The whole truth with a twist in the tale||As a writer (if I may describe myself as one at the risk of sounding immodest), I suppose I do have the licence to garnish my anecdotes with that extra bit of spice (after all, it’s not The Spice of Life column for nothing) or sprinkle some nuggets and bits of exaggeration as a means of enhancing the flavour of my piece or even make up a little story as a seasoning to add that little zing and hold the interest of my readers, but as often as not I do get asked some probing questions regarding the veracity of a particular episode or the experiences I may have attributed as my own. It makes me wonder as to why anyone would take my written word as the gospel truth or even consider that I should only write what I have truthfully and personally experienced! Many of you, I am sure, are about to abandon the rest of my article in disgust, appalled that I am quite a liar, deceiver and a fraudster. But if you trust me (and why should you?), this latest tale about to unfold is true to the very last word. My uncle had not been keeping well for quite some time and the worried family took an appointment with a high-profile doctor, carried all his previous medical reports and reached the hospital. The good doctor, a no-nonsense fellow, in keeping with most members of his revered profession, short on time, possessing an even shorter threshold of patience and a long queue of anxious patients shuffling outside his door, admitted them in and listened to uncle’s symptoms, while simultaneously riffling through the file of extensive tests undergone previously. All of a sudden he stopped short, horror struck, looked uncle up and down, whilst scanning the results of a blood report and said: “Where did you get this one done? It is unbelievable. A patient with readings such as these is likely to be frothing at the mouth, writhing on the floor or have collapsed already!” He actually looked unnerved and ordered the family to immediately make uncle undergo a fresh battery of tests under his personal supervision. My aunt, not one to be calm or collected under normal circumstances, understandably had a few hysterical moments and in a distraught and panicked state rushed out of the door, while desperately scanning the report once again. Peering at it carefully, she went quiet and a shamed look came upon her face. Mortified she beckoned to her son standing inside, crestfallen at the turn of events, scared for his father. The blood report in question was that of their pet dog! Uncle’s name was on it and on the side was scribbled illegibly the word, ‘Owner’. I don’t know what they did next and I think I will not ever ask them because the scene with the doctor could not have been pretty. Uncle, fortunately, is hale and hearty now, healthy enough to recount this tale, where they all blame each other for the mixing up the reports and every narration ends up in blasts of loud laughter. For this one, I am willing to take the witness stand, place my hand on my heart, and solemnly affirm that I am speaking the truth, the whole truth, so help me God! pallavisingh358@gmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/the-whole-truth-with-a-twist-in-the-tale-101638275553501.html

30-11-2021||Mumbai||BMC postpones reopening of primary schools to Dec 15||Mumbai In the wake of the new Covid-19 variant Omicron, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has postponed the reopening of schools in the city to December 15.Schools were slated to open on December 1. The BMC’s education department on Tuesday said that even though offline classes will resume in the next two weeks, parents can opt for online ones.Data showed that 10 lakh students study in classes 1 to 7 in 3,420 primary schools in the city. However, though the date of reopening has been postponed, the standard operating procedure will remain the same. “The guidelines mandate one student per bench and the maximum operation of the school for two to three hours daily,” said education officer Raju Tadvi of the BMC.Tadvi said, “It is a fact that in more than 12 countries of the world, the Omicron variant is infecting people. As a result of this, we need to take preventive measures considering the population of the city. The Omicron variant is being studied and there is no sufficient data on the same, and hence it will take a few days to gauge the situation.”He added that reopening schools would mean disinfecting them, cleaning them and making all logistical arrangements. “We will also have to get parents to submit consent letters without which we cannot expect students to come to school. Hence, to be fully prepared and avoid any untoward incident, we have decided to reopen primary schools from December 15 instead of December 1.”The SOP details guidelines across nine parameters, including attendance, safety and Covid-19 hygiene, teaching, seating arrangements in classrooms, for school managements, teachers, students, and parents. The BMC has mandated that school managements should link their schools with the nearest primary health centres before restarting classes, to better deal with health emergencies among students and staff. Meanwhile, two months after the reopening of the schools there is no spike reported in the number of cases in children or teenagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-postpones-reopening-of-primary-schools-to-dec-15-101638274473138.html

30-11-2021||Mumbai||Annual placements at IITs kick off online from Dec 1||The first phase of placements across the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) will kick-off from December 1 and, going by the high number of pre-placement offers (PPOs) received by institutes, most are hoping for higher number of job offers than last year. Some top IITs have already hinted at more than one student being offered an annual package of ₹1.46 crore this year. “We cannot reveal any details of the job offer or the pay package before the official confirmation. But we are definitely witnessing a rise in international postings for this batch compared to last year,” said an official from the placement team at IIT Bombay. Last year, the highest package offered to a student of IIT Bombay was $200,000 (approximately ₹1.54 crore) by US-based IT firm Cohesity. The same firm has offered the highest package again this year. Once again this year, placement interviews will be conducted virtually. HT recently reported that the number of PPOs, based on figures shared by several IITs, has been higher than those received in 2019, before the outbreak of Covid-19.At IIT Bombay, the batch has received 248 PPOs compared to 164 in 2019. At IIT Delhi and IIT Roorkee, the overall PPOs are almost 25-30% higher than last year and 2019. At IIT Madras, the batch received over 227 PPOs compared to 186 last year and 170 in 2019.“This year, industry response to invitations to participate in campus placements of students has been encouraging across sectors. Many organisations have registered with the placement office with an intent to hire graduates of IIT Delhi. There is an increasing registration for new-age technology-based hiring profiles related to data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning in addition to traditional profiles,” said a spokesperson for IIT Delhi.Domestic companies are also expected to make several offers this year, with higher packages than last year. “Several public sector units have also shown interest in placements this year, and are being given preference based on student interests,” said a spokesperson for IIT Bombay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/annual-placements-at-iits-kick-off-online-from-dec-1-101638273932955.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||Lucknow resident arrested for cheating job aspirants of ₹1 crore||Mumbai cyber police arrested a 29-year-old from Lucknow for allegedly running a job racket and duping dozens of job aspirants to the tune of ₹1 crore, officials said. The accused, Shailendra Bharti, director of GDAS Business Solutions Pvt Ltd, has been arrested following a complaint lodged by S Vidya Raju, 49, who he cheated of ₹26.09 lakh. According to the police, Bharti, with the help of his friends, would steal data of job aspirants from various job portals and then contact them and offer jobs as per their requirements promising lucrative salaries. He would mostly target individuals looking for senior positions and offer posts like deputy general managers to most of them. Later, in the name of various procedural expenditures and charges, he would extract money from the victims. “In this case, Bharti had offered Raju a job in a well-known company and to gain her trust also telephonically interviewed her, posing as a senior executive from the company. Later, when she failed to get the job. When she demanded her money back, the accused took more money from her in the name of a refund process,” said a cyber police official. Police officials said Bharti duped the woman between September 15, 2018, and August 10, 2020, to the tune of ₹26.09 lakh. Analysis of his bank account data and technical investigation led assistant police inspector Shriniwas Kamuni and his team from East region cyber police station to Lucknow from where they arrested Bharti on November 16. The police team seized chequebooks and passbooks of six bank accounts and five mobile handsets and three SIM cards from him. “Bharti, who is a science graduate, earlier worked in a job recruitment company and from there he thought of opening his own job/placement company and duping people in the name of offering them job. From the fraudulently obtained money he wanted to open an imitation jewellery business,” said Rajesh Nagawde, senior inspector of East region cyber police station.The officials said the bank accounts were used to receive the amount from victims and analysis of these six bank accounts revealed that there were transactions worth ₹1 crore in the recent past. Deputy commissioner of police, Cyber, Dr Rashmi Karandikar said the accused has been remanded to judicial custody till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lucknow-resident-arrested-for-cheating-job-aspirants-of-rs-1-crore-101638272433871.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||17-year-old stabs autorickshaw driver, held||The Dindoshi police on Monday nabbed a juvenile robber for stabbing an autorickshaw driver multiple times. According to the police, the incident took place at Goregaon (East) bus stop. The complainant Vikram Singh, 25, was on his way to the depot looking for passengers at 9.35pm on Monday when a boy flagged the auto and approached him. As Singh stopped, the 17-year-old informed him that his wife had gone missing and needed to drive around to find her. Singh agreed to help him to look for his wife. After travelling for five minutes the accused asked Singh for his mobile phone to call his relatives. The victim agreed; however, instead of calling his relatives, he called his friends and asked them to meet him at a deserted stretch of road, towards Malad. The driver suspected foul play and asked the accused to return his phone and get off the rickshaw. “The accused then pulled out the knife from his pocket and stabbed him over five times on his shoulder, arms and stomach,” said a police officer attached to Dindoshi police station. The officer said passers-by called up the police station and reported the assault. The police arrested the juvenile, as he had a previous case registered against him and had also spent time in the children’s home and a correction facility.

30-11-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Handprint’s actions towards sustainability||PUNE In 2007 at a school in Hyderabad, a discussion was being done on ecological impact by my colleagues at the Centre for Environment Education. Srija, a ten-year-old, asked why we always talk about our impact and not what we can do for sustainability.It is her question that inspired the idea of the “Handprint.” The Handprint was adopted at a conference on Education for Sustainable Development in Ahmedabad, as an international symbol for actions to create a better world. And November 27 was declared by the delegates as Handprint Day.Concern for the environment is embedded in our traditions. The Yujur Veda entreats us to “not disturb the sky and not pollute the atmosphere”, while the Rig Veda says: “Do not harm the environment; do not harm the water and the flora; the earth is my mother; I am her son; may the waters remain fresh; do not harm the waters. Do not cut trees, because they remove pollution.”Care for the environment is also reflected in the Constitution of India, Article 51(A) (g) which sets a constitutional obligation on the citizens of India “to protect and improve the natural environment, including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures.”The Handprint draws on such wisdom from our collective heritage and represents the belief that we can make a difference. Our individual and collective actions can solve environmental problems, decrease the human footprint, and make the world more sustainable.The Handprint goes beyond the idea of individual action. It also contains the ideas of learning through action and action along with others. These dimensions are particularly relevant when one considers the climate and ecological changes that our children and their children will have to face within the foreseeable future.Children and youth will need not only knowledge, but systems thinking and critical thinking competence, as well as the ability to communicate and collaborate. Above all, they will need empathy and a caring attitude towards one another, and the living world.When we act on our own, we may develop our individual capabilities to plan, act, and reflect. When we act with others, we may develop a larger understanding and enhance our ability to communicate, collaborate and live together.Anyone can take Handprint action. Just start with any positive action that is possible – cycling instead of using a car, composting instead of throwing mixed waste, or changing to more efficient lights, among others. Whenever it is time to do more, when you feel you are ready to work with others to make a larger difference, you can take that next step. You may become part of a campaign for an environmental or social issue or even lead one.Handprint includes citizenship action, advocacy for sustainability, and participation in decision-making to make it more realistic, representative, and responsive. You might stand for elections and play a leadership role or help conduct a citizens’ assembly and support a whole community to take collective Handprint actions.It might not be easy, or it might be fun. Others bring different perspectives, and you might enjoy looking at things differently. Handprint actions can become a hobby and bring their own rewards in new learning and satisfaction of being involved in positive ways.Sanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education.

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi writes to PM Modi, seeks complete waiver of farmers’ debt||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a “complete debt waiver” for farmers and farm labourers while offering to shoulder the state’s burden. Also read: Pak model apologises after row over her ‘bareheaded’ pics at Kartarpur GurdwaraIn the letter sent a day after the three farm laws were repealed in Parliament, Channi wrote, “With the annulment of the three farm laws by you, the farmers and the government have moved a step closer to resolving pending issues that have taken centre stage. The key issue is that of agricultural debt.” Channi said that during a meeting with farmer leaders in Chandigarh recently, the demand that remains pending at his level is that of the issue of farm debt. “A glittering ray of hope has, however, shone after the Government of India’s changed stance (on the farm laws),” the chief minister said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the farm laws would be repealed on November 19, coinciding with the Gurpurb to mark the 552nd birth anniversary of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev. After the repeal of the three laws in Parliament, a large number of farmers and farm bodies under the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) are continuing with their protests at the Delhi borders, seeking acceptance of six more demands, but they don’t include debt waiver. Punjab farmers’ loan crosses ₹ 1 lakh crore “A Centre-state shared scheme of an appropriate ratio spread over some time with proper modalities needs to be framed to handle this issue and end the debt of our farmers and farm labour once and for all,” Channi suggested to the PM. By an estimate, the total loan, institutional and non-institutional, on the agrarian class in Punjab has crossed ₹ 1 lakh crore. The Congress government in the state had waived ₹ 4,610.24 crore debt on 5,63,718 farmers when Capt Amarinder Singh was at the helm. Channi took over from Capt Amarinder Singh on September 20 after a bitter power tussle with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. When Capt Amarinder was sworn in as CM in 2017, the government was to reach out to 10.25 lakh farmers and waive up to ₹ 10,000 crore, but the plan was watered down to waiving loans of up to ₹2 lakh on small and marginal farmers in the state. It was also decided to pull out income tax payee farmers and those into public sector jobs from the scheme. Urges PM to make a fresh start Justifying the state’s claim for debt waiver, Channi wrote, “Punjab’s farmers picked up the gauntlet of food scarcity of the nation when PL480 variety of wheat was imported from the US and became the bulwark of the Green Revolution.” He said the godowns that are full today testify their relentless toil. “However, while ensuring food security, our self-pride driven farmers have crippled themselves under the weight of a mountain of debt,” the CM said. “Prime Minister sir, let’s make a fresh start and work towards improving the entire ecosystem of agriculture in Punjab in particular and the nation in general. We as stakeholders are ready to commit ourselves to any new arrangement that is decided mutually between all,” Channi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-complete-waiver-of-farmers-debt-101638269553065.html
30-11-2021||Lucknow||Opposition may have to redraw its strategy in UP||With Parliament repealing the contentious farm laws on the very first day of its winter session today, the opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh are literally in a state of disarray.Till now, they were riding high on the potent issue that had dented the pro-poor image of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)-led governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh. Though the farmers have so far refused to relent on their demand for legal sanctity to the Minimum Support Price (MSP), the withdrawal of the farm laws may enervate their year-long successful movement.Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik, who hails from West UP, opines, “Some anger against the BJP might reduce but the issue will remain unresolved till government concedes their MSP demand.”But can MSP have the same polarising effect as the three farm laws? That’s the worry of the opposition already facing a tough challenge from a mighty BJP in the upcoming 2022 assembly polls. Even as the impact of the farmer’s agitation was largely confined to west UP, it had become a talking point in other parts of the state after the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Thus, it helped the opposition construct a political narrative, combined with other issues like petrol, diesel, cooking gas and fertilizer prices.Now, the opposition may have to redraw their poll strategy as the BJP will not leave any stone unturned to win back the region that largely contributed to its victory in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha and 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections. Union Home Minister Amit Shah will be addressing party’s booth presidents meeting on December 2 in Saharanpur, giving direction as well as fillip to the BJP’s campaign. Already several union ministers have addressed meetings in West UP.Hoardings are ready to flood the region. Most of them will have farmers thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for repealing the farm laws. And then the communal fault lines may also reappear damaging the revived Jat-Muslim bohomie. The BJP has galvanised its organisational machinery and intensified a strong Hindu agenda to break itWhy opposition is worried ?“The gap left behind the 2017 elections is too huge to cover,” said a Congress leader from west UP referring to 325 of the 403 seats won by BJP and its allies in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh assembly election.He said, “The BJP has penetrated vote banks like OBCs, Vaishyas, Brahmins and non-Jatav Dalits. The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has revived and allied with the Samajwadi Party (SP), the front-runner in the upcoming polls. But the SP will have to stitch some caste alliances here in west UP on the pattern of east UP, where it has found a partner in Om Prakash Rajbhar. ”Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary have been drawing crowds while the Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been evoking curiosity. But can they stop the BJP in its tracks? Many experts are of the view that even the BJP’s fall from 325 could be by 100 seats, still leaving them with a comfortable majority.Aware of the ground realities, Jayant Chaudhary has already started talking about inclusive politics though he is confident that the farmers will not forget their miseries and forgive the BJP.“The farmers struggled and succeeded in their battle. It’s not a mercy shown to them. Do you think they can so easily forget and forgive the government that compelled them to spend wintry nights in the open?” he asks.Upendra Kumar and his brother Ajay Kumar, farmers from Baraut, Charan Singh’s village, lament the fact that they have to sell their paddy at Karnal in the neighbouring Haryana. According to them, the government had to succumb to the mounting pressures from the farmers and they will have to concede our demand for MSP. They say: How can the government ignore the voice of farmers, who form 60% of the state’s population?Meanwhile, the RLD has launched Bahujan Uday Abhiyan in the western districts to reconstruct the rainbow coalition of castes that Charan Singh had envisaged. The party leaders move around villagers, especially Dalit dominated, with their message of social inclusion. So, the opposition parties, in all probability, will revisit their poll strategy. As such, all the four opposition parties — the SP, RLD, Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party — lack the wherewithal to vie with the ruling party’s paraphernalia. The major challenge will be ticket distribution, in which much of the balancing of the castes will have to be done. As an expert on condition of anonymity said, “Public memory is ephemeral. Barring families who lost their near and dear ones to Covid, few are talking about mismanagement today. Elections are a few months away and caste equations matter. To keep the farmers’ issue burning, the opposition will have to keep rubbing it, reminding them of their year-long battle.”So, the crux of the matter is that will farmers’ anger subside or simmer in the coming months? Will the communal fault lines re-appear? How will the opposition set right its caste calculus? Will the voters remain an aggrieved farmer at the polling booth or will be guided by his caste? Will opposition ensure the election does not get a communal colour with jibes like “abba jaan” with intent to paint the SP-RLD as parties of Muslims? And in a multi-cornered contest, how will they ensure that even BJP votes divide? The churning is on. Is West U.P. up for grabs ?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/opposition-may-have-to-redraw-its-strategy-in-up-101638269312903.html

30-11-2021||Mumbai||Elderly parents harassed for property: Bombay HC||Sons and daughters harass elderly parents to grab their properties, especially among Mumbai’s wealthy sections, the Bombay high court has said while dismissing a woman’s petition challenging a tribunal’s order evicting her from her 94-year-old father’s residence for harassing him.A division bench of justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar said they have complaints from senior citizens that their sons and daughters are harassing them. “In every case, the harassment is an attempt to somehow grab the senior citizen’s property in his or her lifetime without a thought spared to the mental or physical health well-being or happiness of these seniors.”The bench dismissed the woman’s petition saying the case was no different. The 94-year-old said his daughter returned to Mumbai in 2015 after a brief stay in Germany and moved into his flat unannounced. He said while he was suffering from various age-related ailments and was required to be hospitalised, instead of contributing to the house, the daughter was rude and aggressive and soon started badgering him for her share in the property.Sujay Kantawala, who appeared for the 94-year-old, said his client felt so intimidated at times that he would lock himself up in his room. He added the daughter caused his client physical distress and also damaged the house.Also Read: State issues SOP for schools, vaccines mandatory for staffThe daughter challenged the tribunal’s order claiming the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act did not provide for eviction and therefore the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction.The court said the terminology is not determinative. “Removal of a person with no right in the premises is not eviction so as to attract any such prohibition,” said the court. It added the house in question was owned by the father and during his lifetime the daughter had no right over it.“After all the statutory intent is to protect senior citizens. It is not to foist on senior citizens an imaginary claim over their own property where the claimant has no such right, to begin with. The statutory intent is not to limit the rights of senior citizens, but exactly the reverse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elderly-parents-harassed-for-properties-bombay-hc-101638243511373.html

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC poll: To contain rebellion, BJP, Congress go slow on ticket allocation||There are around 1,000 contenders for 35 BJP tickets and around 200 in the Congress for the MC elections. But they may have to wait till the last minute before both parties announce their final list of candidates.The nomination for the MC polls started on November 27 and closes on December 4. But so far both the parties have not declared their candidates for any of the 35 wards. The MC polls are scheduled for December 24.By announcing the candidatures at the last minute, the parties want to avert rebels filling nominations as Independents or jumping to another party’s wagon. There is also a cat and mouse game going on between the two parties. On the seats which are considered close calls, the parties also want to first see the candidate that the other party puts up.The concern of rebel candidates is a real possibility for both parties. In recent times, both parties have suffered from open factionalism.Rebellion fears During the last mayoral elections, the BJP had to face rebel candidates.For the Congress, a major public dispute ensued between incumbent city leadership and former party city chief Pardeep Chhabra. Some of the Chhabra loyalists who left the Congress and joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) along with him are likely to face off against their former party colleagues in the MC polls.“Between the last date of nomination, December 4, and the last date for withdrawal of nomination, December 9, most of the time and energy of local party leader is likely to be spent on firefighting internal discord and rebellions,” said a senior BJP leader.For the ruling BJP, the challenge is bigger, having to placate its 20 sitting councillors. The Congress has five councillors in the outgoing MC house of 26 wards.Underplaying inner party differences, Subhash Chawla, state Congress president, said, “It is routine for the parties to announce candidates close to the deadline for filing nomination papers. This has happened in the past elections too.”Stating that there are around 1,000 contenders for the 35 BJP tickets, BJP city chief Arun Sood said, “We are a disciplined party and we don’t have any internal disputes over the ticket allotment. At most, one or two tickets can be sensitive, otherwise, there is no concern over the issue.”On tenterhooksFor the final selection of the candidates, the Congress on Monday constituted a six-member State Election Committee comprising Chawla, former MP Pawan Kumar Bansal among others. The committee also has four special invitees. “The committee will meet on December 1. From there on the finalisation of tickets will be done,” said Chawla. The BJP is largely depending on the different rounds of surveys it is conducting in all the wards. The party’s election candidate selection committee will decide ticket allotment on the basis of these surveys, said Sood.Notably, most of the existing Congress councillors have already started election campaigns either for themselves or their spouses without the party even announcing their candidature. This many party insiders say is their signal to party decision-makers of their resolve to contest the election.Meanwhile, an incumbent BJP councillor, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “We are totally in the dark whether our candidature will be accepted or not. If it is accepted, then we will hardly have 10 days to campaign. This will be particularly tough as areas of our existing wards have been changed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-poll-to-contain-rebellion-bjp-congress-go-slow-on-ticket-allocation-101638222209562.html

Singh’s grandson Mohit lit the pyre after formal rituals. The centenarian was a soldier in the supply depot of the Azad Hind Fauj, also known as the Indian National Army (INA), formed by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose in 1942.His nephew, Jarnail Singh, said he joined the INA in Singapore at the age of 20 and their camps were captured many times by the British and allied forces and were freed after agreements between both forces.“He left his boarding school at such a young age to fight for the freedom movement after getting inspired by Netaji. After serving in the INA till we got freedom, he then joined a cooperative society where he worked till retirement. The son of a farmer, he spent his life on the ancestral fields,” Jarnail said.Singh is survived by five sons and two daughters. His wife died in 1997. The villagers remember him as a staunch patriot and an inspiration for youth, who remained vocal on many current issues till recently.His elder son Deep Singh, a retired superintendent from the Haryana Secretariat, said he was too excited to listen to the speech by Bose probably in Rangoon (now Yangon), for the first time after his joining. “Talking about how they struggled to get Independence that was possible after scores of sacrifices, he sometimes felt dejected on where the youth is heading towards,” Singh, 67, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/azad-hind-fauj-soldier-dies-at-100-in-ambala-101638222029635.html

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Better upkeep of roads, parks on wish list of ward 23 residents||Ward number 23 is a ward reserved for women which comprises Sectors 34, 35 and 43. Sectors 34 and 35 were a part of Ward number 15 as per the previous system while Sector 43 was clubbed with Kajheri and Sector 52 in ward number 12. An urban ward with little space for colonies and villages, residents here complain of bad roads and cleanliness issues.With Sector 43 finally coming into an “urban” ward, chairman of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) Hitesh Puri who also lives in Sector 43 said, “Earlier, the councillor would usually get elected from Sector 52 and focused more on rural development. Now, we want development on a scale similar to Sector 34 and 35 here. Water supply is a major issue here as water does not reach upper floors. The next councillor must develop new parks in the sector so that children have a place to play in. The open-air gyms installed in the sector must also be maintained better.”There is also a patch of land in front of the housing board houses here which is yet to be developed. Puri complained that the growth of plants here goes unchecked and becomes a problem during monsoons. Similarly, in Sector 34 also, the land in front of Sector 34 gurudwara has been left vacant for many years. At both these places, residents want beautification work.Residents of Sector 34 say many of their problems have been addressed since the local area councillor Ravinder Kaur Gujral also lives here. Speaking about this MS Bhalla, president of the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) here said, “Earlier, we didn’t have a Sampark centre here which was a big problem for many seniors living in this sector but it has been built and a tubewell was also installed to improve the water pressure here. However, the population of stray dogs is increasing despite efforts by the authorities. This should be a priority with the councillor. We also had issues with roads and were told by the MC that they would only be recarpeted after five years. The next councillor must ask this rule be checked or better material be used for re-carpeting of roads. More coordination is also needed between the sweepers and the MC horticulture officials. Horticulture waste isn’t picked up regularly.”Another resident of Sector 34, Wing Commander NS Malhi (retd) added that some residents still continue to face problems with water supply even after the installation of the new tubewell.Sector 35 has many houses built by the Chandigarh Housing Board, all of which are struggling with the need-based changes policy as per Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) general secretary JS Gogia who is also a resident of this Sector. “The next councillor must be outspoken about providing relief to these houses in Sector 35-B. The amount of taxes we have to pay to the MC keeps on increasing but their services are getting worse. The new system of garbage collection and water supply has mostly failed and the next councillor must improve this for us,” he added. BJP president for ward number 23 Preeti Verma, who also lives in Sector 35, said, “The current councillor had got into unnecessary controversy over inaugurating projects which the administration had built. The Sector 35 community centre, which was supposed to be revamped, has stayed defunct for years now. On Dakshin Marg, garbage is being dumped along Sector 35 and the Sehaj Safai Kendra here also lies in bad shape.”Saying that the community centre was being revamped because it had turned into a den for anti-social activities, councillor here Ravinder Kaur Gujral said, “We were receiving complaints about people drinking and gambling here so it was renovated. It will be re-inaugurated soon. There are around 140 parks in the ward and all of them have open air gyms now and I constructed toilets for senior citizens who go for walks here. The open spaces in Sector 34 are under the administration but I would still ask the MC officials to clean the area routinely.”Know your wardReserved for women candidatesWard areas: Sector 34, Sector 35 and Sector 43Voter count: 14,500 (approximately)Key issues:1.

A protester, requesting anonymity, said, “Neither the marks, nor any other detail of the selected candidates have been mentioned in the merit list.” ‘ ₹6-lakh for direct recruitment’ A group of aspirants protesting in Samrala alleged that middlemen were demanding ₹6 lakh for direct recruitment as a constable in the Punjab Police.The cops asked the protesters to file a complaint in the matter, but the protesters said they will file a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court against the merit list. An aspirant, Ravi Kumar, said around 4,300 posts were notified for the post of constable, and a written test was held on September 25 and 26. “However, the merit list had unusual names such as Seena Seena, Tack Singh, Joseph Joseph, Surand, Nindra Nindra, Sharon Patrick Crasta, Essa Taank, Yannis Yannis and Dron Dron,”he said.“There are many such names. We suspect that names are fake and higher-ups will give the seats to their relatives or those who bribe them,” he said, adding that the selected candidates had already been issued admit cards for the physical test.  ‘Qualifying candidates not on list’ Another aspirant, Sukhwinder Singh, said, “The cut off for general candidates was 70%, while it was 65% for SC and OBC category candidates. However, two women aspirants from the OBC category had secured 69%, but their names are not in the list.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/constable-recruitment-aspirants-allege-scam-hold-protest-at-cp-office-in-ludhiana-101638221429582.html

Or, if he had chosen that black marble lying over here, the mausoleum would have shone as dark as the deepest shade of midnight.But this is not ordinary marble, the seller Naresh admonishes. Neither is he a seller of any kind of stones, he protests. “I deal in namak.” This is salt, he insists, gesturing towards these unshapely rock-like objects that look like huge pieces of marble possibly excavated from the arid hills of Rajasthan.Naresh parks his cart daily on a dusty roadside in Gurugram’s Sector 14.The setting is conventionally dull, with the noisy traffic choking the air with nauseating fumes. But the horse-drawn cart, loaded with these curious-looking salt rocks, makes the place appear exceptional.You don’t get this namak in India, claims Naresh. These boulders of salt arrive from Pakistan, he informs authoritatively, “and that’s why it is also called the Lahori Namak,” referring to the city in Pakistan’s Punjab. Some moments later, a pedestrian stops by and sceptically asks if it is indeed Lahori namak. Naresh nods silently.Lying sprawled atop the cart, as if it were his bed, he points to a row of stony fragments in light pink. “They are called the pink salt.” He next points towards similar pieces in black. “Those are called the black salt.”Pink salt is used in the preparation of dal sabzi, while black salt is sprinkled over chopped fruit, or chaat, Naresh says mechanically, sounding like an announcer at a railway station.This smoggy afternoon, the sun is shining palely but these salt rocks are glistening in an inner light of their own, as if each one of them is embedded with a small electric lamp.The salt is sold in whole pieces ( ₹80 per kg), though Naresh also stocks splintered and powdered varieties (processed in a ‘chakki’, or mill), which are easier to use in the kitchen, and slightly more expensive. A native of Rohtak in Haryana, he has been a salt trader for 20 years. “Before that, I used to work at a brick kiln.”Soon, another passerby pauses, looking wondrously at the salt rocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-don-t-take-this-with-a-pinch-of-salt-101638220927431.html

Mann, who was in town to attend a meeting called by Atam Nagar constituency in-charge Kulwant Singh Sidhu, said, “ The schools in New Delhi are now better than private institutes, similarly healthcare facilities have improved, and unconditional accident insurance has been provided. The Delhi model will be replicated in Punjab, if the AAP is voted to power,” said Mann. On sitting AAP legislators jumping ship, Mann said, “This is because the party is giving opportunity to those who have worked on grassroots levels, rather than those who remained missing after the polls.” AAP district president Suresh Goel and other senior leaders including Sharan Pal Makkar were also present. Traffic snarls The meeting, which was organised on the busy Daba Road, led to massive traffic chaos.

The mother of the victim said the accused, Neelam had kidnapped Dilroz around 2.15pm, while she was playing near the gate of their house. “I remember calling out to Dilroz, asking her to come inside and sleep for a while. However, when she did not respond, I went to get her, but she was nowhere to be found. One of Neelam’s sons told me that his mother had taken Dilroz on her scooter. I called Neelam, asking her to take care of Dilroz as she is used to sleeping after lunch, but Neelam said Dilroz was not with her. I kept on searching for her. Later, other children playing on the street said they had seen Dilroz with Neelam, after which we alerted the police,” said the victim’s mother, Kiran, who lost consciousness on seeing her daughter’s corpse. The police scanned CCTV cameras and saw Neelam take away Dilroz. When interrogated, the accused confessed to murder. Neelam and her parents had sold their house and were shifting to a new location. It was their last day in the house and they had shifted most of their things to the new house. Victim bludgeoned twice, reveals autopsy The postmortem report on Monday revealed the horror and pain the toddler had to endure before she finally suffocated to death. The doctors found that the accused, Neelam, had bludgeoned the victim, Dilroz, twice, before burying her in a pit. The three doctors – Dr Ripudaman, Dr Varun Saggar and Dr Gurwinder Kaur – who conducted the postmortem found two injury marks on the toddler’s head –one on the forehead, and one on the back of her head. The injuries were made with a heavy and blunt object or by smashing her head against something hard, they said, while ruling the cause of death to be suffocation. After postmortem, the body was handed over to the family who carried out the last rites. The accused was remanded two days in police custody. Kidnapped girl with intention to kill Sub-Inspector Balkar Singh said Neelam had kidnapped Dilroz with the intention to kill, but had not decided how she would go about it. “When she reached an under-construction colony in the Salem Tabri area, she found a pit in a vacant plot adjoining a field and decided to bury her.” Neelam said she had beaten up the toddler when she had cried and then had made her lie face down in the pit. She had filled the pit with soil and returned home. The victim’s grandfather, Shaminder Singh, said he had scolded the accused’s sons for creating a ruckus in the street, and she had nursed a grudge against him since the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/toddler-kidnapped-buried-alive-in-ludhiana-mother-had-called-up-accused-after-her-girl-went-missing-101638219809871.html

Established in 1975, Punwire, a firm with expertise in wireless communication technology, had remained a profit-making company for over 20 years, and had shot to fame after setting up a communication link between Dakshin Gangotri (Antarctica) and New Delhi. Its operations had come to a grinding halt in 1999 after the scam was unearthed. In July 2000, it was locked for liquidation and in February 2001, the final orders for winding up were passed by the Punjab and Haryana high court. In October 2002, acting on the directions of the Supreme Court, the CBI had registered the instant on the allegations of large-scale embezzlement of funds in the firm. Accordingly, the CBI took over 20 FIRs of Mohali police station for investigation. The present case was a reproduction of an FIR registered in 2001, earlier registered at Mohali police station. It was alleged in the said FIR that Punwire had gone into liquidation because of large-scale cheating and embezzlement of funds by its own officials and also because of mismanagement in the company. It was further alleged that executive director Ved Prakash, who was authorised to issue cheques up to the limit of ₹2 lakh only, had issued cheques beyond the said limit to creditors. The credit amount had run into around ₹132.5 crore. It was stated that the trio were fully aware of the precarious financial condition of the company at the time of issuing the cheques and the act put the company under huge financial liability and multifarious litigations due to instances of cheque bounce. After investigation, a chargesheet was filed on August 29, 2008 and the charges were framed on November 18, 2010. The trial court found them guilty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punwire-multi-crore-scam-three-officials-of-erstwhile-firm-sentenced-to-two-year-jail-101638219209278.html

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||NC will fight alone for Article 370 if Congress not on board: Omar||National Conference vice-president and former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday took a swipe at senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad for giving up the fight for restoration of Article 370. With political parties getting into election mode, Omar raked up Article 370 to strike an emotional chord with the people in Kishtwar. Addressing a public rally at Kishtwar, Omar said, “Article 370 was the legacy of the Congress. I got sad today after reading a news report wherein Azad sahib, who remained chief minister of J&K, said at a rally in Kashmir that talking about Article 370 is useless and that it won’t return.” “It came into existence because of the first PM Jawahar Lal Nehru. If the Congress can’t protect and stand up for its own legacy, then what would it do with the people and their issues,” he asked. “The hearing hasn’t yet started and they (Congress) have already given up. Have you decided before the Supreme Court takes a decision on the matter?” he said. The former chief minister said, “Our identity, survival, jobs, future of youth and land… everything is related to Article 370.” “They (Congress) are not ready to fight the battle but we will fight it alone. We were told that Article 370 was hollow (by the BJP). Had it been so, then why they removed it?” he asked. ‘Good that Azad accepted the mistake of Nehru’Reacting to Omar’s speech at Kishtwar, former deputy chief minister and BJP leader Kavinder Gupta said, “When they (the NC, the PDP and the Congress) were in governments, we have seen that how stone pelting, pro-Pak stand, terrorism, corruption and dynastic politics plagued the state. It is good to see that Ghulam Nabi Azad has realised and accepted the mistake of Nehru.” “They want statehood, which the BJP government has assured in the Parliament, but Article 370 won’t return till doomsday. People got the much-needed relief following its abrogation. They (Omar and Mehbooba) are giving such statements to propel their political fortunes but it is not going to help them because they are on a sticky wicket,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nc-will-fight-alone-for-article-370-if-congress-not-on-board-omar-101638217529276.html

The government should accept our demands which include a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP), amendment in the Electricity Act, compensation to deceased farmers’ families and job to their next of kin, revocation of FIRs registered during the agitation, and strict action against the Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra, by Tuesday evening,” he added.Dallewal said the government should not remain in misconception that the protesters are going back after the three farm laws were repealed through a bill in the Parliament.“After President Ram Nath Kovind signed off on the farm laws repeal legislation, we will ask the government to accept our other demands. The ball is in the government’s court whether they want to call off this agitation or continue it. Farmers of the entire country want a legal guarantee on MSP, not just Punjab farmers,” Dallewal added.SKM leader Inderjit Singh said they are not fully satisfied with the Union government as six demands are yet to be met.“Farmers from Haryana, Punjab and other states will leave Delhi borders after all their demands are accepted. We are in no mood to leave the borders until all our demands are accepted,” he added.BKU state youth president Ravi Azad said they will follow the SKM’s decision after their meeting on December 1.“The government’s only option is to accept all our demands and end this agitation. The BJP-JJP leaders were claiming that the MSP will be continued, so there should not be any problem in giving a legal guarantee,” he added.Meanwhile, JJP general secretary Digvijay Singh Chautala, younger brother of Haryana deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, said the government should revoke all cases registered against farmers during the agitation.“It took one year to solve the farmers’ issues but we are glad that it has been resolved. The government should include SKM leaders in a committee to decide an MSP policy and accept their other demands as well,” he said while interacting with the media in Bahadurgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-farm-unions-give-ultimatum-to-centre-to-accept-pending-demands-by-today-101638216457705.html

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||Corruption in recruitments: Lapses deliberate to shield the accused, alleges Surjewala||Pointing out flaws in the investigation conducted by the Haryana Vigilance Bureau (VB) in the corruption case pertaining to selections of dental surgeons by the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC), Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Monday alleged that lapses were deliberate to shield the accused and cover up the job scam.The former Haryana minister addressing a press conference said documents produced by the VB in court showed that “zero recovery” of documents has been made from the accused.Quoting a November 23 order of the court of Panchkula chief judicial magistrate (CJM), the Congress leader said on November 19, the CJM’s court had sent HPSC deputy secretary Anil Nagar to police custody for four days to make recovery of documents from Rohtak district and the HPSC office in Panchkula.The police custody was granted by the court on an application by the vigilance bureau.“However, when the court asked for daily diary report of the local police station regarding visit of the investigating officer (IO) along with the accused to Rohtak district, the IO expressed his inability to furnish the same,” he said.“Similarly, police remand was granted by the court to other two accused Ashwani Sharma and Naveen on November 22 on pretext that documents have to be recovered from Solan district in Himachal Pradesh. However, the IO again failed to furnish the daily diary report entries of the local police station,” the Congress leader said, quoting the court order.Reading from the court order, Surjewala said on the contrary, the IO said though he is the head of the SIT constituted to investigate the offence, another IO will be able to explain why the accused were not taken to Rohtak and Solan.The Congress leader said the court observed that the plea of the defence counsel that the IO is not serious regarding recovery of articles and only interested in keeping the accused in custody attains gravity.Surjewala said the state government needs to answer whether the vigilance bureau is trying to cover up the whole issue by enacting a drama in the name of investigation against HPSC deputy secretary Anil Nagar and two other accused Ashwini Sharma and Naveen.He also questioned as to why and how the contract for online application portal, scanning, etc was again given to Safedot E-Solution Pvt Ltd by the HPSC despite the fact that this company was ousted in 2020 by the previous HPSC chairman.“The question is under what circumstances and at whose behest this ousted company was again given the job of recruitments by HPSC. Why the HPSC chairman and members have not been questioned by the VB in this regard?” he asked.A HPSC spokesperson said the application portal was managed by TCS. “Now, the work has been given to another company through a tendering process. The scanning work is confidential and looked after by either the secretary or the deputy secretary. For dental surgeon and HCS exam, the scanning work was done in the presence of a committee headed by the deputy secretary. We are not aware of the agency entrusted with the job,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/corruption-in-recruitments-lapses-deliberate-to-shield-the-accused-alleges-surjewala-101638216210613.html

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||Badal loyalist Harjinder Singh Dhami elected SGPC chief||Once a protégé of Akali bigwig and former SGPC president late Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Harjinder Singh Dhami, 65, on Monday took over the reins of the apex gurdwara body, replacing Jagir Kaur. The annual election was held at Teja Singh Samundri Hall here. Dhami had supported Tohra during latter’s feud with the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, which was described as “clash of Titans”, in 1999. Tohra and Badal buried the hatchet in 2003 and the former died in 2004. Now, Dhami, a qualified lawyer, is considered a loyalist of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal. Once again, the chief of the apex gurdwara body is from Punjab’s Doaba region. Dhami is an SGPC member from Sham Chaurasi segment and hails from Piplan Wala village in Hoshiarpur district. Jagir Kaur belongs to Begowal town in Kapurthala district of Doaba region. On the eve of the annual poll session, the gurdwara body members owing allegiance to the SAD, which enjoys the majority in the House, had authorised party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal to choose the president and other office-bearers. He sent the names to the House on Monday for its formal approval. Of the 162 SGPC members, 142 attended Monday’s session. Outgoing SGPC senior vice-president Surjit Singh Bhittewad proposed the name of Dhami for approval of the House, but members from the opposition, including Balwinder Singh Bains and Gurpreet Singh Randhawa, demanded polling through a secret ballot by fielding their candidate, Mithu Singh Kahne Ke. Dhami secured 122 votes while Kahne Ke bagged only 19. Panthic face Panjoli elected gen secy The post of general secretary, the second most powerful seat in the gurdwara body, went to Karnail Singh Panjoli who was also a protégé of Tohra and is reportedly close to Sikh hardliners. Once a critic of the Badals, Panjoli has also been an executive member earlier. Before joining the SAD, he had contested the Punjab assembly elections from Rajpura as a Dal Khalsa candidate. Analysts say Sukhbir may have given Panjoli the key post keeping his Panthic credentials in mind as assembly polls are round the corner. Panjoli, too, won the post through ballot. Sukhbir’s close aide and SGPC member from Haryana Raghujit Singh Virk could again secure a place among the office-bearers as senior vice-president, while the post of junior vice-president went to Principal Surinder Singh, an SGPC member from SC community. Both these office-bearers were elected unanimously. Oppn outcry over executive panel representation The poll session also witnessed uproar from opposition members who wanted their two members to be inducted in the 11-member executive committee, but the newly elected president declined their demand, saying only 19 votes were cast in their favour and as per the calculation, the opposition deserved one-member representation. There was exchange of heated arguments. The opposition got only a single representation in Baba Gurpreet Singh Randhawe Wale and members walked out of the session in protest. “It is unfortunate that instead of discussion, the atmosphere was deliberately spoiled by the opposition,” Dhami said later.

They are expected to be completed by March 2022. The officials said some of the projects are expected to be inaugurated on the occasion of the Republic Day. The ICP also facilitates the movement of passengers from India to Pakistan and vice versa. The construction work of the residential building for the BSF is 90% complete. The ₹22 crore project, which comprises the officers’ block, women’s block and jawans’ barracks, will be completed before December 15 this year, said ICP manager Sukhdev Singh. Those BSF jawans tasked with the security of the ICP and the joint check-post (JCP), which hosts beating the retreat ceremony, will stay in the residential building once completed. Presently, these jawans have been staying at the BSF’s Khasa headquarters, around 20 kms from the Attari border.Sukhdev Singh said 65% construction work of the patrolling tracks, which are being constructed along the perimeter wall of the ICP, has been completed and the remaining will be done before December 15. The BSF jawans will be able to patrol by using two- and four-wheelers by using the new road as the same was done on foot on the unpaved road.Also, ₹3 crore is being spent on air-conditioning of the passenger terminal. “Nearly 75 per cent work on the 1.30 megawatt (MW) grid-tied rooftop solar plant project at ₹4 crore has been completed. The project will be complete before December 31,” he added.The main road leading to the trade gate situated along the zero line was damaged. “We are spending ₹1 crore on the construction of the road and it will be completed before January,” he said.Some underground electric works are also being done at the ICP, the LPAI official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lpai-spending-rs-42-crore-to-upgrade-icp-attari-strengthen-security-at-border-101638214948917.html
30-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ad shoot at Kartarpur Gurdwara: DSGMC urges MEA to take up issue with Pakistan govt||The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee on Monday wrote to Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar, demanding him to take up with the Pakistan government the issue of an agency using the premises of Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib for promotion of women apparel. In pictures shared on social media, a model can be seen posing for an advertisement for a women’s clothing brand at the gurdwara. “We urge the government of India to immediately take up this serious issue with the Pakistan government considering the sentiments of the community,” DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa wrote in the letter. “A Pakistani business promotion agency used the premises of historical Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib, Pakistan, for promotion of ladies clothes. This act of agency/model has deeply hurt the religious sentiments of Sikh community worldwide. It is unfortunate that the local administration allowed an agency to use the religious place of worship for such promotions (sic),” the letter read. Sirsa said many complaints have been received from the Sikh Sangat regarding people using the gurdwara premises as a “picnic spot or to shoot TikTok videos wearing indecent clothes which hurts our sentiments”. “This behaviour is totally unacceptable... We demand strict action against those who disrespect the sanctity of gurdwara sahibs; just like the Pakistan government acted against actress Saba Qamar for shooting a dance video in a historical mosque,” the letter added. Pakistan police initiate probe The Pakistan police on Monday initiated a probe into a Pakistani model’s bareheaded photoshoot for a clothing brand at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur following an Indian Sikh journalist’s criticism of the pictures for hurting the religious sentiments of the community. Noting that the pictures have been uploaded on the social media, Indian Sikh independent journalist Ravinder Singh in a tweet highlighted the disrespect shown to the community and also tagged Prime Minister Imran Khan in his post. Covering one’s head in a gurdwara is mandatory and considered as a way of showing respect for the revered place. Reacting to his tweet, Azhar Mashwani, the Punjab chief minister’s focal person for digital media, said the matter had been “forwarded to concerned authorities for legal action”. Shortly after, the Punjab police tweeted that they are investigating all aspects related to this incident and strict legal action will be taken against those responsible. “Management of concerned brand & model are being investigated. Worship places of all religions are equally respectable,” it said in the tweet. According to a report in the Dawn newspaper, the model’s photos were shared on the Instagram page of a clothing brand named Mannat Clothing, but were removed after the criticism. Mashwani was quoted as saying in the report that police would first investigate the model and the brand’s role in the capturing of the photos and later register a case. “The Police are checking whether the model conducted the photoshoot on her own or the brand carried out the session,” he said. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry in a tweet said “the designer and the model must apologise to Sikh community” over the photos. “Kartarpur Sahib is a religious symbol and not a film set,” he tweeted. Reacting to the whole controversy, the brand- Mannat Clothing- in an Instagram post apologised and denied that the pictures posted on their accounts were part of any photo shoot done by them. “These pictures were provided to us by a third party (blogger) in which they were wearing our dress,” it said in the post. “However, we accept our mistake that we should not have posted this content and we apologise to every single person who was offended by this,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ad-shoot-at-kartarpur-gurdwara-dsgmc-urges-mea-to-take-up-issue-with-pakistan-govt-101638214769269.html

30-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: No change in Dec 31 deadline for takeover of DLF Phases 1,2 and 3||December 31 will continue to be the deadline for taking over of DLF Phases 1, 2, and 3, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) reiterated to developer DLF during a review meeting of the three colonies on Monday.The meeting was chaired by MCG chief engineer TL Sharma at the civic body’s Sector 34 office.Sharma directed DLF to complete all the remaining development works, including construction of roads in all three colonies, as soon as the ongoing construction ban — imposed on the orders of the Supreme Court on November 24 on account of worsening air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) — is lifted so that the developer can adhere to the December 31 deadline.Sharma said if the construction ban continues, a relaxation of 10-15 days can be given to DLF, but as of now, the deadline for handover will continue to be December 31, as agreed upon during a review meeting in October.“Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has given strict instructions to take over the colonies by December 31, according to which all pending works should be completed at the earliest. DLF was also told that the excuse of being unable to carry out bitumen related work in winter will not be accepted,” said Sharma.DLF officials gave an assurance to the MCG that they will complete the work as per the deadline but raised the issue of non receipt of completion certificates, said MCG officials.To this, the chief engineer said the MCG will take up the matter with the department of town and country planning (DTCP); however, the MCG has to take over the three colonies regardless.DLF officials declined to comment on the matter.MCG’s ward 34 councillor Rama Rathee, who attended the meeting, said she raised the issue of infrastructure upgrade in Block G of DLF Phase 1, and blocks J and L in DLF Phase 2, as the existing infrastructure is not sufficient to support the growing population.“Due to the increase in floor area ratio (FAR), there has been a lot of pressure on the existing infrastructure in the three colonies. There is dire need for an infrastructure upgrade. Water is a major problem and underground water tanks need to be built at the earliest to meet the supply deficit. Hence, taking over the three colonies needs to be done as per the deadline so that the MCG can take up the infra related issues on priority,” said Rathee.Around ₹14.12 crore was required to fix civic deficiencies in DLF Phase 1; ₹9.43 crore in DLF Phase 2; and ₹11.89 crore for DLF Phase 3, as per the civic body’s 2017 deficiency assessment report.MCG officials said during Monday’s meeting, the status of ongoing work was also reviewed.“At least 75% of road construction work, around 80% of desilting of sewer lines, 70% of desilting of stormwater drains, 65% of water supply related work, and 60% of horticulture work have been completed in the three colonies. Provided that there are no interruptions and there is adequate availability of manpower and machinery, we estimate that it will take another three weeks to complete all pending work,” said a senior MCG official, who attended the meeting, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-no-change-in-dec-31-deadline-for-takeover-of-dlf-phases-1-2-and-3-101638214169186.html

Health officials said that all the stakeholders were asked to keep strict vigilance regarding the new variant of concern, which is believed to be extremely transmissible. The officials said that the 12 high-risk countries from where travellers would need to follow additional measures on arrival, including Covid-19 testing, are the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Israel. On Monday, Gurugram chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav also held a meeting with representatives of at least 10 major private hospitals and diagnostic labsto check the Covid preparedness in the district.Yadav said that samples of international travellers will be sent for genome sequencing if their Covid test report comes positive. “We have asked the private hospitals to share complete information of international travellers twice a week so that we can keep a record and can track them for contact tracing. We have also asked them to mention the correct address and mobile number of an international patient,” he said. The officials also said that separate testing camps have been set up for international travellers outside two government hospitals and several private hospitals across the district, as hundreds of foreign nationals visit Gurugram every week for medical treatment. On Monday, 3,441 Covid tests were conducted in the district, the officials said. “We are also doing a random sampling of the passengers since July this year and 5% of the samples are sent for genome sequencing to Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak,” he said.Central guidelines say that travellers coming from countries ‘at risk’ have to undergo RT-PCR testing on arrival. Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare, said that they have deputed additional manpower at their flu clinics across network hospitals to cater to any surge in the coming days. “Patients arriving from the designated countries or those who declare a travel history to these in the last fortnight are undergoing a compulsory RT-PCR test. We are ensuring strict adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour at our facilities and are well-equipped to deal with any emergency,” he said. On Monday, the district reported eight fresh Covid-19 cases while 13 people recovered from the infection, according to the state government data. There are 65 active cases in the district, of which 61 are in home isolation and four are hospitalised, the officials said.

The shops were sealed in markets and malls located in sectors 10A, 42, 48, 49, and on Golf Course Road. On Saturday, the MCG had sealed 38 shops across Palam Vihar, sectors 4 and 9 for the same violation.“Under the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, all types of commercial establishments located within the MCG limits are required to obtain a trade licence. Continuous action is being taken by the MCG against commercial establishments operating without trade licence,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer, MCG.The civic body was also supposed to carry out a sealing drive in the zone 2 on Monday. However, prior to the drive, about 50 shopkeepers of markets in sectors 22 and 23 approached the MCG to procure trade licence, the officials said, adding that they were directed to the civic body’s camp opposite the Civil Hospital for the paper work to get a licence. Of 46 shops sealed on Monday, 27 were sealed in Sector 10A market, 10 in malls located in sectors 48 and 49, and nine shops in a mall in Sector 42 located on GCR.The action against shops operating without a licence has gained impetus since Friday when the MCG commissioner had pulled up the taxation branch for lack of action on the matter. During the review meeting, it was pointed out that the MCG’s revenue collection has been hit due to laxity in issuing licences. There are over 47,000 commercial properties in the MCG area. The MCG has issued notices to over 230 commercial property owners to procure trade licenses or else their properties will be sealed next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/46-shops-in-gurugram-sealed-for-operating-without-trade-licence-101638213629959.html

His family members admitted him to a private hospital immediately, where he is currently undergoing treatment,” Pandey said.Umesh Bahadur, station house officer (SHO), Jewar police station, said that a police team was formed and an investigation was launched in the matter.Nirmal, who retired from the Indian Army in 1990, had worked at a private company for a few years. “Nirmal lives with his nephew’s family, after he developed differences with his wife and son who have been living at a different house for the past 15 years. The 30-year-old wife of Nirmal’s nephew told us that the victim was sitting inside his house premises when Nirmal’s son Himmat and his aide shot at him,” Bahadur said.Bahadur also said that Nirmal and his son have been involved in a property dispute for some time. “According to primary investigation, a land owned by Nirmal was acquired in the Jewar airport project and he had got a compensation amount and a developed land in return. However, he did not give any share from those to his son, and his son has been allegedly upset over the issue... so, he committed the crime,” Bahadur added.A case was registered against the two suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) at the Jewar police station on Sunday. “A search to arrest the suspects is underway,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/jewar-son-aide-booked-for-shooting-62-year-old-father-over-property-dispute-101638213390874.html
30-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram’s air quality nears ‘severe’ levels||For the sixth consecutive day, the city’s air quality continued to be in the “very poor” category on Monday, while inching closer to the “severe” pollution levels. However, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted that the city may receive a few spells of rain on Thursday which will improve the air quality later this week.According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin, the air quality index (AQI) of Gurugram on Monday was recorded at 395, a rise from Sunday’s reading of 372. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. Officials from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said that low wind speed and dip in temperature were causing the air quality to deteriorate. “Low temperature and wind speed are causing pollutants to remain trapped in the lower layers of the atmosphere. This further disrupts the dispersion of particulate matter. Due to unfavourable weather conditions, the air quality has deteriorated further. We are monitoring the situation closely and checking on localised pollution violations,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer (north), HSPCB.The HSPCB on Monday also imposed a penalty of ₹25 lakh each on two real estate developers for carrying out construction activities in sectors 61 and 63A, respectively. The Supreme Court and the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) have banned construction activities across Delhi-NCR until further orders.“During surprise inspections, our teams found construction activities ongoing at two different sites on Monday afternoon, and accordingly levied penalties on the developers concerned. We are also carrying out night patrolling to ensure such violations can be detected and localised air pollution can be kept in check,” said Singh.HSPCB on Sunday had imposed a penalty of ₹25 lakh on a developer for carrying out construction activities in Sector 103.Meanwhile, IMD, in its local weather report, said that Gurugram may see a few spells of rain and thundershowers on Thursday, which can help the ai quality improve slightly. A maximum temperature of 26°C and a minimum of 10°C were recorded for the city on Monday, the IMD said. On Sunday, the city had witnessed maximum and minimum temperatures at 24.7°C and 10.5°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-air-quality-nears-severe-levels-101638213389362.html

One of the suspects and the victim exchanged their cellphone numbers and soon started chatting on WhatsApp,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Greater Noida.The suspect took the woman in confidence, and asked her to share her birthday date with him -- which was in September itself. “The suspect told her that he would send her an expensive gift -- jewellery and 65,000 British pounds ( ₹65.11 lakh) -- to her as a belated birthday gift,” said Ankita Sharma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Noida.Soon after this conversation, the woman started getting calls from unknown numbers and the callers identified themselves as Customs officials. “They demanded money from me to release the gift from the Customs department. I transferred nearly ₹27 lakh to different bank accounts, as provided by the suspects who posed as Customs officials, in eight transactions between September and November,” the woman said in her complaint.However, the men kept asking for more money to release the gift. The victim smelled a foul play behind this and filed a complaint at the Sector 20 police station on November 19.Police scanned details of bank accounts of the suspects and found that those were opened in New Delhi. “We traced Internet protocol (IP) address and cellphone numbers used by the suspects, and conducted a search in New Delhi’s Tilak Nagar and arrested the four suspects from there on Monday,” ADCP Singh said.Police have seized 36 cellphones; four passports, laptops and Internet dongles; and ₹3.5 lakh from the possession of the suspects. The Noida police said that the suspects came to India in 2014 on medical visas, and their visas eventually expired. However, they did not return to West Africa and started living in India illegally.The suspects are not cooperating with us in the investigation and it is not yet clear how many people they have cheated so far, said ADCP Singh. “A case was registered against the four suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) earlier this month. They were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody on Monday,” he said.All the four suspects were brought to deputy commissioner of police (DCP) office in Noida Sector 6 during a press conference on Monday, where suspect Mortin said, “The charges levelled against us are not true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-arrested-for-cheating-noida-woman-of-27-lakh-on-pretext-of-birthday-gift-101638213336502.html

The 13 developers and the school authorities in question have destroyed the green belt -- which is located adjoining their properties, by building structures there, said the officials.Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO) of Greater Noida authority, has directed the horticulture department to conduct an inspection in the area and submit a report on the same at the earliest. “The horticulture department has been directed to act strictly in this matter and take action against the violators -- the 13 developers and the school authorities -- for using the green space for their personal purposes. We will take legal action against them if they fail to deposit the penalty amount within seven days,” said Bhooshan.The horticulture department has imposed penalties between ₹4 lakh and ₹8 lakh against the violators, depending on the severity of violations.The green belt has been freed and the penalty notice has been served to the parties concerned, said the officials on Monday.“If the developers or the school fail to pay the penalty amount, the Greater Noida authority will start recovery proceedings through issuance of recovery notices, under which properties of the two parties can be seized.

Supertech Limited, meanwhile, filed a review plea before the court in which it maintained that it has informed the authority that three agencies have been shortlisted for the demolition exercise.On August 31, a bench led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud had given three months to Supertech to demolish the towers, which according to the apex court was built in violation of norms, and directed the Noida authority and Central Building Research Institute to supervise the exercise. The authority filed the status report on Monday as the court given deadline of three months has expired and the Supreme Court order is yet to be complied with, said officials.“Yes, we have filed a report in the Supreme Court in the Supertech matter,” said chief executive officer, Noida authority, Ritu Maheshwari, without giving any further details.According to officials in the know of the matter, the authority has informed the court that developer Supertech has not yet selected an agency for carrying out the demolition, thus delaying the process.But Supertech on Monday filed a review application stating that it has informed the Noida authority about shortlisting three agencies for demolition.“Since the Noida authority and Central Building Research Institute are in a supervisory role, we have informed both about the technical status and that we have finalised three agencies for the demolition. Now it is up to the Noida authority to finalise any one agency for the job. We have also informed the authority about what the experts say about the demolition and how tough a job it would be as the towers are surrounded by other residential buildings,” said RK Arora, chairman, Supertech Limited.Maheshwari, however, said the developer has not yet submitted an action plan for demolition even after multiple meetings.“As per the Supreme Court order, we are only in a supervisory role. It is Supertech that has to select the agency and then prepare an action plan,” she said.The case related to the twin towers was filed in 2012 by the Emerald Court residents’ welfare association (RWA) claiming that several rules were violated in the construction of two 40-storey towers. On April 11, 2014, the Allahabad high court ordered that the towers — Apex and Ceyane — be razed, observing that they stood too close to each other. The Noida authority appealed against the verdict, claiming that no norm was violated in their construction.On August 31, the Supreme Court directed Supertech to demolish the twin towers within three months and also prosecute Noida officials involved in approving maps and building plans in violation of norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/3month-deadline-over-noida-files-status-report-in-sc-on-twin-tower-demolition-101638213334070.html

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella organisation of farmers leading the protests, on Monday issued a statement which termed the passage of the repeal bill as “history has been made today in India”. “Anti-farmer, pro-corporate black farm laws repealed by India’s Parliament without any discussion, after the government of India was forced to take this step through a historic farmers’ struggle - First major victory of the farmers’ movement today, while other important demands are still pending,” the SKM statement said. “We believe that the farm laws repeal is a positive step and we are now seeking a law to guarantee MSP for crops, besides several other demands such as compensation for farmers who died during the yearlong agitation against three laws, as well as withdrawal of cases against farmers, among others. Every farmer is closely watching how the government will take up our demands during the winter session,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader and UP Gate site spokesperson of SKM. On November 19, on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the three laws will be repealed and urged protesting farmers to end their yearlong agitation.Farmers at UP Gate had welcomed the announcement with much happiness and distributed sweets to everyone at the protest site. But there were no such celebrations on Monday when both houses of Parliament passed the repeal bill in record time, through a voice vote, without any discussion. Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said farmers in villages have told them not to leave the protest site. “Similar to the Farm Laws Repeal Bill 2021, the government should bring in a law to guarantee MSP. We have already told the government that we are ready for talks. On Monday, we held discussion with the Delhi Police and apprised them that there will be no tractor march (earlier scheduled for November 29) as it has already been suspended by the SKM,” Tikait said at UP Gate on Monday. “The farmers are still sitting at the three protest sites and they understand that there are other issues for which solution must be found. These three laws came one and half year ago but our other demands such as a law for MSP has already been there for years. The resolution of these issues will come only when talks are held,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-no-celebrations-at-up-gate-farmers-press-demand-for-msp-guarantee-101638213332927.html
30-11-2021||Noida||Pollution control teams act against construction sites in Ghaziabad, DG sets||The officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Monday said their teams are trying to enforce ban on diesel generator (DG) sets, imposed on account of bad air quality in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), and also conducting regular inspections of construction sites to stop any violation of a November 24 order by the Supreme Court, banning construction activities in Delhi-NCR. The air pollution levels in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida, meanwhile, continued to remain in the “very poor” category. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s 4pm bulletin on Monday, Ghaziabad had an air quality index (AQI) of 365, Greater Noida 350, and Noida 356, all readings falling in the “very poor” category. The CPCB figures showed that all monitoring stations in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida had PM2.5 — fine inhalable particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less— as the primary pollutant.An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. The UPPCB officials said they have sealed two places in Sahibabad where DG sets were being used despite a ban on their usage by the Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM). Officials said they have also stopped the construction work at four sites in Raj Nagar Extension in Ghaziabad. “There is a prevalent ban on the operation of DG sets, except for emergency services, as directed by the CAQM. The four sites undertaking construction work were doing so in violation of a Supreme Court order that had directed a stoppage of all construction activities in Delhi and the neighbouring NCR towns. The activities which fall under the purview of the order were stopped,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “Our teams have now focussed on DG sets and construction activities which flout the directions of the Supreme Court and the CAQM,” Sharma added. In its directions on November 24, the apex court called for an interim ban on construction activities in the NCR except for non-polluting construction activities such as plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical works and carpentry. The forecast by the Union government’s System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar) said local surface winds are likely to remain relatively high on Monday and Tuesday, leading to increased dispersion of pollutants. “...On December 1, wind speed and temperature are likely to decrease, reducing ventilation leading to slight deterioration of air quality. From December 2 onwards winds are expected to increase gradually but AQI is likely to remain in the “very poor” category. Low mixing layer height is preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,” the Safar forecast added. The mixing height is the height at which air and suspended particles mix above the ground.A lower mixing height means the pollutants remain trapped closer to the surface.On Monday, the share of stubble burning related pollutants in Delhi’s PM2.5 was 2%, the forecast added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pollution-control-teams-act-against-construction-sites-in-ghaziabad-dg-sets-101638213331897.html
30-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Travellers from high-risk nations to be in home quarantine for a week||In the wake of the World Health Organization (WHO) asking countries to widely test for the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus, saying its divergent design could fuel future surges of the disease with severe consequences, the Ghaziabad health department has directed all foreign travellers reaching the district from 15 “high-risk countries” to be in home quarantine for a week, officials said on Monday.According to the officials, the decision has been taken as a precautionary measure against any possible spread of the new variant. Health department teams and the integrated covid command and control centre (ICCCC) in the district will monitor such travellers during their home quarantine, they added.“The list mostly includes South-African nations among the 15 high-risk countries. While returning or coming to India, a traveller should have the RT-PCR report with him/her, and thereafter the person will have to stay in home quarantine for a week. During this period, our teams will conduct tests on the person and his/her family members. The traveller will be again tested for Covid-19 after one week, and further action will be taken accordingly. In case the person tests Covid-19 positive, we will get genome-sequencing done for the samples,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer (CMO) of Ghaziabad.He also said that the health department has called on several resident welfare associations (RWAs) to take proactive measures to check a possible spread of the new Covid-19 variant. “The RWAs are requested to inform the health department if residents or people are coming in the housing complexes from states with high caseload, and mandatorily about the arrival of travellers from abroad. In the meantime, we have also asked our teams to step up the regular Covid-19 vaccination, and it will take us another fortnight to complete our assigned target for the first-dose vaccination,” Shankhdhar added.According to official records, 1,770 foreign travellers entered the district between November 1 and November 29 (Monday), and 979 of them have tested negative for Covid-19 and test reports of the remaining people are awaited.“Given addresses have not matched in 329 instances, and 128 of the tested people are from other cities or districts. Overall, 334 test reports are under the process. So far, none of the foreign travellers tested positive for the virus. If they do, we will get the genome-sequencing done,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer, Ghaziabad.The WHO warned on Monday that the divergent design of the Omicron variant could fuel surges with “severe consequences” in the future. In a technical briefing document for its member states, the United Nations (UN) health agency said that the likelihood of a potential spread of Omicron at the global level is high, and the overall risk related to the new variant of concern has been assessed as “very high”.At present, the local transmission of Omicron has been reported in South Africa and it has now been detected in four WHO regions -- African, Eastern Mediterranean, European, and Western Pacific.District may miss first dose of vax deadlineIn connection with the target deadline of November 30 (Tuesday) set by the Uttar Pradesh government for vaccination, Ghaziabad in all probability is likely to miss the first-dose vaccination target of 2,702,167. According to the official data, the district has administered the first dose of vaccines to only 2,405,663 beneficiaries till 4.30pm on Monday. So, the district is short of administering 296,504 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the beneficiaries, said the officials.“We will try to complete the target in another fortnight. We have already taken up all necessary measures, including door-to-door surveys and holding evening vaccination camps. But there is a general tendency among the beneficiaries to not turn up as Covid-19 cases are almost negligible in the district,” CMO Shankhdhar added.Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination in the district, said, “Most of the beneficiaries who have not turned up for taking the jab are senior citizens or more than 18 years of age. We urge them to take the jab to protect themselves and others from Covid-19.”Despite all the efforts to meet the vax deadline, the Ghaziabad health department administered 130,706 doses of vaccines between November 22 and November 28 (Monday), at a daily average of 18,672 doses. During the week prior to this, the department administered 111,580 doses of vaccines, with a daily average of 15,940 doses per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-travellers-from-high-risk-nations-to-be-in-home-quarantine-for-a-week-101638213330759.html

The three farm laws were repealed by both houses on the opening day of the Parliament’s winter session on Monday. The bill seeking to withdraw the three farm bills was moved in Lok Sabha by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in the morning, amid ruckus by the Opposition. It was passed in the Lower House without discussion as Speaker Om Birla said a debate is not possible in a noisy scene.“The three highly contentious bills being withdrawn by Parliament after a year-long struggle by the farmers is some relief and a true win for the country’s democracy. This is a lesson for all the governments to practice democratic behaviour both inside and outside the Parliament,” Mayawati tweeted. “However various other problems of the farmers as well as the silence of the government over the demand for a legislation guaranteeing minimum support price of farmers still remains and a positive initiative is required from the centre on this issue so that the farmers could return home happily,” she added. This is the second time that Mayawati has flagged the issue of a law guaranteeing MSP to farmers for their produce. Despite the government withdrawing the three farm laws, the farmers have refused to call off their agitation until several of their other demands like a law on MSP, compensation to farmer families who lost their loved ones during the farmers’ agitation among others are settled. The BSP chief said that the centre also needed to strike a meaningful dialogue with farmers. “The centre should re-initiate a meaningful dialogue with farmers to ensure that they and their families benefit from it. For that, a proper policy is required which would be in the truest sense usher in a green revolution. This would mean life of farmers getting better,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-maya-hails-withdrawal-of-farm-bills-backs-farmers-demand-on-msp-law-101638213268955.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||Varavara Rao files plea to permit him to move to Hyderabad as he cannot afford to live in Mumbai||Mumbai Elgar Parishad accused P Varavara Rao has filed an application in the Bombay high court seeking modification of the February 22 bail order as he wishes to travel to Hyderabad and take medical treatment for cataract operations and other ailments. Rao, 83, has stated that as he is a pensioner and a senior citizen of the state of Telangana, he wants to avail the benefits of various health schemes initiated by the state. Rao has also stated that as he receives a pension of around ₹50,000 per month, it is insufficient for him to stay as well as pay medical expenses in Mumbai. Meanwhile, on Monday, the HC granted Rao an extension till December 6 to return to jail after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) informed the division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal that it had not been able to get the health condition of Rao assessed and examined by Nanavati Hospital, as directed by the bench on November 18. When the application of Rao for extension of bail came up for hearing, senior advocate Anand Grover, representing Rao, informed the bench that rather than complying with the November 18 order, NIA had failed to refer Rao to Nanavati Hospital. In the application seeking modification of the bail order, Rao has stated that the monthly expenses he has been incurring while complying with the bail conditions by staying in Mumbai is around ₹96,000 per month. As he receives only ₹50,000 pension, he is forced to borrow from his children, he stated. The application further states that he had to undergo a laparoscopic surgery and a hernia repair operation at Holy Family hospital after he suffered acute pain in the abdomen earlier in November for which he incurred an expense of ₹3.04 lakh. Rao has stated that he has already spent ₹3.7 lakh over his capacity and hence the bail order should be modified to permit him to go and live in Hyderabad where the cost of living is much lower. Rao has also stated that he has to undergo cataract operation in both eyes which will cost him ₹50,000 which is beyond his financial capabilities. He states that as he is covered by the health schemes in Telangana state and his daughter and grand-children are doctors, they would be in a better position to take care of him if he is allowed to go back to Hyderabad. While assuring the court that he is willing to abide by the strictest bail conditions put by the court while living at his residence in Hyderabad, Rao has stated that he would also be able to sustain himself and his wife from his pension. The application is expected to be heard on December 2 along with the bail extension application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/varavara-rao-files-plea-to-permit-him-to-move-to-hyderabad-as-he-cannot-afford-to-live-in-mumbai-101638213208773.html
30-11-2021||Gurugram||Schools reopen in Gurugram, records low attendance||Most of the private schools in Gurugram resumed offline classes on Monday, but the overall attendance was as low as 30%, officials said. School authorities said that many parents were reluctant to send their wards to school, expressing concerns over the possible third wave of Covid-19.However, in both private and government schools, the attendance was high for classes 10 and 12 due to the upcoming board examinations as it is mandatory for such students to attend physical classes, the officials said.“The overall attendance in private schools was poor at 30%, while the same for government schools was as high as 80%. However, classes 10 and 12 in both government and private schools saw an attendance of almost 90% on Monday,” said a district education officer, seeking anonymity.According to the officials, parents’ consent is mandatory for the students to attend junior classes.After getting the government’s nod to reopen from September (after the second Covid wave subsided in Haryana), schools in Gurugram were closed again from November 14 to 17 due to the deteriorating air quality. On November 17, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) directed that all private and government schools, and other educational institutions in Delhi and other NCR cities should remain closed “until further orders”. On November 25, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram released an order allowing all schools as well as other educational institutions to open from Friday (November 26) with strict Covid protocols. Only a few schools reopened on Friday. Sudha Goyal, director of the Scottish High International School, said tat parents still want their children to attend classes online. “Due to board exams, the senior students are attending physical classes. But parents of students studying in junior classes are not willing to send their wards to school due to the poor air quality and the Covid fear,” she said.Rohit Mann, director, Lancers International School, said, “Being an international school with expat population, we are yet to have our expatriate families rejoin. Many of them are yet to arrive in India and this has influenced our on-site attendance. Besides, parents are still cautious and are waiting for children to get vaccinated before they can send them to school,” he said. Aparna Erry, principal of DAV Public School, Sector 14, said that on Monday they started the offline classes again and were overwhelmed with the response in terms of students’ attendance. However, the government schools on Monday witnessed a robust attendance at 80% as parents opted for physical classes due to challenges in terms of internet connection and devices, the officials said. Sunil Kumar Sharma, principal of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Jacobpura, said that they received 1,400 students, out of the 1,456 students, in classes 9 to 12. “Parents and students now want to attend in-person classes as many of them were facing issues with online classes. There is no substitute for regular studies and due to lack of adequate resources in rural areas, many students were unable to attend online classes,” he said.The education officer said that schools have to follow all Covid-19 guidelines and if anyone found violating the norms, strict action will be taken against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/schools-reopen-in-gurugram-records-low-attendance-101638213150235.html
30-11-2021||Delhi||Covid worries keep students away as Delhi schools reopen||Schools across the Capital witnessed low attendance as they reopened for in-person classes after two weeks on Monday.The Delhi government had announced the closure of schools after the Supreme Court raised concerns about the Capital’s air pollution. Subsequently, the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region also directed the closure of education institutions in Delhi-NCR. Schools in Delhi were closed on November 13, barely two weeks after reopening for all students for the first time since March last year. School administrators attributed the thin attendance to uncertainty surrounding the emergence of a new Covid-19 variant Omicron and logistical challenges, such as the absence of school buses.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said that attendance was poor and several students who had given their consent for in-person classes did not come to school on Monday. The school resumed in-person classes for students in Class 6 onwards.“The feedback has not been very good. If 15 students consent from one section, hardly two turn up. There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the new Covid-19 variant, and some parents are scared. They are a little apprehensive about sending children to school since they are not vaccinated,” said Joshi.In other schools too, the number of students who attended in-person classes was fewer than anticipated based on consent forms. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, which reopened for in-person classes for students upto Class 9 on Monday, for the first time since March 2020, said, “Attendance was less even though we received consent from 50-60% of students. Around 30-35% attendance was recorded today [Monday] in various classes,” said Arora.She said that students were happy to be back at school after nearly 19 months and the school would spend the first few days setting the tone of the classroom through orientation sessions. The school is yet to start its transport service and is working out the modalities of the bus routes.Many other schools are currently in the process of finalising bus routes but are exercising caution amid the abrupt closure of schools in the past. Schools said that while parents were insisting on the resumption of bus services, one needed a minimum number of students to avail of the service.Sudha Acharya, the principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, and the chairperson of the National Progressive School’s Conference, a consortium of over 120 private Delhi schools, said that while parents were seeking bus services, the school management was yet to take a call on the decision. “We will have to take permission from the school management before resuming the service. The challenge is that if one is resuming the bus service on a particular route, one would need at least a minimum of 30 students to avail of the facility otherwise it will not be feasible,” said Acharya.She said that the school was calling students in a staggered manner, due to which students will not be accessing the facility daily. In the absence of daily use, parents might also raise concerns against paying the fees, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-worries-keep-students-away-as-delhi-schools-reopen-101638213091108.html

30-11-2021||Pune||Covid impact: Engineering courses see a surge of applicants this year||Pune: Number of students applying for engineering courses have increased this year compared to 2020 and the reason, according to experts, is that professional courses offer more job prospects especially during the Covid pandemic period. With the admission process underway for various courses, it is seen that the students applying for professional courses has increased in this academic year. The state Common Entrance Test (CET) cell held CET exams for various professional courses like engineering, pharmacy, management, law and others while registration of students seeking admission to these courses went considerably high for this year. As per the information shared by the state CET cell, in this academic year a total of 107,732 students have applied for online admission process for engineering courses in the state. During previous academic year for which admission process was concluded by February 2021 due to Covid induced restrictions, 96,337 students had applied for the courses. As the applications were fewer compared to intake capacity, 55,444 seats (44.7%) of the over 1.23 lakh in the first-year engineering courses across the state had remained vacant at the end of the Centralised Admission Process for the academic year 2020-21. During 2019, of 1.28 lakh seats, 62,086 (49%) were vacant in various engineering colleges across Maharashtra. Similarly, professional courses such as management and master in computer applications, there has been a rise in applications. Students taking direct admission to second year in engineering and pharmacy after completing diploma have also increased, said officials from CET. Last year, 42,815 students had applied for Master in Business Administration (MBA). This year, the number has gone up to 54,227. The number of students seeking direct admission in second year pharmacy course last year was 10,272, while this year it has gone up to 12,374. “There is good response to online admission process and registration of students in this academic year. Especially for the engineering courses, there has been a considerable rise in student registration this year. Students have preferred to choose the engineering sector looking at the job opportunities, mainly due to pandemic which has adversely affected other sectors. There has been good campus placements for engineering students in the last two years,” said a senior official from the state CET cell. Prof Mangesh Nagamurti from a private engineering institute said, “All the admissions for our computer science, mechanical and artificial intelligence have got a good number of students registration. The trend for this year is mostly seen towards professional courses rather than the traditional arts, commerce and science graduation. Students want to go for courses which can get good job opportunities in the future,” Pharmacy college professor Shrikant Borate said, “Due to the pandemic there was high demand for various types of medicines and other medical equipment. Even the business of medical shops and pharmacy industry boomed in last two years. Hence, many students are now preferring to go for pharmacy courses after completing Class 12. This is the field which gives job opportunities in any situation and students prefer this course due to financial crisis situation during Covid pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-impact-engineering-courses-see-a-surge-of-applicants-this-year-101638212788768.html

Delhi recorded an average air quality index (AQI) of 389, down from Sunday’s reading of 405, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin at 4pm.Also Read | SC seeks reports from Delhi, NCR states on controlling pollutionThe respite is expected to be shortlived as agencies have forecast wind speeds to hover around 15-20km/hr range on Tuesday, after which calm wind conditions, which are not conducive to clearing the air, are expected to return from Wednesday.Gufran Beig, founder and project director at the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), said immediate relief is unlikely as the wind speed on Tuesday is not expected to be strong enough to improve the AQI beyond the “very poor” category.“We had forecast wind speed to pick up on Monday and Tuesday but even when they touch 20 km/hr, it will still keep AQI within the ‘very poor’ category. By Wednesday, we will again have calm winds and AQI will start returning to the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category,” said Beig.According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), calm wind conditions were prevailing in Delhi till 10.30am, after which wind speed rose to 15km/hr during the afternoon.“Wind speed ranged from 10-15km/hr during the day but calm wind conditions were back after 5pm. Delhi’s overall visibility ranged from 300 metres in the morning to 2,500 metres during the day, owing to smog,” said IMD scientist RK Jenamani.In its forecast on Monday, the Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi -- a forecasting mechanism under the Union ministry of earth sciences -- stated that air quality is unlikely to improve beyond the ‘very poor’ category, with calm or slow wind conditions, unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants, predicted at night time.“Winds are likely to be relatively strong during Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, air quality is likely to deteriorate again due to calm winds, but it will remain in the ‘very poor’ category,” it said.Meanwhile, Delhi recorded a maximum of 26.1 degrees Celsius (°C) on Monday, a degree above normal, and the minimum was 10.3°C, which is normal for this time of the season.IMD has forecast the minimum temperature to drop to around 9°C on Tuesday but it is expected to increase to 12°C by Wednesday, under the influence of a western disturbance. “There is a possibility of very light rain occurring in parts of Delhi on Thursday. This western disturbance will raise the minimum temperature,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-improves-but-respite-will-be-shortlived-101638212728730.html
30-11-2021||Delhi||5,000 resident doctors from Delhi strike to protest alleged delays in NEET counselling||Resident doctors stayed away from outpatient services at Delhi’s major government hospitals for the third day in a row, with no assurances from the Centre on the NEET PG counselling process.Around 5,000 resident doctors from Delhi have so far joined their counterparts across the country in a strike to protest alleged delays in the NEET postgraduate counselling process.The NEET exams were to happen in May, but were postponed to September due to the second wave of Covid-19. The counselling process was then delayed further because of an ongoing case in the Supreme Court regarding economic reservation.The delays in admission to post-graduation courses might not only result in the washout of a year for the young medical students but has also resulted in a shortage of doctors in medical college-hospitals where a bulk of the work is handled by resident doctors.“We have received verbal assurances from the minister, however, we will not take back our strike till something concrete is done,” said Dr Suvrankar Dutta, general secretary of the Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA), one of the two associations leading the nation-wide strike.The doctors, after consulting resident doctors’ association from across the country, decided on Monday night that they will continue to not work in OPD but will not withdraw from other services till Friday.“In the meeting with the minister on Saturday, as well as a meeting in the health ministry today, we received assurance that all documents that the Centre had to submit to the Supreme Court will be submitted by Wednesday and they will push for emergency hearing of the case. So, we have given time till Friday. If nothing happens we will withdraw from all routine work,” said Dr Manish Kumar, president of the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association, the other organisation leading the protests.Another delegation of resident doctors had met the union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Sunday in Surat and received the same assurances as well, according to Dr Dutta. So far, no cases of the new variant has been confirmed in India.This is a matter of concern as the government now need to prepare healthcare infrastructure for the omicron variant that is now spreading to several countries.In addition, resident doctors from Hindu Rao hospital continue their strike demanding payment of salaries and pending allowances. The senior doctors from the hospital, who had also planned to go on strike Monday onwards, have called it off as it would have rendered the hospitals, dispensaries, maternity and TB clinics under the north corporation dysfunctional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/5000-resident-doctors-from-delhi-strike-to-protest-alleged-delays-in-neet-counselling-101638212608655.html
30-11-2021||Mumbai||State issues SOP for schools, vaccines mandatory for staff||MUMBAI Maharashtra government on Monday issued standard operating procedures (SOP) for all schools to reopen for physical classes from December 1. Only those staff members and students with no symptoms of Covid-19 will be allowed in the classroom. The government’s order says there should be no crowding in school buses, wearing of masks is compulsory for everyone, a distance of six feet has to be maintained, and all teaching and non-teaching staff should be vaccinated. Schools located in containment zones will not be allowed to open; neither will students living in containment areas be allowed to attend physical classes. The SOP was issued by the directorate of health services (DHS) while an order allowing resumption of offline classes from December 1 was issued by the school education department. On November 25, the state government had decided to reopen schools across the state from December 1. Prior to this, all classes barring Class 1 to 4 in rural areas and Class 1 to 7 in urban areas had resumed in the offline mode. The SOP says, “Students who are unwell should avoid going to school. Activities such as mass prayers and sports must be avoided as they can lead to crowding; schools should refrain from using biometric attendance, swimming pools and follow strict Covid protocols for using gymnasiums.” The SOP also lays down the guidelines in case a student is found Covid positive. “There is no need to panic in case a student is found with Covid-19 symptoms. Inform the parents and medical facility and keep the student in a separate room until he or she is attended by a doctor. Make a list of students who can be considered as close contacts and quarantine them at home for two weeks. The list includes students sitting up to three benches on the front, back, right and left rows of the classroom. Conduct RT-PCR for students developing Covid-19 symptoms and even though there is no symptom, get them tested within a period of five to ten days from the day he or she was home quarantined.” The state has directed the schools to make arrangements for online classes of students quarantined at home, check the temperature of students for the next 10 days, and disinfect the classroom. It has also made it mandatory for the schools to review the Covid-19 preventive action plan in case five or more students are found Covid positive in two weeks. They are also advised to take sufficient measures to ensure that an atmosphere of fear is not created in schools and among parents after students or staff found infected with Covid-19. However, the order issued by the school education department directs the empowered committees to ensure school is shut down as soon as they find any student infected with Covid-19. On August 10, the school education department formed empowered committees to ensure the guidelines and SOP being followed for reopening of schools in the state. In urban areas, the committee headed by a municipal commissioner has been empowered to take decisions while for rural areas committees are headed by district collectors. The education department order reads, “Students having any symptoms should be immediately sent back to home and ensure he or she is tested for Covid-19. If found positive, the school should be immediately closed and sanitised. Students came in close contact should be tested for Covid-19.” HT reached out to school education minister Varsha Gaikwad and additional chief secretary, school education Vandana Krishna to ask for clarifications for the contradictory guidelines. Neither responded to calls and text messages. Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope said to ABP Mazha TV news channel, “There is no need to impose any restrictions and schools will reopen on December 1 as announced… there is no need to panic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-issues-sop-for-schools-vaccines-mandatory-for-staff-101638212432718.html

The youth was booked under relevant sections of the IT Act for sharing misinformation and offensive post on social media platform to defame the state government, they said.Confirming the arrest, a Deoria police official said that the accused was identified as Prince Yadav, a resident of Baghi village under Maeel police station limits of the district. An FIR was lodged against him after the cyber cell alerted local cops about the misleading post shared by the accused from his Facebook account, the official said. https://twitter.com/UPPViralCheck/status/1464965066877374477He said that the accused posted the photograph stating it as the scene at a railway platform where several examinees were sleeping in open in cold night to appear in the UPTET examination next morning, but the exam was cancelled due to the paper leak. The post read that the examinees had to suffer a lot due to mismanagement. “When crosschecked, the photograph was found to be of some other state and it had nothing to do with UPTET. The accused was tracked down through his social media account. He was arrested from his house and further legal proceeding was initiated,” the official said. The cyber cell of the state police was regularly keeping a vigil on social media platforms and taking action against such users posting false and misleading information, he emphasised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deoria-youth-arrested-for-posting-misleading-photo-information-about-up-tet-101638212430692.html

30-11-2021||Mumbai||Authorities to trace passengers flown into Mumbai with South Africa returnee||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday said that it will conduct contact tracing of flyers who travelled with a 32-year-old passenger from Dombivli, landed in Mumbai from South Africa via Delhi. The man who tested positive for Covid has been kept under isolation by the Kalyan-Dombivli civic body.According to civic authorities, the 32-year-old Dombivli resident returned from South Africa via Dubai and Delhi to Mumbai on November 24. According to officials, a sample of the passenger was taken at Delhi airport subject to which he was allowed to board a flight to Mumbai. After arriving in the city, he went home in a cab. A BMC official said, “We are going to do contact tracing of the passengers in Mumbai. This means we will trace and screen the passengers a few rows around the seat of the infected passengers. We will also certainly trace the cab driver with whom he went to Dombivli from Mumbai Airport.”Officials from Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) said the passenger was put in institutional quarantine on Sunday where he is stable now. Dr Pratibha Panpatil, Health Officer at KDMC said, “We have tested the family of the South Africa returnee and they tested negative. The passenger is also stable now and his reports of genomic sequencing are awaited. We are doing contact tracing in coordination with BMC officials. For now, things are under control.”Meanwhile, according to BMC officials around 466 people have come from countries of concern in the last two weeks. Of these, 97 were contacted and none are positive. The BMC is expected to undertake a follow-up RT-PCR test on Monday for the above 97 travellers.The BMC had on Saturday issued an advisory requesting citizens to take more precautions. The BMC had on Saturday said that all international passengers arriving at the city’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) from “countries of concern” including countries from Africa, would be made to undergo mandatory RT-PCR testing for Covid-19, and if found positive, would be sent to an institutional quarantine centre while their samples would be sent to the city’s genome sequencing lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/authorities-to-trace-passengers-flown-into-mumbai-with-south-africa-returnee-101638212308947.html
30-11-2021||Pune||Omicron ready: Mixing of vaccines might be an option, says ICMR former chief, Dr Gangakhedkar||PUNE Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former chief of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), now part of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) scientific advisory group on the origins of novel pathogens said that a lot of questions till needs to be answered in light of the new Covid variant, Omicron. He added that a “mixing strategy”, which is mixing two doses of the Covid vaccine, or taking a a booster dose, are options that need to be looked at. He also said that the decision to reduce the gap between two doses should be considered as it should not reduce the efficacy, or the immunogenicity of the particular vaccine, which the Omicron variant might affect even in its current process. Although Dr Gangakhedkar said that it is too early to panic due to the new variant, since we do not know if it increases hospitalisation or deaths, but we only know now that it has a high rate of transmission. During the meeting when questioned about booster doses he said, “When we talk about reducing the gap between two doses we must be very careful while deciding on that to ensure that by reducing the gap we would do not reduce the efficacy or the immunogenicity of that particular vaccine. The variants themselves will reduce the efficacy of the vaccine. Instead we must prioritise fully immunising those who have a comorbidity or are aged above 45 years. We must develop vaccine coverage.”Since confirmation of the new variant, the state health minister and various experts have commented on the need to give booster vaccine doses, however, Dr Gangakhedkar said that giving a booster dose of the same vaccine might not be a wise decision. He said, “We are fortunate that we have not started booster doses because in any case we are going to use the same old vaccines which are based on the Wuhan virus, but you are now looking are the large number of mutations which have occured in the spike protein region which would mean infections would continue to occur. How much of protection you would provide by using the same old vaccine is a question which perhaps can be addressed better if we wait for the data to emerge. “In my mind instead of using the first generation vaccine, the second generation should be used, but the second generation vaccine would not be made available in India as soon as we think,” he said, adding, “A mixing strategy would perhaps become good over a period of time. There has been no discussion on this issue so far, but maybe Covaxin and Novavax could work, because Novavax tends to have 16 different subunits or spike proteins, so some of them would continue to really useful and it is immunogenic. Those who have got Covishield could be give Covaxin as the booster. These questions are unaddressed and need lot of brainstorming.” Dr Raman Gangakhedkar is also the Dr CG Pandit National Chair at the ICMR after he retired as chief of ICMR in July 2020. Dr Gangakhedkar was director-incharge of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune, before he moved to the ICMR headquarters in Delhi. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2020 for his service and his research on HIV/AIDS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/omicron-ready-mixing-of-vaccines-might-be-an-option-says-icmr-former-chief-dr-gangakhedkar-101638212250208.html

A vigilance team of BSF caught him red-handed at a private school in Khandsa where the examination was held on Sunday, said police.Amit Kumar, deputy commandant, board member of BSF, said that Partik Singh of Hisar was arrested on Sunday for trying to take the examination for the post of assistant sub-inspector in BSF for another candidate. Kumar said the suspect is an engineer and had taken ₹1.5 lakh to appear in the candidate’s place and assured him to clear the examination. Police registered an FIR under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating), and 120 B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Badshahpur police station on Sunday. “Prima facie, it looks like it is a work of a gang. Partik told us during questioning that he did it for money, but this was his first time. We are questioning him to check if he was earlier also involved in a similar case,” said Dinkar (who goes by his first name), station house officer of Badshahpur police station. In August last year five persons were arrested for allegedly cheating in a BSF constable recruitment exam.

Bhullar has marked a probe in the case to additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 1) Parminder Singh Heer.The complainant, Jaspreet Singh, 34, stated that the Division Number 3 police had booked him in 2015 for opening fire in the air. Randhir Singh, who was the SHO at the time, had seized his licensed revolver and 10 live cartridges. Randhir was later promoted as ACP.He added that the FIR was cancelled, but the police did not return the weapon. Then, he filed a petition in the HC and the court had sought a reply from the police in the case. Jaspreet in his complaint alleged that Randhir has been threatening him to withdraw the petition. ACP Randhir Singh, who has been posted as ACP, licensing unit, said the court has not approved the cancellation of the FIR yet. Moreover, the arms licence of Jaspreet was cancelled, so the weapon cannot be returned. The ACP has refuted the allegations of threatening him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-trader-accuses-acp-of-threatening-him-probe-ordered-101638212128683.html
30-11-2021||Chandigarh||PM CARES Fund: HC notice to PMO, information commission||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought response from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and Central Information Commission (CIC) on a plea challenging denial of information under the Right to Information Act (RTI) about the PM CARES Fund. The Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund) was created on March 27, 2020, following the Covid-19 outbreak in India. The stated purpose was to combat and contain the virus and undertake relief efforts during the present and future pandemics. A Punjab lawyer, Nitin Mittoo, had sought information about the fund from the public information officer (PIO), PMO, under the RTI through online mode last year. On June 15, 2020, the PMO denied the information, solely on the ground that since it was related to PM CARES Fund, it does not fall under the ambit of public authority under the RTI Act, Mittoo stated in his petition before the high court (HC). The plea seeks directions to the CIC to decide his second appeal filed under the RTI Act, which was registered on September 23, 2020, and is pending to date. The HC bench of justice HS Madaan has sought a response from the CIC through the chief information commissioner, New Delhi; first appellate authority-cum-deputy secretary, PMO; and the PIO by January 6, 2022.What info was soughtThe lawyer had sought details about the cabinet resolution, other information related to advertisements put up about the fund and the money donated.Since the PMO is a government authority, dealing with affairs of the said fund, then the same shall fall under the category of public authority, the petition claims, adding that PM CARES is a trust developed by the Prime Minister as the settler not in his personal capacity but in the capacity of the Prime Minister of India. Hence, information should be provided, it adds. The petition further mentions that on June 30, 2020, he appealed before the first appellate authority, PMO, which upheld the PIO’s decision on August 20, 2020. On September 23, 2020, he appealed against it before the CIC. Reminders were sent on May 17 and June 30 this year, but the CIC has not decided the appeal, the petition states. Seeking directions that the appeal be decided within the stipulated time of 30 days, Mittoo further said in his plea that the delay in deciding the appeal denies the right of the petitioner to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-cares-fund-hc-notice-to-pmo-information-commission-101638212069795.html
30-11-2021||Pune||SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium has 5 Pune labs tracking Omicron||PUNE With threat of Omicron variant of Covid lingering, the state administration has now asked the laboratories to prepare for genome sequencing of samples in the coming days. Of the 28 laboratories in the country that are part of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) group, five are from Pune, a highest for any city in the country. Pune Divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao on Monday said, “As of Sunday evening nothing adverse has been reported with no samples tested positive so far for the Omicron variant. However the laboratories are fully geared to do genome sequencing in full swing and we are fully utilizing the labs as well. According to Rao the administration is in touch with NCL and ISSER. The primary goal of INSACOG is to begin sequencing work on Covid-19 positive samples sent in from across the country. In the wake of the new Covid variant, Omicron, these five labs are now geared up to restart genome sequencing. At least 650 samples have been sent for genome sequencing to various labs in Pune of samples that have tested positive for the infection. However, experts have also said that specific RTPCR test kits should be used for detecting the infection to reduce the load on labs for genome sequencing. The five labs that are part of INSACOG also form the Pune-COG consortium of laboratories that work on Pune samples. These include National Centre for Cell Sciences, (NCCS), National Institute of Virology (NIV), National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), BJ Medical College and Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER). INSACOG is a multi-laboratory, multi-agency, pan-India network to monitor genomic variations in the SARS-CoV-2 by a sentinel sequencing effort.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head of the Microbiology department at BJ Medical College said, “Looking at the threat of Omicron, RTPCR positive samples from November are being processed by targeted accelerated sequencing. Around 100 samples have been sent to NIV, 350 to IISER and NCL, 100 samples to be processed at BJMC and 100 samples to be sent to IGIB, New Delhi. These could be Delta positives and are from the Pune and Ahmednagar region alone.” The expert viewExperts also said that the specific RTPCR kits should be used for the detection of the new variant among samples. Dr Neeta Munshi who is associated with Ruby Hall said, “We have come across several articles that state that if the S-Gene is present in the detection kit then it would pick up the Omicron variant, otherwise the RTPCR kit may not be able to pick up this particular variant. However, we do not have any practical experience on the same as of yet.” Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former chief of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), now part of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) scientific advisory group, said, “The S gene drop out gives us a fairly good indication that whether it is a new variant or an alpha variant that comes sform alpha lineage. So one has to look at using kits like Taqpath, which would be useful in reducing unnecessary load on genomic sequencing. In current genomic sequencing the delta variant continues to be a predominant variant which is there in India and even if we do more genomic sequencing it may not yield in more samples and so we need to have a smart strategy.” Ministry of health and family welfare issues guidelines for travellersOn Monday the central ministry of health and family welfare issued a set of guidelines with regards to international travellers and the new variant of concern, Omicron, with which it directed states/UTs to proactively ensure testing as per guidelines and to send positive samples for Whole Genome Sequencing. “They should also proactively liaise with other States/UTs to ensure effective follow-up of international travellers after disembarking. All passengers from ‘At-Risk’ countries are mandated to be subjected to RT-PCR testing upon arrival. Random RT-PCR testing must also be done for passengers from all other countries,” the directive stated.“The individuals turning positive must be managed at separate isolation facilities as per guidelines, and the results must be sent expeditiously for Whole Genome Sequencing. The contacts of positive travellers must be kept under institutional/home quarantine and must be strictly monitored by the States/UTs. The untested passengers and those turning RT-PCR negative must be followed up by the State Surveillance Units on Day 2 and Day 5, and their RT-PCR test must be conducted, if found symptomatic. They should ensure that every international traveller from these “At-Risk” countries is accounted for, tested, and positive samples sent promptly for Whole Genome Sequencing to designated INSACOG Genome sequencing Laboratories (IGSLs). The sentinel and surge surveillance through the Sentinel Surveillance Sites established in the States/UTs must also be carried out as per INSACOG Guidelines, to ensure that all such positive samples are sent expeditiously for Whole Genome Sequencing,” the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sarscov2-genomics-consortium-has-5-pune-labs-tracking-omicron-101638212008739.html
30-11-2021||Delhi||Jal Board did not provide accounts for audit, CAG informs Delhi HC||The Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG) informed the Delhi high court last month that the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) did not provide its accounts for audit despite several written correspondences.The CAG filed the affidavit in response to a plea by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Harish Khurana seeking direction to CAG to audit the DJB’s accounts, alleging there has not been an audit in the last six years.In the affidavit, filed before a bench comprising chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, CAG said that there was no negligence on their part as DJB did not provide them with their accounts in the first place.“The office made several correspondences seeking accounts for audit from Delhi Jal Board and higher authorities of Delhi government. That as the accounts were not made available for audit, the audit could not be accomplished,” the central auditing body said.CAG said that during the last six years, seven pending accounts prior to the financial year 2015-16 were audited but the rest of the accounts were not made available to them.“That as the accounts were not made available for audit, the audit could not be accomplished. On making available the accounts of Delhi Jal Board, the answering respondent (CAG) undertakes to conclude the Audit of Delhi Jal Board as expeditiously as possible,” CAG said.Meanwhile, DJB also filed a response, saying that Khurana’s plea was “politically motivated”. It said that all accounts of the DJB were maintained “diligently”.DJB said that the final accounts and balance sheet up to the year 2014-15 were audited by the CAG, based on which the final accounts and balance sheet of the year 2015-16 was prepared as well. It was scheduled to be placed before the board at the next board meeting for confirmation before being forwarded to the office of the principal accountant general (audit) for the audit.“Consequently, as the accounts for 2014-15 have recently been audited by the CAG in August 2021, the accounts for 2015-16 incorporating the inputs from audited accounts of 2014-15 have been revised and finalised... However, it is inaccurate to state that accounts have not been maintained by the Respondent No. 2 (DJB), inasmuch as all accounts are being maintained by them as required by law till date, and only require finalisation in terms of the audited accounts of the previous year before being submitted for audit,” the DJB’s response read.Questioning the maintainability of the plea, DJB alleged that the Khurana filed the petition based on RTIs filed by a third party.The matter was listed on Monday, but could not be heard as the judge was on leave.Khurana’s petition said that in response to RTIs dated May 11, May 24, and July 22 this year, it was clearly stated that the copy of the balance sheet for the year 2015-16 and onward is under preparation.The plea said since the authorities have failed to perform the functions laid down under the law, the petitioner was approaching the court with the petition.“It is mandatory to maintain financial accounts and conduct an annual audit of the accounts, in order to ascertain effective functioning of the state and local bodies. Maintaining financial accounts and conducting an annual audit of the accounts help to secure accountability, transparency of the state and local bodies functioning towards the general public,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jal-board-did-not-provide-accounts-for-audit-cag-informs-delhi-hc-101638211889859.html
30-11-2021||Pune||PMC stops payment of staff from merged villages, Ajit Pawar orders probe||PUNE: Following allegations of bogus recruitment, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has stopped paying salaries of employees working at the 23 merged villages since the past six months amid a probe launched by the state government. The Pune zilla parishad (ZP) had submitted a list of 926 employees working in these merged villages before withdrawing the list. Later, it submitted a list of 1,130 employees, raising suspicion that some of the recruitments were done post government decision to merge villages into PMC in December 2013. On Saturday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said he has ordered to scrutinise all the recruitments made post the merger decision. “I have received feedback from the zilla parishad chief executive officer (CEO) that some recruitments were done post-merger decision in anticipation that they will henceforth be employees of PMC. I have ordered probe into this,” said Pawar. There were allegations made that as the villages were set to be merged in the PMC, additional people were recruited for various posts under political pressure during the transition period. Some elected members Siddharth Dhende, Baburao Chandere, Amol Balwadkar and Deepali Dhumal raised the issue of recruitment in these villages at the eleventh hour and demanded inquiry at PMC level. However, some members are in favour of restoring salaries to the staff since six months have passed. The elected members from PMC said that it is true that the payments should not be stopped for long period but at the same time PMC need to take care of bogus employees. PMC estate department head Rajendra Muthe said, “Zilla parishad had given the list and later withdraws it. All of a sudden, employees number increased and even the second list was withdrawn. If PMC did not get details, it is getting difficult to do payments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-stops-payment-of-staff-from-merged-villages-ajit-pawar-orders-probe-101638211888622.html
30-11-2021||Pune||Pune administration fully prepared to fight third Covid wave in light of Omicron variant||PUNE: Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on Monday said that the administration is fully prepared to fight the third wave if it comes in light of the newly confirmed Omicron variant of Covid-19. During a virtual interaction with officials and citizens’ groups, Rao said that the administration has adequate oxygen and drugs but given that the new variant has a transmissibility rate of about 500 to 600 times that of the delta variant, it could be really challenging for the administration to cope up with the needs and so, prevention is the only cure.“In the past few months, we have trained over 5,000 medical and paramedical staff and if required, the contractual staff would be re-hired based on our requirements. The State Disaster Relief Fund will also pitch in as we have already discussed about it with the state government. We are definitely in a better position with regards to oxygen and drugs than we were in April but since the R-Naught factor of the new variant is 1.93 which is much higher than any variant, we must prevent the infection,” he said. Rao said that the same strategy will be adopted to deal with the new variant if at all it enters the country however it is important to shed the fatigue that has crept into the machinery after working for close to two years. “The task may sound repetitive but that is the key. We have successfully faced three variants and then we hoped that life had returned to complete normalcy to the extent that we decided to restart schools from December 1.”Rao also said that the administration is conducting audit for all Covid-19 centres, including fire and electrical audits. With regards to the Jumbo centre, the administration has decided to continue paying the rent and hold the structure, he said. They will wait for a month and then take a call, he added. “Although we have put a ban on a few flights and even chalked out a strategy to screen international passengers, it is likely that the variant will enter India,” he warned.Rao added that along with ensuring that Pune city and rural are self-sufficient in terms of demand during the second wave, the administration has also ensured that Covid-19 facilities in the neighbouring districts of Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur and Sangli are sufficient in the event the third wave hits us hard.Dr R Gangakhedkar, former ICMR chief who was part of the meeting, said, “Although the new variant is highly transmissible, we do not know if it might lead to more hospitalisation or more deaths and so, we should not panic because panic could be counter-productive. There will surely be an outbreak due to the new variant because we must remember that despite the most effective lockdown before the first wave which also got a great response from the people, we could not prevent the outbreak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-administration-fully-prepared-to-fight-third-covid-wave-in-light-of-omicron-variant-101638211770248.html

30-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC praises authorities for steps to free up trees of concrete in the city||The Delhi high court on Monday praised the authorities’ efforts to deconcretise trees in various parts of the Capital, saying that the efforts need to continue.“This is good work...You have definitely done a lot of good work. It is evident…See it is done continuously. Good work by everybody…I was wondering whether you would do it or not because the order was not uploaded,” justice Waziri said.While hearing a plea by a resident of Vasant Vihar against the concretisation of trees, the court perused the photos of the work to deconcretise trees the South Delhi Municipal (SDMC) provided.On Friday, the court had come down heavily on the authorities on the concretisation of trees and rampant construction in the national Capital. It said that these activities were changing neighbourhoods and making people feel like aliens in their own environment. It was the “worst kind of human rights abuse”, the judge had said.The court noted that trees have also been deconcretised in Lajpat Nagar and said, “Kitne logon ki duayen lagi hogi aapko…[a lot of people would have blessed you].”HT reported in December last year that of the total 4,993 trees on the streets of Vasant Vihar, 3,859 were heavily concretised. A tree census conducted by local residents showed over 450 trees had nails, tree guards, barbed wires etc. in or around them, 764 trees were lopped off and at least 793 trees were infested with termites. Based on HT’s report a complaint was filed with the Delhi forest department by environmental activists, and a petition was also filed at the Delhi high court. The report has also been quoted in the petition.The court also cited the example of Singapore and said that it is called a “garden city” because there is continuous monitoring of green patches there.“Do you know why Singapore is known as the garden city? In that city, the gardeners reach at 4am and continue their work till 7am. Then from 8am, another group comes and maintains the lawns and gardens, till the traffic increases. Then again at 11am-12pm when there is no traffic, the gardeners come back. It is monitored throughout the day. That’s how the city looks beautiful and attracts people,” the judge said.Justice Waziri also cited the example of Mumbai’s Lower Parel area where pavements are being re-done to encourage more citizens to come out and walk.During the proceedings, the judge also asked residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to help maintain trees and gardens around residential colonies.“Encourage the citizens’ participation…They will be happy to help,” the court said.A detailed order in the matter is yet to be uploaded on the website of the Delhi high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-praises-authorities-for-steps-to-free-up-trees-of-concrete-in-the-city-101638211648734.html

30-11-2021||Chandigarh||GADVASU to organise drive to promote consumption of fish||The College of Fisheries (CoF), Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, will conduct a fish consumption awareness drive throughout December. Various activities including a fish food festival and competitions including poster making and slogan writing will be organised, which will see active participation from students of the varsity.India is the second largest aquaculture producer in the world. However, fish-eating population in the country is estimated to be only 55%, with an average annual per capita fish consumption (PCFC) of about 9kg, which is less than half of the world average (20kg).Among Indian states, Tripura tops in terms of PCFC (29kg), while it is more than 50 kg in islands like Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep.Meera D Ansal, dean of CoF, GADVASU, said that PCFC is very less in the north-western region of the country. It is only 0.4 kg in Punjab and lowest in Rajasthan (0.01 kg), against the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended PCFC of 12 kg.She also highlighted the nutrition values of fish including protein content/quality, easy digestibility, omega-3 Poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), minerals (calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, iodine, potassium and magnesium) and vitamins (A, D, B2 and E).Fish is well known for its functional properties boosting immunity, vision and heart health, with significant role in brain development in growing children. Unlike coastal states, the non-vegetarian population of Punjab prefers to eat chicken, chevon/mutton, pork etc. and nevertheless, most of its small fish-eating population prefers to eat spineless fish. Applauding the initiative, Inderjeet Singh, vice-chancellor of GADVASU, said that Punjab with its total fish production of 1.5 lakh tones, has resources to easily double its production and offer annual per capita fish availability of 10 kg to the existing estimated population of about 3 crores. The fisheries sector presents enormous socio-economic growth in terms of food, nutritional security, livelihood, employment opportunities and revenue generation, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gadasu-to-organise-drive-to-promote-consumption-of-fish-101638211413286.html
30-11-2021||Delhi||Ration delivery beneficiaries can opt out at any point, Delhi govt tells HC||The state government on Monday told the Delhi high court that doorstep deliveries had become a norm as it defended its ration delivery programme and said that the scheme should be appreciated, even as it assured that beneficiaries could opt out at any time.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said that states like Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, as well as cities like Bengaluru in Karnataka have in place identical doorstep delivery schemes.Everything has been home delivered over the past years, Singhvi said.“It is a complete misconception or [has been] wrongly implied that fair price shops (FPS) will cease to exist. Doorstep delivery is an optional scheme and beneficiaries can opt out anytime. This is nothing but proxy litigation set up by somebody else who is not the petitioner,” he said.The scheme has become another flashpoint between the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government and the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, with the former saying that the plan violates the provisions of National Food Security Act (NFSA) and will deprive migrants of foodgrains, and the latter pointing out that it will root out the ration mafia and ensure that all beneficiaries get their ration.He said the Delhi high court did not stay the programme, despite which the Lieutenant Governor (LG) has stalled the scheme, citing the pending litigation. He further contended that not a single beneficiary has questioned the mode and manner of implementation of the scheme.The Lieutenant Governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.The Delhi government is contesting a petition by the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh, a group of FPS owners, in which they have challenged the doorstep ration delivery scheme and demanded that it should be declared ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power or authority).Arguments will continue on December 3.During the proceedings, the bench said that the fair price shops (FPS) should not be ousted from the system with the implementation of the scheme.“The Centre’s submission is that FPS is an integral part of the NFSA, therefore, you cannot do away with that,” the bench said.During the hearing, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, representing the Centre, said the court should not allow any state to interfere with the structure of NFSA and destroy its architecture.“As Union of India, we are only concerned with complete compliance of NFSA,” she submitted.On November 15, the Supreme Court declined to entertain two separate petitions (one by the Centre and another by FPS owners) against a Delhi high court interim order on September 27 that allowed the AAP government to stop supplying foodgrain to fixed price shops for patrons who have chosen doorstep delivery over physical collection of ration.The high court verdict also effectively gave a go-ahead to the state government scheme.The apex court said since the high court verdict was interim, and the court was still seized of the matter, it would not like to entertain the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ration-delivery-beneficiaries-can-opt-out-at-any-point-delhi-govt-tells-hc-101638211408635.html

30-11-2021||Delhi||AAP councillors escorted out for disrupting EDMC special house meeting||A special House meeting of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on the pollution crisis in the city was disrupted after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillors, demanding revocation of the suspension of their fellow party councillors, hurled bangles at the mayor’s chair on Monday. The discussion proceeded after the 13 AAP councillors, including the four women leaders who threw the bangles, were escorted out.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal said that AAP councillors were trying to disrupt the discussion. “Since they were not ready to listen anything about the failures of the Kejriwal-led Delhi government in tackling the pollution menace, the women councillors tried to disrupt the house by merely raising slogans. They even reached to the seats of the BJP councillors and tried to scuffle with them in the well. Later, the police came in the house and took them away. After that, our 21 councillors discussed the action plan to control pollution in the EDMC area,” he said. Fifteen AAP councillors were suspended on November 17 by the mayor after they allegedly disrupted a House session, seeking a discussion on rising dengue cases in the city even as the BJP councillors wanted to start off with the pollution crisis.On Monday, the four AAP councillors, who were escorted out of the House, staged a protest outside even as the session continued and the BJP councillors accused the Delhi government of intentionally turning their back towards rising pollution levels in the national capital.Agarwal said that the EDMC, with its 10 mechanical sweeping machines and 40 water sprinklers, is doing its best to control the pollution. “While the AAP councillors are trying to disrupt our pollution controlling exercises, the Delhi government is deliberately holding the EDMC’s legitimate funds. As a result of this fund crunch, we are facing difficulty in giving timely salaries to our employees,” he said. AAP councillor and leader of opposition in the EDMC, Manoj Tyagi, said that all four AAP women councillors, led by Geeta Rawat, were demanding revocation of the suspension of AAP councillors. “They were also demanding the immediate suspension of a BJP councillor who had used ‘unparliamentary’ words against the women councillors from our party. When the requests made by the women councillors fell on deaf ears of the mayor, Rawat had no option other than to hurl bangles towards the mayor’s chair, as a token of protest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-councillors-escorted-out-for-disrupting-edmc-special-house-meeting-101638211112604.html

Crime rate in Delhi will increase because of these liquor shops and incidents of rape will also rise. Along with this, it will also ruin the lives of the youth who could get addicted to alcohol. Hence, I request you to call a special session of the Delhi Assembly and initiate a discussion on the new excise policy by way of a private bill,” Dutt wrote in his letter to Kejriwal. His main demand was that liquor shops should not be opened in residential areas, which, he said, is currently happening under the new excise regime, resulting in protests from residents. A resolution to survey and verify norm compliance was passed by the general body meeting of the civic body on Thursday. Dutt had moved the private member resolution on the day. Mukesh Suryan, the mayor of the south MCD, said on Sunday that a survey of all the liquor vends will be initiated soon and the units violating norms will be sealed. The norms include payment of conversion charges and old property tax returns, completion certificates, building by-laws and licensing norms. Delhi government has exited the retail liquor business with the new excise regime kicking in from November 17. According to this policy, the liquor business is now being handled completely by private players.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/need-special-delhi-assembly-session-on-new-excise-policy-councillor-101638211111485.html

30-11-2021||Delhi||‘Delighted’: Tamil author after BJP slum outreach posters feature his photo||On a day when BJP president JP Nadda addressed its 45-day slum outreach campaign, Jhuggi Samman Yatra, in the city, the party’s Delhi unit was red-faced on Monday after posters put up for the drive featured noted Tamil author Perumal Murugan along with other slum residents.Quoting a HT report, Murugan posted in Tamil on his Facebook page: “I’m one among those living in the slums. Delighted.” Senior Delhi BJP party leaders refused to comment on the matter.Meanwhile, addressing the drive in Patel Nagar, Nadda accused Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of indulging in petty politics even during the Covid-19 pandemic, claiming that he took a U-turn on vaccine procurement and misled people on the oxygen crisis in the Capital.“Kejriwal used to say that he will procure the vaccine and asked the Centre for permission again and again. But when the permission was given, he took a U-turn within 10 days and asked the Centre to provide it, and that too free of cost,” said Nadda, adding that the CM also presented wrong facts about the oxygen crisis.Hoping for a fourth term in the corporations, BJP is eyeing the support of slum clusters, which is considered an AAP stronghold, to ward off anti-incumbency. The Jhuggi Samman Yatra, which started from October 15, is focused on highlighting the Centre’s pro-poor schemes and Delhi government’s failures. The BJP president also said that the CM took credit for giving free ration to people, pointing out that it was actually provided by the Centre.He also lashed out at Kejriwal for depriving people of the benefits of the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat scheme, which promises free healthcare benefits to the poor.Praising BJP leaders for helping people during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic, Nadda said, “When other parties went into hibernation, BJP leaders and workers were out on the streets helping people with food, transportation etc. Other party leaders were active only on social media.”Nadda asked people to vote for the BJP in the upcoming elections and said that the AAP-led Delhi government has failed to deliver on its promises. “They promised to end the tanker mafia but the number of tankers has doubled during their tenure. And you all know about the quality of water,” he said.Delhi BJP Adesh Gupta said that they have got tremendous response from residents during the yatras. “The Kejriwal government has failed to deliver on its promises and, despite having funds, they have done little to improve the quality of life of people living in slum clusters,” he said.The Delhi BJP now plans to start a similar outreach campaign in unauthorised colonies and rural villages.AAP spokespersons did not respond to questions seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delighted-tamil-author-after-bjp-slum-outreach-posters-feature-his-photo-101638210868614.html

The positive report was communicated to the family on Saturday.Dr Sharma said the laboratory informed the administration about the positive status on Sunday afternoon. When local officials tried to contact the family at their local address for contact tracing, it turned out that they had already the country.The family, which lives in the United States, came to India about a fortnight ago to meet relatives. They also travelled to Vaishno Devi temple in Jammu and Kashmir and Bikaner district in Rajasthan.Dr Sharma said they have informed the state government’s health directorate about the case and are collecting more details about the family’s departure.Dr Sharma said health officials were told by the family’s relatives in Jaipur that the Delhi doctor certified that the children did not show any symptoms.The local health authorities have not, however, been able to access the certificate issued by the doctor. Or the circumstances under which airport authorities seem to have allowed the family to board the flight.According to the US Centres for disease control and prevention, air passengers older than 2 years need to have tested negative Covid-19 within 72 hours of departure of their flight if the passengers are fully vaccinated. For those who haven’t received both vaccine doses, this time period is 24 hours before a flight.There is also an option for passengers to produce documentation that they have recovered from Covid-19 in the last 90 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-probes-how-2-kids-flew-to-us-with-parents-after-covid-ve-report-101638196227618.html

30-11-2021||World||Germany moves toward mandatory Covid-19 shots as Europe clamps down||Germany took a step closer toward making Covid-19 vaccinations compulsory as the incoming chancellor threw his support behind the move, part of a tougher line by European leaders as the pandemic spirals out of control.Olaf Scholz called for a parliamentary vote on the step before the end of the year, saying on Tuesday that he would allow lawmakers to make the decision.“My recommendation is that we don’t do this as a government, because it’s an issue of conscience,” he said on Tuesday in an online interview with the Bild newspaper.Scholz and outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel met with state premiers to discuss the country’s outbreak. While the measure wasn’t approved at the talks, there’s a growing consensus across the political spectrum that shots will have to be required.“Almost all are in agreement that we’re moving forward on the issue of general mandatory vaccination,” Markus Soeder, the conservative premier of Bavaria, said after a meeting with Merkel, Scholz and other state leaders. A vaccine mandate would be a major departure for the new administration after German leaders vowed for months that it would let citizens to decide if they wanted to take up the government’s offer to get inoculated. The soft tone may have contributed to the country’s relatively low vaccination rate of less than 70%.Scholz, Merkel and the heads of Germany’s 16 states discussed a number of proposals to impose new curbs, including restrictions on unvaccinated people, limiting fans at soccer games and closing bars and nightclubs in hard-hit areas. They will meet again on Thursday to make final decisions. “There is agreement that the fourth wave of the pandemic has led to an extremely serious -- and in some regions dramatic -- situation in our health system,” Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “The federal and state governments will respond together and in resolute fashion.” The latest surge in infections appears to have caught German authorities by surprise, and the transition to a new administration under Social Democrat Scholz has complicated pandemic coordination in Europe’s largest economy. States led by Merkel’s conservative bloc, which is moving into opposition, also called for the new government to prepare for mandatory vaccinations, as well as hard contact restrictions for unvaccinated people, reduced capacity for large events and the shuttering of clubs, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.Pressure has been growing ahead of the change in power and the gathering allowed the politicians to address a Constitutional Court ruling on Tuesday, which rejected challenges to measures such as nighttime curfews and closing schools. The decision could give leaders additional legal backing for a new round of tougher restrictions, but they’re unlikely to impose a widespread lockdown.Alongside possible new measures in Germany, Norway extended quarantine rules for people testing positive for Covid, while Greece made Covid vaccines compulsory for people above 60, including a monthly fine of 100 euros ($114) a month for those who don’t comply. Switzerland and Finland also are considering tighter curbs to clamp down on public contact. France is also bracing for a worsening outbreak. The country reported 47,000 new infections in the last 24 hours, the highest daily level since April. Health Minister Olivier Veran said during government questions in the National Assembly that by the end of this week daily cases could exceed the peak of the third wave of the virus eight months ago.Authorities have been on high alert as the omicron variant spreads. The Dutch national health service confirmed that the strain, first identified in South Africa, was in the Netherlands a earlier than first thought after detecting two cases in test samples taken a week ago. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has compiled reports of 44 cases of omicron in 11 European countries. So far, those cases have all been recorded with minor symptoms or they’re asymptomatic.The European Medicines Agency said it would use expedited procedures to approve new versions of Covid vaccines to address omicron if the current ones provide insufficient protection. That would mean regulatory approval could be completed in three to four months after companies move forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-moves-toward-mandatory-covid-19-shots-as-europe-clamps-down-101638289948723.html

Previously they had been able to take a lateral flow test and there was no requirement to isolate.The reintroduction of mandatory face masks brings England closer in line with the rest of the UK — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — which had not relaxed coronavirus restrictions as much as England had done since the summer.About 14 cases of the omicron variant have so far been identified across the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new measures will “buy us time in the face” of the new variant.Johnson’s government announced Monday it is expanding its booster vaccine program, with a booster dose to be offered to all those over 18 years old three months after people had their second jab.Up until now, only people 40 years old or over and those deemed clinically vulnerable were eligible for the booster shot.The change in advice means around 13 million more people will be eligible for the vaccine. So far, the UK has given around 17.8 million booster shots.Johnson is expected to encourage more to take up the booster shots in a press conference later Tuesday.Jenny Harries, who heads the UK Health Security Agency, said that while there was still uncertainty in understanding the omicron variant, officials hope that the expansion of the booster shot rollout will “to some extent counter the potential drop in vaccine effectiveness we might find with this variant.”She also urged people to be cautious and reduce socializing over the festive season if possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/face-masks-again-mandatory-in-england-amid-omicron-variant-spread-101638279648528.html
30-11-2021||World||Taliban executed, forcibly disappeared over 100 ex-security personnel: Report||NEW DELHI: The Taliban have summarily executed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former police and intelligence officers in just four of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces since taking over the country on August 15, according to a report released by Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Tuesday. Rezaul H LaskarThe Taliban, through their intelligence operations and access to records left behind by the Ashraf Ghani government, have also identified new targets for arrest and execution despite proclaiming an amnesty, the report said.The Taliban leadership directed members of surrendering Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) units to register with them to receive a letter guaranteeing their safety. Individuals who registered were screened for ties to military, police, militia and special forces units or to commanders or former provincial authorities. The report said these screenings were used by the Taliban to detain and summarily execute or disappear individuals within days of registration.The 25-page report, “No forgiveness for people like you – Executions and enforced disappearances in Afghanistan under the Taliban,” provided evidence of the killing or disappearance of 47 former members of ANSF who surrendered or were apprehended by the Taliban between August 15 and October 31.HRW said it gathered credible information on more than 100 killings from Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar and Kunduz – four of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. The executions have generated fear among former officials and others who believed the Taliban takeover would lead to an end to “revenge attacks”.“The Taliban leadership’s promised amnesty has not stopped local commanders from summarily executing or disappearing former Afghan security force members,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at HRW. “The burden is on the Taliban to prevent further killings, hold those responsible to account, and compensate the victims’ families.”In just one example in the southern city of Kandahar in late September, Taliban forces went to the home of Baz Muhammad, who was employed by the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the former spy agency, and arrested him. Relatives later found his body.HRW said the Taliban carried out “abusive search operations, including night raids, to apprehend and, at times, forcibly disappear suspected former officials”.“Taliban night raids are terrifying,” an unnamed civil society activist from Helmand province told HRW. “They are conducted on the pretext of disarming ex-security forces who have not surrendered weapons. Those that ‘disappear’ are [victims] of night raids...The families can’t even ask where [the person has been taken].”During such searches, the Taliban threaten and abuse family members to make them reveal whereabouts of those in hiding. Some of those eventually apprehended were executed or taken into custody without acknowledgment that they are being held.In Nangarhar province, the Taliban targeted people they accuse of supporting the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP). As the UN has reported, Taliban operations against ISKP “rely heavily on extra-judicial detentions and killings”. Many of those killed were targeted because of Salafist views or tribal affiliations.HRW’s findings are largely in line with reports from journalists and former government officials in recent months. Several former officials, both from the security forces and civilian administration, have spoken of Taliban fighters visiting their homes and carrying out searches. In several instances confirmed by people familiar with the matter, the Taliban have threatened or coerced parents and relatives of the former officials to ascertain their whereabouts.On September 21, the Taliban announced the establishment of a commission to investigate reports of human rights abuses, corruption and other crimes. The commission has not announced any investigation into the reported killings, though it reported action against several Taliban members for stealing and corruption.In a response to HRW on November 21, the Taliban said it dismissed those responsible for abuses but provided no information to corroborate this claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-executed-forcibly-disappeared-over-100-ex-security-personnel-report-101638278553293.html

I am amazed by his survival skills," a coastguard official told AFP, declining to be identified.Dramatic footage released by the coastguard showed a team approaching him by boat calling out: "We are coming! Just a little bit longer!

Matsuno did not identify his nationality, citing privacy reasons.A genome analysis at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases confirmed Tuesday that he was infected with the new variant, which was first identified in South Africa.His travel companions and passengers in nearby seats have been identified and have been reported to Japanese health authorities for follow up. Japanese media said two of the patient’s relatives tested negative and have been quarantined in a government facility near Narita airport.Matsuno said the government will maintain strict border controls and will step up its capacity to conduct genome analyses of the new variant.Japan announced on Monday that it will ban all foreign visitors beginning Tuesday as an emergency precaution against the variant, tentatively through the end of the year. The government is also requiring Japanese nationals and foreigners with resident permits to quarantine 14 days following entry.The World Health Organization warned Monday that the global risk from the omicron variant is “very high” based on the early evidence, saying it could lead to surges with “severe consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-confirms-first-case-of-omicron-variant-patient-hospitalised-govt-101638260927914.html

I just don't know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I've talked to . . . are like 'this is not going to be good'," Bancel said.Moderna did not reply to a Reuters' request for comment on the interview and on when it expects to have data on the effectiveness of its vaccine against Omicron, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says carries a "very high" risk of infection surges.Bancel had earlier said on CNBC  that there should be more clarity on the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines against Omicron in about two weeks, and that it could take months to begin shipping a vaccine that work against the new variant.The WHO and scientists have also said it could take days to several weeks to understand the level of severity of the variant and its potential to escape protection against immunity induced by vaccines."Vaccination will likely still keep you out of the hospital," said John Wherry, director of the Penn Institute for Immunology in Philadelphia.The uncertainty about the new variant has triggered global alarm, with border closures casting a shadow over a nascent economic recovery from a two-year pandemic.News of its emergence wiped roughly $2 trillion off the value of global stocks on Friday, but some calm was restored this week as investors waited for more data on Omicron.Remarks by President Joe Biden that the United States would not reinstate lockdowns had also helped soothe markets before comments from the Moderna CEO spooked investors.Biden has called for wider vaccination, while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged everyone aged 18 years and older to get a booster shot. Britain too has expanded its Covid-19 booster programme amid Omicron fears.First reported on Nov. 24 from South Africa, Omicron has since spread to over a dozen countries. Japan, the world's third-largest economy, has confirmed its first case.HONG KONG EXPANDS CURBSCountries around the world have moved quickly to tighten border controls to prevent a recurrence of last year's strict lockdowns and steep economic downturns.Hong Kong has expanded a ban on entry for non-residents from several countries. It said non-residents from Angola, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zambia would not be allowed to enter as of Nov. 30.Additionally, it said non-residents who have been to Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel and Italy in the past 21 days would not be allowed to enter the city from Dec. 2.The global financial hub, among the last places pursuing a zero-Covid strategy, has already banned non-residents arriving from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe.In Australia, five travellers tested positive for Omicron.Singapore's health ministry said two travellers from Johannesburg who tested positive for the variant in Sydney had transited through its Changi airport.Australian authorities have also identified a sixth traveller who was most likely infected with the variant and had spent time in the community.Canberra delayed on Monday the reopening of the nation's borders for international students and skilled migrants, less than 36 hours before they were due to be allowed back in."We're doing this out of an abundance of caution but our overwhelming view is that whilst (Omicron) is an emerging variant, it is a manageable variant," Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said.The global curbs on travellers from southern Africa also raised concerns about vaccine inequality."The people of Africa cannot be blamed for the immorally low level of vaccinations available in Africa – and they should not be penalized for identifying and sharing crucial science and health information with the world," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.India, home to the world's largest vaccine maker, has approved supplies of Covid-19 vaccines to many African countries and said it stands ready to "expeditiously" send more. China too has pledged 1 billion doses to the continent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-less-effective-against-omicron-variant-moderna-ceo-101638259402208.html

So far, of the vaccines used in India, only Covishield, the version of the Astra Zeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) had been approved for travel purposes.Health Canada said on Monday that the country will “expand its list of accepted vaccines for the purposes of entry into Canada and exemption from some testing and quarantine requirements. The list will include Sinopharm, Sinovac and COVAXIN, matching the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL).”Even as this measure comes into effect, India and Canada continue discussions over reciprocal recognition of vaccine certificates. Indian officials have also expressed their continued concern over the “bottleneck” created by restrictive testing measures imposed by Canada, where only a negative RT-PCR result from a test conducted at a single laboratory at Delhi airport within 18 hours of boarding the flight is accepted for travel to the country.Those considered fully vaccinated will also be able to avail of other exemptions including not being subject to testing on arrival, a mandatory 14-day quarantine period including another Covid-19 test on the eighth day.To be considered fully vaccinates, the individual must have had their second dose of the vaccine series at least 14 days prior to entry into Canada.These relaxed measures go into place even as countries including Canada reassess their travel regimen due to concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Canada has already imposed a ban on foreign national from seven southern African nations from entering the country, with exemptions for Canadian citizens and permanent residents.As for Covaxin, provinces like Ontario, Canada’s most populous, are also issuing the standardised vaccine certificate, if those who have received two doses of the jab take a third dose of an mRNA vaccine in Canada.Health Canada is also examining an emergency use authorization for Covaxin, though a decision in that regard isn’t imminent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-begins-entry-for-travellers-vaccinated-with-covaxin-101638257852094.html

But Agrawal has shut those targeting him, including some Republicans in the United States.Also Read | Who is Parag Agrawal, the new CEO of Twitter?The tweet at the centre of the controversy was posted by Agrawal in 2010, when he was not even an employee of Twitter. It quoted a comedian mocking racism and Islamophobia in America.“If they are not gonna make a distinction between Muslims and extremists, then why should I distinguish between white people and racists,” Agrawal said in the tweet posted on October 26, 2010."If they are not gonna make a distinction between muslims and extremists, then why should I distinguish between white people and racists."Picking up on this, Ken Buck, a Republican who represents Colorado’s fourth Congressional district, questioned how users can trust the new CEO of Twitter to treat everyone equally given his views.Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee chipped in: “This is Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s new CEO and the person who’s going to be deciding what kind of speech is allowed on Twitter.”Agrawal had, however, clarified to a user shortly after posting the tweet that he was quoting comedian Aasif Mandvi from The Daily Show.@Joylita I was quoting Asif Mandvi from The Daily Show. The article you are reading seems too deep for my current mental state.“I am amused by people that pass judgement on people for passing judgement. I was attempting to do the same to amuse myself,” he had said in a subsequent tweet.The latest row started after a right-wing website Breitbart picked up the tweet on Monday and inferred that Agrawal supported racism. It also reproduced an old interview given by the new Twitter CEO to MIT Technology Review, and claimed that free speech was not the focus of the company.However, other users have defended Agrawal, including Andrew Kaczynski, a reporter with CNN. He posted the original clip of Mandvi’s interview which shows the comedian indeed made those remarks.This tweet which is currently going viral among the right from Twitter's new CEO is him quoting a Daily Show segment that aired that night about stereotypes.It's a joke about absurd stereotypes, not a factual statement. https://t.co/hhIdXTSiOHhttps://t.co/9bFtGrfExWThe 37-year-old was named the CEO of Twitter by Jack Dorsey, who stepped down after 16 years at the company that he co-founded and helmed.

We have a lot of tools at our disposal and we will act and react according to when the data and the science come in and we will make our appropriate moves according to that,” the top US immunologist said referring to Biden’s address to his country.Biden urged Americans to not panic about the variant and reiterated that full vaccination and boosters were the “best protection” against the disease. He especially insisted on the booster doses.Also read | US company says its Covid test accurately detects omicron variant. Here’s how“Most Americans are fully vaccinated but not yet boosted. If you are 18 years or over and got fully vaccinated before June the 1st, go get the booster shot today. A fully vaccinated boosted person is the most protected against Covid.”Stressing this point, Fauci also said that boosters bolstered the protection offered by the vaccines against “any variant” of the disease. “The president encouraged people to get vaccinated and those who are vaccinated to get their booster shot because that will bring up the level of protection against any variant, the way we have seen, just the way it did with Delta,” he added.Biden also assured that the US government would accelerate the development and deployment of updated vaccines or boosters for the omicron variant, in the event it is needed. He also urged the people to continue wearing masks when indoors or in public settings.“I want to reiterate: Dr Fauci believes that the current vaccines provide at least some protection against the new variant and the boosters strengthen that protection significantly,” he said during his address.Also, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), the country’s public health agency, has now recommended a booster for all adults (people above 18 years of age). Earlier, it approved boosters for all adults but recommended it only for those above 50 years of age, but has now expanded its advisory in view of the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-immunologist-anthony-fauci-echoes-joe-biden-on-boosters-panic-around-omicron-variant-101638243176644.html

Both had tested negative for Covid-19 prior to departure, it added.The ministry said most of the travellers had remained in the transit area at Changi Airport. Of the seven who disembarked, six had been placed on a 10-day stay at home notice, while the seventh, a close contact of an infected individual on the flight, had been quarantined."Contact tracing is ongoing for airport staff who may have come into transient contact with the cases," the ministry said.Australian authorities said on Sunday that the two passengers who tested positive on arrival in Sydney were fully vaccinated and had been placed in isolation.Omicron has prompted countries across the globe including the United States to limit travel from southern Africa, where the virus was first detected. The World Health Organization said it carries a very high risk of infection surges, but said no deaths have yet been linked to the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-says-2-travellers-to-sydney-with-omicron-transited-at-changi-airport-101638239804637.html
30-11-2021||World||US company says its Covid test accurately detects omicron variant. Here’s how||A US company has said its Covid-19 diagnostic tests can accurately detect omicron, the new coronavirus variant, that has prompted several countries to impose travel bans and shut their borders.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc said in a statement on Monday its TaqPath Covid-19 assays can report accurate results even in the case where one of the gene targets is impacted by a mutation."This assay can be used not only to successfully detect Covid-19 but… it can also be used as a proxy for the variant," Mark Stevenson, chief operating officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific, said in an interview, according to Reuters.This is the only Covid-19 test that is both authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration and can be used to indicate if a case is caused by the omicron variant, Stevenson said.Also read | From Pfizer to Moderna: What vaccine makers are saying about omicron jabsStevenson said test samples must still be sent to a lab for sequencing to confirm that the case was caused by omicron and not another variant with similar features, such as alpha.He added that Thermo is prepared to increase its production of tests to meet demand from countries in Africa and elsewhere as they work to track the spread of the new variant.Also read | No fatalities linked to new variant but WHO cautiousOnly Thermo Fisher has so far confirmed that its test can be used to help identify the omicron variant. Other Covid-19 tests, including from Roche Holding AG and Abbott Laboratories, can also be used to diagnose positive cases caused by the variant.The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the omicron variant, which was first detected in southern Africa, as a SARS-CoV-2 "variant of concern" last week and said it may spread more quickly than other forms.Omicron has now been confirmed in Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Britain, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-company-says-its-covid-test-accurately-detects-omicron-variant-here-s-how-101638234998877.html
30-11-2021||World||From Pfizer to Moderna: What vaccine makers are saying about omicron jabs||Omicron poses a "very high" risk globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned even as the new variant of the coronavirus has raised concerns around the world, with countries implementing travel bans and researchers racing to study whether it will evade vaccines. As omicron cases are being reported throughout the world, vaccine makers have said they are working on jabs that could tackle the new strain.PfizerThe US drugmaker's CEO Albert Bourla has said Pfizer has already started working on a version of its Covid-19 vaccine specifically targeting the new Omicron variant in case the current inoculation is not effective against the latest strain.Bourla told CNBC that his company on Friday began testing the current vaccine against the Omicron variant, which was first reported in South Africa and has reignited fears of a global wave of Covid-19 infections.Also read | US CDC says all adults should get Covid-19 booster shots"I don't think the result will be the vaccines don't protect," Bourla said. But the testing could show that existing shots "protect less," which would mean "that we need to create a new vaccine," Bourla said.Bourla said he was also "very confident" that Pfizer's recently unveiled antiviral pill would work as a treatment for infections caused by the mutations, including Omicron.ModernaModerna Inc, another leading Covid-19 vaccine maker, has said it was developing a booster shot against the new variant.Also read | No fatalities linked to new variant but WHO cautiousModerna chief medical officer Paul Burton said on Sunday on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show” that vaccinated people should still be protected, depending on how long ago they got their shots, and for now the best advice is to take one of the current Covid vaccines.Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson also said Monday that it is "pursuing an Omicron-specific variant vaccine and will progress it as needed."AstraZenecaThe Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company has said it is examining the impact of omicron on its vaccine and its antibody cocktail and that it was hopeful its combination drug would retain efficacy."As with any new emerging variants, we are looking into B.1.1.529 to understand more about it and the impact on the vaccine," AstraZeneca said in a statement.Also read | Covid clusters in Maharashtra, Karnataka under watch for new variantAstraZeneca said that it had developed a vaccine platform to respond quickly to new variants with Oxford University, where the vaccine was created."We are also testing our long-acting antibody combination AZD7442 against this new variant and are hopeful AZD7442 will retain efficacy since it comprises two potent antibodies with different and complementary activities against the virus," it said.Sputnik VThe Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which backs Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V's development by the state-run Gamaleya Center, the jab is effective against omicron but they were also developing an adapted booster.RDIF said that the centre "has already begun developing the new version of Sputnik vaccine adapted to Omicron."

30-11-2021||World||US CDC says all adults should get Covid-19 booster shots||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday everyone aged 18 years and older should get a booster shot, as it looks to tackle a new and highly infectious strain of the coronavirus that is quickly spreading across the globe.The update comes after President Joe Biden on Monday called for wider vaccination to curb the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, which was first detected in southern Africa.The U.S. health regulators last week expanded the eligibility for booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines to all adults aged 18 and older either six months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna vaccine doses or two months after their Johnson & Johnson shot.The CDC had, however, stopped short of saying all adults aged 18 to 49 should get the additional shots.The agency is taking a more cautious stance as Omicron's emergence further emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement on Monday.Amid the renewed emphasis, Pfizer and partner BioNTech are expected to ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the coming days to authorize their booster shots for those aged 16 and 17 years, the Washington Post reported on Monday, citing sources.Pfizer and BioNTech did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.Omicron, which the World Health Organization said carried a very high risk for fueling infection surges, has now been confirmed in several countries including Germany, Hong Kong, South Africa and Canada.Scientists in the United States and around the world are urgently examining vaccine effectiveness related to this variant, the CDC said.The agency also said the 47 million adults who are not yet vaccinated are encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-says-all-adults-should-get-covid-19-booster-shots-101638230791928.html
30-11-2021||World||‘China started work on border villages long before LAC standoff began’||A year before China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) attempted to unilaterally alter the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh sector, Chinese authorities were putting in place measures to use border villages to buttress their territorial claims and keep an eye on the Indian side.This trend was picked up by a group of Tibetan researchers who worked for the past two years on putting together a handbook aimed at helping the world to decipher China’s policies that are often vaguely worded and open to different interpretations.As they put together material for the handbook titled “Decoding Chinese Communist Party”, to be released on December 2, the researchers came across several reports on the Chinese side’s focus on using border villages as a means to project force along the frontier.One such report in Tibetan from August 2019, circulated on Chinese instant messaging apps and websites, was on border patrols and propaganda activities at Geru village in Shigatse prefecture, bordering India’s Sikkim state.The report quoted Phurbu Sonam, deployed as the first party secretary in Geru, which is described as a “border defence village”, as saying, “These days, Geru residents have a strong consciousness that everyone is a spy and every household is a spy house.”“The bond between the soldiers and the local residents is as deep as the fish and water,” Sonam added. Every Monday, permanent Chinese cadres stationed in Geru organised a ceremony at the border pillar to hoist the Chinese flag and sing the national anthem. To assist border defences forces, about 100 people from the village conducted regular border patrols on motorcycles.Tsering Tsomo, executive director of the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, which put together the handbook, said the five researchers who worked on the project picked up more such reports that pointed to China’s intentions along the LAC.The Chinese side is not only attempting to recruit Tibetans but also trying to ensure the loyalty of their communities. “This requires social engineering on a large scale, giving border communities top priority for employment and finance for enterprises, and creating villages intended to create abiding dependence and loyalty,” she said.“This handbook is a tool to help people assess the intentions of the Chinese side. Many countries haven’t devoted adequate resources to understanding China. The handbook unpacks the meanings and connotations of Chinese slogans and popular phrases. For example, ‘Xi Jinping Thought’ is several volumes long and open to interpretation,” Tsomo added.For instance, the Tibetan researchers contend that India is the clear concern of China’s new land border law enacted in October. The law, which takes effect in January, will consolidate the securitisation of China’s land borders, the researchers said.While China has land borders with 14 countries, it has unsettled boundaries only with India and Bhutan. The standoff in Ladakh that began in May 2020 has taken bilateral ties to an all-time low and India and China have been unable to disengage frontline troops despite several rounds of talks.The law has strong punitive clauses forbidding activities such as flying drones near the border, mandating military exclusion zones and authorising security agencies to open fire at anyone believed to have committed a crime. Article 53 of the law, the researchers contend, is aimed at authorising a Chinese security presence in countries in the neighbourhood.Article 11, they said, is aimed at pushing Tibetan nomads into villages in border districts and making key border prefectures, such as Shigatse and Lhoka, into zones where loyalty to China is required.Other articles establish a very different kind of long-term securitisation, which requires inhabitants of border prefectures to undertake profound culture change. This is aimed at pushing local communities such as Tibetans to drop their own identity and identify first and foremost as Chinese, the researchers believe.Tsomo said Chinese ethnic policy has “abandoned the fiction that China comprises 56 nationalities, many with territories within which regional ethnic autonomy is legally guaranteed”, and this has been replaced with efforts aimed at cultural assimilation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-started-work-on-border-villages-long-before-lac-standoff-began-researchers-101638203129489.html
30-11-2021||World||Merriam-Webster chooses vaccine as word of the year for 2021||With an expanded definition to reflect the times, Merriam-Webster has declared an omnipresent truth as its 2021 word of the year: vaccine.“This was a word that was extremely high in our data every single day in 2021,” Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor-at-large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement.“It really represents two different stories. One is the science story, which is this remarkable speed with which the vaccines were developed. But there's also the debates regarding policy, politics and political affiliation. It's one word that carries these two huge stories,” he said.The selection follows “vax” as word of the year from the folks who publish the Oxford English Dictionary. And it comes after Merriam-Webster chose “pandemic” as tops in lookups last year on its online site.Also Read | Pandemic: Merriam-Webster’s word of the year not a shocker“The pandemic was the gun going off and now we have the aftereffects,” Sokolowski said.At Merriam-Webster, lookups for “vaccine” increased 601 per cent over 2020, when the first US shot was administered in New York in December after quick development, and months of speculation and discussion over efficacy. The world's first jab occurred earlier that month in the UK.Compared to 2019, when there was little urgency or chatter about vaccines, Merriam-Webster logged an increase of 1,048 per cent in lookups this year. Debates over inequitable distribution, vaccine mandates and boosters kept interest high, Sokolowski said. So did vaccine hesitancy and friction over vaccine passports.The word “vaccine” wasn't birthed in a day, or due to a single pandemic. The first known use stretches back to 1882 but references pop up earlier related to fluid from cowpox pustules used in inoculations, Sokolowski said.It was borrowed from the New Latin “vaccina,” which goes back to Latin's feminine “vaccinus,” meaning “of or from a cow.” The Latin for cow is “vacca,” a word that might be akin to the Sanskrit “vasa," according to Merriam-Webster.Inoculation, on the other hand, dates to 1714, in one sense referring to the act of injecting an “inoculum.”Earlier this year, Merriam-Webster added to its online entry for “vaccine” to cover all the talk of mRNA vaccines, or messenger vaccines such as those for Covid-19 developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.While other dictionary companies choose words of the year by committee, Merriam-Webster bases its selection on lookup data, paying close attention to spikes and, more recently, year-over-year increases in searches after weeding out evergreens. The company has been declaring a word of the year since 2008. Among its runners-up in the word biography of 2021:INSURRECTION: Interest was driven by the deadly Jan. 6 siege on the U.S. Capitol. Arrests continue, as do congressional hearings over the attack by supporters of President Donald Trump. Some of Trump's allies have resisted subpoenas, including Steve Bannon.Searches for the word increased by 61,000% over 2020, Sokolowksi said.INFRASTRUCTURE: President Joe Biden was able to deliver what Trump often spoke of but never achieved: A bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law. When Biden proposed help with broadband access, eldercare and preschool, conversation changed from not only roads and bridges but “figurative infrastructure,” Sokolowski said.“Many people asked, what is infrastructure if it's not made out of steel or concrete? Infrastructure, in Latin, means underneath the structure,” he said.PERSEVERANCE: It's the name of NASA's latest Mars rover. It landed Feb. 18, 2021. “Perseverance is the most sophisticated rover NASA has ever sent to the Red Planet, with a name that embodies NASA's passion, and our nation's capability, to take on and overcome challenges,” the space agency said.The name was thought up by Alexander Mather, a 14-year-old seventh-grader at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia. He participated in an essay contest organized by NASA. He was one of 28,000 K-12 students to submit entries.NOMAD: The word had its moment with the 2020 release of the film “Nomadland.” It went on to win three Oscars in April 2021, including best picture, director (Chloé Zhao) and actress (Frances McDormand). Zhao became the first woman of color to win best director.The AP's film writer Jake Coyle called the indie success “a plain-spoken meditation on solitude, grief and grit. He wrote that it “struck a chord in a pandemic-ravaged year. It made for an unlikely Oscar champ: A film about people who gravitate to the margins took center stage."Other words in Merriam-Webster's Top 10: Cicada (we had an invasion), guardian (the Cleveland Indians became the Cleveland Guardians), meta (the lofty new name of Facebook's parent company), cisgender (a gender identity that corresponds to one's sex assigned at birth), woke (charged with politics and political correctness) and murraya (a tropical tree and the word that won the 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee for 14-year-old Zaila Avant-garde).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merriamwebsters-chooses-vaccine-as-word-of-the-year-for-2021-101638169808957.html
30-11-2021||India||Pakistan diplomat summoned over photoshoot at Kartarpur Sahib||India on Tuesday summoned the senior-most Pakistani diplomat in New Delhi to convey its concern at what it said was the desecration of Durbar Sahib gurdwara, built at the site where Guru Nanak spent the last years of his life, following a fashion shoot at the shrine. A Lahore-based fashion brand had recently posted images of a photoshoot done by a model at Durbar Sahib gurdwara on its social media accounts. The model featured in the photos did not have her head covered – as is required of all visitors to Sikh shrines – and this resulted in widespread criticism in India and Pakistan. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said Pakistan’s charge d’affaires Aftab Hasan Khan was summoned to “convey our deep concern at the incident of desecration of the sanctity of Gurudwara Shri Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur, by a Pakistani model and a clothing brand”. Khan was informed this “reprehensible incident has deeply hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community in India and worldwide”, he said. “Such continued incidents of desecration and disrespect of places of religious worship of the minority communities in Pakistan highlight the lack of respect for the faith of these communities,” he added. The Indian side also told Khan that it expects “Pakistani authorities to sincerely investigate this matter and take action against those involved”. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee had written to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday, demanding that he take up the matter with the Pakistan government. With elections coming up in Punjab, it had become a hot button issue in political circles. However, authorities in Pakistan had already taken up the issue before India’s formal protest. Kartarpur is located in Pakistan’s Punjab province, and Usman Buzdar, the provincial chief minister, took “strict notice” of the matter and sought a report on the incident from the chief secretary. “A thorough inquiry will be done on this incident. CM Punjab reiterated that all religions are respected in Pakistan,” said a tweet from the handle of the Punjab provincial government. It added in another tweet that “strict action will be taken against all culprits”. Pakistan’s Punjab Police said in a tweet official were “investigating all aspects related to this incident and strict legal action will be taken against responsible”. The management of the fashion brand and model were also being investigated, it added. Pakistan’s information minister Fawad Chaudhry asked the fashion designer and model involved in the incident to apologise, saying the gurdwara is a “religious symbol and not a film set”. The fashion brand too distanced itself from the photoshoot, which it said was done by a third party using its outfits. “However, we accept our mistake that we should not have posted this content, and we apologise to every single person who was offended by this. All the holy places are very sacred to us. The pictures and posts have been removed from all our media channels,” the brand said in a statement. The gurdwara at Kartarpur is located in the area where Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, is believed to have spent his final years. In 2019, India and Pakistan opened a special corridor to allow Indian pilgrims to visit the shrine without visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-diplomat-summoned-over-photoshoot-at-kartarpur-sahib-101638296854163.html

The court ordered the retrieval of the user’s data, acting on a complaint by senior advocate Indira Jaising.According to senior advocate Indira Jaising, the man appeared to be taking a bath as the division bench comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum was hearing a PIL filed in connection with the alleged CD scandal involving former Karnataka minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. Jaising, appearing on behalf of the woman who had lodged a sexual abuse case against Jarkiholi, said that the half-naked man was on the screen for more than 20 minutes. The man had joined the video conferencing under the name ‘Sridhar Bhat SDMC Ujire’. “A person is appearing on video conference without a vest, he is visible in this courtroom. Please take judicial notice of this. Let there be some decorum in the court. Milord, I am a woman lawyer…. It is very offensive for a woman to see a man without clothes in a courtroom. Do we have a man without clothes when a woman is arguing in court? What is going on? Milords…It seems he is bathing in front of the court and before me. How is this possible?” Jaising asked the court. Complaining that his conduct amounts to ‘gross contempt of court’, Jaising said she would send the digital evidence to the court to take appropriate action against the man. Some of the advocates, too, drew the court’s attention towards the person who left the video conference after the issue was brought to the notice of the court. A court officer tried calling the offender, but he did not respond and later he logged out. At the end of the hearing, Jaising urged the court to act against the man. She said, “I am exposed to a semi-naked man for 20 minutes. It is done very deliberately and intentionally. It should never happen again, and it is very disturbing and offensive. His conduct amounts to gross contempt of court. I request to take action under the Contempt of Court Act.” Taking note of the issue, the court also passed the order to find out the offender and issue him notice. More than 80 persons logged into the hearing. Meanwhile, Special Investigation Team (SIT) chief Soumendu Mukherjee submitted a report saying the final report (submitted in a sealed envelope) proposed to be submitted is acceptable. The Karnataka High Court has asked the SIT to file an application before it for clearance to file reports in a magistrate court on its investigations in cases pertaining to allegations of sexual assault against BJP MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi and a counter-complaint of extortion filed by the MLA. In July this year, the SIT had placed a final report on the investigation to the high court, seeking permission to file the reports in a lower court. However, the high court expressed its reservations since the supervising officer of the SIT had not seen or signed the report since he was on leave. The HC asked the SIT to resubmit the investigation reports after examination by the head of the SIT Soumendu Mukherjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-issues-notice-after-semi-naked-man-appears-during-hearing-101638296615739.html

The Wayanad MP met Vijai Sardesai and Vinod Palyekar, who extended their support to the party ahead of the legislative assembly elections in the state.Gandhi also met independent legislator Prasad Gaonkar — who earlier met the Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee in October — who also extended his support to the party. Congress is trying to get smaller parties together in a bid to oust the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It recently suffered a setback as former chief minister and Congress veteran Luizinho Faleiro joined the Trinamool Congress earlier this year.However, following Gaonkar’s meeting with Gandhi, some Congress leaders tweeted photos of Abhishek Banerjee’s tweet where he thanked Gaonkar. “It is an absolute pleasure to receive the support of a farmer's son for India's firebrand woman leader who is challenging the “Two”-man show at the Centre. My sincere gratitude to @prasadgaonkr13 ji & heartiest welcome to Sandesh Gaonkar ji on joining @AITCofficial,” Banerjee tweeted earlier.“We agreed to fight resolutely, wholeheartedly and unitedly on behalf of the people of Goa to end the utterly corrupt, incompetent and undemocratic reign of the BJP,” Sardesai said in a tweet. He also called Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant "communal" and "anti-Goan".Goa is witnessing a multilateral contest as the Trinamool Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiv Sena seek to challenge the BJP government in the state. Earlier the Delhi chief minister and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal promised to resume mining, free pilgrimage and free electricity if voted to power. Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee earlier in October reached out to fishermen and civil society members in order to strengthen the party’s base in the coastal state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-forward-party-mlas-one-independent-meet-rahul-extend-support-to-cong-101638295578451.html

The last time such a facility was given to the defence forces was in 2019 right after the Balakot airstrikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan.Using the same facility, the Indian Navy has leased two Predator drones which have been taken from American firm General Atomics.The Indian Air Force had exercised the same powers to acquire a large number of anti-tank guided missiles, long-range precision-guided artillery shells along with the Hammer air to ground standoff missiles with a strike range of around 70 kilometres.The emergency procurement powers under capital acquisition route ended on August 31 this year.The armed forces have a few more projects in the final stages and if they get an extension, they may go ahead for purchasing that equipment too for improving their combat capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-receives-new-israeli-heron-drones-for-deployment-in-ladakh-sector-101638265519344.html

Earlier, the party had conducted a similar campaign in the poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, where leaders Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh had delivered a call to establish a ‘Ram Rajya’ and equated devotion to Lord Ram with true nationalism and communal harmony.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to hold 'Tiranga yatra' in Punjab's Pathankot on December 2. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia will also join the 'Tiranga yatra': AAP (File pic) pic.twitter.com/rv5Rd0qQ1EThe ‘Tiranga Yatra’ or ‘tricolour march’ conducted by the AAP aims to see the participation of thousands of people, including the party's workers and supporters from across the state, carrying tricolours and raising nationalist slogans such as “Vande Mataram”. The campaign also serves as a stage for AAP leaders to make their vows to the people of the state ahead of elections, and reiterate commitment to promises made earlier.The Aam Aadmi Party, which will be contesting all 117 seats in the Punjab legislative assembly for the upcoming elections, has already made a bunch of lucrative promises to the people of the state. If voted to power, party supremo Arvind Kejriwal has promised 300 units of free electricity in every household, free healthcare facilities in mohalla clinics, and ₹1,000 to every woman in the state above 18 years of age.Kejriwal had kickstarted electioneering for his party at a ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ at Bagha Purana in Punjab's Moga district back in March this year. Now, AAP hopes to step up its campaigning with the Tiranga Yatra, a familiar strategy undertaken by the party ahead of elections; four of these have already been conducted in the poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.Punjab is scheduled to go for assembly polls next year. 59 seats are needed for winning a majority in the 117-seat state assembly.In the 2017 polls, Congress won an absolute majority in the state by winning 77 seats and ousting the ruling SAD-BJP government after 10 years. AAP emerged as the second-largest party winning 20 seats in the 117-member assembly, becoming the principal opposition. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) could only manage to win 15 seats while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured 3 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-to-take-out-yet-another-tiranga-yatra-this-time-in-punjab-s-pathankot-101638263025824.html

A committee on Monday suspended twelve MPs for their unruly behaviour on the last day of the monsoon session.“I want to bring your attention to the last day of the session. That day some MPs attacked women marshals, some attacked male marshals. They stood firm. We shudder to think what could have happened to the Chair,” Goyal said.“Considering that they also filmed and showed what happened in Parliament on YouTube, we suggested that a committee be formed to deal with it. However, many opposition parties refused to be a part of the committee. Their contention that such a panel can only work when house is in session is wrong, as the House is constant, so it is the House' decision to suspend. They can make a mistake but they should apologise as everyone can make a mistake,” Goyal further added.He also pointed out that the Opposition did not let Prime Minister Narendra Narendra Modi introduce new ministers of his Cabinet and showed disregard to the large number of women candidates being inducted. “The entire country witnessed how badly the protestors behaved when minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was speaking in the House,” he said.Both houses of the Parliament which are in session saw repeated adjournments over the past two days. The opposition parties boycotted the Parliament proceedings over the suspension of the MPs, terming the decision ‘undemocratic’.Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge also urged Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to revoke the suspension but Naidu said that it may not be possible without proper functioning of the House and if the opposition MPs do not show sincere regret for their misconduct.The following MPs were suspended for unruly conduct - Elamaram Kareem (Communist Party of India (Marxist)CPI (M)), Phulo Devi Netam (Indian National Congress (INC)), Chhaya Verma (INC), Ripun Bora(INC), Binoy Viswam (Communist Party of India (CPI)), Rajamani Patel (INC), Dola Sen (Trinamool Congress), Shanta Chhetri (TMC), Syed Nasir Hussain(INC), Priyanka Chaturvedi (Shiv Sena), Anil Desai (Shiv Sena) and Akhilesh Prasad Singh (INC).--||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/piyush-goyal-asks-suspended-mps-to-apologise-for-their-conduct-in-rajya-sabha-101638264128574.html

30-11-2021||India||Uttarakhand withdraws Char Dham Act ahead of polls||Ahead of assembly elections next year, the Uttarakhand government on Tuesday announced the withdrawal of the contentious Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, which brought four Hindu shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamunotri and 49 other temples under the purview of a board, and against which several priests and religious organisations have been protesting since last year.Also Read | My decision, says Dhami on scrapping Char Dham law. Then makes a promiseThe law, which was introduced by the previous Trivendra Singh Rawat-led government in 2019, allowed the board to act as the highest governing body, to look after the shrines while framing policies and sanctioning expenditure.Priests of the Chardham — Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri — opposed the board, saying it was an infringement upon their traditional rights over the Himalayan temples.“Our government has taken a decision to take back the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act,” chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said.“The decision to abolish the Devasthanam Board is taken on the basis of the feedback received by Teerth Purohit, Haq Hookdhari (stakeholders), people’s representative and report of a high-level committee,” he added.In 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, under the leadership of Rawat, passed the Uttarakhand Char Dham Shrine Management Bill, 2019. In July, chief minister Dhami formed a five-member committee to look into the matter amid continuous protests by the priests. Based on the recommendations of the panel which submitted its report last week, the state government decided to repeal the Act.“The government will speak to all parties concerned now and take appropriate action on improving the facilities for the pilgrims. The repeal of the law would soon be approved by the Cabinet before bringing a bill on the same in the assembly,” Dhami said.Welcoming the move, Char Dham Haq Haqooq Dhari Tirth Purohit Mahapanchayat president K K Kothiyal said: “We are happy that the government has decided to repeal the Act. We are thankful that they have supported the truth and (taken cognisance) of our struggle of two years. We have no grudges against anyone now.”State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Madan Kaushik also thanked the government for its decision.“In a democracy, no decision taken by any government is final. There is always a margin to change it according to the sentiments of the people like in the case of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act. The government has rolled back the decision while respecting the sentiments of the priests’ community,” he said.The Congress, however, claimed that fears of losing the upcoming assembly elections prompted the government to resort to such a move.“The government faced a loss of votes. This decision is purely out of that fear. But this will not benefit them in the upcoming polls,” Congress leader and former chief minister Harish Rawat said.Political commentator Jai Singh Rawat said: “The BJP was fearing vote loss due to the law (Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act) in the assembly elections. Now, much will depend on how both the BJP and Congress use the issue in the polls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-announces-repeal-of-char-dham-devasthanam-management-act-101638259292095.html

The order comes as Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya reiterated in Parliament on Tuesday there are no cases of omicron variant in India so far.The Centre has already issued strict guidelines for people travelling from or transiting through 'at-risk' countries and issued a slew of directions to the states for ramping up testing-surveillance measures and health facilities. It will also review the decision to resume international flights.The World Health Organization (WHO) has termed omicron as a 'variant of concern' and said the risk of its transmissibility is ‘very high’.

30-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu opts for Fisher test to detect Omicron variant||Tamil Nadu on Monday decided to use Thermo Fischer TaqPath Assay, a test recommended by the World Health Organization, to detect the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus at the 12 RT-PCR government labs in the state. The routine RT-PCRtests are not technically complete as they often do not test for the S gene, which is absent in the Omicron variant of the virus.The World Health Organisation has said that in the RT-PCR tests targeting three genes (N, S and E), the S gene is not present in the case of Omicron mutations, therefore, the absence of ‘S gene dropout’ or ‘S gene target failure’ (SGTF) can be used as the marker for this variant, pending genome sequencing confirmation.A circular issued on Monday by the director of public health (DPH) Dr T S Selvavinayagam directed the government labs to use TaqPath kits to test for the three target genes. Five of these 12 labs are in Chennai, two in Coimbatore and one each in Trichy, Salem, Madurai, Thoothukudi and Kanyakumari.The Tamil Nadu government will supply Thermo Fisher TaqPath RT-PCR kits with higher specificity and better detection rate to the labs that have superior access to airports in the state. “All inbound international travellers found with the symptoms of influenza like Illness (ILI) will be screened for S gene drop out using the Thermo Taqpath by the government RT-PCR labs,” the circular said. In addition to international travellers, the TaqPath tests will be used for testing samples of reinfection, vaccine breakthrough infections, unusual transmission events, positive children, severity of illness in patients without comorbidities. Any sample with S gene target failure, found since October 15, will have to be referred to the State Public Health Laboratory for sequencing confirmation of the Omicron variant, the circular said, and added that samples of all Covid-19 positive travellers have to be sent for genome sequencing. On November 27, WHO designated the variant, B.1.1.529, as a variant of concern with the potential of being more dangerous than its predecessors, and gave it a name, Omicron. According to the international organisation, similar to the alpha variant, the S gene target failure (SGTF) or dropout due to deletion at Spike position 69-70 has been reported in the new variant. Also Read | Covid: What we know about the omicron variant“Thermo Fischer TaqPath Assay can therefore be used as proxy test for this variant pending sequencing confirmation. Use of the SGTF approach may lead to faster detection rates,” the circular said, noting WHO’s guidelines for labs. It however acknowledged that most diagnostic tests can detect Omicron. Tamil Nadu has been using only the RT-PCR test to detect the virus since it entered the state in March 2020. As fresh travel bans are being imposed across the globe due to the spread of the Omicron variant to Europe and Australia, Tamil Nadu’s health department has appointed assistant program managers at the state’s four international airports in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy. The ,managers will coordinate with the staff screening and testing passengers on arrival. RT-PCR tests are being done for all international arrivals at the Chennai airport. Since October 21, as many as 55,090 RT-PCR tests were conducted at Chennai airport, of which, three tested positive for Covid-19. The health minister M Subramanian had earlier said that most of the positive samples were of the Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-opts-for-fisher-test-to-detect-omicron-variant-101638258875960.html

When the three, who had just reached the spot in their car, tried to help him, he shouted that they hit him, Jain added.Jain said police also came under attack and it took some time to reach the spot as the place was blocked and there was a traffic jam. “Our team also came under attack,” said Jain, adding that police first rescued the two other victims before finally rescuing Bhuyan.“A mob gathered at the spot and attacked the three without trying to verify what exactly happened,” said Jain and added that the incident happened during the day but no one intervened.A video of the incident, which went viral, showed a group of people purportedly attacking the three. They were rescued by police and taken to a hospital where Bhuyan was declared brought dead.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma directed the police to file a charge sheet within 30 days.

30-11-2021||India||NITI Aayog releases report on online dispute resolution||The NITI Aayog on Monday released a report on Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) to advance access to justice and ensure that cases do not end up before higher courts. The policy think tank proposed measures at three levels to address the challenges in adopting ODR.The report titled “Designing the future of dispute Resolution: the ODR Policy Plan for India” recommends increasing digital infrastructure, building capacity, regulatory framework, including permission for online notorisation, and implementing it in a phased manner, etc.The report is a culmination of the action plan made by a committee constituted at the peak of the Covid crisis by NITI Aayog on ODR in 2020 and chaired by Supreme Court Justice (Retd) AK Sikri, said an official.ODR is aimed at resolving disputes outside of the court system through arbitration, mediation, and negotiation.“ODR can help reduce the burden on the court and efficiently resolve these categories of cases. It can be integrated to support the judiciary through technology integration in court-annexed ADR centres and introduced within Government departments for its internal disputes, as well as through e-Lok Adalats,” wrote Sekri in the foreword of the report.Officials said due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a large section of the society did not receive timely access to justice and it also added to the already lengthy court process.“Through the ODR report, our aim is to create a sustainable framework—one that adapts and endures the test of time to become an option of first recourse for several categories of claims in a dynamic manner,” said NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.Also Read: Vice admiral R Hari Kumar to take over as new chief of Naval staff todayThe report said government litigation contributes to 46% of all litigation in the country and not only burdens the courts but also imposes a huge cost on the public exchequer.In 2017-18, the expenditure incurred by the central government in contesting cases in the Supreme Court alone was Rs. 47.99 crore. The report cited the Legal Information Management and Briefing System portal and added as of September 23, 2020, the government had 5,80,132 cases pending in different courts across the country.At the structural level, the report recommends increasing access to digital infrastructure, building capacity through training, strengthening paralegal service, etc. “The government can mandate certain categories of disputes to be resolved through ODR before approaching courts,” said the report.It recommends measures to tackle challenges at the behavioural level by adopting ODR for government litigation.A good regulatory framework is essential for the success of ODR. For this, NITI Aayog has recommended the introduction of a regulatory framework for mediation and e-mediation for introducing digital innovation in legal processes. Currently, physical copies of documents and physical presence for verification are essential. The report recommends mainstreaming of e-stamping, allowing online notorisation, integration of eSign for electronic signature and electronic seal, maintaining secure electronic records, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niti-aayog-releases-report-on-online-dispute-resolution-101638244051571.html

She will hold meetings with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The CM also aims to attract investments to the state,” PTI quoted a senior party leader as saying on Monday.Her meeting with Thackeray and Pawar, two of the three coalition partners in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra, comes amid her party’s widening rift with the Congress, which is the third partner in MVA.Also read | 'Not constitutionally mandated': Mamata on why she didn't meet Sonia GandhiNotably, the Trinamool has skipped an opposition leaders’ meeting called by the Congress ahead of Parliament’s Winter Session on Monday and also staged its own protests inside Parliament House demanding the Centre to repeal the three contentious farm laws. The Congress held a similar protest too, led by its president Sonia Gandhi.The meeting also holds significance as the Trinamool is trying to expand its national footprint with Banerjee spearheading efforts to unite opposition parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the 2024 general elections in the country. Several leaders joined the Trinamool recently with the defection of 12 Congress MLAs in Meghalaya, including the state’s former CM Mukul Sangma, being the latest.In her recent political visit to Goa too, where her party is contesting the state assembly elections in 2022, popular names, including tennis star Leander Paes, were inducted into the party.However, the party suffered a setback against the BJP in the recently concluded Tripura civic polls, where the BJP won 329 of the 334 seats in that state’s urban civic bodies. The TMC currently has one seat.Earlier last week, Banerjee met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and raised the issue of expanding the Border Security Force’s (BSF’s) jurisdiction in border states, including Bengal and the alleged violence in Tripura.She also invited him to a Global Business Summit to be held in Bengal next year, according to several news reports.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-on-3-day-visit-to-mumbai-from-today-to-meet-uddhav-thackeray-sharad-pawar-industrialists-101638234571797.html
30-11-2021||India||CPM is runner up in Tripura civic polls that BJP swept, says state election body||AGARTALA: The Communist Party of India (Marxist), not the Trinamool Congress, secured the second-highest votes after the Bharatiya Janata Party that swept the Tripura local body elections winning 217 of the 222 seats that went to polls, according to data released by the State Election Commission on Monday.The ruling BJP got a whopping 59.01% votes in the elections held on November 25. The local body election witnessed a voter turnout of 81.54%.The CPM secured 18.13% of all valid votes in all the 14 civic bodies as compared to the Trinamool Congress which ended up with a 16.39% vote share. The TMC, however, did emerge as the runner up in the Agartala Municipal Corporation with a 20.14% share in votes polled.The CPM’s other allies in the Left Front were marginal players. The Communist Party of India (CPI) ended up with 0.76% votes hare, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) with 0.44% and the Forward Bloc with 0.32%.Including the 112 seats that the BJP netted without contest, the Tripura BJP won 329 of 334 seats. The CPM won three seats, and the TMC and royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarma’s party TIPRA Motha won one seat each.The Congress got 2.07% votes while independent candidates in different areas bagged 0.99% votes with 0.17% votes bagged by other political parties, as per the report. The Trinamool Congress, which earlier claimed to have emerged as the runner up in the civic body elections, declined to comment on the State Election Commission report. Trinamool Youth Congress convener Baptu Chakraborty said, “We contested on 120 seats in the civic polls and got 24% votes. Our performance cannot be measured on seats we didn’t contest”.Tripura law minister Ratan Lal Nath said, “The Trinamool Congress got more votes in some seats and very less in others. Where is the record of whatever they are claiming? However, we are not concerned about them. We know that the CPM, Trinamool Congress and Congress will come together, but it still will not affect BJP. “Jitendra Chaudhury, state secretary of the CPM that was in power for decades in the state before being evicted by the BJP in 2018 elections, said, “After the BJP, the CPM got the second-highest votes across the state. The State Election Commission data also said the same thing. Then, how did they (TMC) make such a claim that they bagged second highest votes? Their real purpose is to divide the opposition votes to make way for BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpm-is-runner-up-in-tripura-civic-polls-that-bjp-swept-says-state-election-body-101638215370560.html
30-11-2021||India||Activists slam police action against Munawar Faruqui||A day after comedian Munawar Faruqui through a tweet bid ‘goodbye’ to stand-up comedy, lawyers and activists in the city on Monday argued that the Bengaluru police’s actions that led to the cancellation of Faruqui’s show amounts to dereliction of duty by the police.They said that though an event held in a private space doesn’t require any police permission, the fact the police failed to act against a group threatening to cause ruckus at the venue showed that they failed to perform their duty. A show by Faruqui was cancelled on Sunday, hours before it was supposed to be held in Bengaluru, after the city police ‘suggested’ that the organizers cancel the event, citing possible law and order problems amid protest by right-wing outfits.Bengaluru police on Sunday wrote to the organisers of the event, after a letter was sent by Hindu Janjagruti Samiti, a right wing group, to Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant on the same day asking police to cancel the event. The petition said that Faruqui has a habit of making ‘unacceptable’ jokes on Hindu gods, Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2020, Godhra massacre of karsevaks’.“Allowing Munawar Faruqui, who hurts religious sentiments of Hindus, is providing an opportunity for him to repeat those crimes…. should such a programme that disturbs the communal harmony be allowed when the memories of DJ Halli riots are still fresh?” read the letter, while threatening to take to the streets if the stand-up show is held.Members of the organization have been charged with the murder of editor-activist Gauri Lankesh and scholar M.M. Kalburgi.Hours later Ashok Nagar police issued the letter to the organizers “advising” them that they “should cancel the show”. The letter, though doesn’t mention the HJS petition, says they have credible information that several organizations are opposing the show. The organizers had informed the Ashok Nagar police of the show titled “Dongri to Nowhere” in a letter on November 15, as they need not take permission since it was to be held an indoor, and the police had not taken objection to the same till HJS petitioned the police.Senior police officers aware of the development said that they were pulled up for “not cancelling the show earlier” and were asked to cancel it immediately. Senior police officials, however, refused to comment on the issue.Vinay Srinivas, a civil rights activist, and advocate said forcing the organizers to cancel the show was a violation of the right to freedom of speech and expression. “There is a Supreme Court judgement which says no permission is needed to hold an event at a private venue. It is not the police’s job to interfere in stopping such a performance, their job is to provide security if there are threats,” he said.All Indian Lawyer’s Association for Justice, in a statement, claimed that at its core, the targeting of Munawar Faruqui is part of a communal agenda of rightwing forces in India, which have the overt support of the ruling dispensation. “AILAJ condemns the actions of Bangalore police in issuing notice seeking cancellation of the comedy show by Munawar Faruqui. The said notice is a violation of rule of law and clearly reveals that the police force has abdicated its constitutional duty of protecting the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression, succumbing instead to pressures of extremist communal right-wing forces,” read the statement.“As such the issue of notice by the Bangalore police to the organisers of the event must be seen as a declaration of support to unconstitutional forces. The police force, which is funded by the people, must be bound by the Constitution,” the statement added.Clifton Rozario, a Bengaluru-based lawyer pointed out that police’s failure to take action against an organisation that was threatening to resort to violence is a dereliction of duty. “It is the job of the police department to take action against such groups and they failed at their job. There have been instances where courts have ordered cases to be filed against senior officers for failure to act, this amounts to the same,” he said.An organizer of the event, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that they will not be taking any legal action. “There were several people who had offered to conduct a private show with the comedian, but he was so dejected that he left the city soon after the news broke,” said the organiser.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-slam-police-action-against-munawar-faruqui-101638213748836.html
30-11-2021||India||Karnataka resident doctors go on strike over Covid allowance payment||Bengaluru: The Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors (KARD) on Monday went on an indefinite strike demanding payment of Covid-19 risk allowance. As part of the strike, the resident doctors across the state have decided to withdraw from all the elective services, including outpatient department (OPD) and elective operation theatre, in all medical colleges affiliated with the KARD. They, however, added that emergency services will not be part of the strike.“We have worked hard to manage the Covid-19 pandemic, even by compromising all our academics and against the risk of being infected under adverse conditions. As a result, postgraduates have lost half of their course duration without learning the bare minimum of clinical and other skills,” said KARD’s president In-charge Dr Tejas J.KARD is an association of house surgeons, postgraduates, and super speciality residents of government medical and dental colleges in Karnataka.In May, the Karnataka government announced a Covid allowance of ₹10,000 per month from April 2021 for all resident doctors. The association said that the funds have not been released by the government even after six months, terming it a “blatant disregard” towards the doctors serving on the frontlines.Highlighting an almost 400% hike in academic fees, the association stated that the matter was made even worse by forcing them to pay up the entire sum upfront without any concession during “these troubling times”. It added that innumerable symbolic protests, letters to concerned authorities and a pan-state protest bore no fruitful result. “It is unfortunate to note that the assurance given by the minister of medical education has not been fulfilled. The intent to address the issue is not visible as resident doctors were excluded from the package of Covid-risk allowance announced recently by the Government of Karnataka,” read a statement from the association.“We are left with no option but to display our dissent in this regard with a Pan-Karnataka indefinite strike from November 29, 2021, comprising of withdrawal of all the elective services including OPDs and elective OTs (Excluding emergency services) in all the medical colleges affiliated with KARD,” it added.Meanwhile, housekeeping staff, ward attendees, lift operators, data entry operators and security personnel employed in Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI), staged a protest on Monday, demanding timely payment of wages.The workers claimed that they have not been paid the October salary. Maitreyi from Karnataka General Labour Union, affiliated with the All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), said workers are unable to pay their house rent and do not have money to purchase food for their families.“The workers have not been paid the salary for October 2021. As per labour laws, the workers are to be paid their monthly salary on the 7th of every month. However, as BMRCI has failed to ensure payment of salary for October, the workers are struggling to make ends meet. Without the monthly salary, they are unable to pay school fees of their children or attend to medical emergencies,” she said.Ramesh Krishna K, Medical Superintendent of Victoria hospital, however, claimed that the payment of salaries was delayed as the outsourced agency had not paid the workers. “I have informed the dean and director about this, and we are in the process of resolving the issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-resident-doctors-go-on-strike-over-covid-allowance-payment-101638213572041.html
30-11-2021||India||Andhra high court refuses to quash pleas on capitals citing governor’s order||Andhra Pradesh high court on Monday refused to strike down the petitions challenging the three capitals proposal of the Jagan Mohan Reddy government on the ground that the gazette notification on the repeal of the three capital legislation was yet to be issued.Though the AP Decentralization and Inclusive Development of All Regions Repeal Bill of 2021 was passed in both the houses of the state legislature on November 22 and 23 respectively, it could not be notified in the gazette as it is still awaiting asset of governor Biswabhushan Harichandan.The governor, who had recovered from Covid-19 last week, was flown to Hyderabad again on Monday due to post-Covid complications. He is undergoing treatment at a private hospital, where his condition is said to be stable.The high court bench headed by chief justice Prashant Kumar Mishra adjourned the cases to December 27, stating that it would take up the hearing only after getting a clear picture following the governor’s assent.State advocate general Subrahmanyam Sriram said there was no relevance to the petitions filed by Amaravati farmers challenging the three capitals, as the state government had withdrawn the earlier laws.Representing the petitioners, senior advocates Shyam Divan, Jandhyala Ravi Shankar and B Adinarayana Rao argued that the government had repealed the earlier laws on three capitals to disable the high court from proceeding further. They pointed out that the government had made clear its intention to bring in fresh legislation on three capitals in future.Advocate general, however, argued that the high court cannot take up any pre-emptive adjudication at this stage as the laws were in the domain of the legislature and there was no guidance role for the high court concerning the legislature’s future course of action.The high court revoked its interim orders that prevented the state government from undertaking developmental works due to the litigation. At the same time, it extended the status quo on its orders that prohibited the shifting of government offices and departments to Visakhapatnam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-high-court-refuses-to-quash-pleas-on-capitals-citing-governor-s-order-101638213510221.html
30-11-2021||India||Parliament winter session: 12 Rajya Sabha MPs suspended over ruckus last session||Twelve members of the Rajya Sabha were suspended for the remainder of the winter session that began on Monday after the House passed a motion moved by the government seeking their suspension under Rule 256 for their “unruly and violent behaviour” during the monsoon session. Opposition parties termed the suspension as “undemocratic”.Also Read | Bill to repeal farm laws passedRajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh announced the suspension of the members after parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi moved a motion that was adopted by a voice vote to suspend six MPs of the Congress, Phulo Devi Netam, Chhaya Verma, Ripun Bora, Rajamani Patel, Syed Hussain and Akhilesh Singh; two of the Shiv Sena, Priyanka Chaturvedi and Anil Desai; two of the TMC, Dola Sen and Shanta Chhetri; Elamaram Kareem of the CPM; and Binoy Viswam of the CPI for indiscipline in the last session of the House. The motion moved by the government said, “…the House takes cognisance and strongly condemns the utter disregard to the authority of the chair, complete abuse of rules of the House persistently thereby wilfully obstructing the business of House through their, unprecedented acts of misconduct, contemptuous, unruly and violent behaviour and intentional attacks on security personnel on the last day of the 254th session of Rajya Sabha (monsoon session) i.e. August 11, 2021, thereby lowering the dignity of and bringing disrepute to this August House…”The incidents referred to pertain to the ruckus that broke out in the House on August 11, the last day of the monsoon session, when some opposition MPs climbed on a Rajya Sabha officials’ table, raised slogans, and threw files when the House began a discussion on farmers’ protest against new reform laws. Later, opposition members staged a walkout from the House, protesting against the hurried passage of bills and the deployment of security personnel inside the House, even as the government accused them of manhandling marshals.Opposition members dubbed the suspension “undemocratic” and said the motion moved by the government is “unprecedented and violates the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha).”A statement issued by the leader of Opposition, Mallikarjun Kharge, said the floor leaders of the opposition parties of Rajya Sabha will meet on Tuesday to deliberate on the future course of action. The statement has been supported by parties including the DMK, SP, NCP, Shiv Sena, RJD, CPI, CPM, IUML, LJD, MDMK, TRS and AAP.The government maintained the incidents of “indiscipline were unprecedented.”“The opposition members were given a chance to apologise, but they did not; they even turned down the opportunity to be part of a committee suggested by the Chairman to probe the August 11 incidents,” said a government functionary on condition of anonymity.To a question on why the government did not choose to take action against the MPs who created ruckus on August 10, a second government functionary said; “August 11 was the last day of the monsoon session.” Had the government moved the motion for suspension on August 11; then the MPs named for creating ruckus would have been let off with just a day’s suspension since Rule 256 says they can be suspended for the duration of the session in which the motion is moved.While some of the opposition MPs alleged that they were not allowed to present their version of events before being handed down suspension, a third government functionary said as per the Rule 256 of the Rajya Sabha’s Rules of Procedure the Chairman is entitled to take action against acts of misconduct: disregarding the authority of the chair, abusing the rules of the council by persistently and wilfully obstructing the business thereof.The government also claimed that since the beginning of the monsoon session till the last day, there used to be “20-30 names that were mentioned for disputing the house in the day’s bulletin”.“From not allowing the Prime Minister to introduce ministers; to snatching papers from IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw the opposition in a planned way decided they won’t allow the house to function. There were scenes never seen before — MPs whistling, recording proceedings and putting it on YouTube, and covering the faces of MPs with placards while they spoke,” said the first functionary.The government also referred to the complaints that were submitted by at least two marshals about the injuries they received while preventing the MPs from breaking the security cordon around the Chair.“They will have to consider apologising and there also needs be a re-look at the rules to ensure these incidents do not recur”, the first person added.There have been several instances of members being suspended on account of various reasons. In September 2020, eight Rajya Sabha members -- Derek O’Brien (TMC), Sanjay Singh (AAP), Rajeev Satav (Congress), KK Ragesh (CPM), Syed Nazir Hussain (Congress), Ripun Boren (Congress), Dola Sen (TMC) and Elamaram Kareem (CPM) -- were suspended for unruly behaviour in the House. The motion was passed by a voice vote. The same year, seven Congress members -- Gaurav Gogoi, TN Prathapan, Dean Kuriakose, Rajmohan Unnithan, Manickam Tagore, Benny Behanan and Gurjeet Singh Aujla -- were suspended from Lok Sabha during the budget session of Parliament.In January 2019, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, suspended 45 Members of the TDP and AIADMK for disrupting proceedings for days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-winter-session-12-rajya-sabha-mps-suspended-over-ruckus-last-session-101638213329028.html
30-11-2021||India||Supreme Court disapproves of ‘regime revenge’, pulls up Maharahtra govt in land allotment case||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday disapproved of the practice of “regime revenge” as it pulled up the Maharashtra government for cancelling land allotment to a private entity after the chief of its city planning agency changed. “It is pertinent to remember that, by merely using grounds of public interest or loss to the treasury, the successor public authority cannot undo the work undertaken by the previous authority. Such a claim must be proven using material facts, evidence and figures. If it were otherwise, then there will remain no sanctity in the words and undertaking of the Government,” held a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana. The bench, which also comprised justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant, underlined that businessmen would be hesitant to enter government contract or make any investment if authorities cancelled contracts by only citing public interest. “Such a practice is counter-productive to the economy and the business environment in general. The constitutional guarantee against arbitrariness, as provided under Article 14, demands the state to act in a fair and reasonable manner unless public interest demands otherwise,” noted the bench. The court was hearing an appeal filed by the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra (CIDCO) against a 2013 judgment of the Bombay high court. The HC had quashed the CIDCO’s decision to cancel the allotment of land to M/s Metropolis Hotels, which was given the land in 2008 on lease for constructing a hotel around the proposed Navi Mumbai airport. After the site of the proposed airport changed, Metropolis Hotels applied in March 2010 for subdivision of the plot and change of land use for half the plot from commercial to residential-cum-commercial. Acceding to this request, CIDCO executed two separate lease deeds in respect of the two plots. As some complaints were made against Metropolis regarding irregularities in allotment of plots of land and change of user, the Maharashtra government initiated an inquiry, based on which the new chairman of CIDCO issued a show-cause notice to Metropolis in December 2010 and finally cancelled the lease deeds in March 2011. Metropolis went to HC, which allowed its petition and restored the allotment. Dismissing CIDCO’s appeal against the HC order, the top court also noted that the change of land use and the subsequent division was well ­within the statutory limitations but a contrary view was taken after a new executive head of CIDCO took over. “The contradictory submissions asserted before this court and the concessions given regarding practice of CIDCO to allow change in land use in other cases, clearly points to a ‘regime revenge’... the earlier undertakings taken by the authorities cannot be set aside with the change of person in power, without any rhyme or reason,” maintained the bench. The court rejected submissions of the state government and CIDCO that there would be loss of public money if Metropolis were allowed to retain the land. “When a contract is being evaluated, the mere possibility of more money in the public coffers, does not in itself serve public interest. A blanket claim by the state claiming loss of public money cannot be used to forgo contractual obligations, especially when it is not based on any evidence or examination. The larger public interest of upholding contracts and the fairness of public authorities is also in play. Courts need to have a broader understanding of public interest, while reviewing such contracts,” it held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-disapproves-of-regime-revenge-pulls-up-maharahtra-govt-in-land-allotment-case-101638213270126.html
30-11-2021||India||Amid reports of fissures, Chandy, Chennithala skip UDF meeting||Senior Kerala Congress leaders Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala skipped the United Democratic Front (UDF) meeting in the state capital on Monday, deepening fissures between the new leadership and the old guard in the state.UDF convenor and Congress leader M M Hassan said he was not informed of their decision to skip the meeting, and both refused to comment on their absence. “They promised me to attend the meet. I don’t know what happened,” he said after the meet. Currently, the UDF comprises seven parties, with the Congress and Muslim League as major partners. Chandy’s and Chennithala’s displeasure over the new leadership, led by Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K Sudhakaran and opposition leader VD Satheesan, is not unknown as the old guards have openly questioned their functioning. “Both are upset with the leadership for ignoring their repeated complaints. Instead of taking all along they are ignoring seniors, and it won’t bode well for the party,” a senior leader said on condition of anonymity. Last week, former Kerala chief minister Chandy called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi, urging her to call off the ongoing revamp in the state unit given the upcoming organisational elections. Leaders close to him said he expressed reservations over recent disciplinary actions against some leaders and criticised the style of functioning of the new leadership in the state.Two weeks ago, a former state secretary M A Latheef, a staunch loyalist of Chandy, was suspended for “anti-party activities.” Some of the expelled leaders, like A P Anil Kumar and P S Prashant, later joined the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in August. Chandy criticised the suspension of senior leaders and asked the new leadership to exercise restraint and take everyone along. However, Sudhakaran maintained that discipline was supreme in the party. During the assembly elections in April, the party was expecting to return to power, given the pattern of power alternating between the state’s two major formations, CPI (M) and Congress, but faced a humiliating defeat. The fact that party leader, Rahul Gandhi, is a member of Parliament from Kerala’s Wayanad constituency added to the ignominy. It led to a major internal shift in the power structure and high command was forced to intervene in the faction-ridden unit.“If the High Command wants to strengthen the party in Kerala it will have to ensure that senior leaders are heard properly. Sulking leaders are not good to the party,” said political commentator Sunnykutty Abraham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-reports-of-fissures-chandy-chennithala-skip-udfmeeting-101638213152880.html
30-11-2021||India||In Bihar hooch tragedy, larger questions about prohibition||Gopalganj/Patna: It is Saturday, November 12, and 35-year-old Prabhabati Devi is inconsolable despite the efforts of a group of women around her. Her four infant children fight for space on her lap, as they watch their mother crying. The day marks the shraddh ceremony for her 40-year-old husband, Mukesh Ram, one of the 41 people who died in Bihar between November 3 and November 10 in the most recent rendition of a hooch tragedy that spanned three districts – in a state that ostensibly has complete prohibition. Her three-room house in the Harijan Tola of Muhammadpur village, made of brick and mortar, is locked from the outside, sealed by Bihar Police on November 6. Devi sits on the floor of a temporary shed meant for cattle, where two families that lived in the locked home now sleep. The first is her family, their home sealed on November 6 for allegedly breaking the law. The other is the family of her brother-in-law, Sunil Ram, in jail for the past two-and-a-half months, arrested for consuming liquor. “On November 3, my husband, who worked as a daily wage labourer and earned ₹300 a day, complained of a headache and an inability to see. We rushed him to a private doctor in Motihari, and later shifted him to the Gopalganj district hospital,” said Prabhabati, holding her four young children. “Within hours, he was dead.” Asked if her husband consumed alcohol, Prabhabati says nothing. But right next to her, neighbour Chandrama Ram says out loud an ill kept-secret: “Nearly everyone drinks.”Around Devi, there are other homes in Harijan Tola in different stages of mourning. Suraj Ram (40) died a day after Mukesh, with the same symptoms. A few metres away is the home of Ramanand Ram, who spent days in hospital, developed difficulty in seeing, recovered, but is now in jail. In the deaths in November, this tola reported three of the 11 deaths in Gopalganj. In the districts of Gopalganj, West Champaran and Muzaffarpur, 41 people died and 10 were treated in hospitals, in an incident which has again turned the spotlight on the prohibition law in Bihar, the effectiveness of its implementation five years after it was brought into force by chief minister Nitish Kumar, and hooch tragedies that seems to persist despite its existence.LAW AND BEYONDThe immediate reaction to the outrage that the most recent cycle of hooch deaths has generated has been a wave of administrative action from the Bihar government. Twenty-five kilometres away from the Harijan Tola, in the diaras (river islands) that abut the Gandak river in Baikunthpur and Muhammadpur, the police demolished 45 bhattis (illegal distilleries) and destroyed 6,500 litres of illicit liquor in November. More than 900 people have been arrested in a three-day drive in the first week of November under Section 30(a) of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 in raids across 1,500 locations. In Gopalganj alone, 275 people were arrested and 105 FIRs were lodged, with 34 vehicles carrying hooch seized. In Samastipur, police arrested 65 people and lodged 32 FIRs. In East Champaran, 92 people have been arrested and 83 FIRs registered, with 11,000 litres of prohibited alcohol recovered, said Navin Chandra Jha, superintendent of police. Overall, 106 people have died in hooch tragedies this year, officials of the excise department said. There are no figures available with the government on the total number of such deaths since April 2016, when the law came into force. Since then, the Bihar police have registered 255,000 FIRs and have arrested 212,000 people for violation of prohibition laws, with most being released on bail. In several of Bihar’s villages, however, the law has not precluded the absence of alcohol, but new ways have been found to distribute low-grade liquor. In Gopalganj district, for instance, countrymade liquor called “BB (Bunty Babli)” is all the rage. Manufactured in Uttar Pradesh, it finds its way across the border at inflated rates. “Originally priced at ₹50, a 180ml bottle is selling between ₹100 and 150 here,” said Ravindra Prasad Gupta, a village chief candidate of a village in Siwan. “In addition to this, there are other brands of countrymade liquor called Katrina and Laila that are also in great demand.”Moti Lal Prasad of Bhagwanpur, who owned liquor vends before they were outlawed, said much of the spurious alcohol entering the state was through Uttar Pradesh and Nepal. “They come using road and river routes, transported through the Gandak river, mainly at night. They come in small containers of 10, 20 and 50 litres, and in small bottles. Prohibition has only increased black marketing,” he said. Police in Gopalganj told HT that this liquor was being routinely transported to Bihar through ghats on the Gandak river, including Salempur (Barauli block), Pakhla ghat (Baikunthpur), Maharani ghat (Muhammadpur) and Bangra ghat (Bainkunthpur). Gopalganj’s superintendent of police Anand Kumar describes the striking resemblance of the spirit with water as a major challenge, and one of the reasons why the influx is hard to stop. “The traders manage to slip by security personnel by hiding the bottles among lots of water. However, we have intensified our patrolling and search operations with the help of dog squads in all suspect areas, including Gandak’s riverine areas. We have also made the use of available drones for aerial patrolling,” he said.At least three districts of Bihar – Siwan, Gopalganj and West Champaran – have borders with Uttar Pradesh while 11 districts share borders with Nepal. In the east, Kishanganj, Katihar, Purnia and Banka are close to West Bengal, while six districts of Jharkhand are across the border in Bihar. Compounding this is a 726km Indo-Nepal border that has around 6,000 Bihar villages just in a 3kmradius and numerous open transit points. Every month, close to 200,000 people cross the identified 49 transit points between Bihar and Nepal, data from Bihar Police show. Manoj Pandey, a journalist from Muhammadpur, said these ghats have long been used for smuggling, only the merchandise now has become bootlegged alcohol. “These ghats have been used for smuggling Nepali dalda, a vegetable oil cheaper than Indian vanaspati, and Chinese toys,” Pandey said. “Now they are used for liquor smuggling.”HT spoke to a man from Muhammadpur involved in the trade who said that this “Nepalese” liquor was almost “pure spirit.” “The mixture is one litre of spirit in five litres of water. To this is added nausadar, made of ammonium chloride which supplements the intoxicant in the drink. A 10 litre jar which costs ₹1,500 to make, fetches about ₹10,000 and is sold in pouches of 200ml each at ₹30 at the very least, but often much more. It is the improper mixture of spirit and nausadar that makes these concoctions deadly. At times, urea and stale rice is added as well, which is even more dangerous.”Doctors at Gopalganj and West Champaran, two places which saw the maximum deaths in the most recent hooch tragedy, said most patients complained of vision loss and stomach pain. “The toxic ingredients choke the lung and the heart and cause blockages. The damage then spreads to other organs like the liver, pancreas and the eyes,” said Dr Manoj Kumar, a gastroenterologist in Patna. A LOSING BATTLEOver the past five years, the Bihar government has put in measures like so-called integrated check posts to stop the movement of liquor within the state. At the Kochaikot integrated check post in Gopalganj, at the border of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, there are rows of what look like abandoned vehicles, almost like a parking lot. There are more than 300 vehicles including buses, trucks, SUVs and even motorcycles, all seized over the past two years. The check post has five cameras, all of which were functional when HT visited the spot on November 12. In a room nearby, a television monitor records images, from the driver’s face to number plate to the goods being carried and searched. There are five such integrated check posts in Bihar, and 15 more are in the pipeline. Milling around are a team of 24 excise officials and policemen in three shifts, separate from police personnel manning a nearby Bihar Police booth. And yet, those stationed here believe they are fighting a losing battle. “On an average, 5,000 vehicles cross the check post, and given the resources, we can check only a 100 large vehicles on a given day. Loaded vehicles cannot be properly searched all the time,” said an excise department official posted at the Kochaikot check post. “There are at least six motorable village roads connected with Uttar Pradesh cities of Kashiyan (22 km from Bihar border) and Kushinagar (40 km). Some farmers have land on other side and most from Gopalganj visit Gorakhpur for their medical and other needs. There is no checking at these places,” said Ramanuj Prasad, a resident of Kochaikot village. Moreover, smugglers have developed new ways of bringing in liquor, such as the use of ambulances. On the morning of November 11, an ambulance with the registration number UP 11 BT 5759 and driving on the wrong side of the road was flagged by personnel at the check post. When it was surrounded, the driver jumped and fled, and bottles of liquor were found in the vehicle. A case has since been registered. “The question where it is coming from or how it is being transported is not as important as the fact that this business generates black money and that in turn fuels crime. Illegal liquor used to come from other places earlier as well. Raids and seizure of bottles will not help. Those making money need to be targeted,” said Abhyanand, former director general of police in Bihar. He uses only one name.FOR AND AGAINSTThe recent tragedy has brought to the fore an old debate in Bihar, on the principle and effectiveness of prohibition. Even the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), part of the governing National Democratic Alliance, has asked for a review. “There is a need to review the law. The liquor ban was a good initiative by chief minister Nitish Kumar, which had good intentions, and helped benefit women. But I believe that after six years, its success and failure should be re-evaluated,” Bihar BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal told HT. “There is a liquor mafia active in the state in connivance with police and administration, which is perhaps why the law has failed.” The Bihar government has argued that there is evidence that suggests incremental acceptance of the liquor ban. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16, 29% of Bihar’s population used to consume alcohol. According to the NFHS 2019-20, this number has declined to 15.5%. The ban on liquor has had a significant positive impact on women’s empowerment and domestic violence, according to excise and prohibition minister Sunil Kumar. “The objective was empowerment of women, who were most vulnerable to alcohol related violence. Prohibition has left more money in the hands of families and women,” he said. Cases of domestic violence have fallen to 2,397 in 2019 from 3,792 in 2015, data from National Crime Records Bureau show. The state government says it is due to prohibition. The opposition has argued that the law has only meant that poor people have been targeted. “The Nitish Kumar regime has arrested lakhs of poor and Dalits under the Act. The actual liquor mafia is beyond the government’s reach. Can Nitish Kumar provide data of how many kingpins, liquor operators, smugglers and police officials have been sent to jail?” asked Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, leader of the opposition . The law was harsher on users rather than suppliers, said Rakhi Sharma, chief executive of Disha De-addiction-Cum Re-habilitation Centre. “There is a need for a concerted drive against suppliers to break the chain, and for some leniency towards users,” sharma said. “The stringent laws affect weaker sections who are thrown into jail.” State excise minister Kumar, though, made it clear that there would be no government climbdown. “The policy is here to stay. Every effort is being made to ensure that excise department, police and intelligence work in tandem to make it more effective,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-hooch-tragedy-larger-questions-about-prohibition-101638213151843.html
30-11-2021||India||Jaya house tussle on as AIADMK plans appeal after Madras high court order||Despite the Madras high court order setting aside AIADMK’s acquisition of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s Chennai residence, tussle over the property continues as the party is set to decide on its next course of action at the executive committee meeting on December 1, joint coordinator and leader of opposition Edappadi Palaniswami said on Monday. Legal heirs to the residence J Deepa and J Deepak have, on the other hand, have approached the Chennai collectors for the keys.“AIADMK’s one-crore strong cadre considers the place as a temple. We will retrieve it,” Palaniswami said in Salem. It was the Palaniswami-led government that decided to acquire Jayalalithaa’s 24,322 sq ft bungalow to turn it into a memorial for her. “We are discussing the possibility of going for an appeal. On December 1, we will arrive at a decision,” he said.Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew, Deepa and Deepak, filed separate petitions with the Chennai district collector asking for the keys to the residence. “Based on the court orders, we sent a representation last Thursday to the collector,” said their counsel S L Sudarsanam. “We are yet to receive a response.”On November 24, Justice N Seshasayee passed a 123-page order, in which he set aside the acquisition reasoning that it does not involve a ‘public purpose’ based on writ petitions filed by the siblings Deepa and Deepak. The court also directed the Chennai district collector, in whose custody the keys of the property are, to hand them over to the petitioners within three weeks.Jayalalithaa’s death in office on December 5, 2016, led to several controversies. She left no will or legal and political heirs. This led to several factions fighting for the reins of the AIADMK, which included Deepa, O Panneerselvam (joint coordinator of AIADMK) and V K Sasikala, who lived with Jayalalithaa in Veda Nilayam for three decades. In 2017, after Sasikala was convicted to a four-year jail term in the disproportionate assets case, she handpicked Palaniswami to be the chief minister, who later joined hands with Panneerselvam and expelled her. A day ahead of Sasikala’s release from prison in January this year, AIADMK inaugurated the residence as a memorial, which was seen as a move to prevent Sasikala’s entry. Sasikala, after taking a break from politics, has been active on the ground to reclaim the AIADMK.According to the revenue department, the three-storey residence is on a ten-ground plot. It has 32,721 moveable items, including 8,376 books and 394 mementoes. Fourteen items of gold, weighing 4.4 kgs and 867 items of silver, weighing 601 kgs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaya-house-tussle-on-as-aiadmk-plans-appeal-after-madras-high-court-order-101638213092226.html

Few lawyers, who went on fact finding missions, were served with notices. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act charges were slapped on journalists.

30-11-2021||India||Kerala tightens norms for overseas travellers||As the threat of new virus variant Omicron looms, Kerala on Monday revised its norms for overseas travellers arriving in the state. All travellers coming from high–risk-borne countries will have to undergo a 14-day mandatory quarantine and special teams will monitor them, said state health minister Veena George while announcing new regulations.She said all travellers will have to undergo a test at the airport soon after their arrival and even if their tests are negative they will be under quarantine, and there will be another test on the eighth day, she said, adding that if the result is again negative then they can remain in a 7-day quarantine at their home.Those who test positive will be released only after three consecutive tests after having recovered, she added.“We have heightened our vigil at all airports. Medical teams and enough ambulances will be deployed in airports and treatment centres will be well-equipped. It is a crucial juncture and we can’t lower our guard,” she said after the Covid coordination committee meeting in Thiruvananthapuram. The state has been topping the daily Covid-19 cases for more than six months.Travellers from the following countries would need to follow new norms: the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, Israel, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, China, Hong Kong and Mauritius.“We are following the directives of the Union health ministry. We urge all to ensure Covid-appropriate behavior,” she said. The minister said 96 per cent of the eligible population in the state have received first dose and 63 per cent have received both doses . She said the chief minister will chair a high-power committee on Covid-19 on Tuesday to review the situation.Meanwhile, the state on Monday reported 3,382 new Covid-19 cases and 117 deaths, raising death toll to 39,955, an official release said. Of the 117 deaths, 59 were reported over the last few days and 58—backlog cases— were designated as Covid-19 deaths after receiving appeals based on the new guidelines of the Centre and the directions of the Supreme Court, the release said.In Covid-19 deaths, Kerala is now second to Maharashtra.Now backlog cases, either unreported or kept out of Covid-19 list, are posing a big challenge to the state. Veena George admitted in the assembly that around 7,000 deaths failed to find in the Covid-19 death list due to technical reasons but only half of them is included in the list, and more than 17,000 appeals are still pending with the committee for confirming Covid-19 deaths.The health department is adding backlog of unreported cases between March 2020 and June 2021 along with the daily deaths, showed official data. In November around 60 per cent of deaths reported were backlog cases.“When we pointed grave errors, the government blamed us saying we were portraying the state in bad light. We are happy at least now it realized its error and publicity stunt,” said public health experts Dr S S Lal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-tightens-norms-for-overseas-travellers-101638213088828.html

The posture of the ED in the recent past against the state government in certain cases is against the basic tenets of the federal system. Hence the statement of the ED counsel that the CBI may have to step in has to be viewed as a motivated one,” the affidavit said.The affidavit also said that no complaint was raised against the ongoing SIT probe, and all complainants are satisfied with its quick action in the case. The ED, against which the state fought a legal battle in the gold smuggling case, pushed for a CBI probe as many senior state police officers were allegedly close to Mavunkal. While hearing the petition of Mavunkal’s former driver earlier, the court had pulled up senior police officials and wondered how such a man got their patronage and support. “There could not be any cover-up in the investigation into the cases registered against self-styled antique collector Monson Mavunkal, merely because some of the high-ranking officials are allegedly involved,” the court observed on November 11. Inspector-General of Police A Lakshmana was suspended last month over his alleged liaison with the conman.Mavunkal is now facing eight cheating cases, and a case under the protection of children from sexual offences act for allegedly raping the daughter of his former employee. He was arrested on September 26 after five businessmen complained to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan of being cheated of ₹10 crore. Later many other businessmen also filed cheating complaints against him. A rape survivor also alleged Mavunkal forced her to withdraw the complaint against her tormentor.On Sunday, the state archaeology department said 35 of his main collections including Tipu Sultan’s throne were fake and had no antique value attached to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-probe-in-mavunkal-cases-not-needed-sit-tells-kerala-high-court-101638213031049.html
30-11-2021||India||Rains continue to lash south coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema||Heavy rains continued to pound the south coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema districts for the third consecutive day on Monday due to a depression in the Bay of Bengal, resulting in overflowing of streams and rivers, and massive inflows into reservoirs.According to official figures from AP State Development and Planning Society, Chillakur of Nellore district received a huge rainfall of 211.25 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours, followed by 182.25 mm in Atmakur, 150.25 mm in Sydapur, 144.25 mm in Muthukur and 140.50 in Naidupeta in the same district.In the adjacent Chittoor district, Irugulam of Satyavedu block witnessed a rainfall of 99.75 mm and Kanumole of Krishna district recorded 88.5 mm. Similar rainfall ranging from 55 mm to 80 mm was reported from Prakasam, Kadapa and Anantapur districts as well.According to Nellore district information department officials, heavy rains resulted in huge inflows into Somasila reservoir on Pennar river, forcing the authorities to release 1.15 lakh cusecs to the downstream.Similarly, the Swarnamukhi river, which has been in spate due to heavy rains in the upstream in Chittoor district, resulted in inundation of bridges and highways, and submergence of crops in thousands of acres. Several villages are reeling under the flood waters, a district official said.Meanwhile, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, reviewed the flood situation by holding a video conference with the district collectors of Nellore, Kadapa, Chittoor and Prakasam. He instructed them to take urgent steps to ensure that there are no leaks to ponds and interlink ponds and tanks.Earlier, the inter-ministerial central team met the chief minister at the camp office and discussed about the damages caused to the state during the last week’s floods. Jagan urged the Central team to be more compassionate and humanitarian in the entire approach of assessing the damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rains-continue-to-lash-south-coastal-andhra-rayalaseema-101638212968783.html

The case was initially handled by a special investigation team (SIT) of the state crime investigation department, but was later handed over to CBI following a petition from Vivekananda’s daughter Sunitha.On November 19, the CBI authorities arrested YSRC general secretary Shiva Shankar Reddy Devireddy, a close associate of Avinash Reddy, following a confession statement from the slain leader’s driver Sheik Dastagiri earlier this month.In his confession statement, Dastagri also named one Yerra Gangi Reddy and Avinash Reddy as co-conspirators in the murder of Vivekanda Reddy in connection with a land deal.A local court in Pulivendula on Saturday granted a seven-custody of Devireddy to the CBI for interrogation.However, Gangadhar Reddy, in his complaint to the Anantapur SP, alleged that Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter, in collusion with the CBI authorities, were trying to fix Avinash Reddy in the case. “They brought a pressure on me to give a statement in the court to saying that Avinash Reddy and Gangi Reddy had offered to pay me ₹10 crore, if I admit that I had committed the murder,” Gangadhar Reddy said.He said a senior police officer who was heading the SIT in the beginning, had also brought pressure on him to give a statement to implicate Avinash Reddy in the case. He requested the SP to provide him security, as he was facing threat to his life.Speaking to reporters, Fakeerappa said a deputy superintendent of police-rank official had been appointed to probe into the complaint lodged by Gangadhar Reddy. “We shall take up investigation in all angles and complete the probe within a week. We shall also provide security to Gangadhar Reddy,” the SP added.CBI senior official Ram Singh, probing the Vivekananda Reddy murder case, could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exandhra-minister-murder-case-suspect-accuses-cbi-of-bid-to-frame-kadapa-mp-101638212909934.html
30-11-2021||India||Pak’s decision to allow India’s aid to Afghanistan has a rider — Use Pakistan’s trucks||New Delhi: Pakistan has linked its decision to allow India to transport 50,000 tonnes of wheat and medicines as humanitarian aid to Afghanistan to the condition that the relief materials be moved by Pakistani trucks, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Officials of the two sides are engaged in discussions to find a solution to the impasse, especially in view of the looming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The Indian side is keen on using its own trucks as it wants to ensure that the relief materials directly reach the Afghan people without being diverted in any manner. The Indian side also envisages that the aid will be distributed only through the UN, the people said. India made the proposal for shipping the wheat and life-saving medicines to the people of Afghanistan via Pakistani soil on October 7, and received a response from the Pakistan government only on November 24. The people said Pakistan had attached several conditions to the shipment of the relief materials, besides the use of Pakistani trucks, but declined to go into details. It is understood that the Pakistani side is also seeking shipment charges from India for the use of its trucks. The people pointed out that the process of unloading and loading the relief materials at the Wagah border crossing would add to the logistical issues associated with the transportation of the goods. The Indian side has repeatedly said in recent weeks that there should be unimpeded and unhindered access to Afghanistan for relief supplies and that the United Nations should play the central role in humanitarian efforts. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had made it clear at a news briefing on Friday that no conditions should be attached by Pakistan to the shipment of the humanitarian aid. “This was about humanitarian access into Afghanistan for the delivery of the 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines we are supplying to the people of Afghanistan,” he said. “We are also working on the modalities with the Pakistan side. We believe that humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionalities,” he added. A joint communiqué issued after a meeting of foreign ministers of the Russia-India-China (RIC) mechanism on Friday had called for “immediate and unhindered humanitarian assistance to be provided to Afghanistan” in view of the deteriorating humanitarian situation. Pakistan has for long opposed two-way trade between India and Afghanistan via the Wagah land border crossing. It allowed the former Afghan government to export goods to India via the crossing, but barred any transportation of Indian goods to the Afghan side. There are currently no flights between India and Afghanistan, and transporting the materials via Pakistan was seen as the quickest way of getting the aid to the Afghan people, who are grappling with food shortages. Pakistan had said recently that it would allow the transportation of the Indian wheat and medicines via the Wagah border on an “exceptional basis” for humanitarian purposes and as a goodwill gesture towards the Afghan people. Even a Taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi that recently visited Islamabad had raised the issue of allowing the shipment of the wheat with the top Pakistani leadership. The UN has warned up to 23 million Afghans will be in “crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity” as winter sets in. Ten out of 11 of Afghanistan’s most densely populated urban areas are anticipated to be at emergency levels of food insecurity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paks-decision-to-allow-india-s-aid-to-afghanistan-has-a-rider-use-pakistan-s-trucks-101638212908726.html

Shows that the government knows that they have done something wrong. And that the government is scared,” Gandhi told reporters outside Parliament.The former Congress chief’s remarks came after ‘The Farm Laws Repeal Bill’ was passed in both Houses of Parliament to repeal the agricultural laws against which farmers have been protesting for over a year.The Congress leader said that the withdrawal of the laws is a success of farmers and also of the country.“What is unfortunate is how the bills have been repealed, without any discussion, without any conversation. We wanted to have a discussion about the forces behind these bills because these bills do not just reflect the view of the Prime Minister, these bills reflect the forces behind the Prime Minister and that is what we wanted to discuss,” he said.“We wanted to discuss MSP (issue), we wanted to discuss the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, we wanted to discuss the 700 farmers who died in this agitation and unfortunately that discussion has not been allowed,” he added.The Wayanad MP also suggested that the upcoming assembly elections in seven states must have played on the Centre’s mind while taking the decision to withdraw the contentious laws.“The upcoming state elections must have also played on their mind,” he said.Hitting back at the Congress leader, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said: “The Opposition doesn’t want any work to be done. They just want to occupy media space.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-of-farm-laws-sans-discussion-shows-govt-is-scared-rahul-gandhi-101638212849337.html

With a cost of nearly ₹260,000 crore ( ₹2.6 trillion), the scheme assures that over 80 crore people have food to cook in their homes.”The cabinet on November 24 approved a proposal to extend the PMGKAY, a scheme to distribute free grains per month as a Covid-19 relief measure to two-thirds of India’s population, who were identified as beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act, until March 2022.The cost of extending the scheme for the next four months stands at approximately ₹53,000 crore, according to a cabinet note.Under PMGKAY, the government provides 5 kg of food grain per person per month to 793.9 million beneficiaries. These recipients are covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013 and therefore also receive subsidised cereals every month.The PMGKAY was meant to provide higher quantities of food handouts during the pandemic. It was launched in March 2020 for the April-June 2020 period, but was extended until November 30, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-ration-scheme-s-extension-to-benefit-800-million-beneficiaries-pmmodi-101638212670391.html
30-11-2021||India||Farm laws repealed: First major victory of farmers’ protest, says SKM||Farm unions on Monday termed the repeal of three agricultural laws by Parliament as a historic victory but criticised the government for repealing the laws without a discussion. Both Houses of Parliament passed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill 2021 by voice vote to annul the laws enacted in September 2020 to liberalise the trade of farm produce.Also Read | Bill to repeal farm laws passedThe protests against the laws first began as sporadic demonstrations in Punjab in October 2020 but snowballed into a full-blown political uprising against the Modi government, spreading to several states in the course of a year, including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.During a nationally televised address on November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said his government would withdraw the three laws.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of over 40 farm unions, said the repeal was proof of success of its year-long agitation. It vowed to continue the farmers’ movement until all their “rightful demands” were met.“History has been made today. This is the first major victory of the farmers’ movement today, while other important demands are still pending,” a joint statement by farm unions, issued through SKM, stated.“The anti-farmer, pro-corporate black farm laws have been repealed in India’s Parliament without any discussion. The government of India was forced to take this step because of a historic farmers’ struggle,” it added.Also Read | Repeal of farm laws sans discussion shows govt is scared: Rahul GandhiAhead of the Parliament session, farm minister Narendra Tomar appealed to farmers to end their agitation since the government was withdrawing the laws. Key farm leaders responded by saying they would wait till December 4 for a response on a letter written by them to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, enlisting their demands that are yet to be met.Besides a statutory guarantee for MSP, the farmers want a parcel of land for a memorial to peasants who died during the year-long protests, and all criminal cases slapped against farmers during the course of their agitation to be withdrawn.They have also sought changes to a proposed electricity bill to keep energy prices cheap for farmers and modifications to an anti-pollution law in force in the National Capital Region that includes provisions to penalise farmers burning paddy straw, the cause of deadly winter smog in north India.“Protesting farmers continue to wait patiently and hopefully yet again, for the government to address their pending demands. It can be seen that nearly all Opposition political parties of India are putting their weight behind these demands including MSP legal guarantee,” said Darshan Pal, a key farm leader.He said the protests by farmers will continue, and a decision on marching to Delhi will be taken on December 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-repealed-first-major-victory-of-farmers-protest-says-skm-101638212669018.html
30-11-2021||India||Param Bir Singh meets Sachin Vaze privately for about an hour; Mumbai police probe ‘lapse’||Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Monday met dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and spoke to him for about an hour at the Old Secretariat Building in Mumbai from where the justice K U Chandiwal commission is conducting enquiry proceedings – prompting an immediate investigation by Mumbai Police into what the department termed a “lapse”.At 10.30 am, Singh went to his own office – he is commandant general of Maharashtra Home Guards – on first floor of the building in south Mumbai, according to people familiar with the matter. At about 11.00 am, he appeared before the commission on the upper floor of the same building and got the bailable warrant against him cancelled.Singh filed an affidavit explaining that he could not appear before the commission earlier on account of health issues, and about 10 minutes later went to the adjoining room, the people added, requesting anonymity.Even as the commission completed formalities of cancelling the warrant against Singh, the 56-year-old Indian Police Service officer met Vaze in the adjoining room. Vaze, arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Antilia bomb scare case and the connected murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, and lodged at Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai, was brought at the commission for cross examination by lawyers of several parties to the enquiry.The meeting between Singh and Vaze occurred with prior permission of the commission, a lawyer familiar with Monday’s development said on condition of anonymity.The commission’s lawyer, Shishir Hiray, disputed it. “As per my knowledge, no permission was taken from the special NIA court for any such meeting,” he said. Vaze is in judicial custody of the NIA court hearing the Antilla and Hiran cases.Singh was removed as police chief for his mishandling of the case, and shortly after went public with allegations that the state’s home minister Anil Deshmukh asked Vaze to extort money from restaurants and bars. Deshmukh was forced to resign as home minister and is currently being investigated by both the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate. Meanwhile, five cases have been filed against Singh.Deshmukh’s lawyer took strong objection to the meeting and pointed out the fact to retired judge Chandiwal.Justice Chandiwal, however, ignored the objections. “How can I keep watch on everything and stop them from meeting,” asked the retired high court judge. “But, to avoid such situation in the future, it’s better that he (Vaze) sits in this room (where the commission is functioning from).”Taking serious note of the meeting between the two accused, Mumbai Police on Monday launched an enquiry into the incident.“An assistant commissioner of police conducted preliminary inquiry into the apparent lapse. After recording statements of the police escort party, a sub-inspector and three police constables, a report of the inquiry was handed over to Navi Mumbai police for further action. The escort party personnel are attached to Navi Mumbai police,” said Hari Balaji N, deputy commissioner of police.After being incommunicado for months, Singh, a 1988 batch IPS officer, resurfaced at his home town Chandigarh on November 24, two days after the Supreme Court gave him protection from arrest by Maharashtra Police and directed him to join investigations in the pending cases against him.He came back to Mumbai on Thursday and joined investigations in the cases against him being conducted by the Mumbai crime branch and Thane police. Singh is slated to appear this week before the state’s Criminal Investigation Department, which is investigating three cases against him..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-meets-sachin-vaze-privately-for-about-an-hour-mumbai-police-probe-lapse-101638212433934.html
30-11-2021||India||557 women officers granted Permanent Commission since landmark SC order: Govt in Rajya Sabha||The government on Monday told Parliament that 557 short service commission women officers have been granted permanent commission in the Indian Army after the Supreme Court passed an order on February 17, 2020. There has been no delay in granting permanent commission to any woman officer, junior defence minister Ajay Bhatt said in a written response to a question in the Rajya Sabha. “Sixty three eligible women officers have been granted permanent commission” as on November 25, 2021, in line with the Supreme Court judgment, he said, referring to a November 12 order by the apex court. The Supreme Court on November 12 spared the army of contempt proceedings after the force changed its position on denying permanent commission to 72 women short service commission officers, agreeing to grant it to all women officers who have qualified on merit and have no disciplinary or vigilance clearance pending against them. Of the 72 women officers, 36 filed contempt petitions earlier this month in the top court that were taken up for hearing by a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna. These petitions said the Indian Army was in contempt of the apex court’s March 25 order that said all women short service commission officers who qualify with 60% merit, are medically fit, and have secured disciplinary and vigilance clearance, are to be granted permanent commission. In all, 514 women qualified on the basis of the 60% benchmark, of which 442 were given permanent commission; the other 72 were denied this by the selection board that met in September 2020. One officer opted for premature release from service, reducing the number to 71. On November 12, the defence ministry submitted an affidavit stating that out of 36 officers, 21 have since been granted permanent commission upon review and letters in this regard were issued to them on October 29. The case of one officer was under consideration, leaving 14. Of this, the affidavit added, three were found to be medically unfit, while there were serious objections against 11 others. After some prodding from the court, it agreed to grant permanent commission to these 11, and also consider similarly the case of the 36 others who did not file a contempt petition. The women short service commission officers secured their right to permanent commission and command positions in non-combat streams at par with male officers after a prolonged legal battle culminating in the Supreme Court order on February 17, 2020. The women officers again came to the court in September 2020, complaining against the whimsical standards on merit, medical fitness applied by Selection Board to deny them their due. This resulted in the March 25 order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/557-women-officers-granted-permanent-commission-since-landmark-sc-order-govt-in-rajya-sabha-101638212310163.html

The plan will also depend on whether opposition parties get a chance to demand a law to guarantee crop support in Parliament after they failed to debate the farm bill.”We would be left with no other choice but to boycott if we don’t get any opportunity to raise the MSP (minimum support prices) law and related issues,” a Congress strategist said on condition of anonymity.“We will meet tomorrow to decide the future course,” Elamaram Kareem of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) told HT. “We have received suggestions to boycott the session.

A joint statement of 14 political parties, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), said, “The floor leaders of opposition parties of Rajya Sabha will meet tomorrow to deliberate on the future course of action to resist the authoritarian decision of the government and defend parliamentary democracy.”West Bengal’s ruling TMC took an independent stand in isolation from the Congress and decided to take its own call. The party did not come for Monday’s opposition meeting, which was attended by the TRS for the first time. TRS leader K Kesava Rao attacked the government over the passage of the farm repeal bill in the Rajya Sabha,TMC’s reluctance to attend Congress-led meetings comes in the backdrop of growing distance between the two parties, especially after the TMC poached several lawmakers and senior leaders from the Congress in recent months.TMC leaders deplored the suspension of their party MPs. They termed the punitive action as unconstitutional and said the accused were not heard before suspending them. “We will have a meeting on Tuesday morning and decide our future course of action within the parliamentary process,” TMC leader Derek O’Brien said.Opposition parties were looking forward to a debate on the Farm Laws Repeal Bill to push for a legal backing for the MSP framework. But with the bill passed amid din on Monday, they will evaluate afresh their chances to discuss any proposed MSP law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-to-decide-on-parliament-strategy-today-may-skip-entire-winter-session-101638212068709.html

He accused the government of taking the House for a ride.The Rajya Sabha also took a decision to suspend 12 Opposition MPs from the house for the entire winter session for their behaviour on August 11, a day when the upper house saw the most disturbance.In his comments, the PM said the measure of the work done in Parliament should be the hours spent on discussion and debate and not disruptions.He expressed hope that in the spirit of Amrit Mahotsav (the celebration of the 75th year of Indian independence) law makers would find ways for progress of the country and the session is know for “constructive decisions”.“I hope in future, how Parliament was run and how constructive the proceedings were should be the measure and not how it was disrupted,” he said.In the wake of reports about a new variant spreading through various countries, the PM said the country needs to be more vigilant and alert.

30-11-2021||India||Don’t precipitate inquiry against Bengal’s Alapan Bandopadhyay, SC orders Centre||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre not to precipitate action in the disciplinary proceedings initiated against former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay as it reserved orders on an appeal by the Centre challenging the Calcutta High Court order that that stayed transfer of the disciplinary case pending against the bureaucrat from Kolkata to Delhi. An assurance in this regard was extended by solicitor general Tushar Mehta after senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Bandopadhyay told the court that the Centre is precipitating the matter with the next hearing of the disciplinary enquiry kept on Tuesday.“We are reserving the matter for orders. Till we decide, do not precipitate the enquiry,” the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said. Mehta said, “Till the court decides, we will not.”Bandopadhyay, a 1987 batch IAS officer from West Bengal cadre retired as West Bengal chief secretary on May 31 this year after the Centre ordered him to report to the central government on deputation. The sudden transfer order came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kolkata on May 28 to review the destruction caused by cyclone ‘Yaas’.Bandopadhyay, who was accompanying chief minister Mamata Banerjee, did not attend the meeting chaired by the prime minister during his Bengal visit. The IAS officer, who has since then been appointed special adviser to Banerjee, was with Mamata Banerjee when she handed over a report to PM Modi on the cyclone situation, and left during the meeting to assist her visit to the remaining cyclone-ravaged areas.On his last day in office, the IAS officer was served a show-cause notice under section 51 of the National Disaster Management Act 2005 (NDMA). On June 16, a major penalty charge sheet was issued to him by the Centre under the All India Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules 1969 for missing PM Modi’s meeting.Bandopadhyay approached the central administrative tribunal (CAT) at Kolkata as retired government servants can file petition at the place where they are residing after retirement. However, the CAT principal bench issued an order transferring the case to itself at Delhi. This order was passed on October 22 against which he approached the Calcutta high court and obtained a stay.Challenging the high court relief granted on October 29, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the top court that the high court was without jurisdiction to pass orders as the order under challenge was passed by CAT principal bench at Delhi against which a challenge will only lie in the Delhi high court. Mehta also objected to the disparaging remarks made by the high court in its order where it said that the modus operandi of the Centre “reeks of malafide”.Mehta said, “These are observations coloured with political overtones. High court has to be circumspect and sober in its comments and these are not acceptable.”The high court judgment also attacked the CAT principal bench terming its order to transfer the case as an overzealous act thereby “paying obeisance to the diktat of the Union of India.”Singhvi said the officer in question never intended to disparage or hurt anyone and argued that the petition by Centre was not maintainable since it will imply that all retired employees will be forced to approach Delhi to suit the Centre’s convenience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-precipitate-inquiry-against-bengal-s-alapan-bandopadhyay-sc-orders-centre-101638211415578.html

It was not an adversarial meeting, the persistent questions focused on getting at the nitty gritty of the issue.”Facebook did not respond to requests for a comment.HT has learnt that committee chairperson Tharoor also sought the members’ consent to call Facebook whistleblower Sophie Zhang to speak before the panel. “The panel was unanimous in saying that she should be invited to speak. Protocol will be followed and the request will be routed through the Speaker’s office,” the person quoted above said.Zhang has shared details with the panel, which is analysing the material.Last month, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen sent a complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission citing internal documents that back some of these allegations. Haugen has already testified before the US Senate and UK Parliament.Zhang has earlier exposed the company’s partisan policy in removing inauthentic accounts from the social media platform, some of which were ahead of the 2020 Delhi elections, she told HT in an interview last month. Zhang is among several former Facebook employees and contractors who have said that the company’s policies and management are leading to harm. In a tweet last month, she had also said she would be willing to testify before the Indian Parliament.Also Read | Submit data on complaints: Delhi assembly panel to FacebookThe disclosed documents contend users, groups and pages linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh promote Islamophobia and “fear mongering”, and that the company failed to put “forth a nomination or designation” for other right-wing groups such as the Bajrang Dal given “political sensitiveness”.This, however, was not the first time Facebook has been accused of not censoring political content related to the party power.

30-11-2021||India||How to read today’s GDP numbers?||The National Statistical Office (NSO) will release GDP data for the July-September quarter of the current fiscal year today. In its October meeting, the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee projected a GDP growth of 7.9% for this period. A Bloomberg forecast of 14 economists has projected the number to be 8.1%. The headline number aside, how should one read today’s GDP numbers? Here are five charts that answer this question.Base effect will continue to play a big role in the GDP growth numbersIndia’s GDP fell by a record 7.3% in 2020-21. This was largely on account of the massive contraction in the first half (April-September) in 2020-21 because of the 68-day nationwide lockdown that began on March 25, 2020. India’s GDP suffered a contraction of 24.4% and 7.4% in the quarters ending June 2020 and September 2020.Economic activity inched back to normal with a GDP growth of 0.5% and 1.6% in the quarters ending December 2020 and March 2021. While GDP growth in the June quarter was 20.1%, in absolute terms, GDP was lower than that in the corresponding pre-pandemic quarter of June 2019.The economic disruption due to the second wave of Covid-19, which it peaked on May 9 in terms of seven-day average of daily new cases, played a major role in derailing economic momentum once again in the June quarter. If the central bank’s projection of 7.9% holds for the September quarter, GDP for the quarter ( ₹35.56 lakh crore at 2011-12 prices) will still be marginally lower than that in the September 2019 (35.61 lakh crore). However, if the Bloomberg projection holds, the September number (35.63 lakh crore) will be higher than the pre-pandemic value. This small difference notwithstanding, the base effect should be kept in mind while reading the growth numbers.Growth by sectors will be far more interestingThe pandemic did not affect all parts of the economy the same way. Agriculture, for example, did not suffer a contraction even when the lockdown was the harshest. Sectors such as finance and knowledge based services – it was the easiest for them to shift to remote work methods – did not suffer much during the pandemic.On the other hand, contact intensive services suffered the most. This is best seen in a comparison of June 2019 Gross Value Added (GVA) numbers by sectors with the June figures. It shows a great variation in the extent of recovery, or lack of it, across sectors. It will be worth watching for in the September GVA numbers as well. The sector-wise nature of recovery matters because the employment intensity of sectors varies significantly.High frequency indicators suggest the formal economy did well in the September quarterIf high frequency indicators such as Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) are any indicators, the formal economy made a strong comeback from the disruption from the second wave of the pandemic. PMI Manufacturing fell to 48.1 in June but jumped to 55.3 in July and has stayed above the critical threshold of 50 since then. A reading above 50 shows expansion. PMI Services also jumped above 50 in August. NIBRI crossed the psychological threshold of 100 for the first time after the pandemic in the week ending August 15 and has stayed above 100 since then.These numbers might not tell the informal sector storyThe gap between formal and informal parts of the Indian economy has widened in the post-pandemic period. Some statistics that offer a good proxy for the state of the informal economy, especially its labour markets, suggest that this gap might have persisted during the September quarter as well.Demand for rural jobs guarantee work has not declined despite a sharp recovery in formal sector high frequency indicators. Rural wages, which are a bellwether for blue-collar employment, had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels until August, the latest period for which data is available. Informal sector numbers take time to show in the GDP statistics, and today’s numbers must be read with this caveat in mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-read-today-s-gdp-numbers-101638211229139.html
30-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 30, 1967 — West Bengal Assembly prorogued; Speaker adjourns House, holds Ghosh Government illegal||Calcutta - The West Bengal Legislative Assembly was prorogued tonight. The Secretary of the Assembly, announcing this, said the “Governor has directed that the Assembly do stand prorogued with effect from Nov. 30.” This followed an unprecedented ruling of Speaker Bijoy Banerjee in the State Assembly earlier in the day that the dismissal of the Ajoy Mukherjee Ministry was illegal. Mr Banerjee, who was elected Speaker with the backing of the UF, declared that he was adjourning the House since he was satisfied that prima facie the dissolution of the Mukherjee Ministry, the appointment of Dr Ghosh as Chief Minister and the summoning of the Assembly on his advice were unconstitutional and invalid. The Speaker held that these decisions were effected “behind the back of this House.” According to him, the only authority competent to decide whether or not a Council of Ministers should continue in office “is this House.” He questioned the discretion of the Governor in regard to the appointment of Ministers refused to recognize Dr Ghosh’s Ministry and expressed “grave doubts” about the validity of this session of the Assembly. Pending a full and proper examination of the issues involved, he said, he was adjourning the House sine die in exercise of powers vested in him under Rule 15 of the rules of procedure. No UF motion Immediately after the House dispersed, Dr Ghosh’s Progressive Democratic Front and the Congress Assembly party at an emergency joint meeting decided to table no-confidence motions against the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. In their view the Assembly was still in session. A letter signed by 146 members (128 Congress and 18 PDF) was sent to the Speaker, with a copy to the Governor, stating that the Speaker had no right or jurisdiction to go over the order of the Governor dismissing the Mukherjee Ministry. They regretted that the Speaker had thought it fit to pass a “wholly illegal and unjustified” order adjourning the House and declared that his action was a “total nullity” and beyond his legal competence. Significantly, the United Front had ‘ not tabled a motion of no-confidence in the Ghosh Ministry nor was it willing to face a vote of confidence tabled by the PDF and the Congress Party. The adjournment of the Assembly has no impact on the Ghosh Ministry which continues in power. There is no constitutional breakdown since the Ministry has not been defeated in the House nor has it been dismissed by the Governor. Some constitutional method has, however, to be found in case the Speaker refuses to reconvene the Assembly to face the no-confidence motion against him. This is being examined by legal experts. Tense atmosphere The Assembly met in tense atmosphere. In view of elaborate police precautions, there could be no march to the Assembly by UP supporters. But UF MLAs entered the House in a militant mood, shouting anti-Ghosh slogans. Dr Ghosh, who had occupied his seat on the treasury benches, took the insults calmly. However, immediately after the Speaker had left the House, opposition members surged towards the Chief Minister and one of them threw a wooden piece on Dr Ghosh. A few books and other things were also hurled on Dr Ghosh. As a result, Dr Ghosh was slightly injured. Reacting sharply to the incidents in the House, Dr Ghosh said: “They (UF MLAs) have behaved like cowards. I will not be cowed down by such goondaism. If they want to behave in this way, they will have to face the consequences.” UF MLAs were understandably overjoyed by the Speaker’s action. Mr Jyoti Basu commented: “History has been created. A great fight for democracy has been put up by the Speaker.” Talking to newsmen in his chamber, the Speaker made a grievance that he had not been invited to the swearing-in ceremony of the Ghosh Ministry at Raj Bhavan. He came to know of the dismissal of the Mukherjee Ministry and the assumption of office of the Ghosh Ministry only through radio. ‘I’he Governor had done everything behind the Speaker. He said he had only adjourned the House sine die. This did not mean that the session was over. He did not know when he could recall the Assembly. He would take time since he had to examine the constitutional position regarding the new Ministry. Some Congress members tried to raise objections when the Speaker read his statement, but he did not give way. Congress members were saying that since the Speaker had adjourned the House in his opening remarks, the rest of his statement from the chair had no validity. Speaking to newsmen outside the House, Mr Bejoy Singh Nahar, deputy leader of the Congress Party, said: “The Soeaker cannot criticize the Governor’s actions nor can the House discuss any such action on the floor.” Mr Pratap Chandra Chunder, secretary of the Congress Assembly party, said the Speaker’s action was illegal. The UF had been given a chance to prove their strength, if they thought they had the majority. But by creating disorder, they had exposed their own weakness. The following is the full text of the Speaker’s speech: “Honourable members, this House meets under extraordinary circumstances. I am prima facie satisfied that the dessolution of the Ministry headed by Shri Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee, the appointment of Dr P. C. Ghosh as Chief Minister and the summoning of this House on his advice is unconstitutional and in valid since it has been effected behind the back of this House. Pending a full and proper examination of the matter, in exercise of the powers vested in me under Rule 15 of the rules of procedure of this Assembly. I adjourn the House sine die. “The House will remember that when it was prorogued on Aug. 3, the Council of Ministers was headed by Chief Minister Ajoy Mukherjee and others. This was the Council of Ministers that was collectively responsible to this House in terms of Article 164(2) of the Constitution. “As I understand the constitutional position, the only authority competent to decide whether or not a Council of Ministers should continue in office is this House. An adverse vote against the Council of Ministers in this House necessarily leads to a position when that particular Council of Ministers no longer enjoys the confidence of this House and hence its continuance in office would be a violation of Article 164(2) of the Constitution. ‘High precedent’“I am happy to state that this understanding of mine is supported by high precedent. In March 1945, the then Government of Bengal was defeated in a vote taken on the demand for a grant in respect of agriculture.“The question arose as to the constitutional consequence of such a defeat. At that time my predecessor in office, Shri Nausher Ali, put the essence of the matter in clear terms. “To quote him: “Sir Nazimuddin (the then Chief Minister) said yesterday that he would treat this as a snap division and not a censure. I am afraid the constitutional position has not been properly conceived. The Ministry is the creature of the House. This House can make and unmake the Ministry and the Governor is but the registering authority of the House. Any other course, I am afraid. would strike at the very root of democracy.” “No doubt the circumstances facing Shri Nausher Ali were different. But the essence of the matter, namely, that this House is the supreme authority in regard to making and unmaking ministries, is the same. And this statement came from the lips of a presiding officer of this House when India was not free. Today when a sovereign Indian people have given to themselves a Constitution, surely the authority of this House has increased and not diminished. Governor’s position “This is why I find it extremely difficult to recognize Dr Prafulla Chandra Ghosh as Chief Minister and his colleagues Mr Harendra Nath Majumdar and Mr Amir Ali Mollah as members of the Council of Ministers. Both the text of the articles of the Constitution and the precedent quoted above recognize no discretion in the Governor in respect of the appointment of the Council of Ministers. He is merely a registering authority to use the expression of my predecessor, an authority whose constitutional duty is to recognize and implement the decisions of this House. “To an extent I have attempted to examine the method of which behind the back of this august Assembly, the Council of Ministers responsible to it has been removed. It would appear that on 21-11-6’7 the Governor of this State issued an order under Article 164(1) whereby he proposed to order that the Chief Minister, Mr Aloy Kumar Mukherjee, shall cease to hold office with immediate effect. He further “directed that the Council of Ministers headed by him stands dissolved and other Ministers cease to hold office.‘Prima facie’ “A careful reading of Article 164(1) does not disclose the vesting of any such power of dissolution of a Council of Ministers by a Governor. Hence I do not find any legal basis for the act of dissolution. “I may also mention that the argument has been advanced that the words in Article 164(1) ‘the Ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor’ vest in the Governor me power to dismiss a Ministry. But this argument is without merit. For the same expression ‘pleasure of the Governor’ finds place in Article 165(3) with regard to the appointment of the Advocate-General. And none will question the appointment of the Advocate-General is not within the Governor’s discretion but has to be done on the advice of the Council of Ministers. “On a prima facie examination of the constitutional questions involved, I find it impossible to recognize as legal, valid and constitutional the dissolution of the Council of Ministers headed by Mr Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee. “It follows then that the appointment of the Council of Ministers headed by Dr P. C. Ghosh as Chief Minister is invalid and unconstitutional. “The order by which the Council of Ministers headed by Mr Ajoy Mukherje was dissolved is dated 21-11-67. This Assembly, however, has been summoned ‘ under an order of the Governor which was issued only on 22.11.67. In view of this I am unable to appreciate how this session of this Assembly can have any constitutional or legal validity. For if the order of the Governor of 21-11-67 is illegal and unconstitutional, evidently the Council of Ministers headed by Mr Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee not only continues in office but it alone is competent to advise the Governor on the manner in which he is to exercise his powers under Article 174(1), namely, the power to summon this Assembly. And only an Assembly summoned by the Governor acting under such advice would be validly and properly summoned. I must, therefore, confess my grave doubts about the validity of this session of the Assembly. His duty “Honourable members will appreciate that the Constitution and the rules of procedure charge me with the high responsibility of protecting the dignity and privileges of this august Assembly. And I would be failing in my duty if I did not uphold the rights and powers of this House in the face of attempts to infringe and restrict such rights. “The matters in issue are of higher constitutional importance. It is my regret that when an attempt was made to refer them for the opinion of the Supreme Court under Article 143 such attempt was frustrated. It is beyond dispute that the issues go to the very root of democracy. It is obvious, therefore, that if I am to find out how exactly I should act so as to preserve and protect the privileges of this House I should need more time and then only give a considered ruling on the grave issues at stake. “This is why in exercise of my powers under Rule 15. I have adjourned the House sine die.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-november-30-1967-west-bengal-assembly-prorogued-speaker-adjourns-house-holds-ghosh-government-illegal-101638211109117.html
30-11-2021||India||No plan to recognise Bitcoin, Sitharaman tells Parliament||The government is not considering any proposal to recognise Bitcoin as a currency in India, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told Parliament on Monday.In a written reply to a specific question – whether the government has any proposal to recognise Bitcoin as a currency in the country – Sitharaman said: “No, sir.” The query on Bitcoin was jointly raised in the Lok Sabha by two members of Parliament.The government plans to introduce a bill in the Parliament’s ongoing winter session to ban all private cryptocurrencies, or virtual currencies (VCs). Bitcoin is one of the popular private cryptocurrencies.Replying to another question on a similar matter in the House, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary on Monday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in October, proposed including digital currency in the definition of a bank note, something that will require an amendment to the RBI Act, 1934. “Cryptocurrencies are unregulated in India,” he added. Private VCs do not carry any sovereign guarantee and offer anonymity, unlike a fiat currency. The government has scheduled the introduction of the “Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021” in the Winter Session of Parliament with the purpose to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India”, but the bill will have “certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses”, according to a bulletin issued by the Lok Sabha last week.The government, however, intends to move ahead with a plan to authorise RBI to float its own digital currency. Technically known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), these are distinct from cryptocurrencies in the manner that they are regulated by a centralised authority – the central bank.On another specific query – whether the government is aware that Bitcoin transaction is silently blooming in India in the recent years – Sitharaman said: “The government does not collect data on Bitcoin transactions.”The currency is not banned and the government has initiated the process of enacting a law to regulate VCs.There’s also a school of thought that believes the government could continue to allow cryptocurrencies as an asset class (like mutual funds), not currency. “It has been stated position of the government that it does not consider private cryptocurrencies as legal tender, and it will take all measures to eliminate use of these assets as a payment system, which can often be used in financing illegitimate activities,” an official aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.Earlier in 2018, the central bank cautioned both people and its regulated entities such as scheduled commercial banks against the risks associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and advised banks not to deal with such currencies. The Supreme Court, however, set aside the RBI circular on March 4, 2020.Earlier this month, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das sounded an alarm on cryptocurrencies, cautioning investors on the potential pitfalls of the digital currencies. The central bank says private VCs pose serious threats to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country, and also doubted the number of investors trading on them as well as their claimed market value.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-recognise-bitcoin-sitharaman-tells-parliament-101638210869169.html
30-11-2021||India||Bill to repeal farm laws passed||It took three minutes in the Lok Sabha and 35 in the Rajya Sabha to pass a legislation repealing three contentious farm laws amid protests by opposition parties on Monday.The bill now awaits the assent of President Ram Nath Kovind for the formal withdrawal of the three laws, whose repeal was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 after yearlong protests by farmer groups who opposed the pieces of legislation that were aimed at liberalising farm trade.“During the Covid period, farmers worked hard to increase production and fulfil the needs of the nation. As we celebrate the 75th Year of Independence — ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, the need of the hour is to take everyone together on the path of inclusive growth and development,” said the statement of objects and reasons of the repeal bill.The legislation noted that “the operation of the aforesaid farm laws has been stayed” by the Supreme Court. The statement also mentioned that “even though only a group of farmers” were protesting, the government “tried hard to sensitise them” on the importance of the farm laws and explain the merits.Opposition parties, who planned to use the opportunity to demand a law on guaranteed crop prices and corner the government on agricultural issues, will meet on Tuesday to decide a future course of action. Farm unions, who led a yearlong agitation against the three laws, welcomed the repeal but criticised the government for passing the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, without any discussion.Protests by the Opposition erupted as soon as the Winter Session of Parliament began at 11am. By that time, government managers had indicated in the business advisory committee meeting of the respective Houses that the bill would be passed without debate, said people aware of the developments. They had argued in those closed-door meetings that repeal bills didn’t require a debate and a divisive discussion could be avoided when everyone wanted the laws to be repealed.To be sure, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said at least five times that he would allow the debate, but protesting opposition leaders who had trooped in the Well of the House didn’t stop protests. “Today, at the start of the Winter Session, when we took up the bill in Lok Sabha for repealing, why did Opposition create ruckus? What is Opposition’s intention behind delaying the repeal bill?” asked parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi.In the Rajya Sabha, leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge spoke briefly.“There would be elections in five states. And they (the ruling side) thought that after the recent bypoll results (where the Bharatiya Janata Party suffered some reverses) , what might happen in those state elections. So, they turned their attention to these bills,” he said. He also said that lawmakers in both Houses, non-governmental organisations and farmers maintained that the bills were not helpful for farmers, but the government didn’t listen.Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar hit back at Kharge. “The Congress in its manifesto had promised to bring these bills. Now they have a double standards. We brought the bill for farmers’ welfare. Since we couldn’t convince all farmers, the PM showed a historic magnanimity,” the minister said.After the bill was passed, Tomar also pointed out that procurement under the minimum support price (MSP) regime had doubled since 2014, when Narendra Modi swept to power at the Centre. “Earlier only wheat and paddy came under the MSP. But now, under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, MSP procurement also covers oilseeds, pulses and cotton,” he said.Government functionaries gave out data to show that in 1998 and 2006, two bills were passed by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the same day. Opposition leaders argued that in 22 cases, repeal bills were discussed and debated in the House before passage.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the way the repeal bill was passed was “an insult to the farmers”. “We wanted to discuss MSP (issue), we wanted to discuss the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, we wanted to discuss the 700 farmers who died in this agitation and unfortunately that discussion has not been allowed,” Gandhi said, alleging that the laws were withdrawn for the upcoming assembly elections.The reference was to the deaths of eight people in violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri last month. Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, is one of the accused in the case.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, were passed in September last year. Almost immediately, protests began in the grain bowl states of Punjab and Haryana and snowballed into a full-blown political uprising, spreading to several states in the course of a year, including Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.The three laws were aimed at opening up farm trade but farm unions said the legislation left them at the mercy of large corporations. During a nationally televised address on November 19, PM Modi said his government will withdraw the three laws. The decision came ahead of high-stakes elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous state, and Punjab, where farmers are an influential bloc.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of over 40 farm unions, said the repeal was proof of success of its yearlong agitation. It vowed to continue the farmers’ movement until all their “rightful demands” were met.Also Read | Farm laws repealed: First major victory of farmers’ protest, says SKM“History has been made today. This is the first major victory of the farmers’ movement today, while other important demands are still pending,” a joint statement by farm unions, issued through the SKM, stated.Ahead of the Parliament session, Tomar appealed to farmers to end their agitation. Key farm leaders responded by saying they would wait till December 4 for a response on a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, enlisting their demands that are yet to be met.Besides a statutory guarantee for MSP, the farmers want a parcel of land for a memorial to peasants who died during the yearlong protests and all criminal cases slapped against farmers during the course of their agitation to be withdrawn.They have also sought changes to a proposed electricity bill to keep energy prices cheap for farmers and modifications to an anti-pollution law in force in the national capital region that includes provisions to penalise farmers burning paddy straw, the cause of the deadly winter smog in north India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-repeal-farm-laws-passed-101638210810517.html
30-11-2021||India||No fatalities linked to new variant but WHO cautious||The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Monday the new Covid-19 Omicron variant poses a “very high” risk globally, despite uncertainties about its behaviour that will be established only in the next few weeks, as more countries rolled out new curbs to keep the mutation at bay.Also Read | ‘Be alert to threat of Omicron’: PM Modi warns amid rising concernsThe global health body said it was coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand Omicron, with studies underway, including assessments of transmissibility, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatments.For now, Omicron appears to be a “highly divergent variant with a high number of mutations... the likelihood of potential further spread of Omicron at the global level is high,” the WHO cautioned in a technical note.To date, no deaths connected with the new variant of concern (VOC) have been reported, it added. But even if “another surge of Covid-19 takes place driven by Omicron, consequences may be severe”, the agency added.Researchers in South Africa, where the variant was first discovered and where the largest numbers of people confirmed to be infected with it are, said their early assessments show Omicron is more transmissible than its predecessors, but existing vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe illness and death.Also Read | India offers vaccines, medical supplies to support African countries hit by Omicron variantSalim Karim, a South African clinical infectious disease epidemiologist, said on Monday that there is no need to panic, AP reported. “We know how to assess this and adjust our strategies accordingly,” he said during an online briefing.South Africa anticipates that it will be detecting more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases by the end of the week, up from fewer than 3,000 on Saturday, with hospital admissions already showing a slight increase.Nations around the world sought to keep the variant at bay with travel bans and further restrictions.Japan announced it was restricting the arrivals of all international passengers, and Australia said it will delay its planned reopening of borders to foreign citizens migrating for study and work.Elsewhere, more regions confirmed they have detected the new VOC: Canada said it detected two cases in people linked to travel with Nigeria, and Scotland said it found two cases of local transmission and 13 people were discovered to have contracted it at a Portuguese soccer club.Besides South Africa and UK, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic and Australia have confirmed cases of the variant.Even as countries consider these steps, experts and scientists said the true nature of the threat will only become clearer over the next couple of weeks. “What we do not know yet is vaccine efficacy – what is the impact of the variant on vaccine protection. This will only become clear in the next one or two weeks,” Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said in an interview to CNBC on Monday.“I don’t believe many people would have predicted such a big jump in evolution in one variant,” he said.Both Moderna and BioNTech, the developers of the two successful mRNA vaccines, said they are exploring Omicron-targeting doses which could be ready within the next three months.WHO in its note on Monday said countries should enhance their surveillance to try to get a clear overview of where and how fast it is spreading and urged accelerated vaccinations, especially among vulnerable populations who have yet to receive any jabs.But it has cautioned against imposing travel bans, fearing that blocking travel from countries where new variants are first spotted could be unfair and dissuade surveillance.The UK government has asked its experts to consider the merits of expanding the booster program to millions more people under the age of 40 and cutting the time period for a third jab.Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations, told the BBC that it was “really important that we get the immunity levels in the population high” in case the Omicron variant is more transmissible or protection from the vaccines is reduced.India on Sunday unveiled new guidelines for international travellers, dropping vaccinations as a condition to exempt people from mandatory test-on-arrival if they are travelling from a list of “at risk” countries.Now, anyone flying in from these regions will need to wait at the airport till test results arrive, and will be taken to isolation facilities if they are found infected, following which samples will be genotyped to see if the pathogen they are carrying is Omicron. Those who test negative will need to quarantine at home for a week and take a test on the eighth day mandatorily.All European and most southern African countries are on the list of 12 at-risk regions identified by India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-fatalities-linked-to-new-variant-but-who-cautious-101638210747975.html
30-11-2021||India||Bombay high court asks Centre for update on proposed cryptocurrency bill||The Bombay high court on Monday directed the Union government to update it on the proposed cryptocurrency legislation expected to be tabled during Parliament’s ongoing winter session.The high court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions for the government to enact appropriate laws to address the growing threat of cryptocurrencies and malpractices at trading platforms. The petition, filed by advocate Aditya Kadam, stated that in the absence of appropriate legislation and statutory authority, aggrieved persons do not have a redressal mechanism.Investors face problems as their rights were being violated and their investments were at risk as the cryptocurrency business in India is unregulated, Kadam said.The HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice M S Karnik then asked the Centre to update it on the proposed legislation and posted the matter for hearing on January 17, 2022..Also Read: No proposal to recognise bitcoin as currency, finance ministry says in Lok SabhaA bill seeking “to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India” is among 26 legislations planned to be brought to Parliament in the winter session, which started on Monday.Kadam argued that the Centre had made a statement regarding the issue in 2018 as well, but no action was taken thereafter. The court said it would take up the issue at a later stage.India currently has no regulation on cryptocurrencies, a set of decentralised digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that are not overseen by any sovereign banking regulator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-ask-centre-for-update-on-crypto-currency-bill-101638177566829.html
30-11-2021||India||No panel set up for national jobs policy: Minister||The minister for state for labour and employment Rameswar Teli has said in a written reply to a Parliament question that the Union government has not set up any committee to frame a proposed national employment policy.The minister said the government had launched three employment surveys, namely the All-India Quarterly Establishment-Based Employment Survey (AQEES), the All-India Survey on Migrant Workers and the All-India Survey on Domestic Workers.“Information gathered through these surveys would enable the government to understand significant issues and help to frame evidence-based National Employment Policy,” the minister said in his reply. But “at present there is no such committee” to create a National Employment Policy, he added in his answer.Based on an earlier interaction with officials aware of the development, HT in a report on Monday said that the government would set up an expert committee to frame a draft national employment policy that will likely have employment targets in sectors with potential for mass employment.In his response, the minister added that the Union government had taken “various steps for generating employment in the country” such as projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendayal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission.The Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana was also launched in October 2020 as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package 3.0 to incentivise employers for the creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during the Covid-19 pandemic, the minister said.Five ongoing surveys of the labour markets are expected to help formulate policies for both formal and informal segments of the economy. They will also help design social security measures for workers, including those employed in the gig economy.The surveys are critical as they will provide insights into the employment and socioeconomic condition of migrants and other informal workers.In September, the government released the results of the first All-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey (AQEES) for the April-June 2021 quarter. The AQEES showed a 29% increase in employment in nine sectors during the peak Covid-19 months of April-June 2021 over a base of 2013-14. The survey showed a jump in jobs in sectors such as IT, business process outsourcing and manufacturing.Along with the latest survey, the AQEES is part of four other annual surveys conducted by the labour bureau. These are the All-India Survey of Migrant Workers, All-India Survey of Domestic Workers, All-India Survey of Employment Generated by Professionals and All-India Survey of Employment Generated in the Transport Sector.India lacks an official short-term, high-frequency jobs data and the AQEES is meant to fill the critical gap. Economists usually depend on the Periodic Labour Force Survey, a government jobs survey, or data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a private data firm.According to the latest data from the CMIE, India’s unemployment rate in October 2021 rose to 7.75% from a three-month low of 6.86% in September 2021.(This story has been updated to incorporate the minister’s answer in Parliament)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-panel-set-up-for-national-jobs-policy-labour-minister-101638123441784.html

If the passengers test positive, their samples will be sent to INSACOG for genomic sequencing and they will be sent to institutional quarantine. If they test negative, they will be asked to remain in home quarantine for seven days following which they will take a test on the 8th day and continue monitoring their health for the next 7 days.The government said that the rules will be effective from December 1. The government also said that 5% of the passengers not travelling from the at-risk nations will also be subjected to random testing. The tests for passengers from ‘at-risk’ nations will be self-paid while the cost of the random tests will be borne by the civil aviation ministry.The countries assigned at-risk by the government are - South Africa, China, the United Kingdom, European countries, Bangladesh, Brazil, Botswana, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Hong Kong, Singapore and Israel.The government earlier held meetings with top officials and the health ministry over the omicron variant. The decision to resume regular international flight services from December 15 will be reviewed in the changed situation, the government said.Omicron, which was first found in southern African nations has been detected in several European nations and has led to travel bans and imposition of fresh restrictions on several parts of the world.The variant is feared to be more contagious than the previous variants and experts also fear if it may affect the ability of the vaccines against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-variant-govt-imposes-new-rules-for-arrivals-from-at-risk-nations-101638116231753.html
30-11-2021||Today's||A multipronged approach to protect ICT supply chains from cyberattacks||Cyberattacks on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) supply chain are on the rise. This is dangerous as vulnerabilities can be introduced at any phase of the ICT life-cycle, from design through development, production, distribution, acquisition and deployment to maintenance. Upon successful infiltration, cybercriminals conduct cyber espionage, steal data and intellectual property, or extort money through ransomware attacks.

People also have strong views about data, many of these quite far from the truth. Over time, I have become accustomed to three fundamental things that people get wrong about India’s data landscape.

As the second wave hit, and criticism mounted about how India was short of supplies on the domestic front while offering vaccines to other countries, the government stopped the export of vaccines. Domestically, this defused criticism and earned the government breathing room; externally, it provoked criticism, for many countries in the neighbourhood were left stranded.
30-11-2021||Editorials||A new Twitter, unshackled||Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down as the chief executive officer (CEO) in a surprise announcement on Monday, handing the reins over to a long-time company hand and the current chief technology officer Parag Agrawal. Mr Dorsey emphasised the decision was his own and was meant to unshackle the company from the challenges of being led by its founders which, he said, is “severely limiting and a single point of failure”. Analysts have pointed out that there may be some truth to that: Twitter’s value based on its stock price grew around 76% since Mr Dorsey took over, a period in which the S&P500 grew by double that value. Other social media services such as Facebook and Instagram have logged dizzying trajectories in user and earnings growth.
