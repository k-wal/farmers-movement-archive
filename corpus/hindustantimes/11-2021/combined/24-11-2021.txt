24-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra favours physical school for Class 1 to 4||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday cited the state paediatric task force’s recommendations to say it is in favour of starting physical school for Class 1 to 4, and said a final decision is likely to be taken on Thursday, November 25. “The paediatric task force headed by Dr Suhas Prabhu has recommended allowing physical classes of Standards 1 to 4 with social distancing and other such regulations,” Tope said while addressing the media on Wednesday. “Our health department has no objection. Tomorrow is the state cabinet meeting and I think the final decision may be taken then.” The state government has also requested the Central government to allow vaccination of children in the 12-18 age group, he said. “We should start vaccinating children in the 12-18 age group, as these are students from the 5th standard onwards,” Tope said. “They also tend to be out of home more than the younger age group and are therefore more vulnerable. If someone is infected, he can pass on the infection to his grandparents or his parents who may be co-morbid. Vaccination (for this age group) is happening around the world and Maharashtra is ready with the process.” The task force’s recommendation, however, has elicited a mixed response from school principals and parents. “As of now, we cannot say that the pandemic is gone completely. In such a situation, who will take responsibility if kids get infected? Students from class 1 to 4 are too young to be able to follow Covid protocols at all times,” said Dr Arundhati Chavan, president of the United Forum Parents Teachers Association, a Mumbai-based organisation representing interests of schoolchildren and their parents. Chavan added, “Such decisions should not be taken in haste. It would be ideal if we prepare guidelines, ensure proper protocols and start the classes only by next academic year as it is important for students to prepare mentally as well.” School principals HT spoke to after the minister’s announcement expressed their apprehension about physical classes for the primary section. “We can perhaps start with Class 5 or 6, but it may not be a good idea to resume physical classes for primary students,” said Rupa Roy, principal of Balmohan Vidya Mandir located at Dadar’s Shivaji Park. “It will also be difficult to implement social distancing measures in the classroom since we do not have enough staff. Younger children face a higher risk, and the effect of wearing masks for longer periods among children also needs to be examined.” Roy said that with almost three-quarters of the academic year completed, there should be no haste to reopen, given the spike in Covid-19 cases globally. Both Europe and the United States are currently witnessing a record surge in cases. At present, schools in rural Maharashtra are allowed to run physical classes for Standards 5 to 12, while in urban areas, physical classes for Standards 8 to 12 commenced on October 4. Some schools and parents said getting students from classes 1 to 4 to attend physical classes will expose them to the risk of contracting the infection, while rooting for reopening classes for students from classes 5 to 7. Schools reported thin attendance prior to Diwali. However, schools that follow the state board received a positive response with most students attending physical sessions as compared to non-state board schools after the Diwali break. At the Andheri-based Rajhans Vidyalaya, a CBSE school, the attendance for physical sessions among Classes 8 to 12 continues to remain thin. “Parents are still apprehensive, with a majority continuing online classes,” said its principal Kala Gangadharan. “In the current scenario, reopening Standards 5 to 7 will also have a mixed response. Some parents and students may be eager, but some will be reluctant. On the other hand, I do not think parents of students from the primary section will be keen to send their children to school as of now.” Health minister Tope said that Maharashtra has been witnessing a decline in new cases, and that active cases have fallen below 10,000. “This has resulted in government easing regulations,” he said, while referring to activities apart from resumption of physical classes. Kavita Aggarwal, chairperson, Members of International Schools Association, an organisation formed by educationists to work with Cambridge international schools in India, said schools can resume twice a week for now. “It has been a long gap and I feel schools for at least Classes 5 to 7 should reopen, followed by primary section also starting gradually,” Aggarwal said. “If children are allowed in parks, malls and public places, then why should they not be allowed in schools? It is important for students and parents to get into the routine of regular classes and also to acclimatise themselves with physical sessions. There has been a big academic gap and it is important for students’ social and academic development that schools reopen at the earliest.” Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parents Association, said, “Working parents who find it difficult to manage younger children at home will be eager for physical classes to resume. At the same time, there will be parents that are hesitant to send young children to school. The government should therefore provide an option, and not force any student to attend school.” Sahai added that higher classes should begin in phases. “Classes 5 to 7 should reopen first in urban pockets and all safety protocols should be in place. Classes can resume twice a week initially.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-favours-physical-school-for-class-1-to-4-101637778324710.html
24-11-2021||Lucknow||Tap water scheme: Varanasi to be projected as model of rural water supply||LUCKNOW: Under the Har Ghar Nal Yojana (tap water in each household scheme), the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government is going to present Varanasi as a ‘model’ of rural water supply. Sensor-based automatic systems would be put to use for water supply that would be powered by solar energy, officials said. “For the first time in rural areas in north India, water will be supplied with such technology which will also save energy on a large scale,” said Anurag Srivastava, principal secretary, Namami Gange and rural water supply department. “In this project, the use of electricity will be negligible in delivering pure water from taps to the villages. Simultaneously, sensors are being installed to prevent wastage of water so that after filling the tank, the water supply is automatically turned off and there is no wastage of water,” he added. Srivastava said that in the first phase, work had been carried out rapidly in Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions, as a result of which pure water supply would begin in these areas soon. “In the second phase, Har Ghar Nal Yojana has been initiated in 66 districts of the state. The work in Varanasi is being carried out expeditiously with the laying of pipelines in many areas. So far, the laying of pipelines in as many as 20248 houses in 69 villages has almost been completed. The progress of the scheme is also being continuously monitored by the government,” he added. A target has been set to provide tap water connections to nearly 3,48,505 families of 1296 villages by 2022. In addition, already sanctioned schemes in about 125 villages of Varanasi had been made operational. Through this, clean water was being delivered to 22,079 households, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tap-water-scheme-varanasi-to-be-projected-as-model-of-rural-water-supply-101637778264834.html
24-11-2021||Kolkata||Bengal cops summon Tripura CM’s OSD, say will arrest him if he is a no-show||KOLKATA: Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb’s officer on special duty (OSD) Sanjay Mishra has been ordered to appear before a Kolkata police officer investigating a case registered against him for allegedly spreading wrong data on Covid positivity rate, officials aware of the development said on Wednesday. Mishra has been summoned to the Narkeldanga police station on Thursday.Mishra has been named in an FIR registered on November 3 that accuses him of violating seven sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act 2005. He received the summons via email on Wednesday. It asked Mishra to appear before the investigating officer, sub-inspector S Bandopadhyay, by noon.Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act says: “Whoever makes or circulates a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic, shall on conviction, be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine.” It is alleged that Mishra last month uploaded some data sheets and put out a post on Twitter that said the Covid positivity rate in Kolkata, according to the Union health ministry, was 7.74% on October 27.Accusing Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders of spreading propaganda, Mishra wrote,”….Your party is spreading violence and communalism, that’s enough we don’t want you all to spread #Covid.” According to the data uploaded on the West Bengal health department’s portal, which is shared with the Centre every day, the number of active cases in Kolkata on October 27 was 50 and four people died on that day. The population of the city was 4,496,694 during the 2011 census. A Kolkata Police officer, who did not want to be identified, said the case was lodged on the basis of a complaint lodged by a resident of Narkeldanga in the city’s eastern suburban region.The summons sent to Mishra said, “…..it is revealed during investigation that there are reasonable grounds to question you to ascertain the fact and circumstances from you.” Charges slapped against the officer under the IPC include forgery for the purpose of cheating, defamation, making assertions that cause religious disharmony and creating a public nuisance that causes injury or annoyance. “Non-compliance of this notice may result in your arrest as per law,” said the summons which made news a day ahead of the Tripura civic body elections in which the Trinamool Congress is contesting many seats with an aim to form a base in the state before the 2023 assembly polls. Bharatiya Janata Party’s chief spokesperson in Bengal, Samik Bhattacharya, said he had no idea why Mishra was charged. No TMC leader commented on the case. Mishra was not available for comment. A senior Tripura government official, who did not want to be identified, said he did not know whether Mishra will appear before the Kolkata police on Thursday.“He (Mishra) didn’t visit West Bengal in the past few months. This is strange. How can a case under Disaster Management Act be lodged against him there?” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-cops-summon-tripura-cm-s-osd-say-will-arrest-him-if-he-is-a-noshow-101637777905369.html
24-11-2021||Mumbai||Platform ticket price at Mumbai's CSMT, other stations reverted to ₹10||The Central Railway on Wednesday announced to restore the price of platform tickets to ₹10 at Maharashtra's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CSMT), Dadar, LTT, Thane, Kalyan, and Panvel stations as the restrictions related to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has further eased. The platform ticket price was increased to ₹50 in a bid to limit the crowd on railway platforms amid rising Covid cases. However, with a sustained decline in new Covid cases, the Central Railway has decided to revert the platform ticket price from ₹50 to ₹10 at CSTM, LTT and other suburban railway platforms. The order will come into effect from November 25."In light of the easing of restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been decided by the competent authority to revert the platform ticket price from ₹50 to ₹10 at CSMT, DR, LTT, TNA, KYN and PNVL stations with effect from 25 November," the Central Railway notification said."In view of the above, all concerned booking staff and supervisors are advised to acknowledge the changes and act accordingly," it added.The ministry of railways recently decided to discontinue Covid-19 special trains and restore the number, fare and categorisation of regular timetabled trains which are presently operating as Mail/Express Special and Holiday Special due to the pandemic.

24-11-2021||Lucknow||High Court bench in Agra: Lawyers burn effigy of UP minister||A section of lawyers burnt the effigy of state cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh on civil court premises here on Wednesday a day after Singh said that there was no proposal under consideration for high court bench in Agra.Hemant Bhardwaj, secretary for Action Committee for Establishment of High Court Bench in Agra, said the lawyers have also decided to go to Jewar on Thursday to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Prime Minister will perform the bhoomi pujan of the Noida International Airport (NIA) at Jewar on November 25.“Siddharth Nath Singh is an MLA from Prayagraj West and his thinking is confined to the assembly seat. Singh should be removed from cabinet and someone with wider vision be named as spokesperson for state government,” said senior lawyer in Agra, Devendra Vajpayee. Singh had on Tuesday said there was no proposal under consideration for high court bench in western Uttar Pradesh. “It is unfortunate that a minister is confined to his assembly seat in vision and is ignoring the problems faced by litigants travelling for kilometers for seeking justice,” said Achal Sharma, another senior lawyer in Agra.With assembly elections 2022 approaching, the long pending issue has been raised once again. The lawyers had also met Union minister for law and justice Kiren Rijuju who was in Agra last Sunday. They found response from minister in their favour and were also optimistic as Union minister of state for law and justice prof SP Singh Baghel is an MP from Agra. The lawyers are also pressing for compliance of recommendations by Justice Jaswant Singh Commission which had named Agra as appropriate place for bench in western Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/high-court-bench-in-agra-lawyers-burn-effigy-of-up-minister-101637776345204.html
24-11-2021||Noida||Stage set for Prime Minister Modi to lay foundation stone of Noida airport||Many senior leaders and officials, such as Uttar Pradesh minister for health, family and child welfare Jai Pratap Singh along with additional chief secretary SP Goyal, visited Jewar in Greater Noida on Wednesday to oversee the preparations ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on Thursday, when he will be laying the foundation stone of the Noida international airport, which will come up along the 165km Yamuna Expressway. Officials said the foundation stone laying ceremony is being organised as the biggest event in the state that will be attended by both Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The Noida International Airport Limited, the special purpose vehicle looking after the development of the airport, has arranged for at least 75,000 chairs, seven parking lots, four helipads and prepared a ground— measuring 1.25 lakh square metres — with seating arrangements to accommodate a gathering of nearly 200,000 people. The agency undertaking the preparations has made provisions for two VVIP lounges in the front row. Behind this is the space for media persons and senior party leaders, followed by seating arrangements for the general public who can also listen to the speeches of the leaders on big screens that will be set up in various parts of the venue. BJP workers from Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and other nearby districts will be occupying the agricultural fields of Ranhera and Rohi village on Jewar-Bulandshar road. A day before the event, workers were busy laying bricks on footpaths and clearing bushes along the Jewar-Bulandshahr link road. The stretch will later be converted into a runway for Noida international airport, said officials. “To my knowledge, it is the biggest event that the UP government is organising. Noida international airport is such a big infrastructure project, one that will create huge job opportunities for everyone in this region. We have taken adequate measures for a successful event and everything is in place,” said Goyal, who was seen taking stock of details along with Singh and NIAL officials.On October 20 this year, Modi had laid the foundation stone of Kushinagar international airport in Uttar Pradesh. “Now, he will inaugurate Noida international airport that is slated to be completed by 2024,” said the additional chief secretary.“Noida international airport will be bigger when compared to the one in Kushinagar, because Noida is closer to the national capital and has many big cities around, such as Ghaziabad and Faridabad. Hence, the passenger influx here will be more than that at the Kushinagar facility,” said Goyal.“The work on the airports in Kushinagar and Ayodhya is going on in full swing. Jewar airport will be the fifth international airport in Uttar Pradesh, boosting growth in the state,” said Goyal.Gautam Budh Nagar commissioner of police Alok Singh on Wednesday also briefed police personnel about the protocols to be followed for the smooth conduct of the programme on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/stage-set-for-prime-minister-modi-to-lay-foundation-stone-of-noida-airport-101637776286109.html
24-11-2021||Pune||Pune neurosurgeons undergo training to learn new technique to deal with brain tumours||To avoid the damage to areas in the vicinity of the brain during a brain removal surgery, 39 neurosurgeons from Pune attended a training conducted by Prof Charlie Teo, a neurosurgeon from Australia, at a private hospital. The doctors believe that this new technique will lower the chances of collateral damage to a patient undergoing brain surgery from 10-80%, to just nominal. Tumour removal surgeries require great precision and even the slightest error can paralyse the patient, or redefine the person’s abstract qualities. The technique aims to provide a more precise scan of the brain to understand the networks connecting the brain which helps minimise the damage to a person’s physical and mental being, post operation. Dr Sushil Patkar, neurosurgeon from Poona Hospital where the event was conducted, said, “This is a nascent technology which is currently being used in Australia and it is called ‘Quicktome Omniscent Neuro Technology’ which promises to minimise the damage to the parallel portions of the brain and for maximal and safe resection of difficult brain tumours.” Explaining the brian tumour removal process he said, “It needs exact precision to remove a tumour which if not done accurately can damage the other functioning areas of the brain. It is easier to identify the areas in which parts of the brain perform the physical functions, however, it is very difficult to know the networks that perform the abstract functions which are the highest functions of the brain. There is no defined centre where these fibres exist for these kinds of function. Even if we avoid these centres in case of tumours sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between the healthy part of the brain and the tumour, and sometimes the tumour has engulfed certain healthy parts of the brain, which if removed completely could damage the person’s life in an unexpected manner; for example things that made the person happy before might not make him/her happy post-surgery, or the same drive towards life may not exist even though the person is completely ‘healthy’.” This new technique helps to scan the brain and finds all the possible networks that also include these abstract networks. Dr Patkar said, “We have to send an MRI scan of the brain via the cloud and then identify the networks of the brain depending on which we can either change the entry point or even provide a detailed option to the patient and family regarding the possible effects it could have on the person, so that the family could take the call on whether or not to undergo the surgery. In case of cancerous tumours we can only prolong the inevitable because it is not curable, but in case of other tumours such new technologies can give better options.” However, being a new technology there is no guarantee and it is still developing. “The technology would cost anywhere in the region of $60,000 dollars per year which eventually will be passed on to the patient which would be charged depending on the number of operations a year and other charges. This is why neurosurgeons in the city came together to look at it and decide if they could share the technology and the cost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-neurosurgeons-undergo-training-to-learn-new-technique-to-deal-with-brain-tumours-101637776284862.html
24-11-2021||Pune||Imported liquor consumption expected to double after excise duty reduction in Maharashtra||While the consumption of imported liquor is already rising, the Maharashtra government last week slashed excise duty on imported liquor from 300% to 150% (50%) in a bid to further boost the share of imported liquor in overall consumption while curtailing smuggling and dealing in illicit liquor. The move will further increase imported liquor’s share in overall consumption, according to the International Spirits & Wines Association of India (ISWAI), an apex body of the premium AlcoBev (alcoholic beverages) sector.State excise officials said that while the government currently earns a revenue of about ₹100 crore from the sale of imported scotch annually, this is expected to increase to ₹250 crore as the sale of imported scotch is expected to go up from 100,000 to 250,000 bottles while also curbing smuggling and bootlegging.State excise superintendent Santosh Zagade said, “Since Maharashtra state excise was charging three times more excise on foreign liquor, people were buying it in other states like Delhi and Karnataka. Hence, Maharashtra has taken this step to stop this.”Meanwhile, the ISWAI said that the move will bring price rationalisation and parity with other states, thereby boosting state excise revenues from this segment. It will also significantly curtail the incentive for dealing in spurious/illicit liquor and help curb smuggling of alcohol products from other states while benefitting consumers in Maharashtra in terms of access to genuine products.Nita Kapoor, chief executive officer, ISWAI, said, “These industry-friendly, progressive, policy changes will improve tax compliance, eliminate the grey market and inter-state product smuggling, thereby increasing the state’s revenue collection. Consumers can now expect a reduction in prices and legitimate access to better quality global brands.” Emphasising on the growing consumer preference for premium global brands, Kapoor said, “Indian consumers are increasingly opting for ‘bottled in origin’ (BIO) and geographical indication (GI) tagged niche products which carry a stamp of premium quality. The Maharashtra government has taken cognisance of the emerging growth trends of BIO.”Whereas Shivaji Khandve, president, Pune District Wine Merchants’ Association, said that it will take two months for the new pricing to come into effect though sales of BIO will definitely increase. Thus, it might have an impact on the prices of imported goods by around 15 to 20%. He added that there will be a revision in the MRP formula as well. “Now if companies show higher production costs and book profits, naturally the impact of reduction in excise duty will be less,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/imported-liquor-consumption-expected-to-double-after-excise-duty-reduction-in-maharashtra-101637775924830.html
24-11-2021||Pune||Salisbury Park residents finally get new garden; inauguration on November 25||The residents of Salisbury Park have won an almost 20-year-old battle, with the garden that they fought so long for finally to be inaugurated on Thursday. The new garden spread on 3.5 acres lies adjacent to the old Gool Poonawala garden at Salisbury Park, which is one of Pune’s upmarket areas. It all started in 2004 when the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) issued a notification to de-reserve a plot of land originally earmarked for a garden and handed it over to a local builder. About 300 residents organised a rally in protest under the banner ‘Salisbury Park Residence Forum’ along with local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Shrinath Bhimale and filed a case in court which went on for several years.In 2015, the Bombay high court directed the PMC to pay ₹18 crore to the district administration and take possession of the land. As the original owner did not object to the PMC acquiring the land, the civic body completed the legal formalities, took possession of the land, and began developing a garden on the plot that was earlier used to dump garbage in 2016. Even as work on the garden began, the PMC challenged the increased compensation amount which by subsequent HC ruling was referred to a larger bench in 2018 and further increased to ₹76 crore. The case is still pending in the Supreme Court.Rajendra Thorat, deputy engineer of the land acquisition department of the PMC, said, “The PMC challenged the increased compensation amount of ₹71 crore calculated and decided by the Pune district administration. The case is in the Supreme Court and the hearing is complete. The verdict is expected in the second week of January 2022.”With the garden having been completed this year, the PMC plans to inaugurate it at the hands of BJP state president Chandrakant Patil on Thursday.Faizal Poonawala of Salisbury Park Residence Forum said that the garden has been developed very well and that all residents were involved in its planning and design. “We were involved along with corporator Bhimale in selecting the design. Lt Col (rtd) Dr Vedprakash Taneja guided us. The Salisbury Park Residence Forum was formed later and joined Dr Taneja. Originally, the garden land was open and being used as a garbage dump. That’s when we took up cudgels and shaped public opinion. The PMC was not willing to pay compensation to the builder though the land was reserved for a garden as per the development plan (DP).”The garden has been developed on the lines of a topiary, with the trees and shrubs styled into shapes of animals and cartoons. There is a separate area for exercise with gym bars, a skating rink, flower beds, an amphitheatre and more.Bhimale said, “It is a victory for the residents of Salisbury Park as their dream has finally come true. I am happy I have been a part of it and helped them fulfil their dream.”Ashok Ghorpade, chief superintendent of the garden department, said that the PMC has completed all the work and that the garden is ready to be opened to the public. “We spent around ₹2.50 crore on developing the garden. Architect Avani Lodha from Aseem Gokarn Harwansh (AGH) Landscapes planned the garden. The entire garden area is now more than six-acre (Poonawala garden and new Salisbury garden).”Timeline1966 - Development plan – plot reserved for the garden2004 - PMC de-reserved garden reservation2004 - Salisbury Park residents file case in high court2014 - Local corporator stages andolan in PMC to pay money to the builder2015 - Bombay high court orders PMC to restore reservation and acquire land2016 - PMC pays ₹18 crore to the builder but builder claims ₹71 crore compensation as per the district collector award order.

Two teams of the department are collecting details of such traders in Prayagraj, Pratapgrah and Kaushambi districts, said the official of the department without wanting to be named.The official said the accounts of these traders are carefully being looked into by the department and the details are being prepared both by the special investigative branch (SIB) and the mobile squad of the department. The department is collecting details of purchase and sale data and transactions of bank accounts of these traders following which the GST that has to be deposited by them is being calculated and compared to what the individual firms have deposited in the state exchequer, the official said.The action is part of statewide exercise being initiated to increase the overall revenue of the state.The recent raid at a mobile shop owner of the Indira Bhavan of the posh Civil Lines locality too is being seen as a part of this exercise. It is alleged that this mobile shop owner had sold goods worth ₹70 crore but had paid tax of less than ₹1 lakh thus evading tax of around ₹30 lakh. The official said after scrutiny of documents and submission of evidences, action will be taken against these traders. The teams are working out the amount of tax collected from such traders who are into the business of iron, LED products, fridge, washing machine and sales of other electronics goods.

24-11-2021||Pune||Pune developers booked for cheating, forgery||The Pune city police, on Wednesday, booked developers from the city and two others, including the complainant’s late father, for forgery and cheating of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).A complaint was lodged by Rahul Tikone, husband of Pune corporator Sangita Tikone, and the man who has submitted ownership papers of the land.“I have no idea why my late father has been also booked. He died in 2013 and before his death, he had handed the power of attorney to the developers. However, after his death, in 2018, we got to know that the land was listed in the SRA scheme. Upon digging a little using Right to Information (RTI) we found that the developers had forged a land sale deed of the piece of land in Bibwewadi. That is not possible as there are multiple owners of that land registered since 2010 and none of us was approached for the sale,” said Tikone.Senior police inspector Sunil Zaware of Bibwewadi police station is investigating the case but could not be reached for comment.A case was registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery), 471 (used forged as genuine) and others of the Indian Penal Code at Bibwewadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-developers-booked-for-cheating-forgery-101637775084559.html

24-11-2021||Mumbai||₹28.20 crores penalty for discharging sewage: NGT panel to BMC||A six-judge bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday ordered the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to deposit within three months an environmental penalty of ₹28.20 crores to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for discharging raw sewage into the city creeks, rivers and drains.“The amount may be spent on restoration of the environment by making a restoration plan to be approved and monitored by the CPCB. The CPCB may decide on the plan submitted within one month of such submission,” reads the order by NGT chaired by justice Adarsh Kumar Goel.The order is subject to the orders of the Supreme Court which is pending. BMC had filed a civil appeal before the Supreme Court in March, seeking a stay on the NGT’s October 2020 directions -- which were the result of earlier public interest litigation by NGO Vanashakti. The civic body had also attempted to stay a subsequent execution application that Vanashakti filed before NGT in June, after observing little action by the municipality toward complying with the Tribunal’s orders. The SC however not only allowed Vanashakti’s execution application to proceed but clarified that the municipal commissioner himself will have to satisfy the NGT of compliance with its directionsWednesday’s NGT order states that the civic body is liable to pay environmental damage for discharge of untreated sewage water into the water bodies at the rate of Rs. 4.25 crores per month till bio-remediation or phytoremediation measures are taken by the authorities concerned. “If remediation or treatment of the water of sewage water is taken, it will be reduced at the rate of Rs. 5 lakhs per month per drain systematically. The State PCB (pollution control board) is directed to calculate and do the needful according to the law from time to time,” stated the order.An additional ₹10 lakhs per month per Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) is to be deposited with CPCB for not rectifying operational deficiencies of the existing STPs that is leading to untreated sewage being discharged into water bodies.“With regard to the situation where works concerning STP, sewerage network and its connectivity not yet started, the Mumbai Municipal Corporation has to pay an environmental compensation at the rate of Rs. 10 lakhs per month per STP, sewerage network and its connectivity after 31.12.2020 for the delay in setting up of the same. It will be open to the Municipal Corporation to recover the said amount from the erring officers/contractors,” reads the order.The tribunal has directed CPCB to examine all STPs, CETPs within the Mumbai Municipal Corporation and calculate the amount of environmental compensation as per law and proceed to recover the amount and communicate to NGT within two weeks.The bench has directed the civic body to install nets in sewage stormwater discharge drains to stop sewage solid waste from entering the sea along with the solid waste, and ensure that no untreated water is being discharged into the sea level. It also directed BMC to install mobile public toilets after identifying areas close to beaches where open defecation is rampant. “We are thankful to the NGT for upholding the principle of “polluter pays”. Despite being the richest municipal corporation in Asia, the civic body for decades flouted the environmental laws and laws of pollution for which they have been hauled up now. We are hopeful that this penalty will serve as a reminder for all municipal corporations that are following the same path as BMC,” said D Stalin, petitioner, Vanashakti, a non-government organisation.BoxOther directionsBMC should ensure mangrove area is kept plastic-free zone and recommended to install trash boom or trash trap for collecting floating plastic and other wastes & its disposal.All sewage should be treated at the source and then release into Creek via streams.Natural steams used as sewage canals should be stopped immediately and restoration should be carried out to recover the beauty of the mangroves of Mumbai and adjoining Thane District.Pipelines that are directly releasing domestic sewage in the water bodies, creeks and wetland without treatment must be removed or connected to the STP. There should not be any water logging during the rainy season, and the sewage line or water connection which are discharging the water from the city must be regularly monitored so that there should not be any blockage in the flow of the water.Chief Secretary of Maharashtra may set up an appropriate monitoring mechanism at the state level specifying accountability of nodal authorities not below the secretary level and ensuring appropriate adverse entries in the ACRs of erring officers. Monitoring at the state level must take place on a fortnightly basis and a record of progress maintained. The Chief Secretary may have an accountable person attached in his office for this purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2820-crores-penalty-for-discharging-sewage-ngt-panel-to-bmc-101637774425205.html

24-11-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh says he is in Chandigarh, briefly appears on Telegram||Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Wednesday said that he is currently in Chandigarh and is planning to visit Mumbai soon, news agency PTI reported. Singh did not clarify whether he would surrender before the police or court. The former top cop was granted protection from arrest by the Supreme Court.Singh was declared a ‘proclaimed offender’ by a court in Mumbai and is also facing several extortion cases in Maharashtra. The PTI report also said that Param Bir Singh appeared on social messaging app, Telegram, but later deleted his account from the app. He did not report to work since May following his transfer from the post of Mumbai police commissioner.He made allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. His transfer came after Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze was arrested following the recovery of explosives near Reliance chairman and industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house, 'Antilia' and his connection to the death of businessman Mansukh Hiran.A Mumbai court earlier on Tuesday pasted an absconding notice outside Param Bir Singh's Juhu flat. His lawyer alleged that Singh was told to take back his complaint against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. “Former Mumbai CP Parambir Singh has appealed to the court that he is being victimised since he has written to the CBI. Sanjay Pandey told him that if he takes back the complaint against the then home minister then things will settle for him,” Puneet Bali, Param Bir Singh’s advocate, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“He was told if he did not do it, then he would face cases. So listening to our detailed arguments, the Supreme Court has given notice to CBI and Maharashtra and provided interim protection to him from arrest,” he further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-says-he-is-in-chandigarh-briefly-appears-on-telegram-101637772729384.html
24-11-2021||Mumbai||LED lights to illuminate Cuffe Parade footpaths soon||A ray of hope for the residents of Cuffe Parade, apprehensive to walk at night- as Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) along with the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking will soon set up a unique LED lighting system in the stretch, which will illuminate pavements and the road. The officials said that the project is being funded and sanctioned by the BMC while it is being executed by the engineers of BEST. A senior officer from BEST informed that the planning work was being done by them which was later authorised by the BMC. “We have set up 30 poles adjoining the road at Captain Prakash Pethe Marg in Cuffe Parade. Our primary objective was to set up 41 poles however some of these poles couldn’t be set up as metro works were ongoing,” the official said. The project is being proposed and backed by BJP corporators Harshita Narwekar and Makarand Narwekar. Speaking to HT, Harshita said that residents approached her urging them to take action about the pavements which remains dark after sunset and to make them more pedestrian-friendly. “All of the existing lights are directed towards the road which is why the pavements are dark and people feel apprehensive to walk on them,” Harshita shared. Makarand Narwekar said that these lights will be implemented throughout the entire ‘A’ ward in a phased manner. “I don’t think that this unique kind of lighting exists anywhere else in the city. Illuminating the footpaths will not just encourage pedestrians to walk on them which will also improve the flow of traffic,” said Makarand. A resident - Haresh Hathiramani who has been living in this area since 1975 said that these lights were much needed as there have been cases of theft and robbery earlier in the Cuffe Parade area. “Being a commercial district, most of the areas in the entire Cuffe Parade neighbourhood becomes deserted at night, due to which there have been frequent cases of robbery and theft before,” said Hathiramani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/led-lights-to-illuminate-cuffe-parade-footpaths-soon-101637772024666.html
24-11-2021||Mumbai||In absence of CM, Ajit Pawar may chair cabinet meeting||Mumbai With chief minister Uddhav Thackeray taking more than the expected time to recover from his surgery, the state cabinet meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday is likely to be chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. According to officials privy to the developments, Thackeray is expected to get discharged from the hospital in the next few days and resume work online from his home by next week. He will resume work from the office only after a few days of rest. Officials from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said that the CM is thinking about attending the cabinet through video conference for some time in the beginning. He may do so on Thursday, but the decision about the same was not taken till evening on Wednesday. In his absence, meetings of state cabinet could not be held, while a few major decisions are yet to be taken. “The files and proposals related to major decisions are cleared by the CM from the hospital, but some decisions have been put on the backburner. The decision about the venue and the date of the winter session of the state legislature is yet to be taken. Besides, reopening of schools for Classes 1 to 4 in rural areas and 5 to 7 in urban areas is also expected to be taken in the cabinet on Thursday,” said an official from the CMO.Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the CM will attend the state cabinet meeting through video conference. “After his surgery, he has been recovering very well. Doctors have advised him to complete the physiotherapy sessions before resuming work. They will take a call on his discharge depending on the response to the physiotherapy,” he said. A senior Shiv Sena leader said that the CM is likely to get discharged in the next couple of days. “His physical presence in the office is unlikely for the next few weeks. He has been advised against sitting or standing for longer periods. There will be restrictions on his travelling too. He will have to go through physiotherapy for about two hours every day,” the leader added.A section of the ruling party leaders is also of the opinion that the CM should have given charge of his post to either his deputy or any senior Shiv Sena minister. Leaders from Sena said that the blood clotting in Thackeray’s spine delayed his recovery or else, he could have resumed work now.If Ajit Pawar chairs the state cabinet meeting on Thursday, it would be the second such instance in the two years of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. Pawar had chaired the state cabinet early last year to take the decision of recommending Thackeray’s name to governor BS Koshyari for the nomination to legislative council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-absence-of-cm-ajit-pawar-may-chair-cabinet-meeting-101637771304976.html
24-11-2021||Lucknow||UPERC sets ball rolling for changes in regulations on filing of tariff petitions||The UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) on Wednesday set the ball rolling for the changes in the Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) for Distribution and Transmission Regulations, 2019 by holding a public hearing on the proposed amendments that seek to penalise discoms for delayed filing of their annual tariff petitions. UPERC chairman RP Singh, who presided over the event, said the commission had heard viewpoints of all stakeholders. He also said it will make changes in the regulations soon by introducing penalties in the licencee’s ARR to promote timely filing of the multi year tariff petition and to allow passing on of such benefits to consumers. The proposed amendments also seek to penalise discoms for not filing a true-up petition within six months from the finalisation of the audited accounts of the corresponding year. The issue of the alleged nexus between builders and power engineers in Noida and Ghaziabad, however, dominated the proceedings during the public hearing by UPERC. Raising the issue, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma said recent probes have established that many power engineers in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad (allegedly) intentionally provided financial benefits to builders while issuing power connections to the apartments. “These are the hapless consumers who have to pay for corruption because any loss that discoms suffer on account of corruption is finally passed on to consumers in the shape of higher tariff,” he said. He demanded the commission do away with the provision that allows return of equity (income) to the tune of ₹2200 crore to discoms every year Verma also demanded that no carrying cost be passed on to a discom if it did not finalise true-up petition within six months of auditing of the accounts. He laid emphasis on the need for the CAG audit of discoms’ accounts to know their actual income and deficit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uperc-sets-ball-rolling-for-changes-in-regulations-on-filing-of-tariff-petitions-101637771004678.html

24-11-2021||Mumbai||Govt offers pay hike, urges ST employees to end stir; leaders say need a day to decide||In a bid to end the ongoing strike of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees, the state government on Wednesday announced a salary hike for the state transport (ST) employees. Transport minister Anil Parab also said that the state government cannot decide on the workers’ primary demand to merge the MSRTC with the state government, as the issue is currently being looked into by a court-appointed committee. The strike, which has almost paralysed parts of rural Maharashtra, where the ST buses are the main mode of public transport, is unlikely to end on Wednesday as the leaders of ST employees have sought a day to mull over the government’s offer. The ST strike commenced just ahead of Diwali and later gathered momentum as the state’s principal opposition party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), backed and even led the workers. The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leader alleged that BJP was fuelling the stir to corner the state government. After hectic parleys between the state and ST workers’ delegation, and a series of meetings between Parab, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is admitted to a city hospital, Parab announced the hike in basic salary of the employees, which will come into effect from next month. The revised salary is expected to put an additional burden of about ₹750 crore annually on the MSRTC, the minister said. According to Parab, the hike in pay ranges from ₹7,200 to ₹3,600 depending on the category and number of years in service. “The state government has decided to hike the basic salary of the employees. We have given a 41% increase in the salary, which is the biggest hike in the history of ST,” said Parab, who was flanked by his cabinet colleague Uday Samant and BJP legislators Gopichand Padalkar and Sadabhau Khot, who was leading the delegation of ST workers. The minister also said that the corporation will ensure that the salaries of the employees will be paid before the 10th of every month. ST workers had complained that the salaries were delayed for several weeks and months. The minister further added, “For employees up to 10 years of service, we have made an increase of ₹5,000. Those who got ₹16,800 gross pay, will now get ₹24,000, which is a hike of ₹7,200. For the employees who are between 10 and 20 years of service, we have given them a raise of ₹4,000 in their basic pay. Therefore, who had basic pay of ₹16,000, their revised basic pay is now 23,040. For employees with over 20 years of service, we have increased the basic pay by ₹2,500. If their basic salary was ₹26,000 and their gross pay was ₹37,440, will now get ₹41,040. Those who had basic pay of ₹37,000 and gross pay was ₹53,280, their revised pay will now be ₹56,280.” Parab appealed to the employees to end the stir and resume their service from Thursday or Friday (for those who are Mumbai). “Whatever the state government could do, it has done so far. Despite being in financial loss, the state had given a salary hike. The state cannot decide on the merger, as the court-appointed committee would decide on that. The state would accept the decision of the committee. If the strike does not end, the state will act with whatever means available to it,” Parab said. The MSRTC was affected the most due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown and restrictions. The ST’s daily revenue is around ₹22 crore, however, it incurred a loss worth several crores during the lockdown. Meanwhile, the ST workers who have camped at Azad Maidan, in Mumbai, are still firm to their demand on the merger. A section of the workers on strike said that their demand was for a merger with the state government and not a hike in salary. After the government’s announcement, Padalkar and Khot told workers at Azad Maidan that a decision will be made in consultation with them. “The government has made the announcement. We will stay back at Azad Maidan and will discuss this with the worker here. We have so far not announced if we have accepted their announcement. The figures they have announced will be verified by some experts. We will announce our stand tomorrow (Thursday),” Khot said. The former minister of state in the BJP-led government said that the stir will continue till the discussions finish within the delegation. “We need at least a day to discuss and decide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/govt-offers-pay-hike-urges-st-employees-to-end-stir-leaders-say-need-a-day-to-decide-101637769144475.html

24-11-2021||Patna||JD(U) showcases Nitish’s 15-year rule||The ruling Janata Dal (United) in Bihar on Wednesday showcased 15 years of Nitish Kumar’s government in the state with a slew of programmes to highlight its achievements.“The huge infrastructure growth in Bihar is for everyone to see, as it has touched the life of every section in terms of electricity, roads, drinking water, agriculture and health care since 2005. It infuses confidence in every Bihari. Today, one shudders to think of the situation prior to 2005, when it was considered that governing Bihar was impossible. Nitish Kumar accepted the challenge and showed how it can be done, as he is a doer,” said JD-U national president Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh.Nitish had first taken oath as the chief minister of Bihar on November 24, 2005, wresting power from Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and has gone on to become the longest serving CM of Bihar with an uninterrupted stint. He has remained an integral part of the NDA all through, barring a brief period. It is his seventh term as CM.JD-U spokesman Neeraj Kumar said societal concerns of Nitish Kumar made him distinct from others and it was the reason why he came up with prohibition on the demands of women, which RJD wants to withdraw. “RJD leaders have forgotten their own constitution, which makes it binding on anyone seeking membership to stay away from intoxicants. Nitish Kumar took everyone along when he decided to come up with the challenging prohibition, as he knew it would require everyone’s support and only a few could create hurdles,” he said.In Supaul, water resources department minister Sanjay Jha said Bihar’s transformation was a result of visionary leadership and strong resolve of Nitish Kumar to take forward his inclusive development model. “Darbhanga airport is one shining example. He is now focusing on industrialisation and water to every farm to boost agriculture. His concerns for environment and programmes earned him appreciation even from the United Nations,” Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-showcases-nitish-s-15-year-rule-101637767600381.html

The RJD chief, who has been in Patna for last two days, had appeared in a special court in connection with a fodder scam case on Tuesday.The RJD chief also slammed the union government for rising prices of fuel and other commodities. In the context of Bihar, Prasad said farmers already suffered damages during the kharif season and were facing uncertainty for the rabi season. “ In the name of development in Bihar, we have waterlogged fields and farmers are ruing their fate,” he said.Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, in his address, also attacked the Nitish Kumar government. “CM Kumar should give one explanation to people as why Bihar is still a laggard state with its lowest rankings in all indices of development as per the Niti Aayaog parameters. What good has happened in last 15 years?Crime has risen, unemployment and migration is rampant while scams are taking place with disconcerting regularity in universities,” he said. He also attacked the government over the recent hooch deaths and alleged that liquor flow in Bihar during prohibition had flourished. “RJD had supported the Prohibition when we were part of the government with JD(U) after 2015 elections. But then Laluji had suggested to the CM that implementation of prohibition should be done effectively,” he said. All senior leaders of the party were present at the function, except RJD chief ‘s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, who has often spoken against the state party leadership. The jeep drivePrasad was seen on Wednesday driving an open jeep near his residence after many years, which aroused curiosity among commuters in the morning hours near the Raj Bhawan. The 74-year-old former railway minister took a small drive from the residence of his wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi to Raj Bhawan road and back. The RJD chief is recuperating from his illness and has started becoming more active in party affairs and public interactions lately.Talking about his driving experience later at a party event, Prasad said,“I get bored these days while recovering from illness . So today I took out my jeep and drove. I had bought this jeep from the military quota and it has been maintained well,” he said, while recalling how during his early days of his political career he used to often drive jeeps and had ferried many leaders including former chief minister Karpoori Thakur. “Karpoorji used to tell me that I am a good driver but drive a bit too fast,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/fully-support-demand-of-farmers-on-msp-lalu-101637767598893.html

Here is why||BHOPAL: Mandsaur district in Madhya Pradesh has withdrawn a 10% discount on liquor for people who have received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, officials said on Wednesday, linking the decision to scrap the discount within 24 hours of its introduction to opposition from a ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker.Mandsaur excise officer Anil Sachan said the offer, designed to motivate people to get themselves vaccinated, was withdrawn after objections.BJP legislator Yashpal Sisodiya was among those who frowned at the initiative. “This decision is completely wrong as it will increase the consumption of liquor,” Sisodiya said.The legislator said people could end up buying liquor in large quantities to avail cheaper price and get teetotalers to also buy liquor for them. On Twitter, some people recalled that the legislator’s opposition to encouraging liquor was understandable and natural, particularly given how he would often speak about his decision not to distribute liquor in the run up to 2018 state elections.To be sure, the discount was available on country-made liquor purchased from three designated shops in the district. A circular issued on Tuesday also designated three excise department officers, one for each vend, who could be contacted for any problems in availing the discounts.In Mandsaur, only 45% of people have received the second vaccine dose, 5 percentage points lower than the state’s average.Mandsaur was the only district in Madhya Pradesh to use a discount on liquor to nudge people to get their dose.In south MP’s Khandwa district 350km from Mandsaur, the district administration prohibited liquor vends to sell liquor to people who haven’t been vaccinated.The state’s food and civil supplies department has also ordered that only vaccinated people will get ration under the Food Security Act after December 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-district-withdraws-10-discount-on-liquor-for-fully-vaccinated-customers-101637766204487.html

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many works of elected members were halted. To complete the works, funds have been allocated. There will be no shortage of funds for the HCMTR project as PMC will make provisions in the coming budget.” Rasane added,”The project had a Rs64 crore budgetary provision. It will not require funds immediately so the standing committee approved the diversion of funds.”The HCMTR project is a dream project of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.

24-11-2021||Mumbai||38% dip in B Arch applicants, students blame eligibility criteria||The pre-admission registrations for several technical courses including Bachelor of Architecture (B Arch) ended recently and figures revealed by the state common entrance test (CET) cell shows registrations for the course has dipped by almost 38% this year. From 5,567 registrations in 2020, the number stands at 3,465 this year. Students have blamed this decrease in demand on the recent decision by the Council of Architecture (CoA) to only accept the National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) as opposed to Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) scores, which was also acceptable until last year. Several students raised objections to this change in the ruling, especially, since many have scored well in JEE. However, due to the change in eligibility criteria, many B Arch aspirants are opting to appear for NATA once again in 2022 and apply for admissions next year. “Most students appeared for JEE and NATA, and while everyone scored well in JEE, most found the first two sessions of NATA very tough. In a year when students have already gone through too much, the last thing they needed was a change in eligibility criteria. These students have slogged at least two years preparing for the entrance exam and now it’s of no use,” said the mother of a B Arch aspirant. Until the 2020-21 academic year, B Arch aspirants were allowed to register using either their JEE-Mains or the NATA score. However, this year, following a notification from the CoA, it has been clarified that JEE scores will only be accepted for admissions to IITs, NITs and central universities, whereas all other universities/institutes will accept the NATA score only. This year, both JEE and NATA exams were held in multiple sessions, mainly to give students the option of choosing the best score out of the multiple sessions, and at the same time, also giving students the option of a backup session, in case they missed the previous session due to Covid-related issues. Many B Arch aspirants have now decided to appear for NATA exam in 2022 and apply for admissions for the next academic year. “My daughter appeared for the first two sessions of NATA as well as two sessions of JEE. While she has scored 98 percentile in JEE, her NATA score is low, and until now she was not worried because we were under the impression that the JEE score will be applicable. Because of this change in eligibility criteria, my daughter will either lose a seat in a college of her choice or lose the entire year and try again next year,” said the father of another aspirant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/38-dip-in-b-arch-applicants-students-blame-eligibility-criteria-101637764884588.html

The PMC will also then allow Jain Irrigation to restart work the 24x7 water supply scheme. The above amount does not include taxes.Earlier, the PMC had served a stop-work order the firm for not carrying out work in time. However, an arbitrator in the matter has ruled in favour of the contractor, Jain Irrigation.The civic body will therefore continue the work with same firm and pay a compensation. According to PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane, two companies, L&T and Jain Irrigation have been contracted to carry out the 24x7 water project in the city. Jain Irrigation allegedly failed to meet certain deadlines, after which the PMC acted and also did not to return a deposit. “A former IAS officer was appointed as arbitrator and the decision went in favour of the contractor. PMC was originally asked to pay Rs56 crore. If the decision is followed as it is, PMC has to pay more than Rs63 crore to the company. Challenging the decision in the High Court would have taken time and the project will be delayed. Even by considering the existing material costs, there are chances that a new contractor would charge more. Considering all these factors, the municipal commissioner negotiated with the company and it is has been decided to continue the work with same company,” Rasane said. The standing committee on Tuesday decided to pay the above compensation. “Now the administration will sign a fresh contract with the company and the company will start work,” Rasane added. The 24x7 water project will ensure equal distribution of water to all residents in the city and is an ambitious project undertaken by the PMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/24x7-water-project-contractor-wins-rs4-80-cr-compensation-from-pmc-work-order-reinstated-101637764404091.html
24-11-2021||Mumbai||Former CM’s visit to Raj Thackeray’s new house fuels alliance rumours||Mumbai Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis visited Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray’s new house ‘Shivtirth’ at Dadar on Wednesday, fueling rumours of an alliance between BJP and MNS ahead of the crucial Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.Fadnavis was accompanied by his wife Amruta during the one-and-a-half-hour visit. The MNS described this visit as personal. “Rajsaheb had called them to his new home for lunch. There was nothing political about the visit,” said MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande.BJP legislator Ram Kadam, who was earlier in the MNS, also said that the visit had nothing to do with politics. “It was a courtesy call as Thackeray moved to his new house and there was nothing beyond that,” he stated. Earlier this month, BJP leader Asish Shelar paid Thackeray a visit. BJP Maharashtra chief Chandrakant Patil had also visited Thackeray in August.After a series of defeats in successive elections, Raj Thackeray in January 2020 shifted towards the Hindu hardline agenda leaving his “justice for sons of the soil” programme. He unveiled a new saffron flag with a rajmudra (seal) of Maratha King Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, with the party’s name below it. During Dussehra, the MNS put ‘Proud to be Hindu’ banners in many places across the city. Last month, two seers from Uttar Pradesh, who go by the name of Guru Ma Kanchan Giriji and Jagatguru Suryacharaji, had met Raj Thackeray and requested him for an alliance with BJP and even offered their services to mediate between the two parties.Political experts said it was very clear that the meeting was aimed at the upcoming BMC polls. Political expert Hemant Desai said, “Both the parties will definitely have a tie-up. It may be a direct or an indirect alliance as both parties need each other to fight the Shiv Sena-led alliance.”He added that the BJP is still not sure of bagging power in BMC on its own. “Last time, it lost power by a whisker as it secured 82 compared to two more by the Sena at 84. However, this time, the Sena is ruling the state and will not spare any resources to win back the BMC it has ruled for the last several decades,” he added. He also said that the MNS is at its weakest phase as it has just one legislator in both state assembly and the BMC and needs someone who can fund its campaign. “The BJP fits the bill perfectly,” he added.Thackeray had become a bitter critic of the BJP prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and had held several rallies in the state criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government. He had also been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with transactions related to the purchase of Kohinoor Mills land at Dadar in central Mumbai. However, in recent times, he has refrained from criticising Modi and has turned his ire on cousin and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/former-cm-s-visit-to-raj-thackeray-s-new-house-fuels-alliance-rumours-101637763804459.html

A resident of Jharpo village, in Tatijharia block of Hazaribagh, she was unable to receive the benefits of government schemes in the absence of the Aadhaar card. The woman had apprised officials of her ordeal on getting to know about ‘Aapke Adhikar, Aapki Sarkar, Aapke Dwar’ (Your Rights, Your Government, At Your Door) scheme, a programme aimed at resolving issues related to government schemes at the doorstep of beneficiaries. "After listening to her plight, the District Welfare Officer and Block Development Officer, Tatijharia, swung into action. A vehicle was arranged and she was brought to the camp (Tatijharia) from her residence. Her registration for the Aadhaar card was done on-site and the document was issued to her," a statement from the state government said. Till Tuesday late afternoon, more than 2.5 lakh applications have been received from all over the state and over one lakh cases have been successfully resolved, the statement said. The programme will continue till December 29, marking the completion of two years of the formation of the incumbent government. The scheme was announced by Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Jharkhand's Statehood Day on November 15, the birth anniversary of legendary tribal leader Birsa Munda at Ulihatu, the birthplace of the icon. Multiple camps are being organised at panchayat levels to ensure that the benefits of government schemes reach the doorstep of the rural people. Sajni Bala Mahto, a resident of Palashdih village of Madhavpur panchayat located in Bodam block of East Singhbhum who earned her livelihood through selling Hadiya (desi liquor) wanted to switch over to animal husbandry for a respectful living. "In a camp organised in Madhavpur panchayat under ‘Aapke Adhikar Aapki Sarkar Aapke Dwar’, Sajni Bala Mahto was given ₹10, 000 in the form of an interest-free loan under Phoolo Jhano Ashirwad Abhiyan. “With the loan provided to her through Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion society (JSLPS), she will be able to lead a respectful life while earning livelihood for her family," the statement said. Likewise, Shashi Devi 79, a resident of Ranchi was struggling to get her Ration Card (PDS card) despite multiple attempts. A ration card was issued to her during the outreach programme. The chief minister, earlier, in a letter addressed to all elected village heads had appealed to them to take part in the programme and make it a success. “In last two years, a lot of efforts have been made by our government to live up to your expectations. Now the government is coming to your doors to deliver your rights at your doorstep. Be sure to take advantage,” the letter said. The letter has also been translated into local languages and shared with the public representatives at the village level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/specially-abled-woman-gets-aadhaar-card-after-8-yrs-as-jharkhand-govt-reaches-her-doorstep-101637762996678.html
24-11-2021||Pune||Centre wouldn’t have repealed farm laws if no polls in UP, states: Pawar||PUNE Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar, on Wednesday, alleged that the Narendra Modi government would not have decided to repeal the three contentious farm laws if there were no elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states in the near future. Earlier last week, Modi made an announcement about withdrawing the three agricultural laws, which drew strident protests at Delhi’s borders and elsewhere. To a question on whether the PM’s move was politically aimed, Pawar said the move was announced in view of upcoming elections in UP and other neighbouring states. “There are elections in UP and other neighbouring states. As per our information, the people in power, when they visited the villages in some parts of these states, they got some different kind of reception from the locals. Considering this, they might have sensed what kind of treatment they will get when they go to seek votes. It seems that on that backdrop, this practical decision was taken,” he said. “If there were no elections in these states in the near future, this decision would not have been taken,” he added. On a query about the actions taken by the central agencies in Maharashtra, Pawar said it is not a new thing. “I recently met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. There are six to seven ministers from her government who are currently being harassed by the central agencies. I am going to meet her in Mumbai in the next few days.” He added that the BJP government at the Centre has taken a stand to “harass” non-BJP states by using agencies and the same is being witnessed in Maharashtra. “Let them conduct inquiries. Nothing will come out. This is the finest example of the misuse of power by the people in power,” he added. Asked about former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh submitting in the court through his lawyer that there was a threat to his life in Maharashtra, Pawar said that he was shocked after reading it. “What to say, if a person who worked on several key positions in Maharashtra police department is scared of his colleagues and the state police,” he added. On Monday, Singh’s lawyer told the Supreme Court that the IPS officer was in hiding as he faced threat to his life if he returns to Maharashtra. Issuing a notice to the CBI and the Maharashtra government on Singh’s plea that the entire matter involving him and the former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh should be investigated by the CBI, the apex court protected him from arrest in criminal cases lodged against him in the state. Why MSRTC problems don’t add upOn the strike by MSRTC employees, Sharad Pawar said the financial condition of the corporation is bad. He said the salaries given to their respective transport utility employees by states - Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana - were compared and during the comparison, it was found that the salaries given by Gujarat are lower than those given in Maharashtra; whereas all other states pay wages higher than Maharashtra. Pawar said he has come to know that the state government has taken a positive decision to end the ongoing stalemate. Asked about the involvement of political parties in the agitation, Pawar said that when a group of people go on a strike or hit the streets for some demands, it is an opportunity for the opposition to see if they can add more fuel to that agitation. On the defeat of NCP leader and MLC Shashikant Shinde in the Satara District Central Cooperative Bank elections and the subsequent stone-pelting by his followers at the NCP office in Satara on Tuesday, Pawar said Shinde took the elections “lightly”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/centre-wouldn-t-have-repealed-farm-laws-if-no-polls-in-up-states-pawar-101637763384141.html

24-11-2021||Mumbai||1,500 illegal structures demolished in 4 months in Malad: BMC||In a bid to curb the increasing illegal structures, the P North ward of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has demolished over 1,500 illegal structures in the past four months.The P/N ward is the largest municipal ward, in terms of geographical area, which covers the Malad, Gorai and Marve areas of the western suburbs. Makarand Dagadkhair, assistant municipal commissioner from this ward has said that the majority of the demolished illegal structures are commercial, while the remaining are residential structures. He also said that all these encroachments are taking place on lands owned by the state and Central government.“There are several land parcels in Marve, Erangal, Malvani and Madh that belong to the collector’s department. The civic body has been issuing notices to these establishments, however, they did not respond. Hence, we have now started to demolish these structures particularly,” Dagadkhair said.He also mentioned that to expedite the process, the BMC has appointed a contractor who is providing logistical support and manpower.Earlier, in June this year, 11 people were killed after a portion of a residential structure came down crashing in Malad. It was later found out this structure was also built on the collector’s land.“These agencies have to take the action and BMC provided manpower and logistics to them. We took prohibitory action after no response was received,” Dagadkhair said.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner said that the BMC has already urged the state agencies to appoint consultants for conducting a risk assessment of these illegal structures. Kakani added that BMC has already appointed a consultant who is conducting a survey of these structures on BMC-owned lands.“There are many people who live in these shanties, due to which, several accidents take place during monsoon, every year,” said Kakani. “We have urged them to carry out a risk assessment survey so that these people could be relocated in a different location,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1500-illegal-structures-demolished-in-4-months-in-malad-bmc-101637762423950.html
24-11-2021||Mumbai||CBI concludes arguments on state’s demand for SIT Anil Deshmukh case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday concluded its arguments in the petition filed by the Maharashtra government seeking the constitution of a special investigation team (SIT), headed by a retired judge, to take over the probe on the corruption allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. The first information report (FIR) against Deshmukh was filed by the central agency on April 21. In its closing arguments, the CBI submitted that the reliefs sought by the state for their two top officers namely chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey, who was summoned by the CBI were misconceived, as it could only be sought by the officers themselves. The CBI argued that the claim of the state that the investigation by CBI would be prejudiced, as its current director had a role to play, was misconceived and the petition was only intended to mislead the court. The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the petition filed by the state government, was informed by special counsel Darius Khambatta for the state that the reference of the conversation between DGP Pandey and former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh by the CBI in its arguments on Tuesday, was clearly intended to influence the mind of the court. Khambatta stated that though the CBI claimed that it was only calling upon Pandey in connection with the letter written by Singh to the CBI director on April 19, by referring to the conversation between the two, CBI wanted to influence the court against the state of Maharashtra. Singh had written to the CBI informing it about Pandey’s attempt to make him withdraw the letter written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, while the CBI was conducting the HC-ordered preliminary probe in the corruption allegations against Deshmukh, by Singh and a complaint by Dr Jaishri Patil. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi for CBI, however, refuted the claims of Khambatta and said that it was just an attempt by the state to mislead the court and draw the attention of the bench away from the matter on hand. While continuing his arguments, opposing the transfer of the CBI investigation to an SIT, Lekhi submitted that the grievance of the state that CBI director Subodh Jaiswal could not oversee the investigation as he was a part of the instances that were being investigated, was misplaced as the investigating officer was someone else. Lekhi further submitted that the grievance against Jaiswal could be raised only by Pandey as he was the aggrieved party and the state had no role in it. He also referred to Supreme Court judgements which established that only an aggrieved person could seek transfer if he apprehended a prejudice in the investigation. Lekhi concluded CBI’s arguments stating that there was malice on the part of the state of Maharashtra in filing the petition seeking transfer of investigation to SIT and hence it should not be entertained. While responding to CBI’s submissions, Khambatta drew the attention of the court to the material which CBI wanted to place before the court in a sealed cover and said that if the material was crucial to the investigation, the CBI should not submit it in a sealed cover, as the state was not averse to the investigation, a fact that it had been maintaining since the inception of the petition. Khambatta submitted that the only reason for submitting material in a sealed cover was to cause prejudice. The state government will continue its rejoinder on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-concludes-arguments-on-state-s-demand-for-sit-anil-deshmukh-case-101637761223862.html

Responding to the allegations of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders that they were being targeted by central agencies, he said, “I will be meeting the chief minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee in the next three to four days as she is likely to visit Mumbai.”Slamming the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, Pawar said that around six to seven ministers from the Mamata Banerjee were investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). “The same is happening here in Maharashtra but there is no need to worry. They will not find anything in these probes. They are setting an example on how to misuse power,” he added. Pawar said that the MVA government can be re-elected if all the three parties — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — decide to contest the polls together in 2024. “This government will complete its tenure of five years and if all the three parties decide to contest the 2024 assembly polls together, then it again will be re-elected,” he said.Commenting on the prime minister’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws, Pawar said that they would not have taken the decision if there were no assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab.“The ruling leaders faced a different sort of welcome in the recent days when they visited in Haryana, some parts of UP and Punjab. This has become a cause of concern as assembly polls are scheduled in these states,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-targeting-non-bjp-ruled-states-misusing-power-sharad-pawar-101637759544036.html

Bansal, however, clarified that the Jewar airport will start with domestic flights.“Project cost of phase 1 is ₹8,916 crore. The UP government is spending ₹4,326 crore on acquisition of land, rehabilitation and resettlement. PM Modi is personally monitoring the project,” the aviation secretary said.The Jewar airport is being built on 1,334 hectares of land, Bansal said. “It's a greenfield project that'll be implemented in four phases.

Nitish Kumar and the state’s education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary have advocated a harsher line against top university officials suspected to have crossed the line.In a formal communication to the governor ahead of their meeting, Choudhary said Nitish Kumar asked Raj Bhavan to order a “comprehensive inquiry” into the “serious’ charges levelled by Prof Md Qudus, vice-chancellor of Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University, against his predecessor. Wednesday’s meeting, viewed as an attempt to defuse the crisis, started at 12 noon and lasted for about half an hour. An hour later, governor Phagu Chauhan left for national capital Delhi where he was scheduled to meet Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, among others.Vijay Kumar Choudhary said he was not aware of the agenda for Kumar’s meeting with the governor but believes that it might be linked to the controversies around some vice-chancellors. “When the chief minister and governor meet, the conversation usually revolves around a whole range of issues,” he said. In the same breath, Choudhary added: “Higher education needs to be away from any kind of controversy as public perception is very important, and the CM always wants that.”Wednesday noon’s meeting between the two dignitaries came hours after the governor’s office changed its insistence on letting Magadh University vice-chancellor Rajendra Prasad continue despite a vigilance raid at his house and office last week.Late on Tuesday evening, Raj Bhavan notified that Rajendra Prasad has suddenly gone on medical leave for a month. And unlike in the past when the vice-chancellor of another university was given additional charge, Raj Bhavan named Magadh University’s pro-vice-chancellor Vibhuti Narayan Singh to hold the fort.Magadh University’s finance officer Dharmendra Kumar Tripathi has put in his papers citing personal reasons.A government official said these changes indicated that there may be a change in Raj Bhavan’s approach in handling top university officials and more officials under a cloud could be eased out.After Nitish Kumar’s meeting with governor Chauhan, two names for appointment of vice-chancellor in Patna’s Pataliputra University and pro-vice-chancellor in Nalanda Open University (Patna) were also cleared.Prof RK Singh has been appointed vice-chancellor of Pataliputra University. Singh is from Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand, formerly known as Kumaon Engineering College. Sanjay Kumar, principal of BD College, Patna has been appointed pro-vice-chancellor of Nalanda Open University. “These were pending for a long time and have been cleared,” Robert L Chongthu, principal secretary to the governor, said.Pataliputra University has been without a full-time vice-chancellor for nearly a year. Lalit Narayan Mithila University (Darbhanga) vice-chancellor SP Singh, who was accused of corruption by another vice-chancellor, had been holding additional charge of Pataliputra University.Social analyst NK Choudhary said that the appointments should not put a lid on the larger issue of corruption in the institutions of higher learning. “Appointments are a routine affair and should be done transparently. It should not be reduced to give and take between the government and the Raj Bhawan. After so much hue and cry over corruption, it must be taken to its logical conclusion. A king should not only be honest but also appear to be honest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-governor-meets-nitish-kumar-to-defuse-university-crisis-then-flies-to-delhi-101637754863657.html

24-11-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: City’s watch and ward — famous and infamous kotwals of Pune||Morning papers this week announced revival of legendary yet controversial Marathi play ”Ghashiram Kotwal”, a political satire written by accomplished playwright, Vijay Tendulkar. Written in 70s decade, it commented on rise of political party and abuse of power, but was based on historical events during the Peshwa period and had taken cinematic liberty about historical events. The title itself is based on “Ghashiram” who served as Kotwal of Pune under supervision of prominent minister, Nana Phadnavis, who in turn served four Peshwas, including Madhavrao Peshwa I. Who was Ghashiram and what does it meant to be Kotwal of Pune? Let us trace the rise and fall of Kotwali system in Pune that operated during the 18th century Pune. Kotwali system existed since old times in India and we find reference of “Koshtapal” through various sources that were responsible for city’s law and order during Rashtrakuta period. Later in medieval times, during Tughlaq and Mughal rule, Kotwali system was prevalent in major cities, including Agra. When Pune functioned as a small village, Zambre (Patils) are seen responsible for maintaining law and order and Kulkarni the clerks and village balutedars such as Mahars would help them in executing the functions of watch and ward. Kasba peth till few years back had the platform which once hosted the “Zambre Chawadi (office)” – from where the system operated. As Pune under Nanasaheb Peshwa grew, peths flourished, “Shravan Ramna” became a yearly affair, people practising various trades flocked Pune. These surges of new groups came to Pune in search of employment, opportunity, patronage and new home from across the country. Just as Katraj aquaduct provide water supply, redevelopment and establishment peths made way to development of housing and trade, a necessity to develop a system of watch and ward emerged, too. This became more evident after the attack and ransacking of Pune by Nizam in 1762. The earliest sanad document from year 1764 informs us about appointment of Balaji Narayan Ketkar as a Kotwal or “Chief Commissioner of Police” of Pune city. Before that, Kotwal had limited functions and would only supervise the customs, toll, octroi related activities. In 1764, Kotwali department was a full-fledged organisation who would look after law and order in the city, punishment of related offence and assisted in collection of revenue. This system was independent of the military system, operated within the city boundaries and functioned as a modern police department. The main operating station “Chavadi” was at Budhwar peth next to present day Dagdhusheth Datta temple and flower market, and it was assisted by other branches of chavdis in five different peth areas. Ghashiram Kotwal, one of the longest serving Kotwals of Pune, established two chavadis at Narayan peth and Shaniwar peth. He was also responsible for establishment of Navapura peth where next Kotawal, Anandrao Kashi established a chavadi. The department had bureaucratic officers such as Sar-amin, Amin, Diwan, Mujumdar, Fadnis, Daptardar and Potnis who would receive annual income. Under them, various clerks, (shibandi) inspectors, constables, office staff and (Najarbaaj or khabri) detectives would operate on monthly salaries to execute and process the orders. Kotwali department served functions of city corporation, city survey office, public service department and information broadcasting along with its primary function of policing. During Peshwa times, the city would be under curfew from 11 pm to 4 am and any person breaking the rule would be arrested. For this, the Kotwali soldiers would undertake night patrol. They were responsible for conducting police enquiry procedures for various crimes. Prostitution, gambling, illegal consumption of liquor and non-vegetarian food in public was punished. The weights and standards used in trade and measurements were approved and sanctioned (Bat-chhapai) by the department. They were responsible for revenue functions of valuation of properties, taxes, standardisation of market prices (Nirakh) and enforcing them. The inheritance of dead person without legal heir was deposited in state treasury through their agency. Corporation functions of cremation of unclaimed dead bodies, sanitation and construction of waste water gutters was part of the portfolio. Through “Davandi” or beating of drums department would inform public of the important government announcements. Department was responsible for collecting taxes on remarriage of widows, adoption, goat slaughter, trade, and oils and it contributed sizeably in department’s income. Kotwali would maintain records of bonded labour for certain caste and kept records of the clans and communities that entered and departed the city. Through entire history of Kotwali system in 18th century in Pune, we find exhaustive records of 23 different appointments of Kotwali. Of this, Ghashiram Kotwal and Anandrao Kashi are the most dominant ones. Ghashiram Savladas was Kanauji Gaud Brahmin from Aurangabad who came to Pune to explore better prospects. Within short duration, he acquired prominent position in Peshwa courts through his handsome face, sharp intellect and great oratory. He was appointed incharge of Kotwal office twice, once, for a year in 1777 and later for a decade long tenure during 1781 to 1791. In initial years he showed great promise by establishing firm hold over city’s law and order, set up new chavdis and increased the Kotwali staff per chavadi. He was responsible for major civil works, had setup peth Navapura and commissioned building of lake at Hadapsar to address water woes. He had built a large mansion for himself near Pulgate. He gained favour with Nana Phadnavis who was minister incharge of Kotwal system by efficiently handling Sawai Madhavrao’s wedding organisation in Pune. For that and on many other occasions he was showered with large sum of gifts from treasury by Nana Phadnavis. He won Nana’s confidence particularly, through his efficient network of spies who reported on Raghoba Dada’s activities against the state. However, in absence of restraint, Ghashiram started abusing the power. He started harassing the masses through his officers’ and started slipping in his accounting responsibilities. Nana Phadnavis, on complaints of his subordinates such as Pandurang Bedekar, warned him on number of occasions but it was all in vain. His insolence and arrogance however brought his downfall! During “Shravan Ramna” of 1791, few Telangi Brahmins camping near Ghashiram Kotwal’s mansion raided his garden to eat maize. The gardener thrashed the Brahmins and complained to Ghashiram Kotwal who arrested them and put them in a dungeon with no supply of air. This resulted in horrific death of 21 Brahmins. When Peshwa asked Nana Phadnavis about the whereabouts of missing Brahmins, Ghashiram Kotwal lied through the teeth and said the Brahmins indulged in theft and died of consumption of opium drugs. He also refused to hand over the dead bodies. A full-scale enquiry was commissioned by Nana, but crowd disrupted the proceedings. Ghashiram was arrested by Nana. However, thousands of enraged Telangi Brahmins gathered, confiscated Ghashiram from the custody, paraded him culminating into his violent public prosecution by the mob. Within few years of this episode, nature of Kotwali system was altered drastically by Bajirao II and it ceased to exist around end of century. Originally responsible for Pune’s law & order of Pune, the abuse of power and corruption brought end to the crucial public institution! An important history lesson for all times!

24-11-2021||Mumbai||After dip in 2020, dengue cases see a six-fold rise||Mumbai The city has recorded over six-fold rise in the cases of dengue this year. Data released by the civic body showed that the city saw 821 cases of the mosquito-borne disease as of November 23, compared to 129 cases in all of 2020. This rise is mainly due to the fact that the pandemic and ensuing lockdown led to reduced mobility and less testing in 2020. In 2019, 920 dengue cases were recorded in the city. The city’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the situation is under control if the cases are compared to the previous years. Civic officials said reduced mobility of people played a crucial role in the decline in cases in 2020. A section of the population could have also gone untested, as the manpower in the laboratories was largely directed towards Covid-19 related work, and such patients may have simply relied on online consultation for treatment. “Now that mobility has increased, people are stepping out to go to offices, markets and walks. All these activities automatically increase the chances of mosquito bites,” said Dr Nitin Karnik, head of medicine at the civic-run Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, Sion. He has been admitting six to eight confirmed cases of dengue every week. “But many patients are coming to our hospital from other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR),” he said. Dengue is spread by the female Aedes Aegypti mosquito that breeds in clean water and is known to be a day-biter. The symptoms include fever, joint pain, severe body ache, rashes, persistent vomiting and nasal bleeding. There is no direct treatment for dengue and most interventions are for symptomatic relief. The infection is caused by one of the four closely related serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV) identified as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. Studies have shown that the DENV-2 accounts for the maximum number of cases in Mumbai and Maharashtra. According to Dr Karnik, many dengue patients are being admitted to hospitals with severely low platelet count, neurological complications like altered sensorium and renal involvements. “Such patients require Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. When patients come with a platelet count below 10,000, it becomes a huge risk factor for bleeding in the brain,” said Dr Karnik citing a case of a 25-year-old full-term pregnant woman whose platelet count had fallen to 5000. “We had to keep her in the ICU, give about seven units of platelet transfusion and wait till her count went up to 80,000. She delivered a week later without any complications,” he said. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava said there have been a fairly high number of dengue cases since September. “The jump definitely cannot be trivialised,” he said adding that he generally avoids admitting dengue patients unless they have a risk factor involved. “A majority of the dengue patients can be managed at home,” he said. “We are also getting a lot of patients with classic viral symptoms who are not testing positive for dengue, chikungunya or malaria,” said Dr Paritosh Baghel, an internal medicine consultant at SL Raheja Hospital (a Fortis associate hospital). “These patients have a fever, joint pain, body aches, rashes as well as low platelet counts. We commonly label them as cases of unknown viral illness,” he said. The city has also recorded 60 cases of chikungunya- another viral infection spread by the infected Aedes Aegypti mosquito- this year, after zero cases consecutively in 2019 and 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-dip-in-2020-dengue-cases-see-a-six-fold-rise-101637749943179.html

24-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi eases pollution-related curbs; schools, govt offices to reopen on Nov 29||Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai announced the easing of pollution-related curbs in a phased manner on Wednesday. Schools, colleges and educational institutions will open on November 29, along with government offices, whose employees have been working from home.The measures were imposed by the government last week to tackle the escalating pollution crisis in the Capital. Entry of CNG and electric trucks carrying non-essential items from other states into New Delhi will be allowed from Saturday, the minister said. The ban on petrol and diesel trucks, however, will remain in place until December 3. “For the last three days, we have observed a reduction in the pollution levels in Delhi. We have decided to ease the restrictions, but a strict watch will be kept on the sources [of pollution],” Rai told reporters. The state government and affiliated offices had switched to work-from-home mode for their staff since November 17 to cut down on the use of private vehicles. Also Read: ‘We will not close this matter’: Supreme Court to Centre on Delhi air pollutionThe minister said that the government is providing special shuttle buses from the secretariat to nearby metro stations to encourage people to use the metro instead of their own vehicles. “Construction activities have already been allowed, but we are keeping a close watch on the sites. If any violation is found, we will temporarily ban operations and impose heavy fines,” Rai said. The minister said that till Wednesday, 1,221 construction sites were inspected by 585 teams deployed by the government across Delhi, with 105 sites shut down for violating dust-related norms. “These sites were not adhering to the 14-point guideline we had issued. They have been shut down and a penalty has also been imposed,” Rai said.After a slew of pollution control measures were implemented by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the Delhi-NCR region and adjoining areas on November 16, the Delhi government imposed restrictions, extended a ban on the entry of trucks, continued to keep schools shut, and allowed its employees to work from home in a fresh order released last Sunday.Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive School’s Conference, which has over 120 private schools in New Delhi as its members, welcomed the government’s decision to resume in-person classes in school. Acharya said that schooling had been disrupted due to constant closures and it was necessary for students to return to classrooms. “The reopening of schools was much needed. Students have stayed away from school for a very long time and it’s time that they return to the classrooms,” said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka.The Delhi government’s decision came on a day when the city’s air quality began to deteriorate as wind speeds slowed down over the Capital. New Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) was “poor” on Tuesday - for the first time since November 1 - with a reading of 290 recorded, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin. The AQI reading shot up to 365 – in the “very poor” category - at 2pm on Wednesday. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said New Delhi will continue to see variations in the air quality, with meteorological factors playing a key role. To counter that, it is important to ensure strict vigilance so that extreme curbs don’t need to be imposed again, she said.“Air quality will improve and worsen all through this winter now, but it is important that adequate measures are taken in advance so that we don’t reach those severe [pollution] levels. Pollution from construction sites and garbage burning can easily be controlled. We also need to see what can be done to reduce emissions from the vehicular sector. While the government is trying to promote public transport, it is also turning out to be a big challenge,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-eases-pollution-related-curbs-schools-govt-offices-to-reopen-on-nov-29-101637747483030.html

After a careful medical evaluation, we decided that the tumour would be removed surgically. It was a challenging case as the tumour was massive in size and located in the central part of the liver.He further said, "There were a lot of risks involved during the operation as removing the tumour was itself a challenge. While operating, we also had to save the blood vessels (supply blood to both sides of the liver). It took us 8 hours to remove the tumour. The postoperative period was smooth and uneventful. The patient was discharged after 11 days of hospital stay."The patient who underwent the surgery said, "I am relieved from the pain which I had been facing for the past 20 years. I had visited multiple hospitals and had lost all hopes as many hospitals had refused to treat me. The tumour grew over the years posing a risk to my health. Finally, I am thankful to the doctors at Fortis Hospital for giving me a new life. By successful removal of the tumour.""Congratulations to the doctor's team, in achieving another clinical milestone by giving a new lease of life to the patient.

Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal made the announcement at a press conference. “Our first train for Ayodhya will be leaving on December 3, registrations have started,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The CM further stated that the Delhi government has also added Tamil Nadu’s Velankanni Church in the list of pilgrimage sites under the scheme for senior citizens of the national capital.Last month, the Delhi cabinet gave a go-ahead to the inclusion of Ayodhya as one of the pilgrimage sites under the scheme.The first train to Ayodhya under the scheme will carry as many as 1,000 senior citizens of Delhi, PTI reported citing Kamal Bansal, chairman of the Delhi government’s Tirth Yatra Vikas Samiti.“There is a great demand from senior citizens for the pilgrimage scheme…Pilgrims for other places will be sent after preparations are complete,” Bansal was quoted as saying by PTI.Notably, the AAP-led Delhi government bears the expenditure of the pilgrims under the 'Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana' for their pilgrimage to a total of 13 religious sites, including Shirdi, Haridwar, Mathura, Vaishno Devi, Vrindavan and Puri, among others.Since the scheme is for elderly people, one attendant aged 21 or more can accompany the person and Delhi government will bear his/her expenses as well.Also Read | 'Good schools, hospital for Uttarakhand, too, if voted': Kejriwal bats for AAP's CM faceKejriwal has promised the same free pilgrimage schemes in Goa and Uttarakhand as well, where assembly elections are scheduled next year.

24-11-2021||Delhi||#OddEven in Delhi: Effective or eyewash? Denizens divided||Gearing up to work from office or hit the road for a getaway? Hold that thought; you may need to check number plates of your vehicles, for the return of odd-even is imminent. To curb alarming pollution levels, the Delhi government is mulling over bringing back the traffic scheme, according to which one can drive only odd/even numbered vehicles in the Capital, based on the last digit of their number plates. While some feel this will help control smog, others denizens are of the opinion that it is nothing more than an eyewash At last, a start“Anything that we can do to curb pollution will make a difference. And we must go for it. Our office has always supported this and will accommodate it this time as well. During the pandemic, everyone has been working from home and I’m sure in this scenario too, the corporate sector will support the WFH option for the ease of employees following odd-even,” says Charu Puri, marketing professional from Safdarjung Enclave. “Odd-even certainly helped reduced traffic on the roads in the past, and possibly helped in controlling pollution as well. There is no denying that it encourages people to use public transport. Though it causes some inconvenience, especially to those who don’t have an alternative personal vehicle, but it also encourages carpooling among both the private and government sector employees. The Supreme Court and High Court judges have adopted carpooling voluntarily. If they can, why can’t the rest do so, to ensure a better environment for our future generations,” asks Nidhi Dhull, advocate from Saket. “Vehicular smoke makes it tough for people to breathe. I’ve seen children suffer during smog and the pollutants that come out of any of these cars make it tougher for people to breathe. If the number of vehicles on the roads can be reduced, it would definitely be beneficial. But a well laid public transport system is the real solution in the long run,” says Dr Anuradha Kishore, a paediatrician from New Friends Colony. Just an eyewash!“The core issues need to be addressed first. If those issues are not dealt with, odd-even won’t be of any help. During Covid-19 lockdown, traffic was not an issue. But now, with everything going back to new normal, people have started travelling in personal vehicles and the increased traffic makes me think that no odd-even can free Delhi from traffic jams! I feel the if construction and all is halted, it would be more effective than implementation of this rule,” says Dr Mahima Sabherwal from Ashram.“It’s the uncertainty of the situation which is getting to me. We were planning a road trip to a location close by. Ab beech main yeh odd-even ho gaya toh we’ll be stuck! Also, is this really a solution? I mean they need to give prior notice much in advance and also have a plan in place. How did it even help the last time,” says Rohit Raj, an investment banker from Greater Kailash II. “What will this odd and even scheme even do? It’s not like things will improve a lot after it’s implemented. But the amount of inconvenience that it’s going to create will be grave. After the pandemic, the economy is struggling to bounce back, and such rules will only make it difficult for people to get back to offices, schools, etc. The government ought to make rules and adopt measures that will actually do something to curb pollution,” says Ravi Sarda, a businessman from Model Town.

But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has moved the high court demanding simultaneous elections to all civic bodies. Elections to 114 civic bodies are pending for more than a year. The TMC controls most of the civic bodies in West Bengal. The terms of the elected boards ended over two years ago, but polls were not held because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Also Read: Mamata likely to meet Modi today; BSF issue, developmental talks on chartsThe state election commission has told the high court that it wants to hold the municipal polls in phases starting with Kolkata and Howrah. A senior official of the state election commission said the poll panel has told the high court that at least 85% people in Kolkata and around 55% people in Howrah are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and hence, the commission seeks to hold the elections in these two civic bodies first. Also on Tuesday, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar called on state election commissioner (SEC) Saurabh Das to not become “an extension” of the Mamata Banerjee government, while observing that he has received multiple inputs indicating that the poll panel has conceded its constitutional mandate and authority, and was toeing the state government’s line. “Cautioned Shri Saurav Das that SEC @MamataOfficial toeing the line of state government and be merely its executing agency, would be an outrage of the Constitution as also unwholesome for the democratic process. It will run down essence and spirit of constitutional provisions in Part IXA,” Dhankhar tweeted. Responding to Dhankhar’s interaction with the state’s top election official and his public posts, TMC minister Tapas Roy said, “The governor can always give advice to anyone, but he surely knows that the state election commission is an independent body, just like the Election Commission of India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/civic-elections-in-west-bengal-calcutta-high-court-to-hear-bjp-s-petition-today-101637731101796.html

24-11-2021||Mumbai||Vaccinations, herd immunity reducing active Covid cases in Maharashtra: Experts||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 766 fresh Covid-19 cases and 19 fatalities from the disease, taking the overall tally of infections to 6,631,297 and the death toll to 140,766.Experts, meanwhile, said the state was seeing an overall decline in active Covid-19 cases largely because of two factors: the anti-Covid vaccination drive and herd immunity.Mumbai recorded 190 new coronavirus cases and one death with its tally of fatalities reaching 16,311. A total of 87,506 Covid-19 tests were done in the past 24 hours across Maharashtra, and 929 people recovered from the infection on Tuesday.The daily Covid-19 test positivity rate for the state was 0.87%.Also Read: K’taka issues new RT-PCR test norms for people coming from MaharashtraPune had earlier been leading in terms of the number of active Covid-19 cases for months, followed by Thane. However, due to a recent surge in cases, Mumbai now has the most number of active coronavirus infections.Of the 9,493 active cases, Mumbai has the highest, with 2,561, followed by Pune (2,027) and Thane (1,160).State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the decline in active Covid-19 cases is directly proportional to the number of new infections. “The decrease in active cases indicates the decline in Covid-19 infections. Our sustained efforts to control the virus are bearing the fruit in the form of a lower number of new cases,” he said.During the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, 691,851 active cases were reported in the state on April 23. The figure was below 20,000 on October 27 and less than 30,000 on October 13.Dr Ameet Mandot, director at Gut Clinic, said vaccinations against the coronavirus disease and herd immunity together led to a decline in numbers. “Vaccination has played a vital role in the decline in cases, and it helped in reducing severity [of the disease] in infected people. Also, people are developing herd immunity. These factors are hugely responsible for the control of the virus,” said Dr Mandot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccinations-herd-immunity-reducing-active-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-experts-101637726001091.html

24-11-2021||Chandigarh||4 night shelters to be operationalised for the homeless in Ludhiana||With mercury levels dipping and fog enveloping the city, the municipal corporation has initiated preparations to operationalise four night shelters. The MC will also arrange to bring the people sleeping on footpaths or roadsides to the night shelters and will also feed them. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal held a meeting with officials of the Zone D office on Tuesday and directed them to open the night shelters for homeless. Directions were also issued to prepare a roster of employees in all the four zones of the MC who will be deputed to transport the homeless to shelters in city buses.With a capacity to shelter over 220 persons, the night shelters are situated at four locations — the Haibowal Dairy Complex, near the Clock Tower, Moti Nagar and in Millerganj near Manju Cinema. Officials said that if required, temporary shelters will also be established at the Jagraon Bridge and few more points where a large number of homeless people are found.MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said that tie-ups were being done with gurdwaras, and NGOs for arranging food for those who come to the night shelter. Interested persons or NGOs can also contact MC officials, in case they want to contribute.“The night shelter near the Clock Tower will be opened on Tuesday night, while the others are expected to open in a day or so. City buses will be deployed and MC employees will locate and transport homeless people to the night shelters,” said Dachalwal.Low footfall at night sheltersIn the past, the shelters have been witnessing low footfall even after transport facility was arranged by the MC. The old mattresses kept in the shelters are also washed once in a while. One of the officials, requesting anonymity, said the homeless also avoid visiting the shelters as they receive blankets, and food from philanthropes on the roadsides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-night-shelters-to-be-operationalised-for-the-homeless-in-ludhiana-101637702695837.html
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana:Deadline to pay water-sewer arrears without penalty to end on November 24||The one-time settlement policy floated by the state government allowing payment of pending water and sewer bills without interest or penalty, and regularisation of connections at nominal rates will expire on Wednesday. As per the notification dated August 25, defaulters were given a three-month period to submit a nominal amount (less than 10% of the normal fee) for getting their connections regularised and pay the pending user charges without penalty and 18% annual interest on delayed payment. Those who fail to avail the one-time settlement policy will have to pay interest on the pending arrears for water-sewer charges. In addition, 100% penalty will be imposed on concessional rates being charged under the policy for regularisation of illegal connections. It also said that no penalty or interest will be charged on principal amount if the payment of pending user charges is made within three months (till November 24) of the notification, while only penalty will be waived off if the amount is paid after three months but within six months (till February 24). After six months, the user will have to pay both penalty and interest on the pending amount and the connection will also be disconnected on non-payment of dues. Around 7,000 illegal connections were detected during the MC’s door-to-door survey to check illegal water-sewer connections. These connections have been regularised under the OTS policy at nominal rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianadeadline-to-pay-water-sewer-arrears-without-penalty-to-end-on-november-24-101637702515663.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||‘Govt yet to sanction plea against clean chits in ex-CS assault case’: Delhi police submission in sessions court||The Delhi Police has told a sessions court that the state government is yet to sanction a challenge to the exoneration of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia, and nine Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs, in a case filed over the alleged assault on former chief secretary Anshu Prakash during a late-night meeting in 2018.On August 11 this year, a city court exonerated Kejriwal, Sisodia and the nine MLAs in the case, saying there was no “criminal conspiracy” or “unlawful assembly” as alleged by Prakash.The former chief secretary challenged this decision before the sessions court, contending that the magistrate had drawn erroneous inferences and conclusions without having the benefit of examination of the prosecution witnesses.Responding to Prakash’s appeal, police said they firmly believed the order giving a clean chit to the accused was a “fit case for filing a revision” petition. In a reply filed before additional sessions judge Geetanjali Goel, police also said they have taken legal advice from experts, including the additional solicitor general.Police said that, pursuant to such opinions, they wrote two letters on September 17 and October 18 to the Delhi government requesting it to direct the concerned officer/department to file criminal revision before the sessions’ court “…however, the outcome of the same has not been communicated back to us”.Police also said the investigating officer of the case did not get the requisite support of the prosecution, and that additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava was abruptly restrained from appearing in the case by the Delhi home department.The court took the reply on record, and posted the matter for further hearing on December 7.In his police complaint in February 2018, Prakash alleged that AAP MLAs assaulted during the course of a midnight meeting called by the CM’s former adviser VK Jain on February 19, 2018, to discuss the release of the party’s advertisements..On August 11, the city court, while discharging the CM, his deputy and nine AAP MLAs from the case, said that the incident happened suddenly, after some of the MLAs started questioning Prakash over some issues, and in the spur of the moment, two of the MLAs — Amanatullah Khan and Parkash Jarwal — acted without any conspiracy, prior meeting of minds, or pre-meditation.After the August 11 verdict, Sisodia called the case a “conspiracy” by the Bharatiya Janata Party, a claim the party refuted.Prakash, through senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, has contended before the sessions court that the trial court failed to appreciate, among other things, that the meeting was called at midnight, which was very unusual as there was no emergency at the time.Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-yet-to-sanction-plea-against-clean-chits-in-ex-cs-assault-case-delhi-police-submission-in-sessions-court-101637701845590.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Portrait of tomorrow’s Mumbaiwale||The cotton candy man is wavering like a pink kashti (boat) in this fast-moving grey stream of Sadar Bazar gentry in Gurugram. The wooly plastic-wrapped pink and yellow candies he is holding by a wooden ‘danda’ on his right arm seem unnaturally cheery for the solemn expressions on his face. His eyes are cast downwards even as the busy shoppers are going about him, not noticing his candies.“I’m thinking, I’m in tension,” says Nahar Singh.Moving towards the side, he explains in a murmuring voice that he is planning to leave Gurugram. “I’m planning to go to Bambai,” he says, referring to the city by its former name.In his 20s, Mr Singh has been selling candies in Sadar Bazar for about half a dozen years “but now the business is no longer as it used to be.” He says he manages to earn about “only ₹15,000 every month, which is barely enough to support the family in the village.” Initially, the young man almost decided to go back home for good. His village is close to Tundla, a town near Agra in UP. “But then I thought that might finish my future permanently.”To be sure, Mr Singh was never ambitious. He had arrived in the so-called Millennium City without any pushy determination to transform his life. He had simply followed many of his cousins and acquaintances who too carry on with the same cotton candy business in this city (they in turn had followed the footsteps of their circle’s previous generation). In fact, most of the cotton candy sellers in Sadar Bazar happen to be from Agra and neighbouring districts. Mr Singh lives in a rented room near the bus stand with a group of such hawkers. Every morning each of these men makes his own cotton candies before hitting the streets.Mumbai seems more promising to Mr Singh and “it’s not that I will be taking a big risk (by going into the unknown).” He is familiar with the metropolis. He has some Tundla cousins, too, there selling these same candies. He himself worked there for three months some years ago—and didn’t stay longer “because it was so far from my home town.” Now he feels that “better sense” is prevailing over him as “Gurgawa is not the right place for me.”Absentmindedly ringing the brass bell that many Sadar Bazar hawkers like him carry in their free hand to catch the attention of distracted shoppers, he says, “I might soon leave for Bambai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-tomorrow-s-mumbaiwale-101637701279060.html
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Capping rates at ₹100 unfeasible: Cable service providers||A day after Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi fixed the monthly cable TV rate at ₹100, service providers called a statewide emergency meeting and concluded that the price slash was unfeasible. Alleging that the Telecom Regulatory Authority Of India (TRAI) was micromanaging the cable networks, Fastway Media Cable Network CEO Peeush Mahajan said, “ The regulatory authority has fixed the base price at ₹130, with an additional 18% GST, which roughly comes to ₹154 per connection for 200 channels. Of the ₹130, ₹91 goes to the cable operator, ₹10 to taxes, and the remainder goes to the service provider. Thus, ₹91 goes to cable operators, who have to pay employees salaries, and maintenance costs.” “Not just us, even DTH providers charge between ₹300 to ₹900 per package. Nearly 20,000 people from across the state are associated with the cable business and if corrective steps are not taken, it will be really difficult to run the business,” said Mahajan, adding that operators will urge the CM to reconsider his decision. ‘Selective price slashing’ Another cable operator said there should not be selective price slashing. “If cable TV prices have been capped, then the government should cap the prices of DTH providers as well. Why this selective penalising? Our business is already suffering as people are increasingly shifting to high-speed internet-based platforms,” said the cable operator, requesting anonymity.The CM had said the prices were being capped to end the “cable mafia.” He had also said that transport and cable in the state were owned and controlled by the Badals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capping-rates-at-100-unfeasible-cable-service-providers-101637701316180.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||Minor apprehended for raping, killing woman, burning body||The city police on Tuesday said that they apprehended a 17-year-old boy for allegedly raping and killing a 32-year-old woman in Dwarka and dumping her body in a drain over a week ago.The woman’s body, with burn marks on her forehead and private parts, was found in a drain in southwest Delhi’s Dabri in Dwarka on November 15. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary said police had apprehended the teenager on November 18 on the basis of CCTV footage and manual surveillance.An investigating officer, who asked not to be named, said the woman was seen near the teenager’s house, following which he was questioned.“During questioning, he confessed he had murdered the woman. He also said that he burnt her private parts and forehead using kerosene to remove evidence of sexual assault,” said the officer.According to police, on November 15, a passerby had spotted the woman’s body in the drain near the CNG fuel pump of Dabri sector 2.A police official aware of the case, on the condition of anonymity, had said, “The woman’s body was covered with a cloth, which seemed like a green bedsheet usually used in government hospitals. There were burn marks on her forehead and private parts. Prima facie, it looked like she was assaulted and beaten to death. It looks like she was murdered elsewhere after which her body was dumped here.”Police said they had initially circulated the victim’s photos on different WhatsApp groups and was identified by her family.Investigators said they questioned around 2,700 people and checked CCTV cameras for leads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/minor-apprehended-for-raping-killing-woman-burning-body-101637701013588.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||SC rejects plea, clears way for new VP house||The central government can now start building a new residence for the Vice President on a public park and bus depot after the Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition challenging the change in land use.“It is not the case of the petitioner that the authorities have no power to introduce such a change. Only argument is that in the past, the area was shown as recreational ground and commensurate area has not been provided,” a three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar said. “This cannot be the scope of judicial review. It is the prerogative of the authorities concerned and change effected in a government plan, in one sense, is a matter of policy.”The issue related to plot 1 of the Central Vista area of the national capital, which is now a six-acre public park and a nine-acre bus depot.Lawyer Rajeev Suri had, in a petition, objected to the conversion of the open space available for public recreation with no alternate site allotted to compensate the loss. Advocate Shikhil Suri, who argued the petition, said that if the government wished to take over the green space, it must provide an alternative within the Vista.The bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, said: “It is not some private property being created there. It is for the construction of Vice President’s bungalow…will public view have to be taken on where the VP residence should be?”It was the only challenge against the Central Vista redevelopment plan pending in the top court.On January 5, the court gave the nod for the entire project by dismissing a clutch of petitions filed by environmentalists, architects, social activists and lawyers challenging the project on multiple grounds, including harm to environment, heritage and in violation of the development rules prevailing in Delhi.“There should be an end to everything,” said Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre.The judges relied on an affidavit filed by government explaining the reasons for changing the land use of Plot 1, which housed temporary barracks and stables during the World War 2.The reason for shifting the residence to the proposed site, according to the affidavit, was to help ease the traffic situation in the Central Vista as the movement of the Vice President was mainly to Parliament.“This will be well facilitated by the proposed Vice President residence being in close proximity to Parliament,” said the affidavit filed by the Central Public Works Department’s (CPWD) executive engineer Ashwani Mittal. On October 28, 2020, this plot was notified as residential.“It is not the case of the petitioner that the change in land use has been effected due to any malafide. Since sufficient reasons have been given for change in land use of Plot 1, we find no reason to examine the matter further. We therefore, put a quietus to the matter by dismissing the matter summarily,” the bench said.The revamp project envisages a new Parliament with a built-up area of around 60,000 square metres and expanded seating for over 1,200 members of both Houses, along with 51 ministries in 10 buildings.The CPWD affidavit further disclosed that “considering the overall public purpose of the central vista” the Centre has not only compensated for the loss of public recreational space, but has on its own added numerous facilities in the master plan of the central vista project for the larger benefit of the public.The government had told the Supreme Court that the petition by Suri should be dismissed as the question of change in character of master plan was covered in the judgment of January 5 giving the go-ahead to the central vista project.“Taking a holistic view and complying with Master Plan Delhi (MPD)-2021 provisions, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has approved the change of land use without compromising with green area, built heritage, transport infrastructure, better utilization of the spaces and fully complying with the provisions of the Delhi Development Authority Act, 1957 and the MPD-2021,” the Centre had submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/screjects-plea-clears-way-for-new-vp-house-101637700697982.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||Behind differing farm fire counts: Satellite resolution, methodology||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa)’s VIIRS-SNPP satellite showed 74,015 farm fires in Punjab between October 1 and November 16 .But data collated by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, using a combination of both VIIRS-SNPP and the MODIS satellite and sensor systems, which is used by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region, and the Central Pollution Control Board, showed cumulative fire counts in Punjab only touched 68,922 till November 16.Then there is data from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), part of the Union ministry of earth sciences, whose data doesn’t match that of Nasa or IARI. For instance, the number of fires, according to Safar, peaked on November 7 (4,189), but this doesn’t tally with the fire counts being released by IARI or Nasa.CAQM has now asked states to only rely on data being collated by IARI.Experts say a difference in methodology, satellite resolution, and the area being scanned can explain the differing farm fire figures, with Safar’s daily count not only comprising the fires recorded in Punjab and Haryana, but also Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. It also excludes some fires.“Ours is a difference in methodology, as we combine data from two Nasa satellites and two Isro satellites, using a combination of the VIIRS, MODIS and INSAT-3D/3DR (Indian National Satellite System) to generate a fire count. This count only includes those that can influence Delhi’s air, so some fires are omitted,” explains Gufran Beig, founder and project director at Safar.Beig says while the resolution of NASA’s SNPP satellite can go down to 300 x 300 metres, thereby being able to capture even smaller fire counts close to the surface, Indian satellites have a resolution of 3x3 kilometres, 10 times lower, which can lead to a lower fire count. It’s also important to see how often the images are captured, he adds.CAQM, when contacted, clarified that all states had been asked to adhere to a framework laid down by Isro before August 30 which will ensure a uniform process is followed in detecting farm fires. “A combination of SNPP-VIIRS and MODIS (Terra and aqua) satellites and sensors is in place, which is being shared by IARI. Overall numbers so far show a reduced count this year as compared to last year.”According to a research paper, “Objective evaluation of stubble emission of North India and quantifying its impact on air quality of Delhi” which was published in the Science of the Total Environment journal last year, Indian satellites have an advantage in terms of a geostationary orbit and capturing data every 15 to 30 minutes, but have a disadvantage because of coarser resolution.“MODIS and VIIRS can detect a larger number of fires, and INSAT-3D due to its better temporal resolution could detect even those fire events which MODIS missed. There are number of instances where anomalies were found on day-to-day basis and rectified carefully. VIIRS was often found to detect additional counts which were never confirmed by ground surveys that might have occurred due to festival related firecrackers or sources other than stubble burning,” the paper states.Dr Mahesh Narang, principal extension scientist at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana says IARI uses satellite data that captures fire counts multiple times a day, but adds that there is need for a common methodology across all states to ensure numbers can be correctly calculated.“There is no right or wrong system, but if we are comparing satellite data or remote sensing data, we need to analyse it with the same satellite data from last year, to get accurate numbers. Data for Punjab this year shows a 13.2% reduction and if the same satellite is analysed next year, you can get accurate figures to compare,” Narang says.The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), which analysed Nasa’s VIIRS satellite data between September 15 and November 21 showed Punjab recording 76,320 fires with Haryana recording 9,409 fires during the same period. The figures for the corresponding period under the Isro protocol shows 71,024 fires in Punjab and 6,642 fires for Haryana.If November is analysed, Safar’s monthly fire count recorded 64,051 fires, however, this figure includes fires from UP and Jharkhand as well, while omitting certain fires with ‘low’ intensity. The Isro fire count showed 61,272 fires in Punjab and Haryana, a difference of around 6,000 fires from Nasa’s VIIRS, which recorded 67,754 fires.S Narayanan, Member Secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said the state was acting as per the CAQM’s guidelines and using the ISRO satellite numbers, being collated by IARI. “Last year, we were using data from Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) in Hisar and the numbers were not as accurate. This year, the Commission has taken this decision to have a uniform system across all states. The figures being compared for this year are being done with the same satellite data for last year now,” says Narayanan.According to LS Kurinji, programme associate at CEEW, Sangrur in Punjab is leading the fire count so far this year with 8,872 logged between September 1 and November 22, followed by Bathinda, Moga and Ferozepur districts.“Ludhiana also reported a marked rise in farm fires this year, reaching 5,395 compared to the last year’s figure of 3,885. In Haryana, Fatehabad reported a maximum of 1,968 fires, followed by Kaithal, Jind and Karnal districts,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/behind-differing-farm-fire-counts-satellite-resolution-methodology-101637699867708.html
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||FIR against Kangana Ranaut in Mumbai for ‘derogatory’ remarks against Sikhs||Police on Tuesday registered an FIR against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut here for allegedly using derogatory language against the Sikh community in a social media post, an official said.The FIR was lodged at the suburban Khar police station a day after the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) submitted a complaint against the actor.Ranaut (34) was booked under section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and further investigation was underway, the official said.According to the official, the complainant in the case is Amarjeet Singh Sandhu, a Mumbai-based businessman who was part of a DSGMC delegation that submitted the complaint on Monday.In a statement, Sandhu accused the actor of making derogatory remarks against his community in a post on Instagram.After submitting the complaint, the DSGMC delegation, led by Manjinder Singh Sirsa, a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader who is also president of the organisation, had met Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil and top officials of the Mumbai police, and demanded action against Ranaut.In the complaint, the DSGMC mentioned that Ranaut had intentionally and deliberately portrayed the farmers’ protest (Kisan Morcha) as a “Khalistani” movement and also dubbed the Sikh community as “Khalistani terrorists”.She also made references to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and the then prime minister Indira Gandhi, it said.In the post, the actor has used very derogatory and insulting language against the Sikh community, according to the complaint.“This act on her part is most degrading, disrespectful and contemptuous, which has hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community settled all over the world,” it added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fir-against-kangana-ranaut-in-mumbai-for-derogatory-remarks-against-sikhs-101637700055563.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||‘Planning concessions for scrapping vehicles’: Nitin Gadkari||People scrapping their old cars while buying new ones might get tax breaks if the finance ministry agrees to a proposal mooted by the transport ministry, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday.“The GST (goods and services tax) revenue of both the Centre and the states will rise due to the scrappage policy,” Gadkari said. “I will discuss with the finance ministry on how to provide more (tax-related) concessions under the new vehicle scrappage policy.”The minister was speaking at the inauguration of Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India’s first government-approved scrapping and recycling facility for end-of-life vehicles in Noida.States and Union territories are supposed to provide up to 25% tax rebate on road tax for vehicles bought after scrapping old ones. At the same time, renewing registration certificates of vehicles that are older than 15 years will cost up to eight times more from April 2022.Scrapping old vehicles is important because a vehicle that is 15 years old releases emissions equivalent to 15 new vehicles, Gadkari said. “The scrapping policy is going to boost automobile sales in India. We are expecting that there will be 10-12% more sales once the policy picks up. It will create at least 200,000 jobs directly or indirectly. Also, availability of low-cost raw materials such as aluminium, rubber, steel, copper and plastic will increase, resulting in reduction in the production cost due to lower imports. This has a potential to reduce the raw material cost by 33%,” he said.The existing vehicle-scrapping cycle has a low recovery percentage, and several materials are wasted or not properly recycled. The recovery percentage in India is about 70-75%, according to official estimates, while global benchmarks for recovery from scrapped vehicles are in the range of 85-95%.The scrapping facility in Noida is the second in India, which aims to build 3-4 such facilities in every district of the country, the minister said. Busy districts should have four facilities, while economically backward districts should have at least two centres, he added.“The turnover of our automobile industry is ₹7.5 lakh crore, of which ₹3 lakh crore is from exports. My target as India’s transport minister is to increase the industry’s turnover to the volume of ₹15 lakh crore within five years, and for that we are encouraging ethanol, flex engine, CNG, LNG, green hydrogen and electric vehicles,” Gadkari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/planning-concessions-for-scrapping-vehicles-nitin-gadkari-101637699497704.html

24-11-2021||Chandigarh||BJP plans to contest all 117 seats in Punjab||Hoping to gain ground in Punjab after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal three farm laws, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has asked its state and the district units to identify probable candidates for all 117 assembly segments of the state.The BJP has been at the receiving end of the farmer unions’ ire in Punjab that is the hotbed of the agitation. Their leaders have been repeatedly targeted by protesters, who halted their movement, disrupted meetings and even laid siege to houses of some of them, in the past one year. According to the strategy chalked out by the BJP after several rounds of meetings that were chaired by party’s election in-charge and Union minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, it has decided to take feedback from constituency in-charges and block committees which will send names of all probable candidates to district units. “The entire process will be completed by December 10. The party has decided to go full steam to contest elections on all the seats,” said a party general secretary. No discussion yet on pact with Capt’s party According to a core group member of the party, no discussion was held on the possibilities of an alliance with Amarinder’s new party. “We have been asked to increase political activities in all segments across the state. There is plan to start the mega outreach drive in which central leaders are expected to reach out to be people of Punjab, but that will finalised once the three controversial farm laws are repealed in Parliament,” said the party’s core group member from Doaba. As the party will contest more seats as compare to 23 it used to fight in Punjab, there is plan to increase organisational strength at the booth-level, Shekhawat was quoted by a news channel. “The BJP-led central government has fulfilled two major demands of Punjabis, including opening up of Kartarpur Corridor and the repeal of farm laws,” he said. Sekhawat said the party was ready to contest all 117 seats in Punjab, according to a party release. The election in-charge, it is learnt, has taken feedback from the state unit leaders about chances of the BJP in the state following PM’s announcement of repealing farm laws. Union external affairs minister Meenakshi Lekhi, who is co-incharge of the party for assembly polls in Punjab, also attended the meeting. Party thanks Takht jatehdar The party has thanked Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh for his statement after Modi’s announcement of repealing the farm laws in which he termed the announcement as important for the communal harmony of Punjab. “We thank Jathedar saab for his stand. He has acknowledged the decision of the Prime Minister,” said state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma. Akali Dal can join hands as younger brother: BJPPunjab BJP in-charge Dushyant Gautam said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), if willing, can rejoin hands with the BJP but only as a younger brother.“Earlier, the BJP was younger brother in Punjab. But now, if Akali Dal thinks it is interested in a coalition with us, the party will consider it only in role of a younger brother,” said Gautam, adding that the BJP is prepared to contest on all seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-plans-to-contest-all-117-seats-in-punjab-101637698915790.html
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||HC issues notice to ED on Khaira’s plea||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday issued a notice to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the plea of Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who had challenged his arrest in a money laundering case.The high court has issued a notice for November 29.The plea was filed in an earlier proceeding in which he had challenged the ED raids at his properties on March 9, 2021, in connection with a 2015 Fazilka drug smuggling case. Following raids, the ED had claimed that in 12-odd years ₹4.86 crore were deposited in Khaira’s bank accounts but he declared only ₹99 lakh income to the income tax department. Khaira, who is in judicial custody now, was arrested by the central agency on November 11. According to Khaira’s lawyer senior advocate Vikram Chaudhari, ED’s action was a case of “witch-hunt” as he has been vocal against the three farm laws enacted by Centre last year. The ED initiated proceedings under the PMLA even as there was a stay from Supreme Court in the 2015 matter. The ED initiated these proceedings in January when Khaira was vociferous on the issue of farm laws. Raids were conducted in March and even as matter was pending before the high court, Khaira was arrested though he was summoned 11 times since raids, said his lawyer, adding that till now, even grounds of arrests have not been shared by the ED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-issues-notice-to-ed-on-khaira-s-plea-101637698795511.html

24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Attari ICP readies to send 50,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan||The Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari is ready to facilitate the export of 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat as a humanitarian gesture to the crisis-hit Afghanistan through Pakistan’s territory.Officials posted at the ICP, which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan, and movement of passengers from Pakistan to India and vice-versa, said this would be the first time since August 2019 when any truck carrying Indian goods will cross over to Pakistan through the land border.The government of Pakistan had severed all trade ties with India, besides closing the Attari-Wagah transit route for export to Afghanistan after New Delhi abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and converted the erstwhile state into two union territories — Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh—on August 5, 2019. Only import from Afghanistan was allowed by the neighbouring country.On Monday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that his government would allow India to send foodgrain to Afghanistan. Last month, India announced 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat for Afghanistan as humanitarian assistance and requested Pakistan to allow its transportation via the Wagah border.“Though we are yet to receive a particular date from the government regarding the export of wheat, our teams are prepared. We have adequate staff. The shipment would be transported in around 5,000 trucks and we can send around 200 trucks every day. Every truck has to pass through a proper security check, including the risk management system of the Customs, and the entire process of the shipment would take around 25 to 30 days,” said a senior officer of the Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI), which manages the affairs of the ICP.He said: “Before allowing a truck to cross the zero line, our teams issue special permits to the drivers. The trucks exporting goods are unloaded at the ICP situated on the other side of the border and the shipments are further transported to Afghanistan in Pakistani trucks.”Presently, Afghanistan is exporting goods, including dry fruits, onion and fresh fruits, via the ICP. Around 50 to 100 trucks have been crossing over to India via the land border from Afghanistan on a daily basis.Meanwhile, Indian traders have expressed hope of re-opening of trade between India and Pakistan via the transit route. “We welcome the decision of both the governments to re-open the Kartarpur Corridor for pilgrims. The Pakistan government should also re-open trade with India,” said Anil Mehra, president, Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association.He said: “The traders of both the nations have been suffering since Imran Khan had decided to stop trade with India. The Government of India never stopped the trade, but imposed heavy duty on the goods exported by Pakistan to India.”The Indian government had imposed a 200% duty on all items being imported from Pakistan after the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/attari-icp-readies-to-send-50-000-mt-of-wheat-to-afghanistan-101637698615451.html

24-11-2021||Other||50 bird flu deaths reported from Sambhar lake after Jodhpur and Pali||Jaipur: Over 50 birds, mostly crows, have died due to bird flu in India’s biggest inland salt lake in Sambhar lake in Rajasthan’s Jaipur district in the past five days, forest department officials said on Monday, adding that it was third place in the state to report bird flu deaths since November 1.Before Sambhar lake, deathsof 300 demoiselle cranes were reported from Kaparda area in Jodhpur and Sardarsmand lake area in Pali district of the state. No presence of bird flu in poultry has been reported by the state, officials said.Bird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds. Scientists have confirmed the infection is transmissible from birds to humans, although such a risk is currently low.According to forest department officials, an alert has been issued across wetlands in the state to scan for sudden deaths of birds because of the flu, which, officials believe, have been brought by migratory birds from Central Asia.Between December 2019 and January 2020, close to 24,500 birds died in at least five states because of bird flu brought by birds travelling through the Central Asia bird migratory route.Bhopal-based National Institute of High-Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD), the lab accredited to confirm bird flu, has detected two strains of influenza viruses in the dead birds. H5N8, a sub-type of avian influenza found in poultry and wild animals, was found in crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh while H5N1 was found in ducks in Kerala and migratory birds in Himachal Pradesh.Rajasthan animal husbandry secretary Dr Arushi Malik said the Bhopal-based institute has confirmed the presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus, which in 2019-20 was found in ducks in Kerala. Officials said the strain is commonly found in migratory birds and the infection may have been transmitted from them to the crows.“All bird deaths were due to avian influenza,” she said.“Fogging has been done in the surrounding areas and the nearest departmental institutions have been alerted,” he added. Malik said 7 birds including 5 crows and a Myna and Rufus trippy were found dead in the Sambhar area in Jaipur district yesterday. Four samples of crows found dead were sent to the Bhopal lab, which confirmed the presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus. According to officials, the first deaths among birds were reported on November 5 when close to 300 demoiselle cranes were found dead in Kaparda area in Jodhpur. A week later, more crane deaths were reported from Sardarsmand lake area in Pali district, 30 km from Kaparda, which gets demoiselle cranes from Central Asia. “In both places, the cause of death was bird flu,” Dr Malik said. The animal husbandry department has set up control rooms at the state level and formed Rapid Response Teams in all the districts to control bird flu. Dr Malik said bird flu disease has not been seen in the poultry business so far. “We have appealed to poultry farmers to keep the bird enclosures clean and inform the department immediately if dead birds are seen on the roofs or around their houses,” she said. On Monday, additional director of the department of animal husbandry, Anand Sejara said only two bird deaths were reported from Sambhar Lake, where close to 18,000 birds died due to avian botulism in November 2019. Avian botulism is a neuromuscular illness of birds.Experts said the presence of H5N1 influenza doesn’t necessarily mean that cause of death is bird flu.“The lab report should be correlated with clinical science and post mortem lesion,” microbiologist Dr AK Kataria said.He said bird flu affects the respiratory system, high temperature and also paralysis are the symptoms. Kataria said the death of crows was an annual feature and could also be linked to a sudden drop in temperature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50-bird-flu-deaths-reported-from-sambhar-lake-after-jodhpur-and-pali-101637698495896.html

24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: No consensus, meeting on further reopening of PU remains inconclusive||In a setback to the campus reopening process of Panjab University (PU), the meeting of a university panel remained inconclusive after the panel did not reach any consensus for the further reopening of the campus for students on Tuesday. According to sources, there was a difference of opinions among some members of the committee regarding the further reopening of the campus. The meeting was chaired by dean university instruction (DUI) VR Sinha and was attended by dean research SK Tomar, who is also the dean students welfare (DSW) and other university officials as well. The reopening of the campus is already delayed at the university despite PU planning to conduct upcoming exams in offline mode.This comes two days after former senator of PU Subhash Sharma wrote to the Vice-President of India, M Venkaiah Naidu, who is also PU chancellor, seeking his intervention for the reopening of campus for all students. In his letter to Naidu, he said when the entire country is in “unlock mode”, the reopening of the campus is being delayed.However, a member of the panel, who attended the meeting, said there were chances that all postgraduate students and undergraduate final year students would be allowed to return to campus in the next phase.During the meeting, it was discussed that providing hostel accommodation to a large number of students would not be possible given the Covid-19 guidelines. The university had continuously announced the limited hostel accommodation for the PG final year students who have been allowed to return to campus.Both VR Sinha and SK Tomar could not be reached for their comments.Meanwhile, the university is yet to finalise the mode of the upcoming semester examination, which is scheduled to start in December.Student Centre gears up for reopeningThe shops at the iconic Student Centre of Panjab University (PU) are set to reopen from December 1.

Carrying a mug of water, residents of this colony have to walk a few kilometres to relieve themselves and at times there is a long waiting line, hence they rush to the nearby jungle.Ward number 16 is reserved for women belonging to the Scheduled Cast and it covers Bhaskar Colony Sector 25, Sector 25 (west), and the Chandigarh Armed Police Complex, Dhanas.Meenu, who works in a university, said: “Toilets are not clean here, doors are broken and we have to take water from outside. It gets scary to go to the toilets at night as there are no lights and many drug addicts are there in the area.” She lives in one of the 4,000 jhuggis in this ward.Subash, who drives an auto-rickshaw for livelihood, said: “There are around 20 to 30 toilets for nearly 8,000 people living in the colony. So, people start making queues early in the morning.”Talking about the condition, he said: “The doors are broken and there is no water, so we carry our own water. There is no cleanliness. You will find all sorts of filth in these toilets. Even syringes used by drug addicts are found lying there.” Often women have to walk half a kilometre to the nearby jungle. Anil Kumar, who twice remained the president of the area, said: “Lots of work is pending here, but the main issue is the green belt and parks occupied by people living in slums. We want they should be relocated to pucca houses so that they get a roof over their heads and our children get a park to play.”Kumar said naked, hanging wires pose threat to people, especially children.Sandeep Kumar, a resident, said: “The sector doesn’t have proper roads. Without the motor, we don’t get water in our houses, streetlights are broken and there are no CCTV cameras here.”The common complaint of most of the residents is filthy water. “The sewer lines are corroded because of which it contaminates drinking water. Every day, one or the other area reports water woes. At times we walk a few kilometres to get drinking water from other places.”He said there was no community centre in this ward and poor sanitation was a big issue.Councillor Sheela Devi said people living in slums were allotted flats, but they had sold those flats and have started living in slums. Now, those living in flats have been requesting me to remove these toilets as it stinks. She claimed that there were drinking water taps and enough toilets in the colony.“During my term, roads were constructed, parks were built and other development works were done,” she said, adding that for the problem of filthy drinking water, she had approached the MC several times.Know your ward:Voters: Around 12,000 votesKey issues• Broken toilets that are without the door and water and lack hygiene• Filthy water supply• Broken roads and streetlightsLocal voicesWater is a major issue here.

The blast took place two weeks after a grenade was hurled at the SBS Nagar office of the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) wing of police.

Some parts of the hand grenade have been recovered from the site and a forensic team has collected samples, the SSP added. The explosion was of medium intensity. The armymen on duty, however, had a narrow escape, he had said. When quizzed, the SSP said: “We are yet to get leads in the case.” Despite examining the CCTV footage of the area, the police are yet to identify the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-headway-in-pathankot-grenade-blast-case-101637698375447.html
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Abrogation of Article 370 brought transparent, democratic govt: Nirmala||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said that abrogation of Article 370 brought a transparent and democratic government in J&K. She also said that money from each loan defaulter, irrespective of how powerful they were, will be recovered and restored to the respective banks. Addressing mediapersons here, the finance minister dwelt at length about the fiscal health of J&K post-abrogation of Article 370. “In the last two years, the work that has happened here is absolutely stunning,” she said. “We are accountable for every rupee, which is deployed on the ground. This kind of approach to governance is absolutely unheard of in J&K and for that I would honestly thank abrogation of Article 370,” she said, adding, “It cannot be a few families’ oligopoly. Money of the people should go to the people and it should be a transparent process and that’s what has been achieved in J&K.” She denied any adverse impact on the economy of the region after abrogation of Article 370. “On the contrary, there is a fervour to complete all pending projects,” she said while citing PM’s development package. It may be stated here that the UT has been eyeing ₹35,000 crore investment by the end of this year out of which ₹14,000 crore has already been invested. Responding to another query on loan defaulters, she said all such cases were being pursued in right earnest to get the banks their money back. “We will not let go any defaulter, particularly those who have fled the country, and we will get their assets back through courts to give them to the banks,” she said. When asked what the government was doing to tide over spiraling unemployment rate which has gone over 22% in J&K, she referred to PM’s development package. Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and said, “We are trying to ascertain the reasons, but in recent times, 8,000 to 9,000 recruitments were made and total 20,000 people will be recruited.” “There are self-employment schemes like Mission Youth and many others where the youth are being trained, mentored and financed. I am not contradicting the CMIE figures, but I think that there might have been some flaw in sharing data with them. Things will improve in the next one to two months. We are working on many schemes,” he added. New schemes for women entrepreneurs, tourism industry Sitharaman also handed over sanction letters for ₹306 crore to 145 beneficiaries of various credit-linked central schemes. She also announced new schemes and initiatives for J&K, including Tejasvini & Hausala schemes of J&K Bank, Shikhar & Shikara schemes of Punjab National Bank. Tejasvini scheme focuses on providing financial assistance of ₹5 lakh to women between 18 and 35 years for starting their business. Shikhar scheme focuses on meeting credit requirements up to ₹2 crore for hotel and tourism industry. Under Shikara scheme, credit up to ₹15 lakh for purchase/repair of shikaras is provided in the Valley. Sitharaman also laid foundation stone for Rural Self-employment Training Institutes (RSETI) building at Shopian and Baramula and inaugurated J&K Bank branches in Salal, Bagga and Budhan in Reasi district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/abrogation-of-article-370-brought-transparent-democratic-govt-nirmala-101637698255524.html
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: HC orders release of 32 buses of firm owned by Badal family||The Punjab and Haryana high court has ordered release of 32 buses of Orbit Aviation Private Limited, a firm owned by the Badal family, and directed the Punjab transport department to permit them to ply provisionally on designated routes.The high court bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Pankaj Jain acted on the plea of Orbit Aviation Private Limited in which decision to cancel the permits was challenged. The court posted the matter for further hearing on November 29 and sought the government’s response by then.On Monday, the high court had put transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on notice on a similar plea from the firm owned by SAD leader Hardeep Singh Dhillon against cancellation of route permits.The Orbit Aviation had told the court that on October 11, the transport department had permitted to make the payment of the government dues of ₹77.15 lakh in four monthly instalments of ₹19.28 lakh. The first instalment was paid but a week later, permission to pay in instalments was revoked and the petitioner was directed to pay the taxes in lump sum. By November 15, the entire tax was paid for up to November 30 but on November 12, the 32 permits of the petitioner were cancelled, senior advocate Puneet Bali had told court, alleging that it was a case of “political vendetta”.State’s advocate general DS Patwalia had told the court that after the October 18 order, the firm did not pay a single penny nor did it make any application informing the government that it was intending to make the full payment. Hence, the state was constrained to cancel the permit. It was further told that there is no provision in the Act or the scheme for revocation of cancellation of permit and though the court in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction can do so, but the power could be served only if the petition is to be finally heard and allowed, if at all. The court observed that the state’s argument would not bar the court from even granting an interim relief. “In the present case, the position that has emerged is that an order allowing the petitioner to pay instalments was passed; the first instalment was paid; but the order was withdrawn without even issuing any notice to the petitioner and without assigning any reason,” the court said, adding that once the firm had been permitted to make the payment in instalments, a notice must have been issued for withdrawing that order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-hc-orders-release-of-32-buses-of-firm-owned-by-badal-family-101637698196026.html

The industrialists rued that this will impact business at large as prices of woven and knitted fabrics, knitted garments, textile garments etc will increase.Also, it will adversely impact export, as the sector will not be able to compete at the international market and lead to rampant tax evasion, stated industrialists.CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja said the industry had also opposed an increase in the GST rate, but the government notified it, ignoring their needs and demand. “We have written to Sitharaman to roll back the order, failing which the industry, especially the small units, will collapse,” Ahuja said. The industrialists stated that rising prices of raw material have already been taking a toll on the business.Knitwear and Textile Club president Vinod Thapar said, “Rather than helping the industry by bringing down the prices, the government has added to our woes. The industry will not be able to survive for long under these circumstances and this hike will further encourage tax evasion. The tax rate should be reduced to 5% to save the industry.”BAP leaders postpone protest outside PM’s residenceEarlier, a group of industrialists under the banner of Bhartiya Aarthik Party (BAP), had announced a protest outside the house of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi in Delhi on November 25.

Hitting back at his successor, Amarinder said that actually it was other way round, as Channi had connived with and capitulated before the Badals to save his brother in the Ludhiana City Centre case. “It is a classic case of pot calling the kettle black”, Capt Amarinder remarked, adding, “It is not me, but Mr Channi, who had pledged his support and conscience to Badals to save his brother”. Responding to Channi’s allegations, Capt Amarinder said, “Although I did not want to join issue with him (Channi), his frequent false accusations have forced me to reveal his capitulations before Sukhbir Singh Badal in 2007 to save his brother who was an accused along with me in the Ludhiana City Centre case”. The two-time former CM said that he had put the Badals behind the bars in 2002 and in reprisal they had filed a false case against him, which he fought in the courts for 13 years, while Channi himself tried to buy peace with them to save his brother and pledged his support to them (Badals) in the Vidhan Sabha.Capt Amarinder said that Channi, who at that time was an independent MLA, allied with the Badals to save his brother. “It is not me who had any understanding with Badals, but you who joined them to save your brother in the same case in which I was also an accused”, he said, adding that those living in glass houses should not throw stones on others. “Had I aligned with the Badals and got some understanding with them, as you are accusing me of, I would not have faced the persecution for 13 years”, he reminded the chief minister, while challenging him to deny that he did not capitulate before Sukhbir Badal and begged pardon for his brother. Amarinder resigned as the Punjab chief minister on September 18 after a bitter tussle with Navjot Singh Sidhu and revolt by four ministers and several party legislators amid infighting in the state Congress. The party later picked Channi as the next chief minister of the state. The veteran leader has since quit the Congress and announced his separate party, Punjab Lok Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-hits-back-at-channi-says-capitulated-to-badals-to-save-his-brother-101637696875480.html
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: MLA Talwar inaugurates storm sewer project||MLA from Ludhiana east constituency, Sanjay Talwar, inaugurated the project to install a storm sewer line at Chandigarh Road on Monday. The work is being taken up to prevent waterlogging on the road during monsoon.  The line will be installed from Police Lines Chowk on Chandigarh Road to Buddha Nullah point on Tajpur Road via Sector 32. The project will be taken up at a cost of ₹5 crore and deadline of three months has been fixed for its completion. Councillors Vanit Bhatia, Kuldeep Janda and Umesh Sharma among others were also present. Residents of Chandigarh Road and adjoining areas of Sectors 39 and 32 had previously raised a hue and cry over choked sewer lines and waterlogging during the monsoons. Traffic jams are also witnessed on the road and residents face difficulties in even stepping out of their houses. A few residents had also forwarded a complaint to the chief minister’s office in the past.Premjit Singh, a resident of sector 39, said the accumulated rain and sewer water even enters the houses and parks in the area, resulting in unhygienic conditions. Despite repeated complaints being submitted with the authorities and CM’s office in the past, the authorities have failed to resolve the issue, he added. MLA Talwar said that the sewer lines get choked due to dumping of dyeing industry waste in the MC sewer. After completion of the project, the accumulated rain water will be dumped into the Buddha Nullah through the storm sewer line, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mla-talwar-inaugurates-storm-sewer-project-101637696815441.html

During the pandemic, it has been a tough time for DAP production, distribution and shipping which has further led to DAP shortage in country,” Dalal said, assuring farmers that there will be no shortage of fertilisers.During a video conference with Union minister of health, chemical and fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya, the agriculture minister expressed gratitude to the Union minister for meeting the immediate demand of DAP fertiliser in Haryana.“With immediate assistance provided by the Centre, there is no shortage of fertiliser in Haryana,” said Dalal.Regarding the requirement of urea fertiliser, Dalal said about 11 lakh metric tonne (MT) urea fertiliser is required in state and that about 4.5 lakh MT urea has already been made available to the state by the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-agri-minister-attributes-dap-shortage-to-covid-pandemic-101637696397555.html

Malik accused both the leaders for not fulfilling their assurances given to the community during a meeting of MLAs, MPs and other leaders of the community. “They gave assurance during a meeting at PM residence in March 2015, thereafter in February 2017 and then in 2019 ahead of the Assembly polls in UP and Lok Sabha elections, respectively,” said Malik adding that the community was misled and felt cheated. He said that the Jan Jagran Abhiyan would start from December 1. In the first phase, letters would be written to MLAs and MPs of all constituencies of UP, Haryana and Uttarakhand, he added. Samiti’s state president Jagatveer Singh Sirohi claimed that Jat community had its impact in 125 constituencies of Uttar Pradesh and letters would be written to all MLAs and MPs of these constituencies regarding this. He said, besides this, Samiti’s divisional level meetings would also be convened soon. Malik also released a pamphlet in which Samiti had given details about its leaders and meetings with PM and home minister, and assurances given by them to fulfil the community’s demand. Malik demanded that PM Modi should fulfil his assurance or they would intensify the movement if their demand was overlooked and ignored. He also raised the issue of withdrawing cases against people registered during the reservation movement in Haryana in 2017 and demanded that Haryana government should respect the agreement finalised between the Jat community leaders and state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jat-reservation-campaign-from-dec-1-yashpal-malik-reminds-modi-shah-of-their-promises-101637696335216.html
24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Cancel all exams held during Nagar’s tenure: Congress||Stepping up pressure on the BJP-JJP government in Haryana, tShe Congress on Tuesday sought cancellation of all examinations conducted by the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) during the tenure of HCS officer Anil Nagar as deputy secretary of the commission.The state vigilance bureau had arrested Nagar from the commission’s office in Panchkula last week for allegedly accepting illegal gratification for manipulating the results of dental surgeon examination. Subsequent investigations have revealed Nagar’s complicity in manipulating selection process for other jobs as well.Addressing a press conference, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Tuesday said this “job sales scam” is bigger than the ‘Vyapam scam’.“Investigations should be conducted by an SIT under the supervision of the chief justice of the high court. This would not only ensure fair probe but also reveal the links of those sitting on high chairs,” he said.“The HPSC has become the Haryana Post Sales Counter. The arrest of HPSC deputy secretary Anil Nagar and two others is only tip of the iceberg. Nagar and few others are not the last link in the scam. The rot runs deep,” Surjewala claimed.The former minister said the chief minister continues to mislead people of the state by coining ‘jumlas’ like jobs on merit, transparency and employment without any ‘sifarish’ or money.“The fact, however, is that jobs are being sold, papers are being leaked, and blank OMR sheets are getting filled after the examinations,” Surjewala alleged.The Congress leader said Nagar was the blue-eyed officer of the Khattar government. “From getting postings in Haryana school education board to HPSC, he continued to get postings on important posts. This would not have been possible without the blessings of someone powerful in the state government,” he said.The Congress leader said roll numbers of 24 candidates who appeared for the HCS exams were also recovered from Nagar’s purse.“The question arises as to why, how and who gave the responsibility of management and maintaining secrecy of important recruitments to Nagar, a junior HCS officer with over five years of service after bypassing the HPSC secretary,” Surjewala said.The former minister said the Khattar government indirectly privatised the HPSC and conduct of examinations in the name of improving recruitment process.“Private companies are preparing papers, managing centres, issuing roll numbers, conducting exams, scanning OMR sheets, preparing results and taking decisions on the objections to the answer keys. Everything is in the hands of private companies and their contractual employees like Ashwini Sharma, who have no fixed accountability. If there is some hue and cry, then one company is blacklisted and a new company is floated with another name and contracts get awarded,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cancel-all-exams-held-during-nagar-s-tenure-congress-101637696215258.html

24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Creamy layer: Wealth test, socio-economic status to be criteria for exclusion from BC quota||Specifying a fresh income and wealth criteria for identifying persons in the ‘creamy layer’ among the backward classes (BC) to exclude them from the purview of reservation in public employment and educational institutions, the Haryana government has ordered that children whose parents have a gross annual income of ₹6 lakh and above or who possessed wealth above ₹1 crore for last three consecutive years will not be entitled for BC reservation. Income from all sources will be clubbed to arrive at the gross annual income.The fresh criteria have been notified on directions of the Supreme Court which on August 24 had quashed a Haryana government notification from August 17, 2016 pertaining to identification of creamy layer from backward classes solely on the basis of economic criterion.The new criteria are broadly on the lines of recommendations made by the National Commission for Backward Classes in its 2015 review of income criteria for creamy layer.The 2016 notification also did sub-classification of backward classes which was held arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution by the Punjab and Haryana high court. Besides, fixing income criteria as ₹6 lakh for identifying and excluding the BC ‘creamy layer’, the 2016 notification divided the remaining BCs who were eligible for reservation into two groups on the basis of their annual.The first group comprised persons whose gross annual income was up to ₹3 lakh and the other whose income was between ₹3-6 lakh.The new creamy layerThe Haryana welfare of scheduled castes and backward classes department, in a November 17 notification, has also excluded sons and daughters of Class 1 and 2 officers of central, state and all India services from the purview of BC reservation.Children of officers holding equivalent or comparable posts in public sector undertakings, banks, insurance organisations, universities have also been excluded from the BC quota.As per the notification, children of armed forces personnel, including paramilitary forces whose either or both parents are in the rank of major or above, and children whose family owns land more than the permissible limit under the land ceiling law have also been excluded from the BC quota.Children of constitutional personalities or persons holding constitutional posts including MPs and MLAs have been excluded from the purview of reservation.BC sub-classification held arbitrary by the HCThe August 2016 ‘creamy layer’ notification, held arbitrary by the high court, had sub-classified the BCs stating that children of persons having gross annual income up to ₹3 lakh shall first of all get benefit of reservation in services and admission in educational institutions.The left-out quota shall go to that class of BC citizens who earn more than ₹3 lakh but up to ₹6 lakh per annum. The sections of backward classes earning above ₹6 lakh per year shall be considered ‘creamy layer’ as per the 2016 notification.While directing the state government to issue a fresh creamy layer criteria within three months, the apex court said a notification issued by the Haryana government on June 7, 1995 was in tune with the SC judgement in Indira Sawhney case.The 1995 notification excluded certain persons who held constitutional posts and those who were in employment of the state and the Centre in higher posts from the benefit of reservation.In addition, the social advancement of other categories was taken into account for the purpose of including such categories in ‘creamy layer’.The apex court said according to the August 2016 notification, the identification of ‘creamy layer’ among backward classes was strangely restricted on the basis of economic criteria only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/creamy-layer-wealth-test-socio-economic-status-to-be-criteria-for-exclusion-from-bc-quota-101637695975375.html

24-11-2021||Gurugram||Two dead after car falls into open drain on Pataudi Road||Two men allegedly drowned after their car fell into an open drain near Gadoli village on Pataudi Road early Monday. Police said they suspect that a speeding car rammed into the victims’ car, following which they lost control of the vehicle and the car fell into an open drain. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the men were driving from Pataudi village to Gurugram. “When they reached near the culvert constructed over Najafgarh drain in Gadoli village, they lost control of the vehicle and the car fell into the drain, which was around 5-7 feet deep. The electronic system of the car malfunctioned and all the doors of the car got autolocked, and both men got stuck inside the car,” he said. Police said the autopsy report revealed that the death was due to drowning. According to the police, the incident took place around 2.45am on Monday, when the victims, identified as Keshav Kumar (24) of Pathera village and Dharamvir Singh (29) of Dhanoda village of Mahendragarh, were on their way to Gurugram via Pataudi Road. Police said both the men were childhood friends and business partners. They were in town to attend the wedding of Singh’s relative. Dharamvir was behind the wheel when the incident took place, said police. Sangwan said passersby informed the police control room, following which a team from Sector 10 police station went to the spot. By the time a police team called the crane to fish out the car, both the men had drowned. “They were taken to Sector 10 Civil hospital where doctors declared them dead on arrival. The body was handed over to the family after an autopsy,” he said. Police said the culvert where the accident took place is narrow and devoid of any protective wall on its sides. Sangwan said the Public Works Department (PWD) is responsible for the fencing of the drains but nothing has been done which is a safety hazard. “There have been similar incidents in the past in other parts of the city and we wrote to the agency but to no avail. We will again write to them to inspect the area and take necessary action for the safety of the commuters,”he said. The PWD did not respond to request for comment.Police said they are yet to get the technical report from the automobile agency explaining how the car doors got locked and windows could not be opened, potentially allowing the men to save their lives.“We have received footage from six CCTV cameras and can see a few speeding vehicles crossing that stretch but we are suspecting one car rammed into the victims’ car, which was damaged in the front.

24-11-2021||Other||Gurugram’s air improves to ‘poor’ for the first time in eight days||Gurugram’s air quality registered an improvement on Tuesday from the “very poor” category to the “poor” category for the first time in eight days with an average Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 270, according to the daily bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Experts attributed this improvement to an increase in wind speed in the National Capital Region.The AQI reading at the air quality monitoring station at Gwal Pahari was 259, at Teri Gram, it was 274, at Vikas Sadan, it was 269 and at Sector 51, the reading was 304.An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Experts, however, added that while the slight dispersal of pollutants on Monday and Tuesday was due to the wind speed touching 19-20kmph, the relief was temporary, and the pollution level was likely to deteriorate from Wednesday, as the wind speed was likely to slow down.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded Gurugram’s maximum temperature at 25 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, and its minimum temperature at 10.8 degrees Celsius.An IMD bulletin on Tuesday said that the predominant surface wind is likely to blow from the southeast direction of Delhi with a speed of 5-10kmph. The wind speed is likely to remain between 5kmph and 8kmph on Thursday. “The air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally but remain in ‘poor’ to the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday. The air quality is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Thursday,” the IMD said, adding that for the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category.Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert, also pointed out that slowing down of winds will impact air quality in a big way, as it will become difficult for the pollutants to disperse. “Monday and Tuesday saw the dispersal of pollutants but this phenomenon is not going to help from Wednesday. The AQI will again reach the ‘severe’ category and the situation will continue for the next 15 days. It can improve if it rains in December but the forecast is bleak,” he said.The Gurugram administration, in order to curb the rising pollution, said that it directed civic agencies to ensure water is sprinkled and anti-smog guns are deployed in areas where construction is taking place. “Directions have been issued to all stakeholders to take all measures for curbing local pollution and to implement Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gururgam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugrams-air-improves-to-poor-for-the-first-time-in-eight-days-101637695075247.html
24-11-2021||Patna||As Bihar governor preps for Delhi trip, Magadh Univ vice-chancellor goes on leave||PATNA: Bihar’s Magadh University vice chancellor Rajendra Prasad, who was raided by special vigilance team investigating him for corruption, finally went on medical leave on Tuesday after pressure was mounted on Raj Bhavan to take firm action against the top university official.Magadh University pro-vice chancellor Vibhuti Narayan Singh will handle charge as vice chancellor from November 23 to December 12, a Raj Bhavan notification late on Tuesday evening said after Prasad’s request for medical leave was granted.The Raj Bhavan announcement came hours after top officials confirmed that Bihar governor Phagu Chauhan will leave for Delhi on Wednesday. “We don’t know his itinerary in Delhi, but he is going on Wednesday,” said Robert L Chongthu, principal secretary to the governor said.People familiar with the matter said the governor is likely to meet Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and some other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders.The governor’s Delhi visit comes at a time Raj Bhavan and chief minister Nitish Kumar’s government have faced-off on Rajendra Prasad’s continuation as Magadh university vice chancellor though he is under investigation for corruption.That Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and top education department officials were not present at a Raj Bhavan ceremony to felicitate best teachers and students in the state’s universities was seen to indicate the divide between the gubernatorial office and the elected government.Choudhary made a pointed reference to his governor’s office keeping his department out of the selection process for the awards. “It is entirely Chancellor’s function. We don’t know what period of performance has been considered for award and if the various categories of award conform to the advertisement,” he added.The governor’s choice already has been questioned by some. On Monday, Prof Md Qudus, vice chancellor of Patna-based Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University (MMHAPU) complained to chief minister Nitish Kumar levelling corruption allegations against Lalit Narayan Mithila University (Darbhanga) vice chancellor SP Singh, who was selected for the best vice chancellor’s award by the governor. SP Singh could not be contacted despite repeated attempts on his phone.BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal said it was an issue between the state government and Raj Bhawan. “I cannot comment on this. Governor is a constitutional position. The organisation of the BJP has nothing to do with it,” he added.“There seems to be lack of unanimity between the Raj Bhawan and the state government on the issue of appointment of VCs and the matter started flaring up after several VCs from UP got appointed in the state universities in the last few years, coinciding with the Governors from the neighbouring state,” said social analyst Prof NK Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/as-bihar-governor-preps-for-delhi-trip-magadh-univ-vice-chancellor-goes-on-leave-101637695017748.html

Garg directed the MCG to prepare a roster for mechanical cleaning of roads to mitigate the dust effect, and submit a daily action taken report in this matter. “The officials have been asked to ensure that dust control measures are implemented strictly at construction sites such as Atul Kataria Chowk and Mahabir Chowk,” said Garg.During the meeting, the deputy commissioner also asked the officials to reclaim and revive the green belts in the city most of which are either in bad shape or encroached upon. “The green belts must be revived and encroachments removed by respective agencies. More green cover will help reduce pollution levels. I have directed that a weekly report in this regard must be submitted to my office,” said Garg, adding that HSVP has also been asked to curb dust pollution in Sector 29 and deploy a smog gun for this purpose. Taking into account the large number of potholes and broken roads in the city, which add to dust pollution, Garg directed the MCG to complete the work of repairing these potholes and broken roads by December 15. He also directed the MCG to prepare an action plan within a week for removing construction debris, garbage and other kinds of waste material lying on roadsides and open spaces. He directed the corporation to complete this work in the next two months.The MCG officials informed the administration that 15 teams have been constituted by the corporation to repair the roads under its jurisdiction across the city.Garg also asked city residents to share their suggestions at grap.mcg.gov.in so that these can be discussed and implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-agencies-asked-to-send-daily-report-on-pollution-measures-101637694596363.html

24-11-2021||Delhi||SDMC to set up two ‘waste to wonder’ parks at Jangpura and ITO||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday proposed to set up two parks at Jangpura and ITO on the lines of their waste to wonder park at Sarai Kale Khan and a bird and animal hospital in Vasant Kunj.The proposals were a part of the civic body’s budget that was presented by commissioner Gyanesh Bharti on Tuesday. Bharti announced that in order to mark the 75th year of Independence, a plan has been made to develop Bollywood Park and Shahidi Park on the lines of Bharat Darshan Park in Punjabi Bagh. Upcoming Bharat Darshan Park features 21 replicas of Indian monuments which have been developed using metal scrap.Since the SDMC coffers are already in distress, Bharti said the new projects will be financed by funds from CSR (corporate social responsibility) and on the public-private partnership model. He added that 483 square metre plot has been allocated in Vasant Kunj for the bird and animal hospital. A senior official from the horticulture department said the Bollywood Park in Jangpura will focus on ”the history of the film industry” and the Shahidi Park will showcase themes from India’s freedom movement. “Instead of just using metal scrap like in the waste to wonder park, these parks will use glass, plastic and construction waste to recreate scenes, statues and art installations,” the official said.The civic body has also proposed to set up four centres to address the needs of special children. “These centres will focus on the needs and R&D for projects related to children with special needs. We have also sent the requisition for hiring 386 special educators,” he added. The south corporation is also developing an online learning management system which will co-ordinate online classes, details of students, health tracking, and learning progress.Bharti said tenders for the construction of a parking lots that can accommodate 238 cars in GK-2, 81 vehicles in Amar Colony (Lajpat Nagar) and 225 cars near Punjabi Bagh Cremation Centre will be issued shortly. He added that two new automated parking sites will be developed at Punjabi Bagh Club Road and B-1 block Janakpuri. A total outlay of ₹4,911.75 crore, 26.9% has been reserved for sanitation services. The budget proposes to expand the capacity of plastic waste disposal plant in Dwarka, which has been constructed with the help of UNDP, from existing 5 TPD (tonnes per day) to 50 TDP. A material recovery facility (MRF) with the capacity of 100 TDP will also be set up in Raghubir Nagar area.However, the financial challenges before the corporation and the cash crunch has also led to non-implementation of several announcements from last year’s approved budget which include restarting subsidised meal scheme Atal Aahar Yojana, doorstep collection of property taxes, upgrade of toilet complexes, and addition of new community halls in 49 wards, among other announcements. A senior SDMC official said in order to negotiate around the financial constraints, most of the projects being undertaken currently are based on public private partnership or CSR model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-civic-body-to-set-up-two-waste-to-wonder-parks-at-jangpura-and-ito-101637694055038.html

24-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram gang lures, extorts senior executives; three transgenders held||Police on Monday arrested three transgender persons from DLF Phase 3 for allegedly luring and extorting senior employees of various companies in the National Capital Region after befriending them on social media. Police said that the gang extorted lakhs of rupees from their targets by blackmailing them with intimate pictures or holding them hostage. At least three other members of the gang are yet to be arrested, said police. The suspects, identified as Palak, Simran and Kavvya, who go by their first names, were booked under sections 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at DLF Phase 3 police station on Monday. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that Palak, who used to send friend requests to the victims, formed the gang earlier this year. “The suspects had read about honey-trap cases, and started targeting men on social media. They made plans to extort money by using different modus operandi,” he said. Rao said Palak used to befriend senior executives from Delhi-NCR through social media, then exchanged numbers and later invited them to a hotel room in Gurugram and recorded their intimate videos. “In some cases, Palak would invite victims and later call other members of the gang and record videos and extort money. In three cases, they had held victims hostage and called their family members to transfer money for their release,” Rao said. According to police, Palak used to scan profiles on different social media platforms, and after shortlisting them would discuss with the other gang members for their next move. The gang had been involved in the crime for the past six months, police said. “Once the suspect was confident that the victims trusted her, she would invite them to hotels or guest houses and her aides suddenly barged inside as per the plan and clicked their pictures and recorded videos in objectionable position,” said Rao. Police said that the gang extorted money from at least nine executives in the last three months after taking them in confidence. In one such instance, Palak had allegedly befriended a 35-year-old Karnal resident, working and living in Noida, and invited him to Gurugram’s DLF Phase 3. “The victim reached a guest house in DLF Phase 3 on Sunday where the suspect had already booked a room. After having drinks together, the victim went to take a shower, and as per the plan, Palak called her two friends who were waiting outside the guest house and opened the doors for them. The victim was shocked to find two more persons and before he could utter a word they held him hostage and extorted money,” said Rao. Police said they got him to transfer ₹34,500 into two of their accounts and threatened him to arrange for more. Police said the victim lodged a complaint on Sunday following which a team was formed. “The mobile numbers of the suspects were placed on surveillance. A raid was conducted at three locations and three members of the gang were arrested from DLF Phase 3 on Monday while they were planning to target another victim,” said Rao. The suspects on Tuesday were produced in court that sent them to 14-day judicial custody, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-gang-lures-extorts-senior-executives-three-transgenders-held-101637693935145.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Rajghat road redesigned to make it safer for pedestrians||The Delhi government on Tuesday started trials at the redesigned the Rajghat intersection in central Delhi to make it more pedestrian friendly, as part of its project to establish “zero fatality corridors” on accident-prone stretches in the city. According to officials, plastic barriers, spring posts, cones, and other such equipments have been laid around the Rajghat intersection to reduce exposure of vulnerable road users to the traffic, increase walking space for pedestrians and to slow down vehicles passing through the stretch.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said such interventions to reduce accidents and fatalities will be replicated on 11 high-risk stretches across Delhi. “Delhi roads belong to all, as much to pedestrians and cyclists as to motorists, and the Delhi government is committed to making them safer for all users. It was keeping this in mind that we had launched the Delhi road safety policy in 2018. Through these tactical urbanism (TU) trials, earlier at Bhalswa Chowk and now at Rajghat, we aim to develop a comprehensive network of safe roads and junctions across the city. Small interventions like these, which you and I can take up, can effectively drive the behaviour change needed from commuters and the general public, to enable safe road practices in cities,” Gahlot said, while launching the trials at the Rajghat traffic intersection. According to officials, TU trials are “temporary, quick and relatively low-cost interventions” that test urban design, transportation planning and infrastructure changes for improving road safety for all road users, especially the most vulnerable, like pedestrians, cyclists and other non-motorised transport users. The trials will see road space being redistributed to ensure modal equity, road geometry, channelising traffic, reduction of vehicular speeds, and addition of safety infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.Officials said the project at Rajghat intersection was undertaken in collaboration with the Delhi traffic police and NGOs SaveLife Foundation and Swayam. The work is part of the Delhi government’s “zero fatality corridor” (ZFC) project where it ties up with stakeholders to work on the city’s most accident-prone stretches through interventions that focus on altering motorists’ behaviour and making roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Apart from Rajghat, officials have identified 11 more intersections — Mukundpur Chowk, Nirankari Colony/Gopalpur Red Light, Azadpur Chowk, Majnu Ka Tila, Burari Chowk, Sarita Vihar Metro station, Nehru Place, Khel Gaon, Gandhi Vihar Bus Stand and ISBT Kashmiri Gate -- for the same project.Piyush Tewari, CEO of SaveLife foundation, told HT that the Bhalswa zero fatality corridor project recorded a 100% reduction in road crash deaths by limiting pedestrian exposure.Delhi transport commissioner Ashish Kundra said since 2016, the Rajghat intersection and Rajghat bus depot collectively witnessed 47 crashes,13 fatalities and 51 injuries. “These trials are aimed at making the intersection safe for all in an inclusive, cheap and quick manner. The end goal of these trials is to transform high fatality intersections into high safety intersections,” he said. Tewari said that they have followed a six-point intervention strategy to redesign the Rajghat junction. “All the elements focus on either reducing the speed, or minimising conflict. Through these interventions we have managed to reduce the pedestrian exposure distance by about 50% and pedestrian exposure time by 30%,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-rajghat-road-redesigned-to-make-it-safer-for-pedestrians-101637693815114.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||‘Are you there just for salary?’: Delhi HC slams civic staff on dengue cases||The Delhi high court on Tuesday pulled up the civic authorities for the surge in cases of dengue in the city, saying that all its earlier orders on the functioning of the municipal employees have “fallen on deaf ears”.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, hearing a plea by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) against Delhi government’s decision seeking retrospective recovery of grants-in-aid from municipal bodies, said that the civic body employees should not ask for salaries if they do not discharge their duties.The bench said, “There is so much dengue. You are doing nothing. You only want salaries. What do you do with these salaries and amounts? On the ground, is there something happening?”“How can it be that dengue is increasing every year? Is it not a municipal function? We are in pain to understand what is happening? Is it some rocket science that after monsoon there will be mosquitoes, dengue? It’s a pattern for the last 15 to 20 years,” the bench said, pulling up the SDMC counsel.Delhi added over 1,800 dengue cases during the week ending on November 20, taking this year’s tally past the 7,000-mark, according to the weekly report released by the city’s municipal corporations on Monday.The city has reported 7,128 dengue cases so far, and nine deaths, according to the weekly data.The court noted that the corporations are not “understaffed” and rather “have excess employees”.“Is it that the municipality has given up everything and it’s only to collect taxes and disburse salaries? How do they expect salaries if they don’t do work... Obviously your mosquito checkers, breeders are doing nothing. They are not going to the ground. Probably they are just marking their attendance and you are paying them...,” bench observed.The court said that it has been “extremely patient”, noting that it ensured salaries are paid every time the issue came up. “But it can’t be that there is no work happening and it’s only salaries,” the bench said.The court asked the chairpersons of the three civic bodies to hold a joint meeting and apprise it about the steps being taken to control mosquito breeding.The court clarified that it would not exercise its discretionary jurisdiction in favour of the petitioner corporation and its employees if “the (dengue)situation on the ground does not improve”.The court also noted that it had earlier raised the issue of geo-tagging and marking of biometric attendance of employees. “We direct the petitioner to place on record what steps have been taken in this regard. This information should be provided in the affidavit to be filed,” the bench said.The matter would be heard on December 1.A senior official of South Delhi Municipal Corporation official, which is the nodal agency for vector borne disease data collection, said the matter is sub-judice, and that all the directions of the court will be followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/are-you-there-just-for-salary-delhi-hc-slams-civic-staff-on-dengue-cases-101637693755270.html

24-11-2021||Noida||Union minister Gadkari inaugurates vehicle scrapping, recycling unit in Noida||Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday inaugurated the first vehicle scrapping and recycling unit in the country at Noida’s Sector 80. The facility, developed by Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India Private Limited (MSTI), is a joint venture of Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Tsusho group. Spread over 10,993 square metres, the facility has a capacity to scrap and recycle over 2,000 end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) in a month, which translates to 24,000 vehicles annually. One vehicle can be recycled in 200 minutes. Built with an investment of over ₹44 crore, the facility uses modern and technologically advanced machines to dismantle the vehicles and produces zero discharge. Gautam Budh Nagar has over one lakh old diesel and petrol vehicles. Gadkari said studies show that the pollution generated by one old vehicle is equal to 15 new vehicles. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a net zero emission by 2070, in context of the recently concluded Climate Change Conference (COP 26) summit in Glasgow, Scotland. This scrapping and recycling facility is in the same direction. The facility will help generate employment and increase sale of new vehicles,” he said. The minister said the auto sector has an annual turnover of ₹7.5 lakh crore. “The target is to take it to ₹15 lakh crore in next five years,” he said. Gadkari also said the government is considering a proposal to provide more tax-related concessions on vehicles which are purchased after scrapping old vehicles. He said such scrapping and recycling facilities will be developed in each district. Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director & CEO Maruti Suzuki, and chairman, MSTI, said the facility is environment friendly for dismantling ELVs. “This is our first facility in India. This is a big and commendable step towards clean air and environment. Aligning with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, all the equipment being used at the facility is manufactured in India,” he said. Officials said an ELV owner needs to book a slot by visiting the website – www.msti.co.in or call 18004193530. The company representative will visit the vehicle owner’s place and complete the documentation, and evaluate the ELV’s net worth. The representative will then bring the ELV at the recycling facility and dismantle the vehicle. When HT paid a visit to the facility, it observed that the recycling takes places in nine phases. The vehicles’ tyres, CNG kits, battery, fuel tank, engine, windshield, doors, bonnet, bumper, headlights, seats, steering, dashboard, floor mat, roofing and interior parts are systematically removed at different stations. Finally, the vehicle’s frame is lifted by a crane and put inside the recycling machine which dismantles it and produces a square shaped recycled block. MSTI officials said vehicle owners get a certificate of recycling, which can be used for de-registering their old vehicle at the regional transport office. The company also makes online payment of the vehicle’s net worth to the owner. The scrap recovered is sold to authorised recyclers. The company aims to expand this service in other parts of the country. Satoshi Suzuki, ambassador of Japan to India, also attended the programme and appreciated the initiative. He said Japan will further strengthen ties with India in business and other activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/union-minister-gadkari-inaugurates-vehicle-scrapping-recycling-unit-in-noida-101637693636180.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to take a call on reopening schools today||As air pollution levels in Delhi on Tuesday improved to settle in the ‘poor’ zone with the city recording an average AQI of 290 -- the best since November 1, the Delhi government is set to take a call on reopening of schools on Wednesday.Schools in the national capital were ordered shut by the Delhi government on November 13 in view of the hazardous levels of air pollution, and the directorate of education on Sunday said that they will stay closed till further orders.School administrators and experts said they the notion that keeping children at home will reduce exposure to pollutants was not rooted in science, and added that continued closure of schools may lead to major learning gaps. In-person classes had barely resumed after a nearly 20-month pandemic shutdown, when they were again closed due to rising air pollution.A group of 140 parents in the national capital has written to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal seeking his intervention for reopening of schools, PTI reported.In the letter, the parents have said that schools were already closed due to Covid-19, and while construction and other activities have been allowed in view of improvement in air quality, “children and their education be given equal attention, in fact greater, priority”.Officials at the India Meteorological Department said winds gusting up to 20 kmph on Sunday and 25 kmph on Monday led to a marked improvement in the air quality and visibility.The Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitor Safar said transport-level winds are likely to slow down and change direction from northwest to south-southeast on Wednesday leading to further improvement in the air quality, but within the “poor” category.According to the Safar forecast, local surface wind speed will be relatively low for the next three days but the air quality is likely to be within the poor category for the next three days. Surface winds are likely to pick up from November 27, it said.Schools said they were waiting for a go-ahead on the resumption of in-person classes, even as they stressed on the fact that frequent closures exacerbated hesitancy among parents who had come to believe that schools might close down again on account of inclement weather in the next few weeks.Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC) and the principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, said closure of schools tightened timetables, which could be eased had schools been allowed to reopen as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-take-a-call-on-reopening-schools-today-101637693575101.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||Even Ramayana didn’t last 14 yrs, remarks Delhi HC on Chandni Chowk plea||Expressing concerns over the long drawn out hearings in the case related to the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk — the case is being heard since 2007 — the Delhi high court on Tuesday remarked that even the epic Ramayana did not last for more than 14 years.“This petition has been going on since 2007… Even the Ramayana did not last for more than 14 years. The “vanvas (exile)” should be over by now. What is going on?” a bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani saidThe court’s remarks came while hearing an application filed in the pending petition by NGO, Manushi Sangathan, on the issue of redevelopment of Chandni Chowk and creation of lanes for non-motorised vehicles (NMV).The present application was filed by the service department of the Delhi government seeking discharge of nodal officer Renu Sharma from the case as she has been transferred to Mizoram as chief secretary. The court adjourned proceedings on the application at the request of the counsel, and listed it for further hearing to January 13.The counsel submitted that as per the court’s earlier order, nodal officer Sharma shall not be transferred without its prior permission.In the main matter, the court had earlier passed a slew of directions to decongest the area by ordering registration of cycle rickshaws plying there, construction of a parking lot at Gandhi Maidan for private vehicles, a bus depot at Dangal Maidan near Old Delhi Railway station, and the creation of dedicated NMV lanes.All these projects are part of the main plan to redevelop Chandni Chowk, a project that is being actively monitored by the high court. Advocate Indira Unninayar, representing the petitioner NGO, submitted that the case has been going on for the last 14 years and repeated orders have been passed, reflecting “tardiness, reluctance and non-compliances of the authorities or government agencies” with several cases of contempt.On September 12, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the redeveloped Chandni Chowk market. In the project, the 1.3km-long stretch of the main Chandni Chowk Road, from Lal Qila to Fatehpuri Masjid, has been improved and beautified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/even-ramayana-didn-t-last-14-yrs-remarks-delhi-hc-on-chandni-chowk-plea-101637693517124.html

Khan, who was popular in the area according to local people, was sitting outside his home when some people shot him from very close range, a district police officer said on condition of anonymity. Khan was rushed to a private hospital in Howrah where doctors declared him dead on arrival.“Four people have been arrested till Tuesday afternoon. Khan’s family named some suspects,” the police officer said.Wazul Khan is the TMC’s third Muslim leader killed in three days.Muharram Sheikh, a TMC youth wing leader at Canning in South 24 Parganas district, was murdered near his home on Saturday night. Police arrested seven suspects of whom four were named by Sheikh’s family. “The assailants escaped in an auto-rickshaw and the murder was caught on a security camera,” said a district police officer who did not want to be named.In the second incident, Muhammad Sulaiman, a TMC leader in the Rajgunj area of Jalpiguri district in north Bengal was shot from close range in the head by two motorcycle-borne men on Sunday night. He was rushed to a local hospital and later shifted to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri where he died on Tuesday morning.“Sulaiman was shot when he was standing near a lottery ticket stall. The shopkeeper also suffered some injuries. An investigation is on,” said a police officer from Jalpaiguri.After the last murder in Howrah district, the victim’s brother, Guddu Khan, told the media that Khan received several threats. Though Guddu Khan joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before the March-April assembly polls, police officers said they did not find any evidence of inter-party rivalry in the crime. Some local TMC leaders, however, accused the BJP but the saffron camp denied the allegation.Manimohan Bhattacharya, the newly-appointed convenor of the BJP’s Howrah unit said, “Our party knows nothing about this. The crime was committed by criminals who should be arrested immediately.”After the back-to-back murders, the state BJP alleged that rule of law has been replaced by the rule of the jungle during the TMC regime.“The murders are proof of lawlessness in the state. Mamata Banerjee has established jungle raj,” said BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh.The ruling party refused to attach any importance to Ghosh’s allegation. “He (Ghosh) is so insignificant in his own party that he was removed from the post of state president two months ago. Why should we react to what Ghosh says?” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. The BJP got an opportunity to hit back at the TMC when two rival groups of the ruling party clashed with bombs and guns at Dubrajpur in Birbhum district on Tuesday over control of a football field. Six people were injured and eight villagers were detained. Videos shot by the villagers, showing bombs going off and a man firing a pistol, went viral on social media.“The clash started over a land dispute. Eight people have been detained and two firearms seized along with some ammunition,” Birbhum’s superintendent of police, Nagendra Nath Tripathi, told the media. TMC’s Bhirbhum district president Anubrata Mondal did not deny that his party’s supporters attacked each other. “Both sides support the TMC but the clash has nothing to do with politics. The dispute over control this football field has been going on since 2009,” Mondal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-minority-cell-leader-shot-dead-near-home-bjp-says-jungle-raj-in-bengal-101637693398436.html

Under the Gurujal, an integrated water management initiative of the district administration, the water body in Subhash Nagar will be restored as a percolation pond which will serve as a catchment area for run-off rainwater and help groundwater recharge, the officials said. Small ponds located in low-lying areas that store run-off rainwater and aid groundwater recharge are known as percolation ponds.The move is also expected to mitigate waterlogging-related issues on Old Railway Road and New Railway Road as the MCG aims to channel rainwater from these stretches towards the water body after it is revived. According to representatives of Gurujal, currently, the six-acre water body has been reduced to four acres due to encroachment. Further, it serves as a spot for garbage dumping and is filled with sewage from nearby households which has resulted in heavy silt deposition and reduced the pond’s original depth from four metres to 2.5 metres, they said. In 2019, MCG had observed that sewage from around 110 households was discharged into the pond through a pipeline. “The MCG has disconnected the main sewerage line and provided an alternative line for it. Now, sewage from only around a dozen households located in the immediate vicinity is being discharged at the pond. We are in the process of placing septic tanks to tackle the issue,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The MCG had originally planned to clean the pond in early 2020. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the plan was suspended, the officials said. At that time, Gurujal had also proposed to landscape the area near the pond with native vegetation, open-air theatres, open-air library, shaded pathways, sitting areas, recreational areas, government-sanctioned shops, walkways, fountains, among other amenities for tourism purposes.However, the MCG has declined this proposal and instead is focusing on reviving the water body. For this purpose, it has floated a ₹24.86 lakh detail notice inviting tender for the project.“We will be reviving the pond in a phased manner. The first step is to desilt it. Then we will build a boundary wall around it, and subsequently, plant native vegetation. We will also be building a pedestrian track around the pond,” said Subhash Yadav. district forest officer and nodal officer of the environment and sustainability wing of the MCG.A representative of Gurujal said, “The first step is to remove all unwanted silt and other materials from the bed of the pond. The next step is to clear out all types of liquid from the water body and then fill it with recycled or treated water and increase its percolation rate. Until we get a fresh layer of soil, we will continue to desilt and excavate the pond to reach its original depth.”Gurujal representatives said about the pond that legend has it that Bheem in Mahabharata had halted there to quench his thirst.Experts said that diminishing surface and sub-surface water availability has affected the local ecosystem. “Managed aquifer recharge in the NCR can act as water banking, wherein water is stored below the ground for use later on. This offers environmental, health, and economic benefits,” said Dr Indu K Murthy, principal research scientist at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-civic-body-to-revive-six-acre-pond-in-subhash-nagar-101637693335860.html

24-11-2021||Delhi||Short of funds, Delhi’s south civic body looks to hike annual property tax||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday proposed a hike in the annual tax levied on residential and commercial categories across the city in a desperate bid to ramp up revenues ahead of the crucial civic elections that are due in April next year.To be sure, property tax rates proposed by successive commissioners have not been cleared by the elected wing (the councillors) in the past 10 years.SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti proposed the tax hike in the budget proposals for 2022-23. The budget was advanced this year in view of the upcoming elections, civic officials said, and added that the SDMC wanted to announce the plans for the next financial years before the model code of conduct for the civic polls kicks in. Usually, the three civic bodies present their budget by the second week of December.Facing a crippling financial crunch, the three civic bodies in Delhi that administer almost an equal area and a range of services as the state government have struggled to implement new projects and even pay salaries to their staff leading to strikes over the last at least five years. In the build-up to the 2022 municipal elections, the BJP, which has been ruling the three civic bodies for the past 15 years, has come under severe attack from the opposition which has blamed the financial mess on the mismanagement and rampant corruption in the civic bodies.Bharti made it clear on Tuesday that if the tax hikes are not cleared by the SDMC House, it will be “very difficult” to take up any new projects. “Even today, out of whatever revenue we are earning, more than 90% is being used just to pay the salaries of employees, and rest is being spent on essential sanitation work,” the commissioner said.A senior SDMC official said if the hike in tax rates is approved, it will help increase the revenue by 15%.When the MCD was trifurcated in 2012, the South DMC was the only three civic bodies that had a surplus. Over the years, as revenue dried up, the civic body reported the first deficit of ₹398 crore in 2019-20. This went up to ₹1,001 crore in 2020-21 budget, the data from SDMC finance department shows.Bharti said “minor tax increase” is necessary to achieve the goal of enhanced tax collection. He explained that unlike the last year, this time there will only be two property tax slabs of 12% and 14%. He said properties under categories A such as Sundar Nagar and Vasant , B (Greater Kailash and Defence Colony), D (Janakpuri, Rajouri Garden and E (Paharganj and Pandav Nagar)are proposed to pay tax at the rate of 14%, and the remaining categories of F and G will be taxed at the rate of 12%.Currently, there are three slabs of property tax. Properties under A-B category pay 12% tax, those under C-E 11% and F-H category 7%. The colonies are categorised from A to G based on state of infrastructure and amenities in the area. The circle rates and unit area value of each category is fixed according to the category, and it forms an important factor in tax calculation.Among commercial properties, the commissioner has proposed a 5% hike in the tax rates for “special category property” such as guest houses and lodges.Bharti added that the corporation plans to collect ₹1,445 crore in property taxes in the next financial year.He has also proposed to reduce the existing rebates on early filing of taxes from 15% to 10%; and for CGHS (co-operative group housing) properties from 20% to 10%. Bharti argued that the 15% rebate on early filing was created when the interest rates in banks were high and the rates have now substantially decreased. He added that CGHS rebate was meant to encourage societies to file taxes collectively but that has never been implemented. The 1% education cess remained unchanged in the budgetary proposals.The commissioner has also pushed for 20% taxation on commercial properties of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). “The DMRC is currently paying a service charge and several rounds of meeting have been held to resolve the matter. We will charge a normal 20% property tax rate on commercial properties except the operational properties such as station area etc,” Bharti said.Data from the SDMC finance department shows that the corporation has been running at an annual deficit since fiscal 2019-20. The SDMC had a surplus of ₹663 crore in 2016-17, ₹104crore surplus in 2017-18, and ₹113.63 crore surplus in 2018-19. The deficit of ₹398 crore was registered in 2019-20, and that rose to ₹1001 crore during the pandemic-affected revenue collections of 2020-21.A municipal official said both the internal revenue from sources have gone down due to the pandemic impact on businesses while the grant from the government has also decreased. “Our buffer surplus funds have been exhausted due to the pandemic and if a third wave strikes, we won’t be able to pay salaries,” the official said, asking not to be named.Leader of the house Inderjeet Sehrawat said commissioners propose tax hikes every year and just like every year the elected councillors will decline to accept the proposal. “The three categories will continue to exist. The rates will be the same. There will be no hike. We should focus on increasing the number of properties from which tax is collected instead of increasing the rates,” Sehrawat said.Aam Aadmi Party’s MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the budget lacks vision, and added that the AAP will give immediate relief from tax hike as soon as it comes to power in the civic bodies. “The Budget should have presented a vision on how to improve the economic activities in Delhi, specially after the pandemic. The tax rate was never this high before. MCD has failed the people of Delhi in so many areas,” Pathak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/short-of-funds-delhi-s-south-civic-body-looks-to-hike-annual-property-tax-101637693275156.html

The airport also has a water and waste treatment plant, along with energy efficient lighting systems, the DIAL chief operating officer Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said.To add to these measures, the airport operator recently adopted electric vehicles and a TaxiBot, which is a semi-automatic robot that helps in taxiing an aircraft, without the aircraft having to be turned on, thereby reducing carbon emissions. TaxiBot was introduced in 2019, making Delhi airport the first one in the country to do so.The airport said TaxiBot has resulted in a significant reduction in turbine fuel consumption for ground movement. “At Delhi airport, we are on a strong environment progress journey and we are confident of becoming a “net zero carbon emission” airport by 2030, in line with the airport carbon accreditation guidelines. Towards this direction, we have initiated various environmentally sustainable programmes, such as the introduction of TaxiBot and the adoption of electric vehicles,” Jaipuriar said, adding that the airport achieved a level 4+ accreditation last year after getting a “carbon neutral” status in 2016.Carbon neutral refers to a policy of not increasing carbon emissions and of achieving carbon reduction through offsets. “We will continue to develop and be the best in class infrastructure and provide services using innovative and sustainable technologies.” the DIAL DEO said.India is currently the world’s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, after the United States and China. Speaking at the COP26 summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the country would make one billion-tonne reduction in projected emissions from now until 2030.

Refuting BJP’s allegations, Vikas Goel, leader of the opposition in the north civic body, said he was manhandled for supporting the civic body employees. “I was first manhandled by the guards at the entry point for carrying pamphlets in support of the employees who have not got their salaries for the last three months. Then, the BJP councillors were carrying liquor bottles in their hands. If they have any reservation about the liquor policy of the Delhi government, they don’t have any right to start a scuffle and misbehave with our women councillors. Their leaders use muscle power to create fear when anybody questions them,” he alleged. Congress councillor and former leader of the opposition, Mukesh Goyal, accused the BJP of raising non-issues. “It (the house meeting) was scheduled to discuss vector-borne diseases and pending salaries of employees. But instead, they were raising slogans against the new excise policy. To conceal their failures, the BJP councillors always try to create a ruckus, to get the house suspended,” he said. Mayor Iqbal said the BJp is considering filing a complaint. “The behaviour of the AAP councillors is condemnable. They don’t like to come forward for a healthy discussion on issues of development. We have called an urgent meeting of our party councillors to determine the course of action against AAP councillors. If a majority of them agrees to lodge criminal cases against AAP councillors, we’ll do that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-north-civic-body-s-house-meet-suspended-after-ruckus-101637692855192.html

They termed it “childish, politically motivated and a fabulous statement”.Recently, the Union law minister, Kiren Rijiju, while speaking at an event in Agra, had said that the Central government was examining the feasibility of setting up a bench of the Allahabad high court in Agra for the benefit of lawyers and litigants of western Uttar Pradesh.The Elders’ Committee, which at present is heading the Allahabad High Court Bar Association (HCBA), in a press release on Monday, termed the statement of union law minister as politically motivated adding, “As and when the elections come, such misleading statements are issued by politicians at the helm of affairs, which is nothing but a political stunt to gain undue advantage of voters from a particular district.”Further, it is an attempt to create differences between the Bar of Agra and Meerut district, which had been fighting since long for the creation of a bench in Meerut.Taking serious exception to the minister’s statement, the committee said, “The Union law minister is supposed to know that without the concurrence of chief justice of the high court, Allahabad, no such proposal can be aired. The person who is holding the post of Union law minister, is supposed to know this much of legal position,” the release further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allahabad-hc-sangharsh-samiti-to-plan-stir-against-minister-s-statement-101637692735136.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: CAQM meets with states to review compliance of directives||The Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) held a meeting on Tuesday to review the pollution control measures implemented by the NCR states over the past seven days, since the body issued a detailed set of restrictions, including a ban on construction activities and closure of schools. No new measures or curbs have been directed by the commission, said senior officials who participated in the meeting. A senior official who attended the meeting said it was convened by the CAQM to take stock of the compliance of the pollution control directions ordered on November 16. “The CAQM will submit the status report before the Supreme Court on Wednesday based on the action taken reports from all states. No additional directions were issued on Tuesday,” said the official, asking not to be named. A Union environment ministry official said after assessing the current measures taken by the NCR states, fresh directions will be issued by the commission on November 24-25. “Fresh directions will be issued based on weather and air quality forecasts and the action taken by states. Directions will be announced on November 24-25,” the ministry official said, also asking not to be named. The Delhi government, however, has extended the ban on the entry of trucks, except those carrying essential items, into the city and continued to allow officials of the Delhi government and affiliated offices to work from home till November 26. The government also issued orders that schools will remain closed in the national capital until “further orders”. The construction ban alone was lifted on November 22. Senior officials from Delhi’s environment department said a review of the restrictions will be conducted on November 24. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality improved to the “poor” category on Tuesday, for the first time since November 1, when the 4pm average air quality index (AQI) was 281. On Tuesday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings, Delhi’s AQI was 290, largely owing to swift wind that dispersed pollutants. On Monday, Delhi’s AQI was 311, in the “very poor” category on the AQI scale. Forecasters, however, said this relief from toxic pollution is only temporary and from November 24, winds will slow down again. Weather forecasts are also not indicating any drastic fall in temperature. “Wind speeds will gradually slow down and because of that, pollution levels will also rise slightly. Temperatures are also likely to remain in the same range,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services. On Tuesday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, taken as representative of the city, was 26.7 degrees Celsius (°C) and the minimum temperature was 10.3°C, a notch below what is considered normal for this time of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-caqm-meets-with-states-to-review-compliance-of-directives-101637692316731.html

The PMC in its proposal said that Pune city has a large number of diabetic and heart ailments patients which leads to complicated kidney ailments. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer at the PMC said, “This is to ensure that even the poor and those who cannot afford dialysis, which is a regular and repeated treatment process, can avail of the service. As of now, the poor are dependent on Sassoon General Hospital which receives more patients than their capacity and so we have decided to start a dedicated dialysis unit at our hospital.

24-11-2021||Noida||Garbage fires compound Ghaziabad’s pollution problem, 256 instances this year||For a city reeling under high levels of pollution, solid waste or garbage burning has contributed a fair share to pollution throughout the year with 256 such instances reported till November 20 this year. Officials of the district fire department said the incidents recorded this year are those for which they received complaints and the department intervened. Instances of garbage burning, however, could be higher, he said. According to the official figures of the fire department, there were 392 garbage fires in 2019, 189 in 2020 and 256 till November 20 this year. “The instances of garbage burning were fewer last year due the lockdown and other restrictions that were put in place during the pandemic. The figures indicate only those instances, where complaints were registered with us. There could be many such incidents which go unreported,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer, Ghaziabad. According to official data, the share of garbage fires is about 34.72% of the total 1,129 fire incidents reported in 2019.The share of garbage fires in 2020 was 20.76% with overall 910 fire incidents reported with the fire department. In the current year, officials said, there have been about 1,000 fire incidents till November 20, of which garbage fires make up about 25.6%. “Garbage fires are a major issue concerning the city. Sometimes, the contractors of different agencies, their staff set fire to garbage. In other cases, residents set up fires to get rid of roadside garbage, dry leaves, etc. The shortfall in processing about 600-700 metric tonnes of waste daily is making matters worse for the municipal corporation,” said Vikrant Sharma, a city-based environmentalist. “On our part, we have been raising the issue of garbage fires since 2015 and so far, we have intervened in about 200 such incidents, which have mostly occurred near the Raj Nagar Extension and near the floodplains of Hindon river. Many such incidents on roadsides and even in residential localities go unreported,” Sharma added. Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said garbage fires cause increase in PM2.5 levels. “On our part, we have already given reminders to different agencies and local bodies to crack down on those engaging in garbage burning and also penalise offenders. There is no assessment on the share of garbage fires in city’s pollution levels but it definitely increases the PM2.5 levels,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. As regards the shortfall in the waste processing capacity, municipal commissioner M S Tanwar said last week that efforts were on to procure more vehicles. “We are trying to initiate work for our waste to energy plant at Galand and the work is likely to start next year. Further, we are also trying to plug the gap of a shortfall of about 300 vehicles which are to be used for door-to-door collection of solid waste. Of this, 100 vehicles will arrive in next 15 days while we have also sent a proposal to the state administration of sanctioning ₹21 for procuring 224 more vehicles,” Tanwar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/garbage-fires-compound-ghaziabad-s-pollution-problem-256-instances-this-year-101637692014990.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||Noida international airport will be biggest in Asia, says CM Adityanath||Noida international airport will be completed by 2024 and will be the biggest in Asia, said chief minister Yogi Adityanath who was in Jewar on Tuesday to take stock of the preparations being made ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on November 25, for laying the foundation stone of the airport at Ranhera village, along the 165km Yamuna Expressway. Adityanath reached the airport site at 4.30pm in a helicopter, inspected the site in great detail and held a meeting with officials of the Noida International Airport Limited, a special purpose vehicle looking after the development of the airport, the police, district administration, and senior party leaders before leaving the venue. Estimated to cost ₹34,000 crore, the airport has been promised to the people of the region for the past 30-35 years, said Adityanath. “But our government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, since 2017 started working seriously. Now, we are going to lay the foundation stone for this project that will benefit entire UP, particularly Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Hapur and other adjoining areas,” said the chief minister. “Noida international airport will be completed as per the scheduled deadline of 2024 and create huge employment opportunities in the state, thereby changing the business dynamics of this region,” said Adityanath while briefing the media after the meeting with the top officials and senior leaders. He said Uttar Pradesh already has airports in Lucknow and Varanasi. “We have also started work at Kushinagar and in Ayodhya. Jewar will be the fifth international airport in the state,” said the CM. Adityanath said they are also developing the Film City near the airport, a defence corridor to boost manufacturing in Aligarh, an electronic city, a dedicated freight corridor and other infrastructure projects are being expedited to boost growth and development in the state. “Since 2017, we are working on 11 new airports to connect at least 80 cities of the state by air. Earlier, only 25 cities were connected by air with the help of two airports. We have fast-tracked infrastructure projects and put the state on the path to development,” he said. The BJP’s brass has also directed local MLAs, members of Parliament and other leaders in Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Aligarh, among other districts, to get in touch with workers to put up a ”grand show” during the airport’s foundation stone laying ceremony on November 25. Adityanath also held a meeting with state civil aviation minister Nand Gopal Nandi, BJP state president Swatanra Dev Singh, president of BJP’s western UP wing Mohit Beniwal and other leaders to discuss the preparations for the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/noida-international-airport-will-be-biggest-in-asia-says-cm-adityanath-101637691594891.html
24-11-2021||Delhi||DDA flat allottees seek more time to make payment||Allottees of over 300 flats in Dwarka, part of Delhi Development Authority (DDA)’s housing scheme of January 2021, said Tuesday that the land-owning agency has asked them to make the full payment by January next year, despite the flats still being under construction. The allottees said they wanted the DDA to extend the date of payment by a few months or till the land-owning agency is in a position to hand over flats.The DDA had put 1,353 flats on sale in Dwarka, Jasola and Vasant Kunj in its housing scheme of 2021. The allotment of these 348 middle income group (MIG) category flats in Dwarka was put on hold by the DDA immediately after the draw of lots in March, as the construction work was not complete. The rest were given allotment letters. Some of these allottees were given a payment extension due to curbs during the second wave of the pandemic.Ashish Seghal, an allottee, said, “We have been asked to deposit the money by mid-January next year. After that, we will have to pay a penalty. I visited the site last week and there is a lot of pending work. The sewage treatment plant is yet to be constructed; the park area is yet to be developed; and finishing work is pending, among others.”Allottees have questioned the DDA’s decision to put these flats on sale without finishing the construction work.Arun Aggarwal, another allottee, said, “The DDA is yet to get fire safety clearance for the buildings. Can the agency assure us that we will be able to move into our flats by January-end? Moreover, while other allottees were given an extension to pay the full amount, we have been given just three months. We want the DDA to extend the payment window. We have taken up the matter with the DDA.”Another concern of allottees is the 10% surcharge that DDA has levied on the cost of flats in Dwarka. Aggarwal said, “This surcharge has not been levied on MIG flats in Vasant Kunj. This surcharge is usually for high income group flats. The parameters for all MIG flats should be the same.”When contacted, a senior DDA official aware of the development, said, “We have applied for fire safety clearance and the remaining construction work will be completed soon. We will be handing over flats to allottees in January. So far, we have not given any extension for payment.”Meanwhile, of the 1,353 flats that were put on sale earlier this year, close to 400 have been returned by allottees. The land-owning agency is planning to announce another housing scheme to dispose of the flats returned by allottees of past housing schemes. Close to 15,000 flats will be put on sale again in December, DDA officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-flat-allottees-seek-more-time-to-make-payment-say-units-are-only-being-built-101637691355353.html
24-11-2021||Pune||Swedish delegation looks to colour all sustainable endeavours green||PUNE A Swedish delegation from the embassy of Sweden in New Delhi, the Consulate General of Sweden in Mumbai, the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in India (SCCI), and Business Sweden visited Pune on Tuesday and collectively emphasised sustainability and innovation as the cornerstone of business policy of a country.An ‘Environmental Sustainability Mapping Study’ of 18 Swedish companies was commissioned by the Consulate General of Sweden in Mumbai and the Swedish Chamber of Commerce India (SCCI) in association with Centre for Environmental Research and Education (CERE). The primary aim of the study is to understand how Swedish companies operating in Maharashtra and Gujarat are involved in green transition and to make recommendations to further the agenda. The study was undertaken in partnership with the consulate general of Sweden in Mumbai and the Swedish Chamber of Commerce.Anna Lekvall, Consul General of Sweden in Mumbai said, “The green transition and climate action is a high priority for Sweden and it is encouraging that the local Swedish companies are exhibiting leadership and commitment toward sustainability. We have completed the first-of-its-kind sustainability mapping study of Swedish companies in Maharashtra and Gujarat which will further support and strengthen cooperation going forward. We are very excited about the sustainability project done here in India. In challenging times, Indo-Swedish relations have strengthened ”The study highlighted how Swedish companies in west India have been actively promoting sustainability and demonstrating leadership in environmental stewardship with initiatives such as switching to renewable energy and electric mobility, implementing energy efficiency, investing in green buildings, promoting water conservation and integrating a green transition across value chains. Sara Larsson, head of Swedish Chamber of Commerce in India (SCCI), said, “Working together on environmental sustainability can increase learning, enable local solutions, and ramp up the transition process. As next steps, Team Sweden aims to promote knowledge exchange, capacity building and collaborative approach around environmental sustainability between companies, academia and research institutions.”According to Ambassador Klas Molin, more than half of Sweden’s GDP is through exports. “As far as Sweden’s footprint is concerned, Pune was selected as a manufacturing base early on, encouraged by the government then under Prime Minister Nehru. We are looking at long term co-operation in the field of science and technology in innovation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/swedish-delegation-looks-to-colour-all-sustainable-endeavours-green-101637691234886.html
24-11-2021||Lucknow||Don’t try to incite passions over CAA, Yogi warns followers of ‘abba jaan’||KANPUR Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday again used the terms “abba jaan-chacha jaan” as a jibe, threatening strict action against those who incite passion over the Citizenship Amendment act.He targeted AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi, who recently demanded withdrawal of the act, which last year led to widespread protests in several parts of the country. Adityanath called the Hyderabad-based leader, whose party is contesting the coming UP Assembly elections, an agent of the Samajwadi Party.While addressing a meeting in Barabanki on Sunday, Owaisi had demanded that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) should be withdrawn as well after the announcement on the repeal of the agri laws.The CAA is aimed at providing Indian citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who entered the country on or before 31 December 2014.In September, the chief minister had sparked a row by using the Urdu term for ‘father’, saying that rations distributed by the previous state government went to those who say “abba jaan”.In Kanpur on Tuesday, Adityanath said there used to be riots every “third or fourth day” in Uttar Pradesh earlier, but now UP is known as a riot-free state.“I want to warn those people trying to incite feelings in the name of CAA. I am asking followers of ‘chacha jaan’ (uncle) and ‘abba jaan’ to listen carefully that if attempts are made to vitiate the atmosphere of the state by inciting feelings, the state government will deal with it strictly,” said the chief minister while addressing a convention of polling booth-level BJP leaders here, also attended by party president JP Nadda.“Everyone knows that Owaisi is working as an agent of the Samajwadi Party that wants to incite passions in the state,” he said, adding: “Our government doesn’t protect rioters but runs bulldozers on their chest.”Reacting to Yogi’s statements, Asaduddin Owaisi, in a tweet in Hindi, said: “Those who were mowed down were not rioters or mafia. They were farmers of Lakhimpur Kheri. And the father (of the main accused) is still a minister. ‘Thok dengey waley Baba, I am the agent of those who got India freedom and those who kept citizenship of Indians away from religion.”Emphasising the government works for development and does not patronise mafias, Yogi Adityanath stated that Kanpur region’s social fabric was damaged and development affected due to the politics of family (‘pariwarwad’) and caste (‘jatiwad’) since Independence.Deputy chief minister Keshav Maurya said the Samajwadi Party had become “Jinnahwadi Party” and that is why SP president Akhilesh Yadav was renamed as “Akhilesh Ali Jinnah”. “The BJP worked for all, whereas the SP and the BSP worked for a select few, primarily criminals,” he added.

24-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Over 1,500 illegal shops, hutments removed from HSVP land||The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran on Tuesday demolished around 1,500 temporary shops and hutments that were illegally constructed on three acres of government land near Golf Course Road in Nathupur, officials said. Another four acres of land in the same area will be cleared from encroachments on Wednesday and Thursday, they said. The demolition was carried out amid strong resistance by the shop owners and occupants of hutments, said the officials. Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP, said that the enforcement team reached the area around 11am and the occupants were given one hour to remove their belongings but they started a protest. “A police team, which accompanied the enforcement team, brought the situation under control, after which the earth moving machines were pressed into service and the land was cleared from encroachment,” he said. Lot said that the encroachers were also issued a warning that if they tried to encroach the government land again, then FIRs would be registered against them. HSVP officials said that occupants of illegal shops and hutments in the remaining four-acre land have been asked to vacate the area. The land in Nathupur village, officials said, was acquired in 2009 and compensation was paid to the owners. After clearing the encroachments, the department of town and country planning would be asked to plan for commercial utilization of this valuable land, they added. For the past few months, the HSVP has embarked on a drive to clear its land from encroachments so that it can be sold for commercial and residential development by private players. The authority has been facing a financial crunch and has decided to monetise its assets across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-1500-temporary-shops-hutments-removed-from-hsvp-land-in-nathupur-101637675393222.html

Earlier, the state had fixed November 30 as the deadline. Till November 22, over 57.8 lakh people had been administered the first dose and 46.7 lakh the second dose as well. More than 9 lakh people are yet to get the second jab. Among the 12 districts of the state, Kinnaur and Solan districts have achieved the full vaccination of the targeted population. In Shimla and Una districts, more than 90% people have been inoculated with both the doses, while the remaining districts have achieved full vaccination of more than 83% of the population. “The state is set to achieve full vaccination of the targeted population by December 3. A programme will be held in Mandi on December 4 to celebrate the feat. It will be attended by Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Jagat Prakash Nadda,” said chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh. He said that the Union minister will felicitate beneficiaries during the event. Himachal Pradesh was the first state to achieve the vaccination of 100% of the targeted population in August-end. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had praised Himachal Pradesh’s efforts to complete the first dose of vaccination of 100% adult population through a virtual conference on September 6 during which he also interacted with healthcare workers of the Covid-19 inoculation programme. In order to meet the target of vaccinating more than 9 lakh people with the second dose by December 3, the state health authorities face the uphill task of inoculating 1 lakh people daily. Besides the daily inoculation at vaccination centres, health workers have been going door-to-door to vaccinate people. In some areas, the inoculation is being done of people travelling in buses, too.

24-11-2021||World||Covid resurgence in Europe forces govts to rethink need for booster shots||Coronavirus infections broke records in parts of Europe on Wednesday, with the continent once again the epicentre of a pandemic that has prompted new curbs on movement and made health experts think again about booster vaccination shots.Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Hungary all reported new highs in daily infections as winter grips Europe and people gather indoors in the run-up to Christmas, providing a perfect breeding ground for COVID-19.The disease has swept the world in the two years since it was first identified in central China, infecting more than 258 million people and killing 5.4 million.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU public health agency, recommended vaccine boosters for all adults, with priority for those over 40, in a major shift https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-health-agency-says-vaccine-boosters-should-be-considered-all-adults-2021-11-24 from its previous guidance which suggested the extra doses should be considered for older frail people and those with weakened immune systems."Available evidence emerging from Israel and the UK shows a significant increase in protection against infection and severe disease following a booster dose in all age groups in the short term," the ECDC said in a report published on Wednesday.Many EU countries have already begun giving booster doses to their populations but are using different criteria to make priorities and different intervals between the first shots and boosters.ECDC head Andrea Ammon said boosters would increase protection against infection caused by waning immunity and "could potentially reduce the transmission in the population and prevent additional hospitalisations and deaths".She advised countries with low levels of vaccination to speed up their rollouts and warned of high risks of a further spike in deaths and hospitalisations in Europe in December and January if the recommended measures are not introduced.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, acknowledging that Europe was again at the epicentre of the pandemic, warned against a "false sense of security" over the protection offered by vaccines."No country is out of the woods," he told reporters, adding that he hoped a consensus can be found at a World Trade Organization ministerial meeting next week for an IP waiver for pandemic vaccines, already supported by more than 100 countries.Sweden will begin gradually rolling out boosters to all adults, government and health officials said. Booster shots of mRNA vaccine have been offered to people aged 65 or above, with an eye to eventually extending the shots to other groups."We are faced with an uncertain winter," Health Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference.

24-11-2021||World||Key Taliban leader’s intervention led to Pakistan’s nod for supply of wheat from India||Days before the Taliban’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi embarked on a visit to Pakistan on November 10, one of his aides reached out to an intermediary to ascertain whether there were any India-related issues that should be raised in Islamabad. The aide from Muttaqi’s office also wanted to ascertain from the intermediary whether there were any sensitivities that should be kept in mind in the Taliban foreign policy chief’s maiden engagement with the Pakistani leadership, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Muttaqi’s aide was informed about the need to take up with the Pakistani leadership the offer made by India several weeks ago to supply 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan, and the pressing need to make travel arrangements for hundreds of Afghan citizens stranded across India since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government in August, the people said. Pakistan had not responded to India’s proposal to ship the wheat to Afghanistan via the Wagah land border crossing in the absence of direct flights. The Taliban delegation led by Muttaqi, which was in Pakistan for three days, raised both issues with top leaders such as foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Prime Minister Imran Khan. As a result, Khan announced on November 22 that his government would allow the shipment of the Indian wheat as soon as modalities were worked out by Islamabad and New Delhi. Khan said Pakistan would also facilitate the return of Afghans who had gone to India for medical treatment and were stuck there. This outreach by Muttaqi’s camp and the Taliban’s balanced response to the November 10 meeting of senior security officials of seven countries, including Iran and Russia, that was convened by India are being seen in some quarters as an attempt by the Taliban to strike a balance in their attempts to forge relations with Pakistan and India. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid had said the first regional meeting on Afghanistan convened by India was in the “better interest of Afghanistan” and reiterated the group’s policy on not allowing Afghan soil to be “used against any country”. The Taliban, he added, had no “objection or anxiety” about the meeting. “Though we are not present in this conference, we firmly believe this conference is in the better interest of Afghanistan...and the participating countries also must be thoughtful of improving and safeguarding the security situation in Afghanistan and helping the current government to ensure security in the country on its own,” Mujahid said. One of the people cited above said: “It is difficult to gauge their sincerity but they do seem to be going through the motions to create an impression that they want a balance between Pakistan and India. It also suits the Taliban to be seen as not completely reliant on Pakistan.” The Indian side, which had opened channels of communication with sections of the Taliban leadership last year, has made it clear it is in no rush to give legitimacy or recognition to the Taliban setup. New Delhi has insisted that Afghanistan must not be used for planning or executing terror attacks on other countries and an inclusive government must be formed in Kabul. Participating in an online event organised on Wednesday by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla described the Indian side’s conversations so far with the Taliban as “very reassuring” but also listed the world community’s continuing concerns on Afghanistan. Though the rapid developments in Afghanistan amounted to a setback, he said: “We have also established some contact with the Taliban both in Doha as well as in Moscow in the talks, and I think the Taliban in our conversation with them have been very reassuring. They have recognised that India has contributed greatly to the people of Afghanistan that our developmental projects over the last 20 years have greatly contributed to Afghanistan’s development.” He added the Taliban “want us to provide humanitarian assistance; they want us to re-establish our embassy there. So they have said good things, which is a good start.” India, Shringla said, will now “have to see how best to protect our interests, make the best of a difficult situation”, and also make sure the country is “not in any way vulnerable to the new strategic realities” of the region. He referred to the UN Security Council resolution 2593 on Afghanistan and said it lays down the international community’s expectations of the Taliban. “One is an inclusive negotiated political settlement, the second is that its territory should not be used against the detriment of any others, the third is that they should provide humanitarian access, the fourth is that there should be no human rights abuses on women, children and minorities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-taliban-leader-s-intervention-led-to-pakistan-s-nod-for-supply-of-wheat-from-india-101637773824674.html
24-11-2021||World||Over 20 migrants dead in deadliest English Channel disaster||Over 20 migrants died Wednesday crossing the Channel from France to England when their boat sank off the northern port of Calais, authorities said, the deadliest single disaster on the intensively-used route.The French interior ministry said in a statement that French patrol vessels found corpses and people unconscious in the water after a fisherman sounded the alarm about the accident. Police then said in a statement that "over 20" people had died.Three helicopters and three boats have been deployed to take part in the search, local authorities said.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who is heading to the scene, wrote on Twitter that "many people" had died in the incident, adding that "the criminal nature of the smugglers who organise these crossings cannot be condemned enough.""The disaster in the Channel is a tragedy," added Prime Minister Jean Castex. "My thoughts are with the many missing and injured, victims of criminal smugglers who exploit their distress and misery," he wrote on Twitter.The disaster, the worst single loss of life recorded in recent times from migrant crossings in the Channel, comes as tensions grow between London and Paris over the record numbers of people crossing.Britain has urged tougher action from France to stop migrants making the voyage.- Growing post-Brexit tensions -According to the French authorities, 31,500 people attempted to leave for Britain since the start of the year and 7,800 people have been rescued at sea, figures which doubled since August.Seven people have been confirmed dead or are still missing feared drowned after various incidents this year.In Britain, the ruling right-wing Conservative party of Prime Minister Boris Johnson is coming under intense pressure, including from its own supporters, to reduce the numbers crossing.French police said this week they detained 15 suspected members of an international migrant smuggling syndicate that helped people illegally cross the Channel to Britain.The network of Iraqi Kurds, Romanians, Pakistanis and Vietnamese helped a minimum of 250 people per month cross to England, using small boats that transport up to 60 migrants at a time.Passage to England would cost a migrant 6,000 euros ($6,800) and the smugglers racked up some 3 million euros ($3.4 million) in total profits.According to British authorities, more than 25,000 people have now arrived illegally so far this year, already triple the figure recorded in 2020.The issue has added to growing post-Brexit tensions between Britain and France, with a row on fishing rights also still unresolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-20-dead-in-migrant-boat-accident-in-english-channel-101637771301963.html
24-11-2021||World||Europe rethinks booster shot policy as Covid cases hit records||Covid infections broke records on Wednesday in parts of Europe, once again the epicentre of a pandemic which has prompted new curbs on movement and made health experts think again about booster vaccination shots.Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary all reported new highs in daily infections as winter grips the continent and people gather indoors in the run-up to Christmas, providing a perfect breeding ground for Covid.The disease has swept the world in the two years since it was first identified in central China, infecting more than 258 million people and killing 5.4 million.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU public health agency, recommended vaccine boosters for all adults, with priority for those over 40, in a major shift of policy.“Available evidence emerging from Israel and the UK shows a significant increase in protection against infection and severe disease following a booster dose in all age groups in the short term,” the ECDC said in a report published on Wednesday.Many EU countries have already begun giving booster doses to their populations but are using different criteria to make priorities and different intervals between the first shots and boosters.ECDC head Andrea Ammon said boosters would increase protection against Covid infection caused by waning immunity and “could potentially reduce the transmission in the population and prevent additional hospitalisations and deaths”.She advised countries with low levels of vaccination to speed up their rollouts and warned of high risks of a further spike in Covid deaths and hospitalisations in Europe in December and January if the recommended measures are not introduced.Sweden will begin gradually rolling out boosters to all adults, government and health officials said. Booster shots of mRNA vaccine have been offered to people aged 65 or above, with an eye to eventually extending the shots to other groups.“We are faced with an uncertain winter,” Health Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. “You can contribute by staying home if you’re sick or by getting vaccinated if you haven’t already, and taking your booster when you’re offered it.”Unlike many of its neighbours, Sweden has not been hit by a new wave of infections, and hospitalisations remain relatively low, but there have been scattered signs the pandemic is picking up pace.Slovakia reported its highest daily rise in cases on Wednesday, just ahead of a government meeting likely to agree a short-term lockdown to quell the world’s fastest surge in infections.VACCINATION RESERVATIONSNeighbouring Austria has already locked down its population this week for at least 10 days, becoming the first to reimpose such restrictions. It will also require the whole population to be vaccinated from Feb. 1, infuriating many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high.The Czech Republic reported its highest daily rise in infections, with cases surpassing 25,000 for the first time and putting further strain on hospitals.The country of 10.7 million has the world’s fourth-highest infection rate per capita, according to Our World in Data.The Czech government, due to hand over power in the coming weeks after losing an October election, has put in place measures barring unvaccinated people from restaurants, cinemas and other services such as hairdressers, aiming to boost vaccination figures that lag many in the European Union.The outgoing government is also looking to institute mandatory vaccines for people over 60 and some professions, like healthcare workers.Hungary reported a record 12,637 new daily Covid cases, bringing the total to 1.045 million with 33,519 deaths.Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government, which opposes further lockdowns for fear of stifling the economy, launched a vaccination campaign this week, offering shots without prior registration.However, the idea of mandatory vaccinations has raised concerns among Hungarians, with some expressing reservations despite already being vaccinated.“Making the vaccine obligatory is a difficult thing as it could limit people severely, including from earning a living, so I think such a decision should be made very carefully,” said Zsuzsanna Koszoru as she lined up for a booster jab.Many German regions have already started to impose tighter rules amid the country’s worst Covid surge yet as the curtain comes down on the Angela Merkel era, including demanding that vaccinated people show a negative test to attend indoor events.Outgoing Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Monday that by the end of the winter almost everyone in Germany would be “vaccinated, recovered or dead”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-rethinks-booster-shot-policy-as-covid-cases-hit-records-101637767597313.html
24-11-2021||World||UAE keen on speedy restoration of air services with India, says envoy||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is keen on speedy restoration of normal air services with India as the lack of adequate flights is posing difficulties for travellers and has led to a spike in air fares, UAE ambassador Ahmed AlBanna said on Wednesday. Under the air bubble arrangement worked out by the two countries following the Covid-19 pandemic, Emirates and Etihad, the flag carriers of the UAE, are currently operating at 30% of their total capacity under the normal air services agreement. This is affecting traffic and the price of a return ticket has increased to almost ₹200,000 from the pre-pandemic rate of around ₹80,000 to ₹90,000. Besides going back to the air services agreement, which will result in the doubling of traffic, the two countries should look at increasing capacity under the pact, AlBanna told a group of reporters. The UAE has also asked the Indian government to exempt flights to the emirates from restrictions for the duration of the Dubai Expo 2020, which will continue till March next year, but is yet to get a “green light”, he said. The UAE is home to more than three million Indian expatriates, the largest ethnic community in the emirates comprising professionals and blue-collar workers and their families. The demand for flights has increased as a growing number of Indians are making their way back to the UAE. Dubai also serves as a key transit point for Indians travelling to other parts of the world. AlBanna noted the total weekly capacity for Dubai alone under the air services agreement was about 65,000 seats, while only 24,000 seats are currently available. The frequency of flights on the Delhi-Dubai route has dropped from five a week to three a week, he said. A clause in the air services agreement of 2007 mandates that when capacity on routes between the UAE and India touches 80%, new quotas to be shared between carriers of both countries should be re-negotiated. AlBanna noted that Indian carriers had reached 100% capacity before the pandemic. “At that time, there were at 1,068 flights a week, with around 400-plus flights by the UAE carriers and over 500 by the Indian ones. We need to re-negotiate,” he said. Two rounds of talks held in Mumbai in 2017 and New Delhi in 2019 had not been “successful in reaching a final decision on increasing capacities for the four sectors of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah”, he said. It would be to India’s benefit to end the air bubble, go back to the air services agreement and open all airports once travel restrictions are eased further, the envoy added. AlBanna said the UAE and India had recently concluded the second round of negotiations on a proposed comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) in Dubai and a third round will be held soon. Though the two sides are eyeing the completion of negotiations by March next year, AlBanna said: “I want it before March. Hopefully it will be in place. The CEPA will be a big plus point in our strategic partnership.” Referring to the first virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of India, Israel, the US and the UAE last month, AlBanna said the four countries had no plans to create a NATO-like alliance. “That doesn’t make any sense. It is an economic bloc that concentrates on economic and business collaboration between the four countries,” he said. Technical teams from the four sides are preparing for an in-person ministerial meeting. “Very soon, once that is done, the ministers will meet to discuss further sectors [of cooperation],” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-keen-on-speedy-restoration-of-air-services-with-india-says-envoy-101637764824322.html
24-11-2021||World||German parties reach deal for coalition govt that will end Merkel era||Three German parties have reached a deal to form a new government that will end the era of longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, according to Olaf Scholz, who is poised to replace her.Scholz, of the center-left Social Democrats, said the new government would not seek “the lowest common denominator, but the politics of big impacts.”He stressed the importance of a sovereign Europe, friendship with France and partnership with the United States as key cornerstones of the government’s foreign policy — continuing a long post-war tradition.Scholz said he expects that members of the parties will give their blessing to the deal in the next 10 days.The Social Democrats have been negotiating with the environmentalist Green party and the pro-business Free Democrats since narrowly winning a national election on Sept. 26.If party members sign off on it, the three-way alliance — which has never yet been tried in a national government — will replace the current “grand coalition” of the country's traditional big parties. The Social Democrats have served as the junior partner to Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats.Merkel, who didn't run for a fifth term, is expected to be succeeded by Scholz, 63, who has been her finance minister and vice chancellor since 2018.The three would-be governing parties have said they hope parliament will elect Scholz as chancellor in the week beginning Dec. 6. Before that can happen, the deal requires approval from a ballot of the Greens’ roughly 125,000-strong membership and from conventions of the other two parties.News of the deal came as Merkel led what was likely to be her last Cabinet meeting. Scholz presented the 67-year-old, who has led Germany since 2005, with a bouquet of flowers.The negotiations over the alliance were relatively harmonious and speedy compared to previous coalition talks. But the political transition, with Merkel as a lame-duck caretaker, has hampered Germany's response to the latest rise in coronavirus cases.Few details have emerged from the closed-doors talks, including how the parties will divide up the ministerial portfolios. The alliance is a potentially uneasy mixture because it brings together two traditionally left-leaning parties with one, the Free Democrats, that has tended to ally with the center-right.A preliminary agreement last month indicated that Germany would bring forward its deadline for ending the use of coal-fueled power from 2038 to 2030, while expanding the rollout of renewable energy generation.At the Free Democrats’ insistence, the prospective partners said they won’t raise taxes or loosen curbs on running up debt, making financing a central issue.Merkel's Christian Democrats are currently preoccupied with a leadership contest over who will become their next leader and revive the party's fortunes after it suffered its worst-ever election result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-parties-reach-deal-for-coalition-govt-that-will-end-merkel-era-101637763867855.html
24-11-2021||World||Thai activists iPhones may have been targeted: Apple||Apple Inc issued on Wednesday alert messages to at least six Thai activists and researchers who have been critical of the government, warning it believed their iPhones had been targeted by "state-sponsored attackers", according to activists and the alerts reviewed by Reuters.Apple and Thailand's Digital Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said he had received two emails from Apple warning it believed his iPhone and iCloud accounts had been targeted, along with a "threat notification" on his Apple account.Researcher Sarinee Achananuntakul and Thai activist Yingcheep Atchanont of Legal Monitoring group iLaw said they had received similar emails, while a rapper, a political activist, and a politician opposed to the government separately posted screenshots of the same email on their social media accounts.All are perceived as being critical of the Thai government.The messages warned "if your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone."Apple on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Israeli cyber firm NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies for alleged surveillance and targeting of US Apple users with its Pegasus spyware. In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said that the NSO group had created "state-sponsored surveillance technology" that had been aimed at "very small number of users".It was not immediately clear in Apple's alerts on Wednesday whether the company believed Thais were being targeted by Pegasus.Internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab identified in 2018 a Pegasus spyware operator active within Thailand.Thailand's government is still led by the architects of a 2014 coup, who remain in power after a 2019 election that its rivals say was stacked in the military's favour.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the coup leader, has denied the claims, but has faced months of anti-government protests.As well as calls for greater democracy, the government has also been criticised over its management of the coronavirus pandemic and the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-activists-iphones-may-have-been-targeted-apple-101637759332541.html
24-11-2021||World||Germany's Angela Merkel set to hand off power||She was called "the leader of the free world" against authoritarian populists on the march in Europe and the United States, but Angela Merkel is wrapping up a historic 16 years in power with a mixed legacy at home and abroad.In office so long she was dubbed Germany's "eternal chancellor", Merkel, 67, leaves with her popularity so resilient she would likely have won a record fifth term had she sought it.Instead, Merkel will pass the baton as the first German chancellor to step down entirely by choice, with a whole generation of voters never knowing another person at the top.Her supporters say she provided steady leadership through countless global crises as a moderate and unifying figure.Yet critics argue a muddle-through style pegged to the broadest possible consensus lacked the bold vision to prepare Europe and its top economy for the coming decades.What is certain is that she leaves behind a fractured political landscape, with her own CDU party divided as it struggles to emerge from her long shadow.Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, who served as her vice chancellor and finance minister, successfully sold himself as the Merkel continuity candidate in the run-up to September's general election and is now poised to succeed her.Scholz's SPD was set to unveil later Wednesday a coalition deal with Greens and liberal Free Democrats. Assuming the government takes over in early December, Merkel will fall just days short of beating Helmut Kohl's record as Germany's longest-serving post-war leader.- Do the right thing -The unflappable Merkel has served for many in recent years as a multilateralist counterweight to the big, brash men of global politics, from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin.A Pew Research Center poll in September showed large majorities in most democracies around the globe having "confidence in Merkel to do the right thing in world affairs".A trained quantum chemist raised behind the Iron Curtain, Merkel was long in sync with her change-averse electorate as a guarantor of stability.Her major policy shifts reflected the wishes of large German majorities -- among them phasing out nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster -- and attracted a broad new coalition of women and urban voters to the once arch-conservative CDU.However, the last days of her tenure have been marred by a vicious fourth wave of the coronavirus outbreak, the worst since the start of the pandemic.- 'Austerity queen' -Before the pandemic, her boldest move -- keeping open German borders in 2015 to more than one million asylum seekers -- seemed set to determine her legacy.But while many Germans rallied to Merkel's "We can do it" cry, the move also emboldened an anti-migrant party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), ushering a far-right bloc into parliament for the first time since World War II.The woman once known as the "climate chancellor" for pushing renewables also faces a mass movement of young activists arguing she has failed to face up to the climate emergency, with Germany not even meeting its own emissions reduction commitments.The incoming coalition has pledged to improve on that legacy, and to take a more assertive stance with Russia and China after the commerce-based pragmatism of the Merkel years. Merkel became Europe's go-to leader during the eurozone crisis when Berlin championed swinging spending cuts in return for international bailout loans for debt-mired countries.Angry protesters dubbed her Europe's "austerity queen" and caricatured her in Nazi garb, while defenders credit her with holding the currency union together. - Kohl's 'girl' to 'Mummy' -Merkel, the EU's and G7's most senior leader, started as a contemporary of George W. Bush, Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac when she became Germany's youngest and first female chancellor in 2005.She was born Angela Dorothea Kasner on July 17, 1954 in the port city of Hamburg, the daughter of a Lutheran clergyman and a schoolteacher.Her father moved the family to a small-town parish in the communist East at a time when tens of thousands were headed the other way.She excelled in mathematics and Russian, which has helped her maintain the dialogue with the other veteran on the world stage, Russia's Putin, who was a KGB officer in Dresden when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.Merkel kept the name of her first husband, whom she married in 1977 and divorced five years later.After the fall of the wall, Merkel, who was working in a chemistry lab, joined a pro-democracy group that would merge with Kohl's Christian Democrats.The Protestant from the East whom Kohl nicknamed his "girl" would later be elected leader of a party until then dominated by western Catholic patriarchs.As she rose to power, party rivals sneeringly called her "Mutti" (Mummy) behind her back but she deftly -- some said ruthlessly -- eliminated potential challengers.Although her name has come up on wish lists for key EU or United Nations posts, Merkel has said she will leave politics altogether.Asked on her final trip to Washington in June what she looked forward to most, she replied "not having to constantly make decisions".bur-dlc/hmn/rl||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-angela-merkel-set-to-hand-off-power-101637758424577.html
24-11-2021||World||Pakistan informs India about allowing shipment of 50,000 tonnes of wheat for Afghanistan||Pakistan formally informed India on Wednesday that it will allow the shipment of 50,000 tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines from India to Afghanistan via the Wagah land border as a goodwill gesture to the Afghan people. India’s offer to supply wheat and other essential items as humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan had been pending for more than a month as Pakistan had not cleared the transportation of the relief materials via land routes. There are currently no flights between India and Afghanistan, and transporting the materials via Pakistan was being seen as the quickest way of getting the aid to Afghanistan, which is on the brink of a looming humanitarian crisis. The Pakistan government’s decision was formally conveyed to the charge d’affaires of the Indian high commission in Islamabad at the foreign ministry, according to an official statement from the Pakistani side. “As a goodwill gesture towards the brotherly Afghan people, the Government of Pakistan has decided to allow the transportation of 50,000 Metric Tonnes of wheat and lifesaving medicines from India to Afghanistan via Wagah Border on an exceptional basis for humanitarian purposes,” the statement said. The announcement was more of a formality as Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had said on Monday his government would allow the transportation of the wheat offered by India to Afghanistan as soon as modalities were finalised by Islamabad and New Delhi. Even a Taliban delegation that recently visited Islamabad had raised the issue of allowing the shipment of the wheat with the top Pakistani leadership. The UN has warned that up to 23 million Afghans will be in “crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity” as winter approaches. Ten out of 11 of Afghanistan’s most densely populated urban areas are now anticipated to be at emergency levels of food insecurity.Khan made the announcement while approving a humanitarian assistance package for Afghanistan. He also said Pakistan will facilitate the return of Afghan nationals who had gone to India for medical treatment and were stuck there. Hundreds of Afghan nationals, including patients seeking medical treatment and their relatives or attendants, have been stranded in India for months following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August. In recent weeks, some of them made their way back to Afghanistan via Iran on a handful of specially arranged flights. However, the fare for this route was $850 and out of the reach of many of the stranded Afghans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-informs-india-about-allowing-shipment-of-50-000-tonnes-of-wheat-for-afghanistan-101637758103815.html

A Taliban delegation that recently visited Islamabad had raised the issue of allowing the shipment via land.The development comes after Pakistan skips India's regional NSA-level summit to discuss Afghanistan post the Taliban takeover. With Iran, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan attending the summit, it was declared by the eight countries that Afghanistan's territory must not be used for terror activities.

24-11-2021||World||China slams US for inviting Taiwan to democracy summit||China on Wednesday slammed the US decision to invite Taiwan to a democracy summit in December, calling the decision a “mistake” and asking Washington not to collude with Taiwan “independence” separatists.“China firmly opposes the US invitation to the Taiwan authorities to participate in the so-called Summit for Democracy,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, adding that Taiwan is “an inalienable part of Chinese territory”.China reacted after the Joe Biden administration officially released the list of participants to its upcoming “summit for democracy”, which includes the island of Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy claimed by Beijing as a breakaway region.The invitation comes days after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Biden held a video summit where the Chinese President warned Biden that encouraging Taiwanese independence would be “playing with fire”.There are 110 participants on the US state department’s invitation list for the virtual event on December 9 and 10 including India but not China and Russia.The summit, according to Washington, aims to help stop democratic backsliding and the erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.The naming of Taiwan has expectedly riled China, which has in recent months increased pressure on the island and accused the US of working with those who propagate “independence” for it.Beijing has never ruled out using force to reunify the island of some 23 million people. Reacting to Taiwan being included in the summit, the mainland’s State Council Taiwan Affairs Office said “it’s a mistake” and reiterated its firm opposition to any formal interaction between the US and the island.“We firmly oppose any form of official interaction between the US and the island, which is a clear and consistent stance,” Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday, adding that the way the US listed Taiwan as a participant at the summit “…is a mistake”.The Chinese foreign ministry expressed strong opposition against Taiwan being invited to the “so-called summit of democracy” with spokesperson Zhao Lijian urging the US to stop colluding with Taiwan “independence” separatists.Zhao added that “…there is only one China in the world, and the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China”.“Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and the one-China principle. It is a generally accepted norm of international relations. Apart from being part of China, Taiwan has no other status in international law,” Zhao said.During the presidential summit with Xi Jinping, Biden had reiterated long-standing US support for the “One China” policy under which it officially recognises Beijing rather than Taipei.But, according to the White House, Biden had also said he “strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”.Xi, according to the official news agency, Xinhua, said that those in Taiwan who seek independence, and their supporters in the US, were “playing with fire”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slams-us-for-inviting-taiwan-to-democracy-summit-101637745144175.html
24-11-2021||World||Canada: Justin Trudeau govt to focus on economic growth, climate crisis||As Canada’s parliament formally opened on Tuesday following the September elections, the minority government headed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau presented an agenda focused on putting the Covid-19 pandemic “behind” and priorities like economic growth and tackling record inflation, climate crisis and reconciliation with the Indigenous communities.The outline of what Justin Trudeau plans to achieve in the near future was presented by Canada’s governor-general Mary Simon in her Speech from the Throne, which is equivalent to the Indian President’s address to the nation. The speech is so named as the governor-general (GG) is the representative of the Queen Elizabeth II, Canada’s head of state.The speech will be debated in the House of Commons in the days ahead and could result in the new government facing its first vote of confidence, as it will require the support of either the opposition Bloc Quebecois or the New Democratic Party (NDP) to get it passed. Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party is 10 short of the 170 seats required for a majority.“Priority number one remains getting the pandemic under control. The best way to do that is vaccination,” the GG said. In a statement related to the speech, Trudeau referred to the snap elections in September and said voters “gave parliamentarians a clear direction to work together to put the Covid-19 crisis behind us and find the real solutions needed to build a better future for all Canadians.”“Building a better future starts with getting the pandemic under control and finishing the job on vaccines,” the statement issued by the prime minister’s office noted.The speech began with a reference to the devastating flooding that beset the province of British Columbia last week. “The Canadian government will continue to invest in our workers and industry to help bring us into the economy of the future, while also taking action to clean the air that we breathe and protect Canadians from extreme weather events,” Trudeau said.The speech reiterated Canada’s COP26 commitment that it was “moving to cap and cut oil and gas sector emissions, while accelerating” its “path to a 100% net-zero electricity future”.With inflation at a level of nearly 5%, a high not experienced in the country for two decades, that, along with affordability, was among the main matters addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeau-govt-to-focus-on-economic-growth-climate-crisis-101637736682101.html
24-11-2021||World||Biden taps oil from US strategic petroleum reserve. Here's all you need to know||When President Joe Biden ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from America’s strategic reserve to help reduce energy costs, he was taking aim at a growing burden for millions of Americans embarking on Thanksgiving travel.The step announced Tuesday, done in rare coordination with several other nations, is among the few things a presidential administration can do to try to lessen the squeeze — and the political threat — of rising inflation. The likelihood of providing meaningful relief in the near future, however, is probably low. Still, any help in easing fuel prices, even modestly, would be welcomed by many Americans.Here is a look at what's involved:Just what is the petroleum reserve?America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana. It was created following the 1970s Arab oil embargo to store oil that could be tapped in an emergency. But the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years: Now the US exports more oil than it imports.There’s a limit to how much can be released at once. In the past, the government has released about 1 million barrels per day. At that rate, the promised influx of 50 million barrels of crude could last about two months.Why did Biden tap the reserve?The idea is that by putting more oil on the market, prices will fall. That hasn’t happened yet. But depending on what happens in the rest of the world, there’s still a chance it could work.Oil prices rose slightly after the announcement. Traders were anticipating the news, and may have been underwhelmed by the details, said Claudio Galimberti, senior vice president for oil markets at Rystad Energy.“The immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this effort,” said Jim Burkhard, vice president at IHS Markit. “It will really be in the months ahead.”Whether the move is effective depends on several factors.What about OPEC?The OPEC oil cartel and its allies will be meeting in about a week to decide whether to increase production or to hold back, a strategy the group often employs to boost prices. Earlier this month, Biden had hoped OPEC nations, led by Saudi Arabia, would agree to significantly boost production. But they only made modest increases.If OPEC decides next week that it wants higher prices, its members could take oil off the market. “Just overnight, they could just offset it,” Burkhard said. “So that’s a big question mark, is how they react to this.”The coalition Biden assembled — bringing together India, China, Japan, South Korea and the U.K. to tap their strategic oil reserves — is unprecedented, Galimberti said. Altogether, the group could be adding 70 million to 80 million barrels of oil onto the market, he estimates.“It’s kind of a coalition of oil importers,” he added. “But can they really supplant, or can they really represent a rival to OPEC-plus? The answer is absolutely not.” That’s because the group of importers are using their strategic petroleum reserves, which are limited. On the other hand, OPEC and its allies have oil reserves that can last for decades. “So there is no comparison between the two,” Galimberti said.Will gasoline get cheaper?What many consumers want to know is what’s going to happen to gasoline prices at the pump. Many factors go into the price of gasoline. Refineries buy crude oil in advance, so they’re still working with more expensive oil, and states have differing tax rates that impact the price. Nevertheless, if OPEC doesn’t respond by curtailing production, the influx of oil could lead to a gasoline price decrease of 10 cents to 15 cents per gallon, said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. Even if the price drop doesn’t happen, Biden can make the case that he tried.“Really, what we’re talking about are the most price-sensitive consumers in the economy,” Book said. “They may not show up in GDP numbers or recessions, but they show up in vote counts as marginal voters, who may or may not respond in the next election cycle, and I think if we get down to it that’s really what this is about.”Why does oil matter?The future of oil and gas in the US is a political flashpoint and source of tension, especially as companies and government agencies grapple with climate change and the transition to cleaner sources of energy.On the one hand, the US oil and gas industry has been praised by some political leaders for creating energy independence. Where the US once relied heavily on imports, other nations now rely on the US for oil. It's also a job supplier: The oil and gas industry employs more than 10 million people in the US and contributes about 8% of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Any impact resulting from Biden's release of oil from the strategic reserves “is likely to be short-lived unless it is paired with policy measures that encourage the production of American energy resources,” the API said in a statement.Companies that supply oil benefit from higher prices. But consumers don’t like it when those higher prices trickle down to the pump.“The broader drama is this new variable in the oil market: It’s the tension between aspirations to decarbonize and the practical concern to have low gasoline prices,” Burkhard said. “And there there’s a conflict between those two forces. And that’s why we’re going to continue to see dislocations between demand and supply.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-taps-oil-from-us-strategic-petroleum-reserve-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-101637734142231.html
24-11-2021||World||Canada: Justin Trudeau government formulates new Indo-Pacific strategy||As Canada formulates a new strategy for the Indo-Pacific, the region will be a key component of its foreign affairs policy as evidenced by its mention in the agenda before the new parliament.As the House of Commons met for the first time after the September elections, Canada’s governor-general Mary Simon outlined the policy priorities of the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and among those was “making deliberate efforts to deepen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific”.The outlet Globe and Mail reported earlier this month the Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, is working on a new policy for the Indo-Pacific. A spokesperson for Canada’s new foreign minister Melanie Joly told them that it will comprise “a new integrated approach to the Indo-Pacific region with a view to diversifying Canada’s engagement and deepening its diplomatic, economic, security and sustainable development partnerships”.The special secretariat tasked with developing the policy is being headed by veteran diplomat Jonathan Fried.Canada has also had discussions with India in recent times about the region. In fact, Fried recently met India’s high commissioner Ajay Bisaria in Ottawa.Last week, in her keynote address to the Halifax International Security Forum, Canada’s new defence minister Anita Anand said, “In the Indo-Pacific, Canadian military ships, aircraft, and sailors maintain a solid presence.” She added that “through Operation Projection, Canadian warships work in lockstep with our partners to maintain a meaningful, and interoperable, allied presence in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world”, referring, in this context, to a recent “sail-through in the Taiwanese strait” in October.Pressure has been increasing on Canada to be more assertive in the region even as the threat posed by China increases. This matter was also discussed when Trudeau met US President Joe Biden in Washington earlier this month.Also speaking at the Halifax Forum, North America’s premier event related to global security, Admiral John Aquilino, commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, argued that the world’s “military and economic centres of gravity have shifted to the Indo-Pacific”.This new reality was reflected in the speech delivered by Canada’s governor-general on Tuesday. Without mentioning China, Mary Simon said, “In the face of rising authoritarianism and great power competition, Canada must reinforce international peace and security, the rule of law, democracy, and respect for human rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeau-government-formulates-new-indo-pacific-strategy-101637733321842.html
24-11-2021||World||Does vaccination protect against long Covid? Here’s what studies suggest||It’s been nearly two years that coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic began across the globe. While multiple vaccines with high efficacy rate are currently available, their protection capability in the face of varied threats posed by the virus remains somewhat ambiguous. One such threat is long Covid or post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).According to WebMD, long Covid can be defined as having lingering symptoms of the infection weeks or even months after one starts to recover from it. A recent study by researchers of University of Michigan revealed that over 40 per cent of Covid-19 survivors around the world are estimated to have suffered from long Covid.Does vaccination protect against long Covid?Although vaccination helps against the virus, experts believe that it doesn’t curtail the risk of long Covid. According to a report in Nature, physiotherapist David Putrino said a dozen of his clients experienced long Covid from ‘breakthrough infections’ wherein vaccinated individuals catch the infection.One of the causes of long Covid is the broad immune response triggered by the initial infection, which can produce antibodies and several other immunological reactions against the body’s own tissues. Researchers and data suggested that vaccination could only decrease the likelihood of this scenario, and also that protection against long Covid is partial.Also Read | Long Covid has more than 200 symptoms across 10 organ systems: StudyOne of the largest studies gathered so far from 1.2 million people, who were inoculated with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, found that a full-two dose of vaccination decreased the risk of long Covid by about half among those who had breakthrough infections. However, the Nature journal report noted, the study constituted more men than women, and fewer individuals from the lower-income regions.Is it possible to know the extent and of long Covid’s risk?Immunologist Petter Brodin at Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute said that determining the risk of long Covid from breakthrough infections is challenging as several people with mild or asymptomatic infections may not even be tested for Covid-19, according to the Nature report.Also Read | Blood clotting may be root cause of long Covid syndrome? Here's what study says“Doing any kind of assessment of how many people develop long-term symptoms after they are vaccinated is going to be incredibly difficult,” he added.What remains unknown regarding the interlink between vaccine and long Covid?A large study, yet to be peer reviewed, revealed that vaccination didn’t protect against multiple conditions related to long Covid. In reference to this, immunologist Akiko Iwasaki at Yale University in Connecticut, said that results of these studies are disappointing.“I honestly thought the vaccine would protect against long Covid much more extensively,” she said.With vaccination programmes continuing, researchers will gain a better insight into the mechanism of vaccines and variants that affect long Covid rates and severity. For example, in October, the UK branch for the National Statistics, which is assembling data on long Covid, reported that the first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine was associated with 13 per cent decrease in self-reported long Covid symptoms among those who already had the condition. Meanwhile, the second jab produced an additional 9 per cent drop relative to the first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/does-vaccination-protect-against-long-covid-here-s-what-studies-suggest-101637726260640.html

24-11-2021||World||NASA launches spacecraft to kick an asteroid off course||NASA is preparing a mission to deliberately smash a spacecraft into an asteroid -- a test run should humanity ever need to stop a giant space rock from wiping out life on Earth.It may sound like the stuff of science fiction, but the DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) is a real proof-of-concept experiment, blasting off at 10:21 pm Pacific Time Tuesday (0621 GMT Wednesday) aboard a SpaceX rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California."All systems and weather are looking good for tonight's Falcon 9 launch," Elon Musk's company tweeted.The goal is to slightly alter the trajectory of Dimorphos, a "moonlet" around 525 feet (160 meters, or two Statues of Liberty) wide that circles a much larger asteroid called Didymos (2,500 feet in diameter). The pair orbit the Sun together.Impact should take place in the fall of 2022, when the binary asteroid system is 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers) from Earth, almost the nearest point they ever get. "What we're trying to learn is how to deflect a threat," NASA's top scientist Thomas Zuburchen said of the $330 million project, the first of its kind.To be clear, the asteroids in question pose no threat to our planet. But they belong to a class of bodies known as Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) -- asteroids and comets that approach within 30 million miles.NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office is most interested in those larger than 460 feet in size, which have the potential to level entire cities or regions with many times the energy of average nuclear bombs.There are 10,000 known near-Earth asteroids 460 feet in size or greater, but none has a significant chance to hit in the next 100 years. One major caveat: scientists think there are still 15,000 more such objects waiting to be discovered.- 15,000 mph kick -Planetary scientists can create miniature impacts in labs and use the results to create sophisticated models about how to divert an asteroid -- but models are always inferior to real world tests.Scientists say the Didymos-Dimorphos system is an "ideal natural laboratory," because Earth-based telescopes can easily measure the brightness variation of the pair and judge the time it takes the moonlet to orbit its big brother.Since the current orbit period is known, the change will reveal the effect of the impact, scheduled to occur between September 26 and October 1, 2022.What's more, since the asteroids' orbit never intersects our planet, they are thought safer to study.The DART probe, which is a box the size of a large fridge with limousine-sized solar panels on either side, will slam into Dimorphos at just over 15,000 miles an hour.Andy Rivkin, DART investigation team lead, said that the current orbital period is 11 hours and 55 minutes, and the team expects the kick will shave around 10 minutes off that time.There is some uncertainty about how much energy will be transferred by the impact, because the moonlet's internal composition and porosity are not known.The more debris that's generated, the more push will be imparted on Dimorphos."Every time we show up at an asteroid, we find stuff we don't expect," said Rivkin.The DART spacecraft also contains sophisticated instruments for navigation and imaging, including the Italian Space Agency's Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube) to watch the crash and its after-effects.- Nuclear blasts - The so-called "kinetic impactor" method isn't the only way to divert an asteroid, but it is the only technique ready to deploy with current technology.Others that have been hypothesized include flying a spacecraft close by to impart a small gravitational force. Another is detonating a nuclear blast close by -- but not on the object itself, as in the films Armageddon and Deep Impact -- which would probably create many more perilous objects.Scientists estimate 460-foot asteroids strike once every 20,000 years.Asteroids that are six miles or wider -- such as the one that struck 66 million years ago and led to the extinction of most life on Earth, including the dinosaurs -- occur around every 100-200 million years.ia/dw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-launches-spacecraft-to-kick-an-asteroid-off-course-101637715818294.html
24-11-2021||World||Waukesha Christmas parade crash: Child 6th victim in incident, suspect charged||An 8-year-old boy became the sixth person to die Tuesday as a result of a man driving his SUV into a suburban Milwaukee Christmas parade, with a criminal complaint alleging that the suspect in the case steered side-to-side with the intent of striking marchers and spectators.Darrell Brooks Jr., 39, was charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, a charge that carries a mandatory life sentence if convicted. He rocked back and forth in his seat and cried throughout his court hearing on Tuesday, his attorney’s arm on his back, as the charges against him were detailed. His bail was set at $5 million, and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14.“The nature of this offense is shocking," said Waukesha Court Commissioner Kevin Costello.Additional charges related to the sixth death and the more than 60 people injured will be coming later this week or next, said Waukesha County District Attorney Susan Opper. The criminal complaint said 62 people were injured, up from the 48 previously announced by police.Brooks is accused of speeding away from police and entering the Waukesha Christmas parade on Sunday night, refusing to stop even as an officer banged on the hood of his SUV. Another officer fired three shots into the vehicle, but it did not stop.Five people ranging in age from 52 to 81 were pronounced dead within hours. Jackson Sparks, 8, was the first of many injured children to have died. He was walking in the parade with his 12-year-old brother Tucker, who was injured and is being discharged from the hospital, according to his GoFundMe page.“This afternoon, our dear Jackson has sadly succumbed to his injuries and passed away,” the page’s organizer, Alyssa Albro, wrote.The city’s livestream video and bystander video captured the chaotic scene when an SUV sped along the parade route and then into the crowd. Several of those injured remain in critical condition.According to the criminal complaint, witnesses told police that the vehicle “appeared to be intentionally moving side to side,” with no attempt to slow down or stop as it struck multiple people and sent bodies and objects flying.Brooks ignored several attempts to stop him, according to the criminal complaint.A detective — wearing police insignia and a neon orange safety vest — stepped in front of Brooks’ vehicle and pounded on the hood, shouting “Stop,” several times but Brooks drove past him, according to the complaint.A uniformed police officer who saw Brooks’ SUV traveling toward the parade route also tried to get his attention, yelling “Stop, stop the vehicle” several times but was ignored, according to the complaint. The officer “observed the driver looking straight ahead, directly at him, and it appeared he had no emotion on his face,” the complaint said.Brooks braked at one point, but instead of turning away from the parade route, he turned into the crowd and appeared to rapidly accelerate, the complaint said.Another police officer shot at the vehicle, striking it three times as it entered the parade route. Brooks was not hit by the bullets, the Waukesha police chief said Monday.The complaint said one witness who spoke with police said the SUV "continued to drive in a zig zag motion. It was like the SUV was trying to avoid vehicles, not people. There was no attempt made by the vehicle to stop, much less slow down.”Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said Brooks, 39, was leaving the scene of a domestic dispute that had taken place just minutes earlier when he drove into the parade route.He had been free on $1,000 bail for a case in Milwaukee County earlier in November in which he’s accused of intentionally striking a woman with his car. Prosecutors said they’re investigating their bail recommendation in that case, calling it inappropriately low.“We have a gentleman that has a huge background, via multiple states,” Costello said.Brooks has been charged with crimes more than a dozen times since 1999, mostly in Wisconsin but also in Georgia and Nevada, and had two outstanding cases against him at the time of the parade disaster. That included resisting or obstructing an officer, reckless endangering, disorderly conduct, bail jumping and battery for the Nov. 2 incident.Thompson said that there was no evidence the bloodshed Sunday was a terrorist attack or that Brooks knew anyone in the parade. Brooks acted alone, the chief said.NBC News published doorbell camera footage that appeared to capture Brooks' arrest. It showed Brooks, shivering in just a T-shirt, knocking on a homeowner's door and asking for help calling for a ride. Moments later, police surrounded the house and shouted, “Hands up!” Brooks, standing on the porch, held up his hands and said, “Whoa whoa whoa!”Hundreds gathered at a downtown park Monday night in Waukesha, Wisconsin, for a candlelight vigil in honor of those lost and hurt. A pair of clergy solemnly read the names of those who died. Volunteers handed out sandwiches, hot chocolate and candles at the vigil, which was attended by interfaith leaders and elected officials.“We are parents. We are neighbors. We are hurting. We are angry. We are sad. We are confused. We are thankful. We are all in this together. We are Waukesha Strong,” said a tearful Amanda Medina Roddy with the Waukesha school district.Mayor Shawn Reilly described the parade as a “Norman Rockwell-type” event that “became a nightmare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/waukesha-christmas-parade-crash-child-6th-victim-in-incident-suspect-charged-101637714488928.html

Turkey, which like America is a member of NATO, is also missing from the list of participants.Among the countries of the Middle East, only Israel and Iraq will take place in the online conference, scheduled for December 9-10.Traditional Arab allies of the US -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, are not invited.Biden invited Brazil even though its far right president, Jair Bolsonaro has been criticized as having an authoritarian bent and was a firm supporter of Donald Trump.In Europe, Poland was invited to the summit despite persistent tension with the European Union over its human rights record. Hungary, led by hardline nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, was not invited.In Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria and Niger are among the countries on the list.In announcing the summit back in August, the White House said the meeting would "galvanize commitments and initiatives across three principal themes: defending against authoritarianism, fighting corruption, and promoting respect for human rights."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-biden-invites-around-110-nations-to-virtual-summit-on-democracy-report-101637715204381.html

They had suffered burns and one had a broken leg.The accident happened on the Struma highway about 30km west of Sofia around 2am local time.North Macedonia’s chief prosecutor, Lubomir Jovevski, who visited the scene of the accident, said that 12 children were confirmed among the dead.The cause of the crash was not immediately confirmed, but it appeared that the bus hit a highway guard rail, crashed and caught fire.Bulgarian investigative service chief Borislav Sarafov said four buses from a North Macedonian travel agency had entered Bulgaria late on Monday from Turkey. “Human error by the driver or a technical malfunction are the two initial versions for the accident,” he said.Photos taken shortly after the crash showed the bus engulfed in flames with plumes of smoke rising from the scene. Daylight revealed the burned-out bus, its windows all broken, charred and gutted, sitting upright against the median barrier.Interior minister Boyko Rashkov told reporters at the crash site that he had “never in my life seen something more horrifying”. “The picture is horrifying, the people who were on the bus are turned to charcoal,” Rashkov said. “It is impossible to say how many they were. There were four buses that travelled together, and it is possible that passengers changed buses during the stops.”Media in North Macedonia, a country of about 2 million people, said that police were outside the Skopje offices of a travel company that is believed to have organized the trip to Turkey.Bulgarian caretaker Prime Minister Stefan Yanev, who also visited the site of the crash, said it was “a huge tragedy”.“I take this opportunity to send my condolences to the relatives of the victims,” Yanev said. “Let’s hope we learn lessons and we can prevent such incidents in the future.”Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka wrote online that almost all of those who died in the crash were ethnic Albanians.North Macedonia’s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, arrived in Bulgaria to visit the survivors in the hospital in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bus-crashes-catches-fire-in-bulgaria-at-least-46-killed-101637698227695.html
24-11-2021||World||Merck asks EU drug regulator to authorise its Covid-19 pill||The European Medicines Agency said it has received a request from Merck to authorise its coronavirus antiviral, the first pill shown to treat Covid-19.In a statement Tuesday, the EU drug regulator said it had started evaluating molnupiravir, made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and that a decision could be made within weeks on whether it might be cleared.Last week, the EMA issued emergency advice saying that molnupiravir could be used to treat adults infected with the coronavirus who don't yet need extra oxygen and are at increased risk of developing severe disease.The agency said the drug should be given as soon as possible after Covid-19 has been diagnosed and within five days of symptoms starting.It is intended to be taken twice a day for five days.Earlier this month, Britain became the first country in the world to OK the drug.The UK licensed molnupiravir for adults diagnosed with Covid-19 and with at least one risk factor for severe disease.An antiviral pill that reduces symptoms and speeds recovery could prove groundbreaking, easing caseloads on hospitals and helping to curb explosive outbreaks in conjunction with vaccination campaigns.Europe is now at the epicenter of the pandemic and the World Health Organisation has warned that without urgent measures, Europe could see 700,000 more Covid-19 deaths by the spring.Molnupiravir is also pending review with regulators in the US, which is expected to convene an expert panel later this month to consider authorisation.Even if the pill is licensed, initial supplies will be limited. Merck has said it can produce 10 million treatment courses this year, but much of that supply has already been purchased by governments worldwide.In October, Merck agreed to let other drugmakers produce molnupiravir and signed a licensing agreement with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool allowing its pill to be made by companies in dozens of countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merck-asks-eu-drug-regulator-to-authorise-its-covid-19-pill-101637691488046.html

That, he said, was 2.5 times more than the same period last year.Shoigu complained in particular of what he said was a simulated US nuclear strike against Russia earlier this month."The defence minister underlined that during the US military exercises 'Global Thunder', 10 American strategic bombers rehearsed launching nuclear weapons against Russia from the western and eastern directions," Shoigu was quoted as saying in a defence ministry statement."The minimum proximity to our state border was 20 km."Shoigu was quoted as saying that Russian air defence units had spotted and tracked the US strategic bombers and taken unspecified measures to avoid any incidents.Global Thunder, which this year put US nuclear-capable B-52 bombers through their paces, is the US Strategic Command's annual nuclear and command exercise designed to test and demonstrate the readiness of US nuclear capabilities.President Vladimir Putin referenced the apparent episode briefly last week, complaining of Western strategic bombers carrying "very serious weapons" close to Russia. He said the West was taking Moscow's warnings not to cross its "red lines" too lightly.Shoigu made the comments in a video conference with Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe. He said that US bomber flights close to Russia's eastern borders were also a threat to China."Against this backdrop, Russo-Chinese coordination is becoming a stabilising factor in world affairs," said Shoigu.Russia and China agreed at the meeting to step up cooperation between their armed forces when it came to strategic military exercises and joint patrols, the defence ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-says-us-rehearsed-nuclear-strike-against-russia-in-november-report-101637688011310.html

New Delhi has ordered the release of 5 million barrels from the reserve and other countries will make their respective announcements.“American consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic,” the White House said in the announcement, adding, “That’s why President Biden is using every tool available to him to work to lower prices and address the lack of supply.”Gas at the pump is selling at an average of $3.40 a gallon (3.8 litres), with prices going up to $4.70 in California, according to the Automobile Associations of America. Tuesday’s national average of $3.40 is 3 cents more than a month ago and $1.29 more than a year ago - when oil prices had nosedived because of slump in demand caused by Covid-19 lockdowns - in the wake of and 81 cents more than in 2019.The release from the reserve is expected to hit the pump middle or late December.President Biden had been under mounting pressure from Republicans and from with his own democratic party to use the reserve to tackle the rising oil prices, especially in view of the holiday season that starts with Thanksgiving later this week, when Americans are expected to hit the roadThe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a stockpile of gas meant to be used during emergencies such as a war or a hurricane. It was created after the oil crisis of the 1970s. The oil is stored in underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana, which together are reported to hold more than 600 million barrels, which is slightly less than a month’s requirement.The President has been working with countries across the world to address the lack of supply as the world exits the pandemic. “As a result of President Biden’s leadership and our diplomatic efforts, this release will be taken in parallel with other major energy consuming nations including China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom,” the White House said. “This culminates weeks of consultations with countries around the world, and we are already seeing the effect of this work on oil prices. Over the last several weeks as reports of this work became public, oil prices are down nearly 10%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taps-oil-stockpile-in-parallel-with-india-china-and-others-101637688114670.html
24-11-2021||World||Turkish lira sees historic fall as Erdogan wages ‘economic war of independence’||The Turkish currency weakened by nearly 10% against the US dollar Tuesday, a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted there would be no turning back from his unconventional policy of cutting interest rates despite high inflation.The lira plunged to a record low of 13.44 against the dollar before recovering some of its losses. It was trading at 12.51 against the dollar in the late afternoon — down 9.9% from Monday’s close. The currency was trading at 14.08 against the euro. The lira has lost some 40% of its value since the start of the year.Erdogan, who had declared himself an “enemy” of high borrowing costs, portrayed his economic policies as “an economic war of independence” during a late-night televised address to the nation. He made clear that his government would not step back from its policy of lowering borrowing rates to boost growth.Contrary to traditional economic theory, Erdogan argues that high interest rates cause inflation. Typically, central banks raise those rates to tame rising consumer prices.“Either we were going to give up on investments, production, growth and employment by keeping to the understanding that has prevailed in our country for years, or we were going to engage in a historic struggle in line with our priorities,” Erdogan said. “As always, we preferred the struggle.”“We are determined to do the right thing for our nation,” he continued. “We encourage investment, production and exports. ... We protect employment. ... We care about growth.”Turkey's Central Bank has cut interest rates by 4 percentage points since September, raising concerns about its independence from Erdogan’s government. The president has sacked three bank governors since 2019.Inflation is running at around 20%, eroding the public’s purchasing power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-lira-sees-historic-fall-as-erdogan-wages-economic-war-of-independence-101637677899634.html

The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows,” Lingo added.US warships periodically conduct exercises in the strait, almost always triggering angry responses from Beijing, which claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, and surrounding waters as its own territory.The PLA’s eastern theatre command issued a statement saying it had deployed ships and aircraft to follow the US vessel.“This move by the US creates security risks and undermines regional stability. The theatre troops will take all necessary measures to resolutely counter all threats and provocations, and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” spokesperson Colonel Shi Yi said.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry echoed Yi’s views.“US warships have repeatedly flaunted their strength and made provocations in the Taiwan Strait under the guise of freedom of navigation. This is not a promise of freedom and openness, but a deliberate interference and destruction of regional peace and stability,” ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the ministry briefing.“The US should immediately correct its mistakes, stop provoking troubles and playing with fire across the border, and play a constructive role for regional peace and stability,” he added.China has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) over the past year or so, provoking anger in Taipei.British, Canadian, French and Australian warships have all made passages through the Taiwan Strait in recent years, sparking protests from China.“Nine were conducted in 2019 followed by 15 in 2020. So far this year there have been 11, including the USS Milius crossing,” news agency AFP reported, quoting Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, who keeps a database of declared US transits through the strait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-expresses-anger-after-us-warship-transits-taiwan-strait-101637661533128.html

He is one of the FBI's most wanted men due to his involvement in suicide attacks and ties with Al Qaeda.Late last month, the Taliban urged the United States and other countries to recognise their government in Afghanistan, and said that the failure to do so and the continued freezing of Afghan funds abroad would “lead to problems not only for the country but for the world.”Zabihullah Mujahid recalled that the reason the Taliban and the US went to war last time was also because the two did not have formal diplomatic ties.ALSO READ | Taliban must seek legitimacy within Afghanistan before international recognitionNo country has formally recognised the interim Taliban government in Afghanistan since the Islamist insurgents took over the war-torn country in August, following the collpase of the Ashraf Ghani-led government, while billions of dollars in Afghan assets and funds abroad have also been frozen, even as the country faces severe economic and humanitarian crises.However, senior government officials from a number of countries have been meeting with the Taliban leadership both in Kabul and abroad to broker peace and aid deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leadership-afghanistan-government-ministers-and-officials-induction-101637658596062.html

And the two other charges each carried over 60 years behind bars."We are all so very happy that Kyle can live his life as a free and innocent man, but in this whole situation there are no winners, there are two people who lost their lives and that's not lost on us at all," David Hancock, a spokesperson for the Rittenhouse family, told Reuters.August 2020 shootingsKyle Rittenhouse went to Kenosha, about 32 kilometres from his home in Antioch, Illinois, on August 25 of last year as protesters in the city gathered after a White police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, paralysing him from the waist down.Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and fired a bullet that tore a chunk off the arm of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28. Rittenhouse claimed self-defence.Also read | Rittenhouse provoked bloodshed, walked off like a hero in a Western: ProsecutorRittenhouse's gun was loaded with 30 rounds of full metal jacket bullets, which are designed to penetrate their target. The violence was captured on mobile phones and surveillance video included the moments after Rittenhouse fired four rounds into Rosenbaum, who lay motionless, bleeding and groaning. Another video showed Grosskreutz screaming, with blood gushing from his arm.Rittenhouse said he shot Huber after he had struck him with a skateboard and pulled on his weapon. He said he fired on Grosskreutz after the man pointed the pistol he was carrying at him. Rittenhouse testified that he shot Rosenbaum after the man chased him and grabbed his gun.Rittenhouse said during the trial that he wanted to guard property against arson and destruction and tend to the injured. In his own defence last Wednesday in the trial's most dramatic moment, Rittenhouse emphasised that he acted out of fear for his life. "I did what I had to do to stop the person who was attacking me," he said.Defence vs prosecutionThe defence argued that Rittenhouse had been repeatedly attacked and shot the men in fear for his life.

"It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,” they said in a statement.The verdict was greeted with outrage by many on the political left and celebrated by gun-rights supporters.US President Joe Biden said on Friday he supported the jury's decision and urged Americans to react with calm.

24-11-2021||India||Tomato prices in Tamil Nadu soar past ₹100, govt steps in with subsidised variety||With tomato prices soaring due to the northeast monsoon induced downpour earlier this month, the Tamil Nadu government has started the process of selling tomatoes in the price range of ₹85 and ₹100 per kg through state-run farm fresh outlets in 12 districts including Chennai from Wednesday. The state cooperatives department said in a statement that they are procuring 15 metric tonnes of the vegetable every day for this purpose.“The government is making efforts to supply tomatoes at a lower price to the public. Until this afternoon, 8 MTs of tomatoes were sold in these markets,” minister for cooperatives I Periyasamy said in a statement. “Until Tuesday, a kg of tomatoes in the open market was ₹140, and due to this move by the government, on Wednesday it is around ₹90-100 per kg. Similarly, the prices of other vegetables have also come down,” he said.On Wednesday, Chennai’s main wholesale market saw tomatoes selling for ₹120 per kg while in other markets it had touched ₹140. Tamil Nadu primarily receives its tomatoes from two regions in Karnataka and three regions in Andhra Pradesh, says advisor to the Koyambedu Wholesale Vegetable Traders, V R Soundararajan. “Usually, during the northeast monsoon, there is a gap in the rainfall in various parts of Tamil Nadu. But this time, there was heavy rain in all the southern districts at the same time. We have not experienced a situation like this in 30 years,” says Soundararajan. He said that it was not just tomatoes that were affected. “Tomatoes, brinjal, ladies finger reach Koyambedu from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and because of the rainfall, the crops are damaged, transport is affected so our supply has dwindled,” he said. After tomatoes, the vegetables that cost the highest per kg in the retail market are ladies finger ( ₹80), beans ( ₹71), brinjal ( ₹72).K Pushparaj, a small vendor who supplies fruits and vegetables door-to-door said that he has stopped purchasing tomatoes from the wholesale market. “Tomatoes have become a luxury for some so a few residents have stopped buying it,” he said.The prices have been steadily increasing since the arrival of the northeast monsoon in the state in October and have skyrocketed since heavy spells of rain caused severe damage in Chennai, delta districts and southern districts. Between November 6 and 7 and on November 11 Chennai received 21 cm and 16 cm of rainfall respectively. From October 1 to November 18, Chennai and Tamil Nadu received 66% and 61% of excess rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tomato-prices-in-tamil-nadu-soar-past-rs-100-govt-steps-in-with-subsidised-variety-101637775984674.html

Former chief minister Mukul Sangma is one of them, reports said.The development comes as Trinamool supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee met PM Modi on Wednesday on her New Delhi trip. On being asked about her plans to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Mamata said it is not mandatory to meet Sonia Gandhi every time she visits New Delhi. The Congress is busy with the Punjab election, Mamata said.While the exodus of Sangma and his followers was not beyond speculation, the sudden development in Meghalaya, which will go to the polls in 2023, at a time when Congress is experiencing exodus in other states too is significant. Mukul Sangma has been expressing his resentment with the Congress for quite some time. However, every time it was speculated that Sangma would cross over to the Trinamool, he dismissed those speculations. On Wednesday too, Sangma reportedly denied to comment and said he would address a press meet on Thursday. Kirti Azad has been the latest name to make the switchover from the Congress to the TMC following former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro and former Mahila Congress national president Sushmita Dev.Before the major development in the northeastern state on Wednesday, Congress leader KC Venugopal said the crossing over of some of the leaders to Trinamool is a drama which will not be able to weaken the Congress. "We are not bothered about all these... If somebody is taking people from our party, it will not matter at all. If somebody is thinking that they can destroy the Congress one day, it will not happen. Many people have tried these kinds of things earlier also," Venugopal said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-12-cong-mlas-join-trinamool-making-it-main-opposition-claims-tmc-101637775285388.html

The submarine was constructed at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) Mumbai in collaboration with M/s Naval Group, France, and was delivered to the Indian Navy on November 9, 2021. A total of six submarines are to be built under the project.“It's a proud moment for all of us. It has an indigenous set of batteries and has an advanced communication suite of indigenous make so it has taken the concept of 'AatmaNirbhar Bharat' further,” Captain Anish Mathew, Commanding Officer of INS Vela, told news agency ANI.Launched in May 2019, INS Vela has completed all major harbour and sea trials including weapon and sensor trials since then despite Covid-induced restrictions. Pointing to the intricate activity of submarine construction, the ministry of defence had earlier said the difficulty is compounded when all types of equipment are required to be miniaturised.The Scorpene-class submarines are meant to undertake multifarious tasks typically including anti-surface as well as anti-submarine warfare.MDL is one of India’s leading shipyards with a capacity to meet the requirements of the Indian Navy. According to the defence ministry, MDL is ready for undertaking the construction of future submarines by leveraging the experience and the transfer of technology of the Scorpene project.Last week, INS Visakhapatnam, the first stealth-guided missile destroyer ship of Project 15B, was commissioned at the naval dock in Mumbai in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh. In a step towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat, the commissioning reaffirmed India's presence amongst an elite group of nations with the capability to design and build advanced warships.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-to-commission-ins-vela-fourth-scorpene-class-submarine-tomorrow-in-mumbai-101637770555984.html

The organisers, who hosted a virtual music festival ‘Sunburn for Goa’ last year to raise funds for Covid-19, recently started accepting bookings for this year’s festival in anticipation of government approval.Sawant did not elaborate on why he decided to reject permission for the festival.“We have not given permission for Sunburn this year… This time, we have not given permission to Sunburn. My office has already processed the file,” Pramod Sawant told reporters after a cabinet meeting.Goa tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar said he was in favour of holding the festival, but will respect the chief minister’s decision.“I felt that it should be held. I wanted it to happen. What people want should happen,” Ajgaonkar said but underlined that it was the chief minister’s call to make, not his.“The chief minister has taken a decision after studying the matter. I cannot take any decision, without final approval from the chief minister. CM has not informed me about rejecting the file yet,” he said, adding that the chief minister’s office was better informed about the ground situation in so far as the Covid-19 pandemic was considered.”The file had come to us, we had sent it to (chief minister’s office) for a decision. The final decision is taken by the CM,” Ajgaonkar saidThe Sunburn festival that draws thousands of music lovers was not held last year on account of the pandemic after initial attempts by the organisers to hold the festival. The festival was first organised in Goa in 2007. According to its website, over 2 million people from 51 countries have flown to Goa over the years to attend the festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-this-year-says-pramod-sawant-as-he-nixes-goa-s-sunburn-music-fest-101637772684524.html

He said the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP government (2012-17) had implemented a number of welfare schemes for farmers.He also said policies about remunerative prices, cheaper power to farmers, free irrigation and availability of fertilisers for farmers were the result of the policies of the earlier SP government.He said under Akhilesh Yadav’s leadership, the SP was always with the farmers. The party strongly opposed the three farm laws and was aware that farmers had been framed in different cases by the BJP government, Chaudhary said. He said a large number of farmers, too, went to jail during the period.Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson and senior cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh reacted sharply to the SP chief’s move and described it as “fake” concern for the farmers. Singh said the farmers understood this was another gimmick of the Samajwadi Party ahead of the crucial 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-announces-rs-25-lakh-for-kin-of-farmers-who-died-during-protests-if-sp-wins-polls-101637771544654.html

Priyanka Chaturvedi replies to ‘trolls’||As Shiv Sen leader Priyanka Chaturvedi has been voicing her concern against the government's proposed ban on cryptocurrency, Chaturvedi was trolled on Twitter as several users pointed out to her earlier tweet where she rued the fact that there is no regulatory framework or roadmap on crypto in India. While the Shiv Sena leader was asked whether she has put all her savings in crypto, Priyanka Chaturvedi made it clear that she has not invested a single rupee. "But unlike you, I do speak for lakhs of investors and not for the Government of India." Asking for regulation or regulatory framework is not similar to asking for a ban, Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote. Repeat: Not a single rupee. But unlike you, I do speak for lakhs of investors, & not be a bhopu for the GoI https://t.co/R4mewWtUYnThe government will introduce 'The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021' in the upcoming winter session of Parliament. The bill, as it has been reported, seeks to create a facilitative framework for the creation of an official digital currency that the Reserve Bank of India has been intending to do. Effectively, as experts said, all private cryptocurrencies will be banned in India."If true, this is a recipe for disaster India doesn't need. Banning all private cryptocurrencies is basically killing the space -- robbing India of creating an ecosystem for new age FinTech. Anyway, expecting any better from GOI was wishful thinking," the Sena leader tweeted on Tuesday. Quoting an opinion piece by former RBI governor D Subbarao, the Shiv Sena leader said that teh ex-RBI governor is also in favour o regulating the currency, not banning. "...do not recognise it as a legal tender but asset class - like Japan, Singapore and Britain. But no, the GOI is allergic to sound advice," she wrote.Following this, she was attacked on social media to which she replied that her concern is not personal as she has not invested any money into crypto.The news of a possible ban triggered heavy selling following which the cryptocurrency industry urged the government to take a nuanced approach towards regulating crypto assets in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-much-have-you-invested-in-crypto-priyanka-chaturvedi-replies-to-trolls-101637770241789.html

"From the last many days, we are continuously receiving reports from Congress workers, MLAs, leaders from Patiala and the media about your anti-party activities.

We are also made aware of your open announcements in the media about siding with your husband's party," party in-charge of Punjab and Chandigarh Harish Choudhary wrote to the Lok Sabha MP."Kindly explain your stand on this issue within a period of seven days. Otherwise, the party will be forced to take necessary disciplinary action," the notice said.After Amarinder Singh resigned from the chief minister's post after months of dissidence inside the party and hinted that he would quit the Congress, Preneet Kaur who represents the Patiala constituency in the Lok Sabha said she had no intention to quit the Congress at that time.However, recently she has hinted that she might join Amarinder Singh's party as she spoke at an event in Samana. "Captain Amarinder Singh has always stood by the commitment he makes. Main apne parivaar de naal haan (I am with my family)," Preneet said without giving out details of whether she has already decided to join the Punjab Lok Congress or not.In the upcoming assembly election, the fight for which has been hotting up with the AAP emerging as a bigger threat to the Congress and Amarinder Singh's party keeping the question of alliance with the BJP open, Amarinder Singh has already announced that he will be fighting the elections from Patiala, which he represented in 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017.The tussle between Amarinder and Navjot Sidhu resulted in Amarinder renouncing the chief minister's post facing heat from the party. Amarinder decided to burn all the bridges with the Congress as he said he felt humiliated by the way the party treated him. He would not join the BJP, he had made it clear. After days of speculations, he floated his own party and kept the option of tying up with the BJP open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-s-wife-accused-of-anti-party-activities-given-7-days-to-explain-101637768025881.html

24-11-2021||India||Sputnik Light Covid vaccine to be launched in India by December, says RDIF CEO||The Russian-made one-shot Sputnik Light Covid-19 vaccine will be launched in India by December, news agency ANI quoted Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) as saying.Sputnik Light vaccine is based on human adenovirus serotype 26, which is the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine. The vaccine is considered a highly effective vaccine when used both on a standalone basis and applied as a booster, according to reports.Dr. Reddy's Laboratories recently said it was in talks with India's drug regulator to sell Russia's Sputnik Light as a booster dose. India, however, at the moment is not considering authorising booster Covid-19 doses as many in the country have been naturally infected and the government believes two doses of a vaccine offers sufficient protection for now.It is not clear at the moment whether Russia's Sputnik Light Covid-19 vaccine will be administered as a booster or used on a standalone basis. India is currently administering Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V vaccine doses to its population.Sputnik light COVID vaccine to be launched in India by December: Kirill Dmitriev, CEO, Russian Direct Investment Fund pic.twitter.com/Ybjmsi6yfSMeanwhile, according to the latest findings by the Gamaleya Center based on data from 28,000 subjects in Moscow, Sputnik Light vaccine has shown 70% efficacy against infection from the Delta variant of coronavirus when administered standalone.Efficacy of one-shot Sputnik Light as a booster against Delta variant for other vaccines will be close to the efficacy against the Delta variant of the Sputnik V vaccine: over 83% against infection and over 94% against hospitalization.A one-shot vaccination regimen of Sputnik Light has a number of key advantages, including ease of administering the vaccine, monitoring and more flexible re-vaccination schedule when used as a booster.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-light-covid-vaccine-to-be-launched-in-india-by-december-says-rdif-ceo-101637764058806.html
24-11-2021||India||Assam to form panel to study encroachments in Vaishnavite monasteries||The Assam cabinet on Wednesday decided to form a high-level committee to study complaints of encroachments in Vaishnavite monasteries in the state. The meeting held in Bongaigaon (the second such meeting held outside the capital since the new government formed in May) also decided to form a youth commission to prepare young men for competitive exams, jobs and also set conditions to discourage outsiders from taking part in state civil service exams. “There have been complaints and news reports about encroachment of land belonging to ‘satras’ (Vaishnavite monasteries). But till now no government has done any survey on this issue. Now we have decided to constitute a committee to look into all aspects of the problem,” Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said after the meeting. The committee headed by former minister Pradip Hazarika will also have ruling BJP MLAs Mrinal Saikia and Rupak Sarma as members. While Hazarika will be accorded the rank of cabinet minister, Saikia and Sarma will enjoy privileges of ministers of state. The committee will have support of senior officials of revenue and land records department and submit a report within one year of formation on status of encroachments in ‘satras’. Earlier a similar committee was formed to find out about encroachment at Garukhuti in Darrang district. This followed two rounds of eviction of settlers in the area in September this year which led to clashes between police and residents resulting in deaths of two civilians and injury to 18 others. The cabinet decided to set up a youth commission to impart skills to educated youths from the state to become engineers, doctors and other skilled professionals. The aim would be to prepare youths who can compete and succeed in securing central government and defence jobs as well. “This is being done as we noticed that many students who studied in Assamese medium schools were not able to succeed in medical and engineering entrance exams or secure jobs in central government agencies. The commission will provide coaching to these students with help of reputed institutes,” said Sarma. The cabinet decided to do away with a paper on languages in the Assam Public Service Commission (APSC) exam to select candidates for various state government services. “But there will be three new conditions. All candidates will have to be residents of Assam, should have their name registered in state employment exchanges and mandatorily be able to speak Assamese, or any other language spoken in the state including Hindi, fluently. These conditions would make it difficult for prospective candidates from other states to take part in this exam,” said Sarma. In another move, the cabinet decided to allow state government employees including senior IAS and IPS officers (and event ministers) 4 days leave from January 6 to January 9 next year to spend time with their parents or in-laws. Sarma informed that Assam will remodel state education system in accordance with National Education Policy. From April 2023, schools will follow a pattern of 5+3+3+4 years of school education from kindergarten to senior secondary level. The state government has decided to commemorate the 400th birth centenary celebration of Ahom general Lachit Borphukan, which falls on November 24 next year, with yearlong celebrations and events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-form-panel-to-study-encroachments-in-vaishnavite-monasteries-101637766929571.html

Identification of others is being ascertained,” Kashmir inspector general of police Vijay Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The Resistance Front (TRF) is a terror group backed by the Lashkar-e-Taiba.In October, terrorists killed Supinder Kour, a resident of Alochi Bagh area and Deepak Chand, a resident of Jammu, at Sangam Eidgah. These attacks came as the Valley saw an uptick in the number of terrorist attacks on civilians and on non-local people, including a renowned pharmacy owner, a bhel puri seller and taxi stand worker in Srinagar.Security personnel earlier this week gunned down a district commander of terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district. The police last week gunned down two top leaders of the TRF, including Shakir Najar, a top commander of the TRF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-slain-in-j-k-encounter-killed-two-teachers-civilians-in-october-101637766213932.html
24-11-2021||India||Congress MLAs urge Thackeray to commit ₹1 lakh ex gratia for Covid victims to force Centre pay its share||Maharashtra Congress Legislature Party on Wednesday wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, urging him to commit ₹1 lakh for families of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) victims as per the norms of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) so that the central government is forced to announce its share of ₹3 lakh for each Covid death. The letter stated that the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) norms require 75% of ₹4 lakh to be paid by the central government and the remaining 25% by the state government.“We request that you commit to upholding the state government's share of ₹4 lakh as ex gratia payment so that it pressurizes the Central government to fulfil its commitment to the affected citizens,” the letter read.In September, the central government informed the Supreme Court after the repeated extension of the deadline that families of those who died of Covid-19 will receive an ex gratia of ₹ ₹50,000 from the SDRF. The compensation will be paid for future Covid-related deaths as well.Referring to the Centre’s submission to the Supreme Court, the Maharashtra CLP said the “meagre amount” is insufficient. It further stressed that the central government should implement its earlier order notified by the ministry of home affairs in March 2020 in which it “committed disbursement of ex gratia payment” of ₹4 lakh for each Covid-related fatality.The Maharashtra CLP criticised the Centre’s argument for not providing ₹4 lakh as compensation in which it had said that it would leave the government with insufficient capital to deal with Covid-19 itself.“We cannot understand how the Central government continues to collect taxes through rising fuel prices on one hand and provide discal reliefs to big corporates on the other hand and it continues to deny much-needed relief to the citizens,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mlas-urge-thackeray-to-commit-1-lakh-ex-gratia-for-covid-victims-to-force-centre-pay-its-share-101637764382578.html
24-11-2021||India||India scanning options on trade, investment with China to ensure security: Shringla||The government is carefully assessing all options to ensure that India’s trade and investment ties with China do not leave the country vulnerable in any way, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Wednesday against the backdrop of the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Normal ties in areas such as trade and technology are based on peace and tranquillity being maintained in the border areas, but the two sides have been unable to “conduct normal relations” since China adopted an “aggressive posture and attempted multiple transgressions” along the border in eastern Ladakh, Shringla said. “Trade continues, there are investment ties that continue but all of this has to be examined very carefully and the government is examining all these options very, very carefully to ensure that our integrity and security remain intact,” he said at an online interaction on the theme “Bharat@75: Empowering India” organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Shringla was responding to a question from the moderator for the event, who described China as India’s biggest foreign policy challenge and asked what could be done to address the issue. The foreign secretary said India will have to ensure it is not vulnerable in any way because of its economic and trade ties with China. “Last year...we saw that China maintained an aggressive posture and attempted multiple transgressions along our border in eastern Ladakh. That obviously was not conducive to peace and security, and as a result, we are not able to conduct normal relations,” he said. “Having said that, of course trade continues, import and export continues, China continues to be an economic partner. But obviously we need to today evaluate whether we are over-extended in terms of our supply chains, in terms of our investment tie-ups, in terms of the technology that we get,” he added. All these issues need to be carefully examined to see “that it is in keeping with our larger strategic and security interests and that obviously, as we move forward, our own economy grows, our own interactions grow”, he said. “We need to ensure that we are not vulnerable in any way. On the contrary, our growth and development can be faster and better ensured,” Shringla said. India and China have been locked in a standoff in the Ladakh sector since May last year and a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June 2020 that killed 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops has taken relations to an all-time low. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said last week ties are passing through a “particularly bad patch” and China still hasn’t given a credible explanation for massing tens of thousands of troops on the LAC. The two sides pulled back frontline troops at Pangong Lake and Gogra after several rounds of talks, but there has been no headway in disengagement at other friction points since August. India has linked the normalisation of overall ties with China to the resolution of the standoff. Soon after the standoff began, India imposed a ban on more than 200 apps owned by some of the biggest Chinese internet firms and restricted foreign direct investment from China, especially in critical sectors such as telecommunications. Shringla pointed out that India had restarted ties with China in 1988 with the objective of allowing “normal business to be conducted without the border issue coming in the way of that relationship”. “In other words, we would have trade, commercial ties, scientific and technological ties, people-to-people contacts but we would isolate the border issues that would be discussed separately through the special representatives of both countries. But of course, that was predicated on peace and tranquillity being maintained in the border areas,” he said. The rapid rise of China, both as a military and an economic power, is an issue the world is grappling with, and India is in the process of protecting its own strategic and security interests, Shringla said. “We have had several rounds of talks with China. We have resolved some of the issues but there are still some outstanding issues and until we can resolve those issues, obviously we will not be in a normal relationship mode,” he added. At their latest round of diplomatic talks on the standoff on November 18, India and China agreed to hold the next discussions between senior military commanders at an early date but were unable to make headway on the bigger issues. The meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs was held against the backdrop of growing evidence of China building infrastructure and villages in disputed sections of the border with both India and Bhutan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-scanning-options-on-trade-investment-with-china-to-ensure-security-shringla-101637762183907.html
24-11-2021||India||Cinema halls can’t sell movie tickets under new Andhra law, only govt can||HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh assembly on Wednesday passed a bill to make it mandatory for cinema halls to sell their movie tickets through a government-run online platform -- the first state in the country to take over sale of movie tickets to minimise tax evasion.The government has decided to introduce a seamless online movie booking system, on the lines of Indian Railways online ticketing system, minister for information and public relations Perni Venkatramaiah alias Nani told the assembly as he introduced the legislation on behalf of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. The assembly later unanimously passed the Andhra Pradesh Cinemas (Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2021 by a voice vote. It will be introduced in the state’s legislative council for passage on Thursday before seeking the governor’s assent.The online booking system will be run by Andhra’s state film and theatre development corporation.Perni Venkatramaiah said the government will not allow theatres to screen more than four shows a day for any film. “All these days, the exhibitors have been screening the films for six or even seven shows a day to make big money. Besides, they are collecting ₹500 to ₹1,000 on each ticket in the name of benefit shows, caring a damn for the rules and regulations,” he said.The online ticketing system run by the government will end all such activities, the minister said. The exhibitors will only screen the films on the prescribed timings and ticket prices will be completely under government control.He added that there were instances where there was no connection between a theatre’s collections and the Goods and Services Tax accruing to the state government.“Now, they producers and distributors cannot avoid payment of taxes to the government. Since the portal is managed by the state-run corporation, payment would be made to the theatres through Reserve Bank of India gateway on a day-to-day basis,” the minister added.Perni Venkatramaiah also underlined that the government-controlled ticketing system will benefit moviegoers as well. People will be able to book tickets of for their choice at any theatre by making a phone call, surfing the Internet, by sending SMS etc.The minister said it will help people get tickets without standing in long queues. “The proposed online movie booking system reduces traffic problems and pollution and helps in checking black-marketing,” the minister said.Popular Telugu film producer DVV Danaiah, whose multi-crore budget film “RRR” directed by SS Rajamouli of “Bahubali” fame, is up for release shortly, said the film industry doesn’t have any objections on the Andhra Pradesh government’s decision to take over online cinema ticketing system.“In fact, we welcome it, as it will lead to transparency in ticket sales. It will benefit both the industry as well as the government,” he said.Danayya, however, refused to comment on the government’s decision to control the number of shows to be screened in the theatres and restricting the number of the benefit shows.“We have to wait and see how the government is going to do that,” he said.Noted Telugu film critic Venkat Arikatla said the online ticketing system was going to be a complicated affair.“No doubt, it will definitely result in a transparency in the system and plug the holes in the revenue generation from films, but it is not so easy to operate the system,” he said.“The government says the portal will be operated and maintained by the AP Film and Theatre Development Corporation, but it requires huge investment, apart from technical manpower to run it. Instead, the government could have entered into a tie-up with already existing online cinema ticketing platforms line Bookmyshow.com by paying them certain fee,” Arikatla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cinema-halls-can-t-sell-movie-tickets-under-new-andhra-law-only-govt-can-101637761163871.html

The DNA test result on Tuesday showed that Anupama is the biological mother of the child. Anupama walked out with the baby boy in her arms along with her partner Ajith surrounded by activists.Anupama alleged that her parents forcibly took away her child and gave it up for adoption as he did not approve of the inter-caste couple. She said that the police showed reluctance in filing a complaint against her father. The student leader ran pillar to post trying to get her child back, who was taken away from her when it was three days old. A family court last month put a stay on the adoption process and ordered the DNA test. The test was conducted at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB).Anupama, however, said that she will continue to fight against the officials who allegedly colluded with her parents, especially her father, who is a CPI(M) leader.The baby was in the custody of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) at the Nirmala Sishu Bhavan before being presented to the court. The court posted the matter for November 30 but the hearing was preponed as the government sought to reunite the mother with the child at the earliest.Anupama alleged that the government did not want to take action against her parents despite her going to several senior leaders. The police filed a complaint against her father, S Jayachandran, a senior leader of the CPI(M) trade union wing CITU, for taking away her child and handing it over to the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare (SCCW)-run orphanage in Thiruvananthapuram in 2020.The foster parents from Andhra Pradesh who initially had the custody of the child will get top priority during the next round of adoption, officials of the CWC familiar with the developments told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adoption-row-anupama-reunited-with-her-child-101637760298808.html

"We will fight this battle until she is put behind bars for spreading hatred against Farmers and Sikhs," he tweeted a day after registering an FIR against the actor.The complainant of this particular FIR was Amarjeet Singh Sandhu, a Mumbai-based businessman who was part of the delegation of the Sikh body that submitted the complaint on Monday.

Karnataka Pradesh Youth Congress was the latest to have filed a formal complaint against Kangana over her comment.While the storm over her 'bheek' comments which the actor has been defending unwaveringly is yet to die down, she stirred a fresh controversy while reacting to the announcement of the repeal of the farm laws.

24-11-2021||India||Calcutta HC stays single bench order on CBI probe into school recruitment||A division bench of the Calcutta high court on Wednesday ordered a three-week stay on the single bench order that had asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary inquiry into alleged irregularities in the appointment of 25 group ‘D’ employees in schools run by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE). The CBI probe was ordered on Monday by Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay after he heard a petition filed by some unsuccessful applicants. The judge said that a CBI officer of the rank of deputy inspector general has to complete the preliminary probe and submit a report before the court by December 21. The West Bengal government moved the division bench of Justice Harish Tandon and Justice Rabindranath Samanta challenging the order. The division bench, while passing a stay on the CBI probe for three weeks, asked the WBBSE and the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) to submit all documents in a sealed cover to the registrar general of the Calcutta high court. The division bench said the matter will be heard again on November 29. The process to recruit around 13000 group ‘D’ staff began in 2016. The WBSSC interviewed the applicants and drew up a panel of prospective employees. The panel was valid till March 2019. The petitioners alleged that genuine applicants were deprived as ineligible people got jobs in state-run schools during the recruitment drive. They also alleged that the number of ineligible people recruited could be around 500 and many of them were inducted after the validity of the panel expired in 2019. During a hearing on November 18, the WBSSC told the single bench through an affidavit that the 50 recruitments under scanner were illegal as it did not clear these candidates or issue recommendation letters to them. The commission also sought an inquiry by a retired judge of the Calcutta high court, indirectly implying that ineligible people were recruited by the board of secondary education. The court asked the WBBSEE to file an affidavit. On Monday, Justice Gangopadhyay turned down the WBSSC’s suggestion to have an inquiry conducted by a retired judge or a panel of three retired judges of the Calcutta high court. In his order, Justice Gangopadhyay said, “CBI should also enquire a very important part of this serious illegality and irregularity as to whether there is any money trail in issuance of such recommendation letters and subsequent issuance of appointments letters.”While ordering a stay on the CBI probe, the division asked senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who represented the petitioners, whether he would prefer an investigation by a retired judge of the court. Bhattacharya said the petitioners would want it. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government of indulging in widespread corruption and depriving jobless youths of the state. After the division bench passed its order on Wednesday, the student and youth fronts of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), staged a massive demonstration outside the office of the WBSSC in Salt Lake demanding resignation of education minister Bratya Basu and top officials of the WBBSE and WBSSC. The youth activists blocked roads and broke through police barricades. Several of them were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-stays-single-bench-order-on-cbi-probe-into-school-recruitment-101637752763561.html

Confronted by the public over the issue of bad roads, the new minister promised roads as smooth as the cheeks of Bollywood actor Katrina Kaif. People listening to the minister clap and burst into laughter. Reports said the minister was addressing officers and first referred to Hema Malini, BJP MP. Then he reportedly commented that Hema Malini has become old now and then chose Katrina Kaif's cheeks instead to be the standard for roads.Watch video #WATCH | "Roads should be made like Katrina Kaif's cheeks", said Rajasthan Minister Rajendra Singh Gudha while addressing a public gathering in Jhunjhunu district (23.11) pic.twitter.com/87JfD5cJxVWhile such a sexist and controversial comment coming from a politician is nothing new, there have been exactly similar instances of politicians aspiring for roads as smooth as Hema Malini's cheeks. Years ago, Lalu Prasad Yadav had made a similar comment involving Hema Malini, which was emulated by a UP minister of Akhilesh Yadav Cabinet, Rajaram Pandey. Of later, in 2019, Congress leader PC Sharma invited criticism when he had said the Congress government will make Madhya Pradesh roads as smooth as Hema Malini's cheeks. Going a step further, Sharma said the condition of the roads at that time was like the cheeks of BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya.According to reports, Hema Malini too, in past, reacted to her cheeks being brought into political discourse so often. “It so happened that I was travelling from Patna to Nalanda for a show. The roads were so bad that I got delayed in reaching the venue. When I expressed my displeasure about the road conditions Laluji promised to make the roads as smooth as my cheeks. Why my cheeks? If politicians continue to bring in my cheeks as references to roads, my cheeks may soon begin to resemble those bumpy roads that are never smooth in spite of the promises," Hema Malini had commented earlier summarising what made Lalu comment on her cheeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/road-as-smooth-as-katrina-kaif-s-cheeks-says-rajasthan-minister-people-clap-and-laugh-101637751007455.html

Sawant said the auctions were likely to take place in December and besides the State Bank of India, the Mineral Exploration Corporation Limited (MECL) was helping in identifying the leases to be auctioned. “The cabinet has given approval to MECL for assessment of mineral ore for phase one of the auction. We are auctioning around six to eight blocks. ...they are exploring which blocks will be eventually selected. After that auctioning will be conducted by the State Bank of India,” Sawant told reporters.Iron Ore mining in Goa has remained suspended since March 16, 2018 after 88 mining leases renewed by the Goa government across 2014-15 were rendered defunct and cancelled by a Supreme Court order in February 2018. The mining industry was a major revenue and employment generator for the state and at its peak contributed close to 15% of the state’s GDP. The state is now eager to restart mining ahead of the upcoming assembly polls by holding fresh auction process (that includes obtaining fresh environmental clearances) as per the directions of the apex court after its several attempts to challenge or circumvent court order did not yield desired results.Also Read: PM Modi to perform bhoomi pujan of Jewar airport as BJP sets tone for UP pollsSawant didn’t specify which leases will be auctioned and whether they were fresh or among those operational before the Supreme Court order in February 2018 invalidatedmining leases. “The MEPL has already started exploration of mining leases to deduce the quantum of below-surface mineral deposits. Our auctioning procedure will be completed before December 15. Auction will be carried out through the corporation (Goa Mineral Development Corporation), but we will take SBI on board too,” Sawant added.Goa government had earlier considered undoing the Supreme Court order through an act of Parliament but the idea was rejected by the Central government. Finally, when the state government’s review appeal was rejected by the top court earlier this year, CM Sawant announced the setting up of a mining corporation to restart mining. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-ropes-in-sbi-for-fresh-auctions-of-mining-leases-before-assembly-polls-101637750483234.html

Maharashtra too has been facing the same issue, he said. The NCP chief alleged that the BJP government had set an example on how to misuse power before the country. He said that he would be meeting West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the next three-four days as she is likely to visit Mumbai soon.“It is not new for us (opposition parties). Around six to seven ministers from Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet were facing investigations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The BJP-led central government has adopted a policy to trouble the governments of non-BJP ruled states and misuse power. The same is happening here in Maharashtra but there is no need to worry about it. Let them carry out all their probes; they will not get anything. However, they have set an example on how to misuse power before the country,” Pawar said attacking the Narendra Modi led BJP government. Opposition parties have been calling the investigations by central agencies such as Enforcement Directorate and CBI into various allegations of corruption as political vendetta. Pawar was responding to the allegations by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders that they were being targeted by the central investigation agencies.“I will be meeting Mamata Banerjee in the next three-four days as she is expected to visit Mumbai,” he added.Pawar said that the MVA government can be re-elected if all the three parties — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — decide to contest the polls together in 2024. “This (MVA) government will complete its tenure of five years and if all the three parties decide to contest the 2024 assembly polls together then it will again be re-elected,” he said.Commenting on the Prime Minister’s announcement that the Centre would repeal all the three contentious farm laws, Pawar said they would not have taken the decision if there were no assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and other neighbouring states. “The ruling (BJP) leaders faced a different sort of welcome in recent days when they visited Haryana, some parts of UP and Punjab. This has become a cause for concern as assembly polls are scheduled in these states. The Central government would not have taken the decision if there were no assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and other states,” he reiterated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-adopted-ways-to-misuse-power-and-harass-states-alleges-sharad-pawar-101637750183297.html

Indians are currently flying under bilateral air bubble arrangements that allow passengers of two countries to fly with restrictions in place. India has air bubble pacts with around 28 countries, including the US, Britain, the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan and France. Minister of civil aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia last week said the ministry was evaluating the process of restarting international flights with passenger traffic returning towards normalcy.

On the domestic front, passenger traffic for flights in February 2020 - which was during pre-pandemic times - was around 400,000 per day. Bansal said the country has already started seeing daily passenger traffic of nearly 400,000 for domestic flights. “The current daily domestic passengers are between 380,000 and 398,000.

Singh said that the deaths of 700 farmers could have been prevented had the farm laws been withdrawn by the Union government within a month since the farmers launched their agitation."Over 700 farmers would not have died if the three agricultural laws were withdrawn within 30 days of the farmers' agitation. This decision to repeal the laws is a sign of happiness on one hand and 'late latifi' (a late act) on the other," news agency PTI quoted Singh as telling reporters on Tuesday evening.Singh further demanded that the government pay a compensation of at least ₹50 lakh to the next of kin of farmers who lost their lives during the protest, alongside providing employment to a member of their families."In case the dependents of the deceased farmers are illiterate, the Centre should grant such families a monthly honorarium of ₹20,000," PTI further quoted him as saying.In case of a minor dependent, the government should bear their education expenses, the BJP leader suggested, adding that dependent widows of deceased farmers be paid a monthly pension of ₹25,000.Notably, this is not the first time the BJP leader spoke in favour of the farmers. Earlier, the leader urged the government to bring a law guaranteeing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers' produce. He also said that the farmers' agitation would not have taken place had the government consulted them before the laws were enacted.Singh, who is also an executive committee member of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, took a jibe at Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut, calling her "manchali" (crazy) for her remarks on the country's Independence. Kangana Ranaut stoked a controversy recently after she said India's Independence in 1947 was "bheek" (alms) and that real freedom was attained in 2014."The government should invoke the National Security Act against her," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deaths-of-700-farmers-could-ve-been-prevented-had-bjp-leader-slams-centre-101637747582116.html

The Cabinet has also decided to extend the government's foodgrain scheme, introduced during the pandemic, till March 2022. "In the upcoming Winter Session, the priority will be to take up these bills," the minister said on farm laws. The process will commence from the very first day of the winter session of Parliament, the minister said adding that Prime Minister's promise on November 19 has been fulfilled within five days of the announcement. “Many journalists were saying that the issue was not even on today's agenda.

Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh told news agency ANI that the two leaders held strategic discussions on common issues of Uttar Pradesh in a bid to get rid of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.While Singh didn’t give explicit confirmation on the alliance, he hinted that the two parties are heading towards the same. After an hour-long meeting with Akhilesh Yadav at the Lohia Trust office in Lucknow, the AAP leader said there has not been any discussion on the seat-sharing formula and they will provide information if there they arrive at any decision regarding the alliance.“I met Akhilesh Yadav.

24-11-2021||India||Regular international flights to resume by 2021-end: Govt||The civil aviation ministry on Wednesday said that India will resume regular international flights, which have remained suspended owing to the Covid pandemic, towards the end of the year. The government has been allowing commercial international flights on a case-to-case basis.Recently, civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said the government is keen to resume normal international travel operations and is evaluating the process. “We are evaluating the process. We are coming back to normalcy. First, we allowed 100% passenger capacity in our domestic flights and now we allowed in-flight meals in those flights," Scindia said at the Confederation of Indian Industry’s (CII’s) Global Economy Policy Summit.The announcement comes as a major relief to the aviation industry as well as the tourism industry both of which have seen major losses due to Covid-19 and still continue to face challenges as infections continue to rise rapidly in some parts of the world. The recent rise of cases in Europe will also adversely affect the tourism industry as governments impose restrictions.Earlier, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) extended the ban on scheduled international commercial passenger flights until November 30 allowing only international scheduled flights on selected routes by the competent authority on a case to case basis and allowing cargo flights.Experts still feel that India’s aviation industry is not yet out of the woods as tourism is yet to regain its pre-pandemic levels. Air Vistara earlier this month said the prolonged suspension of scheduled international flights to and from India is hurting the financial prospects of most airlines.“A prolonged suspension of scheduled international operations is definitely impacting the financial health of most airlines, thereby adding to the pressure (on the revenue),” Vistara CEO-designate Vinod Kannan was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He said the situation is still unpredictable and dynamic.Following the fall in the number of cases, domestic passenger traffic has risen and airports across India’s major cities also saw a rise in footfall. Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) saw a four-fold growth in passenger traffic in August. Civil aviation secretary Rajeev Bansal says that the government is expecting domestic passenger traffic to go back to pre-Covid levels starting April 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/regular-international-flights-to-resume-by-2021-end-govt-101637745804531.html

The conversation took place at an event to mark the death anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. As it seems from the conversation, Shivakumar said though Indira Gandhi's death anniversary and Sardar Patel's birth anniversary fall on the same day, the Congress never puts up a portrait of Patel. As Siddaramaiah cautions that this will become a controversial and an advantage point for the BJP, Shivakumar orders a staff to get a photo of Sardar Patel. If anyone had doubt how much the Nehru Dynasty hated Sardar Patel, this video clears it.CONgress leaders @siddaramaiah & @DKShivakumar agree to place photo of Sardar Patel along with that of Indira Gandhi fearing BJP.It is a shame that Slaves are so much scared of an Italian. pic.twitter.com/ZiO3pUegGuCong leaders caught on tape ‘linking Shivakumar to graft’Sharing the video, in which the two Congress leaders can be seen engaged in a conversation over Sardar Patel's photo being missing, BJP leader CT Ravi wrote, "If anyone had doubt how much the Nehru Dynasty hated Sardar Patel, this video clears it.

The authenticity of the purported video has not been independently verified by HT.What is the conversation about? As reported by news agency ANI, Siddaramaiah raises the point that there is no photo of Sardar Patel. He also says that the BJP will criticise this and "will take advantage" if Sardar Patel's photograph is not put up."We never keep Patel's picture on the day," Shivakumar says. However, Sardar Patel's photo is put up on Shivakumar's instruction.This is not the first time that a video faux pas has taken place in Karnataka Congress. In October, two Karnataka Congress leaders were caught on tape purportedly linking Shivakumar to allegations of corruption, being unaware that the microphones were on and they were audible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scared-of-an-italian-bjp-on-shivakumar-siddaramaiah-leaked-conversation-over-sardar-patel-s-photo-101637743428084.html

According to those familiar with the development, the official brief for the Cabinet meeting will be provided by Union minister Anurag Thakur at the National Media Centre in New Delhi later on in the day.The official nod to the proposal to withdraw the farm laws, which were passed by Parliament in September last year, comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement to scrap the contentious pieces of legislation. In a televised address on Gurpurab, the Prime Minister had said that his government will be repealing the agriculture laws; he had also personally apologised to the people of the country and acknowledged that there was a “deficiency” in attempts to convince the farmers.The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, will now be introduced in the Lok Sabha for passage in the upcoming winter session of Parliament beginning on November 29. The agriculture ministry is deliberating on the exact dates to discuss the three laws in the forthcoming Parliament session, informed Union minister Prahlad Joshi a day ago.The bill – which has been listed for introduction and passage among the 26 new bills on the agenda of the government – seeks to repeal the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act provides for setting up a mechanism allowing the farmers to sell their farm produce outside the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). Any license-holder trader can buy the produce from the farmers at mutually agreed prices. This trade of farm produces will be free of mandi tax imposed by the state governments.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act allows farmers to do contract farming and market their produces freely.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act is an amendment to the existing Essential Commodities Act.The repeal of these three legislations has been one of the key demands of around 40 farmer unions protesting against these reforms for nearly a year now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-cabinet-approves-bill-to-repeal-three-contentious-farm-laws-101637741446277.html

According to Uttar Pradesh government, the ceremony will take place at 1pm.The airport is being developed by Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), a 100 per cent subsidiary of the project's Swiss concessionaire Zurich International Airport AG. The airport is being developed under the PPP model in close partnership with the government of Uttar Pradesh and the government of India.The UP government has touted the airport to be the logistics gateway for North India. Owing to its scale and capacity, the Noida International Airport will prove to be a game-changer for the state, the government said.It is among the significant promises made by the Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, which is eyeing a return to power in Uttar Pradesh in next year's assembly elections. The chief minister announced on Tuesday that it will be completed by 2024 - before the next General Elections are held."We are going to lay the foundation stone for this project that will benefit entire UP, particularly Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Hapur and other adjoining areas," he said on Tuesday. The chief minister is personally monitoring the arrangements for PM Modi's visit.“Noida international airport will be completed as per the scheduled deadline of 2024 and create huge employment opportunities in the state, thereby changing the business dynamics of this region,” he added.The airport is spread over more than 1300 hectares of land, and the completed first phase of the airport will have a capacity to serve around 1.2 crore passengers a year.Though the elections will be held in five states next year, Uttar Pradesh is being considered as politically most significant for the BJP. The poll schedule is likely to be announced by the Election Commission in January.The ministers of the Narendra Modi government are regularly visiting the state and interacting with the people through the foundation stone laying ceremonies and inauguration of various projects.Earlier this month, PM Modi visited Sultanpur where he inaugurated the Purvanchal Expressway. Later, he visited Mahoba and Jhansi for the event. He also participated in the DGPs' conference in Lucknow.The BJP has already appointed the election in-charge and election co-in-charge. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Anurag Thakur, and four other members have been assigned the responsibilities. Arjun Ram Meghwal, Shobha Karandlaje, Annapurna Devi, and party General Secretary Saroj Pandey, former Haryana minister Captain Abhimanyu, and Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Thakur have been made co-incharge.The BJP is facing challenge from the opposition parties, especially the Samajwadi Party (SP), which claims the Adityanath government is taking credit for schemes launched by the previous dispensations.A former minister in the previous SP government, Abhishek Mishra has said that the BJP has known that they are not going to form the government in the elections. He further claimed that his party will form the government with the full majority.In fact, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has claimed that his party will win 400 of the 403 seats in UP Assembly.The leaders of Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) claim that its voters are silent and will show the magic during voting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-perform-bhoomi-pujan-of-jewar-airport-as-bjp-sets-tone-for-up-polls-101637739738711.html

24-11-2021||India||Action ordered against ‘conversion’ of tribals in Madhya Pradesh’s Jhabua||Authorities in Madhya Pradesh’s Jhabua district have directed action against the alleged conversion of tribals to Christianity at prayer meetings without permission from the administration after Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) demanded a ban on such gatherings.This comes even as Christian organisations have accused the administration of supporting VHP, harassing the community and forcing many of them to cancel Sunday prayer meetings for a month now under pressure from groups allied with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).In an order, sub-divisional magistrate Anil Bhana cited demand number two of VHP functionary Kamal Maharaj’s memorandum and added there is a complete ban on “mass conversion” of tribals to Christianity without permission of the district magistrate in the scheduled area. “...so if any such event takes place under your jurisdiction, then take necessary action immediately,” he said. Maharaj submitted the memorandum to the district collector over a week back.VHP, an affiliate of BJP’s ideological fountainhead Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh, has been campaigning in Jhabua against the alleged “illegal conversion” of tribals.Maharaj said earlier they did not have any way to check the “illegal conversion.” He added after the anti-conversion law was passed this year in Madhya Pradesh, they were confident of a ban on them. “We are holding a campaign and also seeking the support of district administration to stop the illegal conversion.”Madhya Pradesh is among the BJP-ruled states that have criminalised what they call forced religious conversion. Critics of the legislation say they are being misused to target minorities.Also Read: Court says oral sex not ‘aggravated sexual assault’, cuts jail term of accusedBhana maintained his order is just a reminder of the rules and it has nothing to do with VHP.Father Maria Stephen, the public relations officer of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bhopal, accused the administration and VHP of harassing members of the Christian community. “For the past one month, many have cancelled Sunday prayer meets as the members of the saffron organisation (VHP) are creating a ruckus by levelling false charges of conversion,” he said. “Our members are facing atrocities but instead of providing protection, the administration is supporting the organisation.”Jhabua district collector Somesh Mishra said the order has been issued against illegal conversion as per the anti-conversion law. “There is no ban on organising prayer meetings. If someone has any issue or members of the Christian community are feeling unsafe, they can file a complaint. As of now, we have not received any complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/action-ordered-against-conversion-of-tribals-in-mp-christian-groups-allege-harassment-101637739142375.html

24-11-2021||India||Third dose of vaccine not needed in India yet: AIIMS chief on booster shots||Randeep Guleria, the director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, said on Tuesday said that no booster dose for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is required in the country right now. Hailing the ongoing nationwide vaccination drive against the infectious disease, Guleria also acknowledged how India has come a long way in vaccine manufacturing – from importing shots to now taking the lead in exporting doses to other countries.“There is no surge of Covid-19 cases as of now,” the ANI news agency quoted Guleria, who was speaking at a book launch event. “So, there is no need for a booster dose in India for now.”The book, titled ‘Going Viral’, has been authored by Professor Balram Bhargava, and it captures the first-hand experiences of scientists who developed Covaxin, India's first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine.Guleria, who was present at the book launch event as a special guest, said, “When H1N1 had hit India, vaccines were imported from foreign countries. From importing vaccines to manufacturing our own indigenous vaccine, we have come a long way. Today, our Covid-19 vaccines are being exported to other countries.” VK Paul, a member of NITI Aayog also present at the book launch event, added that a decision on the ‘third dose' (booster shot), if necessary, will be decided based on science and studies are currently ongoing on this matter.“There are studies being done,” he was quoted as saying. “We are going through the data and research work is in progress.”One should understand, for many countries, booster doses are provided when the country vaccinates citizens with both doses to their fullest. First, let us focus on finishing the task of vaccinating people with both doses. I believe that booster doses should be administered when the studies based on science say so," he added.Speaking on the current situation of Covid-19 in the country, Paul warned that the pandemic is not over yet and will not likely be over in the near future. “It might become an endemic instead of a pandemic, or could be a pandemic in a pandemic,” he said. “The virus might take a different shape but India is ready to deal with the situation. We are in a better situation now.” (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-dose-of-vaccine-not-needed-in-india-yet-aiims-chief-on-booster-shots-101637732796195.html

The order added the offence falls under the category of “penetrative sexual assault” and is punishable under Section 4 of POCSO Act.
24-11-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee to meet PM Modi at 5pm today, here's what's on agenda||Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is currently in Delhi, will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 5pm on Wednesday. Before that, she will meet Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Subramanian Swamy; the meeting is at 3.30pm.This is Banerjee’s second visit to the national capital following her party’s thumping victory in the West Bengal Assembly elections 2021 and helped her become the chief minister of the eastern state for the third time in a row. It is also her first visit to Delhi after she swept the Bhabanipur bypolls held on September 30 defeating closest rival BJP’s Priyanka Tibrewal to retain her chief ministerial position.Her trip to the capital comes at a time when the Bengal CM is at a political high with a string of political leaders from various parties, including Congress and BJP, have joined the TMC. Most of the induction happened in Bengal wherein many prominent saffron party leaders, including former national vice-president Mukul Roy and Union cabinet minister Babul Supriyo joined the TMC camp. Furthermore, the TMC also made a landslide victory in the recently concluded bypolls by wresting control in Dinhata and Santipur constituencies that were earlier won by the BJP, and retained the other two in Khardaha and Gosaba. With this, the saffron party’s strength in the West Bengal Assembly went down to 70 from its original 77, while Banerjee’s camp rose to 217 from 215.Banerjee has lately been ramping up efforts to strengthen her party’s presence in Tripura and Goa – both poll-bound states.The Bengal CM’s visit to Delhi is seen as her continued efforts to assemble the Opposition to defeat the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.However, what remains to be noted regarding the meeting between PM Modi and Banerjee is their discussion about the Border Security Force (BSF) jurisdiction issue, which has heated up the tension between Bengal’s ruling party and the Centre.Also Read | No meeting between Sonia, Mamata amid tension between Congress and TMCPrior to her visit to Delhi, Banerjee on Monday told media persons that the issue will comprise the discussions between her and PM Modi. “I…have an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi…regarding the BSF issue and other development issues of Bengal,” she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The West Bengal legislative assembly on November 16 passed a resolution against the Centre’s decision to extend the BSF jurisdiction from 15km to 50km on the international border of the state. It became the second border state after Punjab to pass such a resolution.The central government-led by the BJP amended the BSF Act to increase the central force’s jurisdiction to 50km in West Bengal, Punjab and Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-to-meet-pm-modi-at-5pm-today-here-s-what-s-on-agenda-101637735395411.html
24-11-2021||India||HTLS 2021: Order or disorder in new world?||It has been said that two dangers constantly threaten the world order: order and disorder. We are at the cusp of rapid global transformation. The new world order will not be an act of choice, but an inevitable fait accompli.Consider four dominant transformational changes: The pandemic; the multiple dimensions of the climate crisis; far reaching technological challenges; and geopolitical conflicts that threaten the whole world. While the first three are not acts of choice but inevitable consequences of both anthropogenic behaviours and technological breakthroughs, the fourth, of recent origin, is the result of behavioural changes contrary to expectations.It is now increasingly evident that this is not the first pandemic that mankind has faced. It would be naive to believe it would be the last. While the origins of the pandemic remain opaque, there is now increasing evidence based on declassified US intelligence reports on Covid-19 that while both natural transmission and lab leak theories remain plausible, it may have also involved the handling of animals that could be coronavirus carriers. The debate on the issue of did the virus jump from bats arises because “75% of new infectious diseases over time have come to us from animals”.Apart from this, the recently concluded COP26 has accepted that anthropogenic behaviour is an important contributor to multiple aspects of climate change. The sceptics have either accepted defeat or receded in the background. Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented a laudable five-point agenda for the climate crisis entitled “panchamrit” at the conference. These are to raise India’s non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, to meet 50% of power requirements using renewable energy, and to reduce the carbon intensity to less than 45%, with India achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.What is undoubtedly extraordinary is the speed with which the global scientific community responded to the pandemic in harnessing technology for the production of vaccines in record time. Innovation driven by scientific excellence that mankind has achieved is a harbinger of the new global order.Institutions of global governance were created in good faith. Over time, the virus of dominance by the few creators corroded their credibility. What is worse is that the entry of China promoted and fostered by the developed powers in the belief of a peaceful rise has impaired the objectivity of many of these institutions. However, the global society cannot overlook these developments.What binds these four aspects overriding change is to reinvent a new architecture of global governance. It entails a fundamental restructuring of the institutions of global governance that is contemporary.Consider the following. First and foremost, the most overarching institution of global governance is the United Nations. The UN has undoubtedly undergone phases of reforms since its foundation in 1945. It has sought to respond to peacekeeping measures and developmental challenges, even as the organisation in the post-decolonisation era has become more broad-based.The existential question of empowering the UN remains divided between those who recognise that this is no more than a high-level interactive forum and others who would like to make this into a full-fledged world body.One of the under-addressed challenges is Asia’s inadequate representation in the UN Security Council, which many have argued seriously threatens its legitimacies. The only way it can play an increasingly important role is to recognise that both political and economic power structures have undergone fundamental changes since its inception. To this end, Jeffrey Sachs suggested to add four Asian seats, namely, one permanent seat for India, one shared by Japan and South Korea, one for the Asean countries, and the fourth to rotate among other Asian countries. It is somewhat ironic that India, which would soon become the world’s most populous country, does not have a permanent seat in this key decision-making body. Whatever be the decision, the current situation is untenable by permitting veto rights to the new dominant power in Asia.While going beyond COP26, we certainly need a new entity like the UN Environmental Organisation (UNEO), which was suggested in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change as early as February 2007. We also need an international convention on technology, its opportunities and minimizing misuse by aberrant member states.Secondly, the Bretton-Woods institutions created in 1944 – the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund – need reinvigoration and a new focus based on current needs. These inter alia would include a review of quotas based on financial contribution through obscurantist practices like Single Country Borrower Limit or the limited use of Article IV Consultation with the IMF both in anticipating and addressing international crises as they emerge. These institutions as well as other regional banks must mainstream the need for climate finance in innovative ways both by way of direct lending and mitigating risks to incentivise and garner necessary capital flows. It seems to me that a new Bretton-Woods conference could also be convened with a new nomenclature to review the intellectual basis of these institutions through fundamental reforms of institutional governance.Third, the IMF itself as the principal arbitrator in the management of global monetary systems must have a coherent response to the emerging challenges of cryptocurrency. Many believe this would create multiplicity of banking systems and security exchanges as well as uncertainties for nations to manage their monetary and fiscal policy with coherence. The possibility of misusing the inevitable technological changes arising from cryptocurrencies needs to be addressed in a responsible manner.The fourth issue is the emergence of newer technologies, particularly 5G and artificial intelligence. The recent details on what AI can do by way of allowing nations to use hypersonic means to assert their technological prowess is only one example. How do we harness unthinkable changes in technology and equally rein them in? We must respect the sovereignty of nations, privacy to individual rights and the nature of international arrangements.Finally, the Old World Order through which we are transiting accommodated the aspirations of Asia and dealt with the period of decolonisation but remained a cosy compact of North Atlantic powers of the US and Europe. The emergence of China has serious geopolitical implications, not only for Asia, but, given its technological and financial prowess, for the stability of the overall system of social order.The New World Order will not be based on philanthropy. Enlightened self-interest is difficult to harness, but modalities not only of consensus in which there would be, hopefully, a willing relinquishment of individual and national sovereignties for overall global good. The task is daunting but inescapable.(NK Singh is chairman of the 15th finance commission and president of the Institute of Economic Growth)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/htls/htls-2021-order-or-disorder-in-new-world-101637734101791.html
24-11-2021||India||Health min asks states with increasing case positivity to ramp up Covid testing||The Union health ministry has cited a decline in weekly Covid-19 testing rates and directed 11 states and two Union territories to increase tests to avoid missing infections.“While there has been a significant decline in the new cases with 10,195, average daily cases reported in the week ending 22nd November, it has been observed that there has also been a decline in weekly testing rates,” wrote Union health and family welfare secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday to these states and territories.The states and territories directed to increase the testing are Nagaland, Sikkim, Maharashtra, Kerala, Goa, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir, and LadakhThe letter said in the absence of sustained levels of sufficient testing, it is very difficult to determine the true level of infection spread. “With a majority of countries seeing multiple surges in Covid cases in recent times and a few developed countries facing even fourth and fifth wave despite high levels of Covid vaccination, there is a need for continued vigil given the unpredictable and contagious nature of the disease…”The ministry sought all efforts to preserve the gains made so far and to prevent deterioration of the Covid-19 scenario across the country as the pandemic was not yet over.Also Read: India sees spike in daily Covid toll with 437 new deaths; Kerala adds the mostIn a letter to Nagaland, which HT has accessed, the ministry warned against rising case positivity in certain districts, attributing it to, among other things, fall in Covid-19 testing. “Nagaland has reported 342 average daily tests as on week ending 22nd November. This is in stark contrast to a high of 1,250 average daily tests conducted in the week of 23- 29th August. It is also worrying to note that the state has recorded a positivity of 1.5% in the week ending 22nd November, having stagnated over the past 4 weeks, with an abysmally low share of RT-PCR tests. i.e.,8.2%,” it said. “Further, worrying trends with regards to tests, tests per million, positivity rate and higher dependence on Rapid Antigen tests have been observed in various districts of the State… The positivity in districts such as Mokukchong and Peren has been above 2.5%, with RT-PCR share falling below a decent proportion of the total tests.”The Centre has asked states to maintain high testing considering the increase in travelling due to weddings, festivals, and vacations. It added a decrease in testing would make it difficult to know the actual infection spread.The ministry has also directed the states to closely monitor the prevalence of respiratory distress symptoms, influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection with the onset of winter and increased pollution in some states. It added tests should be conducted regularly for timely identifying actual Covid-19 cases. The ministry asked the states to keep a watch on the clustering of cases for early identification and containment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-asks-states-with-increasing-case-positivity-to-ramp-up-covid-testing-101637734282005.html

We were accused of keeping the roads blocked. We did not block the road. Blocking the roads is not our movement. Perhaps, our movement is to talk to the government.

The Union cabinet is expected to take up the farm law repeal bill for clearance today and it is likely to be tabled in the winter session of Parliament.Meanwhile, Tikait also announced that at least a thousand people will head to the Parliament to press for the MSP law among other issues."We are awaiting the government's response on MSP. Moreover, the incidents that happened in the past one year, in which 750 farmers died, the government should take responsibility for that," the BKU leader told ANI.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions, that have been at the forefront of the year-long protests, in an official statement said that tractor rallies will also be organised in state capitals distant from Delhi."Preparations are underway for marking November 26, 2021, on the completion of 12 long and continuous months of struggle by lakhs of farmers in India - Thousands of farmers are expected to come to the morcha sites on that day around Delhi," SKM noted, adding that the day will also be celebrated as a “partial victory” of their movement."Solidarity events" are also being planned across the world by the Indian diaspora as well as international farmers' organisations, SKM informed.Parliament's winter session will commence on November 29 and is expected to continue till December 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-tractors-1-000-people-will-head-to-parliament-on-november-29-rakesh-tikait-101637729292851.html

The bench highlighted that a loan waiver scheme is also in pursuance of the Directive Principles of State Policy.“The impugned loan waiver scheme is, in essence, a social policy in pursuance of the Directive Principles of State Policy, introduced with an object to eliminate inequality in status, income, and facilities... The objective of promoting the welfare of the farmers as a class to secure economic and social justice is well recognised by Article 38,” said the court.Article 38 says the state shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic, and political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life.Also Read: Farm laws repeal: Cabinet approval likely today, bill listed for winter sessionApproving the Tamil Nadu government’s scheme, the bench noted the 2016 loan waiver scheme for farmers owning land up to five acres was introduced with an endeavour to bring substantive equality in society by using affirmative action to uplift the socially and economically weaker sections.“Due to the distinct degree of harm suffered by the small and marginal farmers as compared to other farmers, it is justifiable that the benefit of the scheme is only provided to a specified class as small and marginal farmers constitute a class in themselves,” said the court.It held the classification based on the extent of landholding had a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved through the scheme which kept farmers with big landholdings out of its purview. “The classification based on the extent of landholding is not arbitrary since owing to the inherent disadvantaged status of the small and marginal farmers, the impact of climate change or other external forces is unequal.”The court set aside the 2017 Madras high court’s judgment, which directed the state government to extend the benefit of the scheme also to the big farmers.Allowing a petition by the National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturists Association, the high court held the grant of loan waivers only to small and marginal farmers to be arbitrary and directed the state government to grant the same benefit to all farmers irrespective of the extent of landholding.The top court overturned this judgment, finding substance in the state’s policy of drawing a distinction between classes of farmers based on their landholdings.“Small and marginal farmers are resource deficient; they do not have borewells to overcome the drought. These farmers are usually dependent on large farms to access land, water, inputs, credit, technology, and markets,” said the bench.It referred to a 2019 report of the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation that showed that households having lands less than 0.01 hectare use 93.1% of the agricultural loans for non-agricultural purposes. “In sharp contrast, a household that owns 10 hectares of land only uses 17.1 percentage of the agricultural loan for non-agricultural purposes. This depicts the poverty that envelops the class of small and marginal farmers,” said the bench.It also cited statistics on the percentage distribution of the indebted agricultural households which depicted that 27% of the households that hold between 0.01- 040 hectares of land; 34% of those who hold between 0.40-1 hectare and 20% of those who hold between 1-2 acres are indebted. “On the other hand, only 4.5% of those who hold 4-10 hectares and 0.6% of those who hold 10 plus hectares are indebted,” said the bench.It also quashed the high court’s observation that the loan waiver scheme was constitutionally suspect also because it was in pursuance of an electoral promise made by All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam before the 2016 assembly polls.“It is settled law that a scheme cannot be held to be constitutionally suspect merely because it was based on an electoral promise. A scheme can be held suspect only within the contours of the Constitution, irrespective of the intent with which the scheme was introduced. The scheme propounded by the state of Tamil Nadu passes muster against the constitutional challenge,” said the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loan-waiver-schemes-for-small-farmers-are-tools-of-economic-social-justice-sc-101637727261222.html

24-11-2021||India||Opposition played with sentiments of farmers: BJP’s Dushyant Gautam on farm laws||The three farm laws that are now being repealed had encapsulated all the demands and proposals made over the past two decades in order to improve the lives of the country’s farmers, Dushyant Gautam, the national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) insisted on Tuesday. He blamed the Opposition parties for creating unrest among farmers and politicising the laws, saying they would have ushered in long-pending reforms. “They played with the sentiments of farmers, they spoilt the amity between communities, and they used this as an opportunity to play politics. Whatever had been said by the Congress in their manifesto and about contract farming was included in these laws. Yet, they indulged in khilwad (messing things up) and rajneeti (politics),” Gautam told HT. Also Read: Farm laws repeal: Cabinet approval likely today, bill listed for winter sessionThe union government had been under pressure from a section of farmers to withdraw the three contentious laws that were passed in Parliament last year. Ensuing protests by farmers against the three laws threatened to cast a shadow on the BJP’s electoral fortunes in the forthcoming assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Gautam, who is also in charge of Punjab, said the government was mindful of not letting a situation emerge that would allow the issue to snowball into a fight between Sikhs and other communities. “Whenever we went to talk to the people and explain the bills, we were told that the bills are good but they (protesters) should be removed from the border (protest sites). It seems we could not deal with the strictness with which we should have dealt with the protests,” he said. Gautam said strict action was not taken by the government because it didn’t want to see any untoward incident that the Opposition could then take advantage of. “We did not want to break them. We wanted to keep society together,” he said. While the Opposition dubbed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the farm laws as a victory for the protesting farmers, the BJP claims the farmers were instigated to oppose what the party saw were beneficial laws enacted in good faith. “The Opposition tried to present events in different light… They tried to discredit the government. We thought this decision was the only solution to escape this, especially since those for whom these laws were drafted were not with us. It was important to save the country,” Gautam said. On the Opposition’s allegations that the union government was reluctant to send the farm bills to select committees for scrutiny, Gautam said, “They only know how to divert from the issues at hand… had they wanted solutions, they wouldn’t have waited so long to punish the accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom, or for the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, or taking the names of the blacklist (comprising names of Sikhs and foreign nationals listed for alleged anti-India activities who were barred from seeking visas).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-played-with-sentiments-of-farmers-bjp-s-dushyant-gautam-on-farm-laws-101637724380975.html

It is expected that issues pertaining to the Border Security Force (BSF) and the development of the state will come up during discussions during Mamata's visit to Delhi.Briefing the media in Kolkata on Monday, Banerjee said, “I am going to Delhi today as I have an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the day after tomorrow, regarding the BSF issue and other development issues of Bengal.”Mamata Banerjee will stay in the national capital till November 25.Banerjee's visit to the capital is taking place days ahead of the winter session of Parliament which is scheduled to begin on November 29.Former JD(U) Rajya Sabha MP Pavan Varma and Congress leader Kirti Azad and Ashok Tanwar joined Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the presence of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday.The BSF, which was only empowered to take action up to fifteen kilometers in the states of Punjab, West Bengal, and Assam, has now been authorised to extend its jurisdiction up to 50km without any hurdle or permission either from central or state governments.Banerjee opposed the move as in October she said that the West Bengal government, like the Punjab government, is also protesting against the Centre's decision to increase search and arrest jurisdiction of BSF in border states.She said law and order is a state subject and West Bengal's borders with Bangladesh were completely peaceful. The chief minister also said her government will go by the “state laws”.BJP MP Saumitra Khan from West Bengal said, “TMC was carved out of the Congress and now they are killing Congress workers in the state. The Congress is preparing for its end by joining hands with the TMC ahead of general elections. Here they will meet PM Narendra Modi, while in the state, set our BJP workers on fire. If she becomes the face of opposition parties, then the unity of the country will be in danger.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-likely-to-meet-modi-today-bsf-issue-developmental-talks-on-charts-101637721403133.html

He was speaking during an Indo-Russia friendship society on Tuesday."In the last seven years, we've seen that there is no talk of non-alignment and peace. We behave like we are slaves of Americans, begging for protection from China," said Aiyar."Our relation with Russia suffered a massive blow after 2014," he added. Aiyar further said the Congress is not in favour of whatever policy decisions the current dispensation is taking.The Congress leader made an appeal to the government to mend ties with Russia."Russia (erstwhile USSR) was India's closest ally when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister. In fact, Indira became a Russia name. Many girls have been named after her, especially in Uzbekistan," said Aiyar.He carried forward the attacks lodged by the Congress party, especially its former president Rahul Gandhi, by accusing the Centre of ceding Indian territory to China during the ongoing standoff in Ladakh. The Centre has denied these allegations and many leaders of the ruling BJP have launched counter-attacks, saying that "India knows how to give befitting reply to China, Pakistan or anti-national elements”.Aiyar's comments come weeks before Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives in India. He shares a very close relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and is making an exception during the Covid-19 time to visit a foreign country. Ahead of Putin's visit on December 6, the defence ministry has cleared over ₹5,000 crore deal with Russia to manufacture 7.5 lakh AK-203 assault rifles in Uttar Pradesh's Amethi.India has also received Russia-made two S-400 air defence system, which will be deployed on north and east borders of India beginning 2022 to balance the tactical disadvantage faced by the military after Chinese military's surprise May 2020 transgressions on 1,597-km Ladakh Line of Control (LAC).India has been engaged in a border standoff with China in Ladakh since last year. The armies of both the countries engaged in a skirmish in June 2020 in which India lost 20 soldiers and the PLA too suffered an unknown number of casualties.A number of talks between the two countries have taken place to end the standoff, but tension still continues in some areas along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-become-slave-of-us-says-manishankar-aiyar-at-indo-russian-event-101637720288807.html
24-11-2021||India||Delhi HC to hear plea seeking to ban Salman Khurshid's controversial new book||The Delhi high court is set to hear today a plea seeking to ban the sale, purchase, and all forms of circulation of ‘Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times’ – the new book by Congress leader and former Union minister Salman Khurshid which triggered extensive outbursts from certain political quarters, particularly over the fact that the author had compared a “robust version” of Hindutva to the jihadist Islam of terror groups such as the Islamic State (IS) and the Boko Haram.Also Read | Salman Khurshid says Hindutva and ISIS not same, but similar amid book controversyThe plea in Delhi high court, filed by advocate Vineet Jindal, calls out Khushid's book for violating “the fundamental right guaranteed under articles 19 and 21” of the Indian Constitution. Other than seeking a ban on the sale, purchase, and all forms of circulation, the petition also strives to ensure that the book is not published henceforth in any form – neither print nor digital.Khurshid, although went on to say that Hinduism is a “beautiful religion” that he is proud of, unwittingly sparked a nationwide row with the views presented in his book. Even within the ranks of his own party, leaders differ on the debate over religious views. Khurshid's party colleague, Ghulam Nabi Azad, has publicly said that he did not agree with the former on the matter. “The comparison is factually incorrect and an exaggeration,” the PTI news agency quoted Azad as saying.Also Read | Godse preached Hindutva, says Congress amid row over Salman Khurshid's bookKhurshid's new book on the Ayodhya verdict was released last week. It explored the Supreme Court's landmark judgment on the Babri Masjid land dispute and made comments on the ideology of the Hindutva.The controversy heightened to the point that it spawned attempts to vandalise Salman Khurshid's house at Uttarakhand's Nainital last week. Although no one was hurt in the house where only caretakers stay, the unidentified assaulters damaged windowpanes and set fire to a door at the house, according to the police. Khurshid later posted video clips on social media, in which some people appeared to be burning down his effigy and shouting derogatory slogans against him and the Muslim community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-to-hear-plea-seeking-to-ban-salman-khurshid-s-controversial-new-book-101637714352655.html

If the experiment proves successful, it will be implemented in other parts of the district as well, said Sachan.However, the move drew criticism from an MLA of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who said it will encourage people to consume liquor."This is not a decision taken by the state government, and it will encourage people to consume liquor," BJP MLA from Mandsaur Yashpal Singh Sisodiya said on Twitter in Hindi.जिला आबकारी अधिकारी ने प्रेस नोट जारी कर शराब पीने वालों को वैक्सीनेशन के दुसरे डोज लगाने पर ठेकेदार द्वारा मंदसौर की तीन दुकानों पर 10% भाव में छुट देने की बात कही है, यह नवाचार है जो उचित नहीं है और ना ही यह शासन का निर्णय है इससे पीने वालों का आकर्षण बढ़ेगा।Meanwhile, the Madhya Pradesh government will organise a mega campaign on Wednesday to cover more population under its vaccination programme.

According to reports citing officials familiar with the matter, the Union Cabinet will be meeting today, when it is likely to take up ‘The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021’ for approval and give its official nod to the proposal to withdraw the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, which was passed by Parliament in September last year.Also Read | Why govt failed to convince farmers about the new lawsThe Cabinet approval, if it is at all granted on Wednesday, will come days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement to scrap the contentious agriculture laws. In a televised address on Gurpurab, the Prime Minister had said that his government will be repealing the three pieces of legislation; he had also personally apologised to the people of the country and acknowledged that there was a “deficiency” in attempts to convince the farmers.The central government has now listed The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, in its agenda for the winter session of the Parliament beginning on November 29. The agriculture ministry is deliberating on the exact dates to discuss the three laws in the forthcoming Parliament session, informed Union minister Prahlad Joshi a day ago.Also Read | Farm laws to be repealed, but what's next for farmers?The bill – which has been listed for introduction and passage among the 26 new bills on the agenda of the government – seeks to repeal the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act provides for setting up a mechanism allowing the farmers to sell their farm produce outside the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). Any license-holder trader can buy the produce from the farmers at mutually agreed prices. This trade of farm produces will be free of mandi tax imposed by the state governments.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act allows farmers to do contract farming and market their produces freely.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act is an amendment to the existing Essential Commodities Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-repeal-cabinet-approval-likely-today-bill-listed-for-winter-session-101637710863351.html

PM expressed grief over the loss of lives and deep concern over the crop damages. PM assured all possible support from the Centre,” Bommai said in a post on Twitter. The telephone call between Modi and Bommai came a day after several images and videos of Bengaluru’s flooded residential localities and tech parks were all over social media. The residents of Kendriya Vihar, an apartment complex with 600 homes and over 1600 residents, were moved to other locations as rain water damaged the entire basement. Yelahanka Zone of Bengaluru was flooded as over four-feet of water caused disruption the everyday life. People were moved with the help of tractors and large SUVs. Bommai visited the affected area on Tuesday. “There are two Raja Kaluves (storm water drains) and the sizes of these are small and the outflow is significantly large,” Bommai said, adding he has instructed BBMP and other officials to take action. The chief minister also visited the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) where flooding damaged expensive and sensitive research equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmmodi-calls-cm-bommai-discusses-karnataka-s-flood-situation-101637696396523.html
24-11-2021||India||Another Gowda set to join politics as dynasts dominate Karnataka MLC polls||Suraj Revanna, the grandson of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and son of HD Revanna – a former minister and legislator from Holenarsipura in Hassan district, was among the seven candidates that the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) nominated on Tuesday for the upcoming Karnataka legislative council polls scheduled on December 10.Suraj would be the eighth member of Gowda’s family in active politics, cementing JD(S) as a family-run outfit. JD (S) may not be the only ones trying to bring their kin to the Karnataka legislative council – the upper house. Several relatives of senior leaders of the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) too have found name in the lists for the upcoming legislative council polls.Taking to Twitter, BJP was sharp in its criticism that the Congress practices “family politics” from the national leadership to the MLC polls. “In the JD (S) party, eight people from the same family are in power. But the Congress party is a bit generous in this regard! The Congress has approved family politics from the AICC national president’s post to MLC candidates,” the BJP said in a post on Twitter.The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) on Monday announced the names of the candidates for the upcoming MLC polls. The list included some candidates who are closely related to the senior leadership of the state Congress. Sunilgouda Patil, a Congress MLC from Vijayapura who is looking to be re-elected to the upper house, is the brother of former minister and legislator M B Patil. Similarly, Bheemanagouda Patil is the son of former minister Basavaraj Patil. Bheemanagouda’s brother Rajshekar Patil is an MLA and the other brother Chandrashekar Patil is an MLC. Channaraj Hattiholi, the candidate from Belagavi, is the brother of Congress legislator Lakshmi Hebbalkar; S Ravi is the relative of state Congress president DK Shivakumar.Shivakumar on Tuesday hit back at the BJP. “Let them (BJP) take out the list (of candidates). Who have they given (tickets) to in Coorg, Dharwad and other places? Let them hold a mirror to their own list,” Shivakumar said on Tuesday.The BJP has also nominated candidates closely related to active politicians. Pradeep Shettar, a sitting MLC from Dharwad is the younger brother of former chief minister and legislator Jagadish Shettar; Hanumant Nirani is the brother of Murugesh Nirani, Karnataka’s Minister for Large and Medium-scale Industries; Suja Kushalappa is the brother of Madikeri legislator Appachu Ranjan, who is a BJP parliamentarian. Recently, the BJP decided to replace Sunil Subramani who was a sitting MLC and the other brother of Ranjan. Political analysts said the concept of political families have the same kind of acceptance as business families where party workers accept leaders introducing their children or kin into the electoral battlefield.“Assembly elections are more a public election. But one can function in MLC elections through a friend’s network. That is why several independents make it to the upper house,” Narendar Pani, faculty at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) and political analyst said.Trying to push for kin in the assembly elections have a greater impact on the probability of power whereas the MLC elections are easier in terms of managing expectations and do not have a very wide ranging impact, analysts added. The decision to take the “back-door” entry – an expression used for entering the upper house – is a safer bet as it is easier to manage expectations and any fallout or disgruntlement may have very minimal impact on the probability of securing power like in the case of assembly seats, analysts said.“Deve Gowda has brought family into politics which inturn has brought politics into the family,” said a Bengaluru-based analyst, who wished not to be named. He referred to the battle between Gowda’s two sons –HD Kumaraswamy and HD Revanna – who have both fought hard for dominance within the JD (s) that has led to a widening rift within the party.Senior leaders such as BS Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah and Mallikarjuna Kharge are also among others who have their sons as legislators or parliamentarians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-gowda-set-to-join-politics-as-dynasts-dominate-karnataka-mlc-polls-101637696395256.html
24-11-2021||India||A day later, flood-hit Kendriya Vihar limps back to normalcy||For 56 -year-old Sudheer Dhar, the harrowing experience of floods in Kendriya Vihar apartments in Yelahanka continues even as disaster management teams try to pump out water from the premises.The entire complex with over 600 homes was flooded after a heavy downpour on Sunday night that led to the overflowing of the nearby lake, inundating the entire residential locality. Over 130 mm of rainfall was recorded in the Yelahanka zone on Sunday night alone.“For the last four days, there is no power or water,” said Dhar, who had just managed to charge his phone for two hours in a shop nearby on Tuesday evening.He said though the people of the apartment complex and disaster relief were doing all they can to help the stranded residents, people were “suffering”.The residents were provided with food and bottled water by volunteers on Monday. But on Tuesday, volunteers dropped off large water cans at the ground floor, forcing the likes of Dhar to walk down from his eighth-floor apartment and carry it back up as the lifts are down and power is yet to be restored.“We are very worried about the pandemic as there is (stagnant) water. Dengue and malaria are increasing and there are many elderly people residing here,” he added.Dhar’s 78-year-old mother is living with him and he has sent his son to a relative’s residence as he has to work from home.Several others shared the plight even as relief workers continue to toil and restore some semblance of normalcy after the recent downpour in Bengaluru.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai visited the complex on Tuesday.From November 1-21 (till 5.30 pm), Bengaluru has received over 195 mm of rains as against the average of 42 mm in the month, registering an excess of 364%, data from the Karnataka Disaster Management Authority (KDMA) shows.Almost every single district of Karnataka has received excess rainfall with 21 out of 31 receiving over 200% more rains this year.At least 24 people have died and lakhs of hectares of crops have been lost, thousands of homes have been damaged in the rains which has left a trail of destruction across the southern state and several other parts of the country.Bommai on Tuesday said the overflow from the lakes and inadequate size of the Raja Kaluve or storm water drain (SWD) were the main reasons for the floods.Residents said there was a similar incident in 2017 and around ₹4 crore were allocated to “fix” the problem, which apparently was not.Much of Bengaluru, which contributes over half of the state’s revenues and is known globally for its prowess in technology, has remained one of the most poor in terms of public infrastructure, planning and regulations, leading to such incidents.It would not be wrong to say that there isn’t a single road in all of Bengaluru that does not have a pothole in it or in some cases no road at all as motorists and pedestrians risk nothing short of their lives each time they tread these streets.Bengaluru has had 18 deaths due to civic apathy in 2020, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, that is more than all other major cities combined many times over.“About 138mm of rains lashed the city in just 2 hours recently. All the lakes in and around Yelahanka are overflowing. The situation is the same in many parts of the city. The existing Rajakaluves with a width of 8 to 10 feet are proving to be inadequate to carry the heavy flow,” Bommai said. He has instructed officials to fix the problem--an assurance the likes of Dhar have heard before.Rapid and unplanned expansion with the complicit approval of civic bodies has led to encroachment of natural canals, lakes and drains, leaving little or no space for rain water to flow.“BBMP had identified 714 illegal structures on Rajakaluves. Houses and buildings which have come up on Rajakaluves would be evicted. However he assured that care would be taken to ensure that the poor are not affected by providing them alternative facilities. Houses and residential complexes on the Buffer Zones would be shifted after giving them adequate time to move,” Bommai added.The chief minister has retained the Bengaluru development portfolio.But successive governments claim to spend, at least on paper, several thousand crores to improve the infrastructure under the guise of development which has little or no impact. The city continues to crumble, forcing its over 12 million residents who live and migrate to the city in the hope for a better life.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) on Tuesday held a meeting on how to prevent such incidents in the “future”.The BBMP administrator and additional chief secretary to the government of Karnataka Rakesh Singh held a meeting with officials to take precautionary measures during the rains and said that precautionary measures should be taken and see to it that no damages occur.“During the rainy season, in the Kaluves, Drains on either sides of the road and in the shoulder drains all the waste should be cleaned and ensure that water flows smoothly. Due to the digging of the roads,” he said, according to a statement by the civic body.“After the rain stops in the city, in all zones immediately the road work and filling of potholes to be taken. Also, with the roads which are damaged immediate repair work should be taken. The road repair work should be done in a quality manner,” said Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the BBMP.Meanwhile, Dhar sits in a dark room with his immobile mother hoping that at least this time, things would be different.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-day-later-flood-hit-kendriya-vihar-limps-back-to-normalcy-101637696337774.html
24-11-2021||India||Delay in SII’s first shipment to Nepal under Covax||The first shipment of Covishield vaccines to Nepal under the Covax programme has been delayed temporarily, people familiar with the development said, although the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, the maker of Covishield, will resume shipping doses to other countries in a week or so under the global initiative.“Nepal was the first country to begin Covax shipments with, and the consignment was supposed to leave for Nepal on Monday (November 22). Everything was ready, but then there was a request from their side to halt the shipment for a couple of days,” a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. “We have been made to understand that it had got nothing to do with the company but something from the side of the Nepal government related to preparations.”India halted export of Covid-19 vaccines in April after a severe second wave hit the country that impacted the Covid-19 vaccines global access, or Covax programme, which has been established to deliver Covid-19 vaccines equitably to all countries. Last week, the central government allowed the company to ship five million doses under the Covax facility after the export restrictions were lifted.“The Nepal order has been put on hold and not cancelled. The company will send the doses as soon as there is a go ahead from their side,” the person said. “In a day or two, there should be more clarity in terms of countries and doses from the Covax facility and doses to other countries should begin in next six-seven days.”Supplies under Covax are directly shipped by the manufacturer to the country that needs the doses, said a person familiar with the process.“It is not like there is a Covax warehouse somewhere and the manufacturer will send the doses there. Imagine the amount of time wasted and the extra cost incurred if it was done that way. Covax shares details of the delivery and the manufacturer sends it,” the person said, but declined to be named. “As of now 5 million doses have been approved by the government of India (under the programme).”India’s requirement for doses increased from April 1 as it started vaccinating everyone above 45 years of age. The move was aimed at curbing transmission as the country battled a devastating second wave of the pandemic. Serum Institute may ship 20-30 million doses of Covishield by the end of the year, the company has said in the past, but it would depend on India’s Covid-19 situation as many countries in the world are reporting another Covid wave. India wants to inoculate its eligible population as soon as possible.Currently, 38.3% of the country’s adult population is partially vaccinated, while another 43.3% is fully vaccinated. The government has started a special drive — Har Ghar Dastak (knock on every door) — to ensure all eligible people are vaccinated. In October, the central government permitted Serum Institute to export one million doses each to Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vaccine maitri (friendship) initiative.Another Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer, Hyderabad-headquartered Bharat Biotech, was also allowed to ship one million doses of Covaxin to Iran.“The health minister publicly announced that India will resume Covid-19 vaccine export in the last quarter and the promise has been kept,” a central government official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delay-in-sii-s-first-shipment-to-nepal-under-covax-101637696336492.html
24-11-2021||India||Forced oral sex with child ‘lesser offence’: Allahabad HC reduces jail term||The Allahabad high court has reduced the jail term of a Jhansi man convicted for forcing a 10-year-old child to have oral sex with him in 2016, ruling that such an act amounts to “penetrative sexual assault” under Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and not in the category of “aggravated penetrative sexual assault” defined under Section 6 of the Act.Justice Anil Kumar Ojha accordingly reduced the sentence of the convict to seven years from 10 years of rigorous imprisonment awarded by the trial court. “After going through the records and provisions of POCSO Act, I am of the considered opinion that the appellant should be punished under Section 4 of POCSO Act because the act done by appellant falls in the category of penetrative sexual assault. Penetrative sexual assault being lesser offence from aggravated penetrative sexual assault is legally permissible to convict the appellant therein,” justice Ojha ruled.The high court reasoned that the trial judge sentenced the man to the minimum sentence of 10 years provided under Section 6, and retained this principle even as it sentenced the Jhansi man under Section 4 which is punishable by a minimum jail of 7 years. The maximum punishment under Section 4 is imprisonment for life.According to the boy’s father, the convict Sonu Kushwaha went to the complainant’s house in March 2016 and took out his son telling him that they were going to a temple. Once there, the man gave the child ₹20 for oral sex. When the child returned with the money, his family asked him about the money. The child told them about the abuse. Based on the FIR filed four days after the incident, a case was registered under Section 377 (carnal intercourse against the order of nature) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and section 3 and 4 of the Pocso Act. The court, after hearing parties concerned, said that the offence committed by the appellant does not fall under Section 5 and 6 of the Pocso Act because there was penetrative sexual assault as the appellant had forced the victim to have oral sex with him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forced-oral-sex-with-child-lesser-offence-allahabad-high-court-reduces-jail-term-101637696276533.html

After the riot, one of the accused fled to a middle-east country and the other jumped the bail and absconded during the trial.Both were found guilty by the special court judge K S Ambika on November 20 and the quantum of punishment announced was on Tuesday. The trial of the duo was held separately as they were absconding and were later arrested by police in 2011. Koyamon was found guilty under the explosives act for manufacturing country-made bombs and Nizamuddin for murder, rioting and other sections of the Indian Penal Code.In 2009, the special court had sentenced 63 of the 139 accused who faced trial in the case.

Justice N Nagaresh issued notice to the Centre and the Kerala government seeking their stand on the petition by a senior citizen who has contended that the PM’s photo on his vaccination certificate was a violation of fundamental rights.The court directed the Centre and the state to file their reply affidavits before the next date of hearing.The petitioner, Peter Myaliparampil, has contended that he had paid for the two doses of vaccine and therefore, the certificate was his “private space” with his personal details on record and therefore, it was inappropriate to intrude into the privacy of an individual.The petition reads, “Petitioner had received the paid COVID-19 vaccination from a private hospital and thereafter received a vaccination certificate. The certificate had the Prime Minister’s colour photograph and the message: “medicine and strict controls (in Malayalam), together India will defeat COVID-19 (in English)” with attribution to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”“The national campaign against COVID-19 is being converted into a media campaign for the Prime Minister. The petitioner also addressed a representation to the Central government for a vaccine certificate without the PM’s photograph but did not receive any response,” the petition further read.“Government messaging and campaigns, especially when it uses government funds, should not personify any leader of the political party. This affects the petitioner’s independent choice of voting, which has been recognised as the essence of the electoral system in People’s Union for Civil Liberties vs Union of India,” it added.“Moreover, according to the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court for campaigns using public money in Common Cause vs Union of India, no individual can be credited for the launch of an initiative or be celebrated for achievements of a certain policy of the State on government expense,” the petition reads. Peter had filed a similar petition two months ago, which was heard by Justice PB Suresh Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-seeks-centre-state-replies-on-plea-against-pm-s-photo-on-covid-jab-certificate-101637696155378.html

The fresh resolution proposes to withdraw the statutory resolution adopted by the state assembly on January 27, 2020, under Article 169 of the Constitution of India, requesting the Centre to abolish the state legislative council. A fresh resolution will be sent to the Union home ministry for approval soon. The Jagan government had decided to abolish the legislative council last year after his government failed to get the bills on the formation of three capitals in the Upper House due to a lack of majority for the ruling YSR Congress party. Out of the total number of 58 members in the council, the YSRCP had only nine members, while the TDP had 33 members. Making a statement at the time of adopting the resolution for the abolition of the council on January 27, 2020, the chief minister said the Upper House had become a stumbling block for his government in taking important policy decisions and getting legislative approval. He also asserted that the legislative council did not serve any purpose, as there were more educated and intellectual members in the assembly. He even reasoned that the council was causing a huge burden on the state exchequer to the extent of ₹60 crores every year, which the cash-strapped state could not afford to continue. The resolution was sent to the Union home ministry, which has not taken any action on the proposal since then. Initially, the Jagan government made a couple of representations to the Centre, asking for early abolition of the legislative council. It stopped pursuing the matter later as ruling YSRCP’s strength increased due to elections periodically. Now, the strength of the YSRCP in the state council has gone up to 21 with the election of three more MLCs under the MLA’s quota. Elections to 11 other MLC seats under local bodies’ quota are underway, and since the YSRCP has captured 90 per cent of the local body seats in the recent elections, it is expected to win all 11 seats unopposed, taking the YSRCP’s council strength to 32. The legislative affairs minister told the state assembly that the state government took the decision in the wake of the failure of the Centre in deciding on the same despite constant persuasion of the matter at various levels and lapse of a considerable period of 19 months. “So, we have decided to continue the council to put an end to the prevailing situation of uncertainty and ambiguity, which is affecting the dignity and decorum, always associated with the council and its members,” Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-passes-resolution-to-keep-legislative-council-101637696096533.html
24-11-2021||India||Vanniyar Sangam moves court against makers of Jai Bhim film||The Vanniyar Sangam Tuesday moved district court Tuesday against Tamil film Jai Bhim alleging that certain scenes in the movie show the community in poor light. T Arulmozhi, president of the Sangam, parent body of political party Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), filed a private complaint before the second judicial magistrate in Tamil Nadu’s Chidambaram district against actor Suriya, who also produced the movie along with his wife Jyothika under the banner 2D Entertainment, director TJ Gnanavel and OTT platform Amazon Prime Video, which released it. The complaint seeks the court to proceed against the accused of their offending movie scenes and punish them for the offences under sections 153(provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (1) (promoting enmity between different groups), 499 (defamation), 500 (punishment for defamation), 503 (criminal intimidation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to breach peace) and 505 (statements conducing public mischief) of Indian Penal Code. The case was filed after the makers didn’t tender an unconditional apology as demanded. “The accused person’s reckless depiction of the Vanniyar Community in poor light with villainy and criminal bent of mind has delivered an irreparable dent in the hitherto earned high reputation of the community with one deadly blow in accused film wiping out all goodwill the Vanniyar community has enjoyed so far from all other communities,” their petition filed on Tuesday said. “Now Accused persons have created communal issues, criminal intimidation between the people and also provokes the breach of peace by inciting violence among the people in the state of Tamil Nadu.”The petition also states that they had earlier filed criminal complaints at a Chidambaram police station but had refused to register the complaint, and thereafter, the complaint was filed in Cuddalore, but no action was taken to date.Jai Bhim fictionalises a real-life case of a tribal man, Rajakannu, who was falsely implicated in a theft case and died in custody due to police torture in 1993 and the film shows how his wife and retired high court justice K Chandru fight for his justice. The case Rajakannu Versus State of Tamil Nadu and others resulted in three policemen being sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment for the murder of Rajakannu.Among the contentions raised, the petition states that the movie has retained the real names of all the characters but deliberately changed the name of the sub-inspector of police (who had tortured the victim in the police custody) from his real name Anthonysamy to Gurumurthy and “repeatedly referred to him as Guru” which they said was related to the community’s prominent late leader J Guru. “The accused have projected the said wicked person, a wrongdoer as if he belonged to vanniyar community thereby imputing that the members of the Vanniyar community are prone to commit wrong and illegal things while in real life said Sub Inspector does not belong to Vanniyar Community,” the petition states.Further, the petition states that the symbol Agni Gundam (meaning raging flame from the holy pot) has been a sacred symbol of the Vanniyar community for many centuries, which has been used in a movie scene in a calendar that is behind sub-inspector. “The accused have deliberately got printed a calendar of the year 1995 with the symbol of Agni Kundam with the caption of Kshatriya Kula Manadu, Villupuram,” the petition states. “Accused have made several symbolic representations through various scenes and dialogue in the movie insinuating that vanniyar community people are oppressing the underprivileged people in the movie,” the petition said. They added that it cannot be considered as a “casual, innocent, inadvertent mistake” in the movie which has now been viewed by millions of cine lovers across the globe which was released on November 2 on the OTT platform. The complainant states that freedom of expression cannot be used to defame the particular community and earn substantial revenue by “distorting facts”. They also pointed out that the dialogue writer of the movie, Kanmani Gunasekaran returned his remuneration saying that original facts have been suppressed and the real life-widow Parvathy that her consent was not obtained. In an interview with HT, last week, retired Justice Chandru had said that among those alive from the case only his name and the police officer I Periyasamy’s names have been retained besides the deceased Rajakannu.The controversy started when PMK leader and former union minister Anbumani Ramadoss wrote a letter to actor Suriya demanding answers. Suriya clarified that it was intended to show the real-life struggle of Justice Chandru and that the mistakes pointed out were immediately corrected. The film’s director, Gnanavel released a statement recently, stating that it was not intended to target or shame a particular person or community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vanniyar-sangam-moves-court-against-makers-of-jai-bhim-film-101637696095235.html
24-11-2021||India||Kerala adoption row: DNA report confirms parentage||Former Left student leader Anupama S Chandran and her husband Ajith Kumar are the biological parents of a one-year-old baby whose controversial adoption sparked a row in Kerala, a genetic test confirmed on Tuesday.Chandran and Kumar say that her father, a leader of the state’s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), forcibly took away their child and put him up for adoption because he didn’t approve of the intercaste couple. Last month, a family court stayed the adoption process and ordered the DNA test.“This is the happiest day in my life. It is the victory of a mother,” Chandran told reporters with tears in her eyes. The couple was holding a sit-in protest outside a children’s home where the baby was kept by the authorities a week ago.Minutes after the DNA (genetic identification test) result from the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in Thiruvananthapuram was issued , Child Welfare Committee (CWC) authorities allowed the mother and father to see the baby. There were joyous scenes outside the venue with the parents and activists distributing sweets.“I thank the people who stood with me. I hope I will get custody of my baby soon,” said Chandran after meeting her child. She said she will continue her struggle till officials who allegedly colluded with her parents to give away the baby in a hurry were punished and reiterated her charge that “it was child trafficking.”An official of the CWC said it will inform the family court about the test and request it to take an early decision. The baby was brought from Andhra Pradesh on Sunday and DNA samples of all three (mother, father and baby) was taken on Monday.“It is a slap on the face of the government. It should take immediate action against officials who supported the adoption flouting all rules,” said K K Rema MLA, Revolutionary Socialist Party leader, who supported the young mother.“It is a great victory for the mother. Sad, not even a single woman leader from the ruling CPI(M) met her. How can they take up women issues in the future?” asked Congress leader Bindu Krishna.CPI(M) leaders didn’t comment on the development.Health minister Veena George said the government will approach the court to expedite the transfer of the baby and denied any delay on the part of the government. “We are with Anupama and we will be happy to see child’s union with his parents,” she said.In the second week of October, Chandran told reporters that her new-born baby was forcibly taken by her parents and given up for adoption, ignoring her protests. With her family being members of the ruling CPI(M), Chandran said that she took up the matter with senior leaders but was ignored.On October 20, the police filed a complaint against six people, including her parents. In her complaint, she alleged that her father, S Jayachandran, a senior leader of the CPI(M) trade union wing CITU, took away her newborn child on the third day of delivery and handed it over to the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare (SCCW)-run orphanage in the state capital last year. The child was later given up for adoption in a hurry, flouting rules, she claimed in her complaint.But her father maintained that the baby was born out of wedlock and hence shifted to a government-run children’s home with the consent of Chandran. He said she signed on stamp paper but Chandran later said she signed under duress. She said her parents opposed her relations with her husband Ajith since he belonged to a Dalit family.The issue kicked up a row cornering the ruling Left Democratic Front and the state government. Many writers and left intellectuals appealed to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to intervene, but the CM said that it was a “family affair”.However, state fisheries minister Saji Cherian criticised Chandran and backed her parents. “Her parents have done only what everyone will do in the society,” he said.Later, Chandran filed a defamation compliant against the minister and said she approached many senior leaders but failed to get justice. Party insiders admitted that the issue was denting the image of the ruling CPI(M), and their poll plank of women’s rights.The Central Adoption Resource Authority instructed the SCCW to give due weightage to the foster parents from Andhra Pradesh who were forced to hand over the baby to officials from Kerala on Sunday. A senior official of the CWC who did not want to be identified said top priority will be given to them during the next round of adoption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adoption-row-dna-report-confirms-parentage-101637696035827.html
24-11-2021||India||UP polls: SP, RLD strike pact, discuss seat-sharing formula||The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) on Tuesday sealed an alliance for the 2022 UP Assembly polls and also discussed a seat-sharing formula, according to people aware of the development in both parties.An RLD leader who asked not to be named said the alliance was finalised after RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary met SP chief Akhilesh Yadav at the latter’s residence. Soon after, both tweeted photographs of the two of them together, with comments that indicated that a an alliance was on.In a tweet in Hindi, Akhilesh said: “Towards the change with Shri Jayant Chaudhary.” Jayant tweeted: “Badhtey kadam (taking steps forward).”“The alliance is likely to be declared formally within a day or two,” said Anil Dubey, RLD national secretary and spokesperson.The alliance between the two long-standing partners in UP has been on the cards for some time. Yadav and Chaudhary have both said several times that an alliance has almost been finalised and would be announced formally before the end of November.The RLD is likely to contest 30-40 seats (mostly in western UP, its stronghold) . Chaudhary is the grandson of former Prime Minister Charan Singh and the son of former union minister Ajit Singh.The SP has already announced an alliance with Om Prakash Rajbhar’s eastern UP based Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SPSP) and a few smaller parties, including the Mahan Dal. Alliances with more small parties are in the offing including one with Shivpal Yadav’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L).Since the loss in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Samajwadi Party had been reiterating that it will not ally with any big party because of its experiences with such partnerships(with Congress in 2017 UP Assembly polls and with Bahujan Samaj Party in 2019 Lok Sabha polls).The RLD enjoys support among farmers of western UP and is on the same page with the SP on the issue of opposing the Centre’s three farm laws, which the government said last week that it would repeal.The RLD and the SP have been constant companions since the 2017 UP assembly elections and contested all the assembly and Lok Sabha bypolls together since then.“This alliance seems mature with their long-standing partnership and no discord ever surfacing between the two. Both the leaders also exude the same wavelength and both parties are likely to gain in 2022 polls,” said professor SK Dwivedi, political analyst and former HoD, political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-polls-sp-rld-strike-pact-discuss-seat-sharing-formula-101637695495348.html
24-11-2021||India||Rectify injustice meted out to NEET aspirant: Supreme Court to NTA||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the National Testing Agency (NTA) to rectify the injustice meted out to a disabled medical aspirant who was denied an additional one hour at the NEET-UG 2021 and directed that in future, the rights and entitlements of students with disability appearing in the competitive examinations should be listed out clearly in the information bulletin.The petitioner, Avni Prakash, who hails from Maharashtra, suffered from dysgraphia, commonly referred to as ‘writer’s cramp’ and had a certificate of disability issued by a recognised hospital. Dysgraphia causes impaired handwriting and demonstrates inconsistent handwriting, poor spelling and spacing, transcription difficulties, and incoherence.Due to the action of NTA, she had slipped in the overall merit list prepared for persons with disabilities and demanded for an opportunity to give the examination again. The top court refused this prayer, realising that such an order will set a wrong precedent for an examination such as NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) taken by nearly 1.6 million candidates across the country.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna, however, directed NTA to consider steps to be taken to rectify the injustice done to the candidate within a week and convey the same to the Registry of the Supreme Court within two weeks. The option of what is to be done was left to NTA even as the bench suggested extrapolation of marks awarded to the candidate, compensatory marks, or by adopting a “no negative marks” policy.The top court was convinced that the suffering caused to the petitioner was a consequence of inadequate knowledge at the designated examination centre with regard to facilities available to persons with disability (PwD) students coupled by an element of ambiguity in the instructions framed in the NEET Bulletin 2021.“In the future, the first respondent (NTA) shall ensure that provisions which are made at the NEET in terms of the rights and entitlements available under the right to persons with disabilities (RPwD) Act 2016 are clarified in the NEET Bulletin by removing ambiguity, as noticed in the present case,” the bench held.In the present case, the apex court left it open for NTA to relax the upper age criteria applicable to persons with benchmark disability.Holding NTA accountable for its mistake, the bench said, “Responsibility and power without accountability are an anathema to our Constitution…It is no answer for an authority bound by the dicta of law and the Constitution to throw up its hands in despair, instead of attempting to remedy the injustice which is caused to a student. A judge cannot ignore that behind the statistics is a human face, reflecting the aspirations, joy and tears of a student and her family.”The order noted August 2018 guidelines issued by the ministry of social justice and empowerment that states that every policy should have flexibility to accommodate the specific needs of PwD on a case-to-case basis. Even the NEET Bulletin 2021 provided for compensatory time of an additional hour for such candidates. Yet, the candidate’s paper was forcibly taken away at the completion of three hours and when she protested, the invigilators sought production of certificate of disability, which the court said was a requirement at the time of getting admission. The petitioner did possess a certificate of disability issued by the LTMG Sion Hospital, Paediatric Neurodevelopment Centre.The court said, “For effective participation of the students with disabilities in the society, which undoubtedly is the salutary object of the legislation, the safeguards which are provided by the law must be duly enforced and any breach of entitlement must be answerable at law.”The petitioner secured an All India Rank of 1,721 out of 2,684 candidates who qualified in the PwD category. In relation to Maharashtra, she secured rank of 249 out of 390 candidates in the same category.The bench observed, “Individual injustices originating in a wrongful denial of rights and entitlements prescribed under the law cannot be sent into oblivion on the ground that these are a necessary consequence of a competitive examination… The number of cases where such injustices take place maybe a few or more than that, but it cannot be ignored that for a student who is made to suffer, the consequence is indeed serious.”Before approaching the top court, the petitioner had appealed to the Bombay high court, which dismissed her petition on October 29. She approached the top court on November 10 in appeal against this order. The petitioner had cleared her Class XII this year with an aggregate of 87.4% marks. The NTA, during the course of the proceedings in the case, informed the bench that the petitioner had attempted 84 out of 180 questions in her NEET entrance and was awarded 166 out of 720 marks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rectify-injustice-meted-out-to-neet-aspirant-supreme-court-to-nta-101637695196260.html

On the next date, the court will examine over 200 witnesses,” said Sinha.The 73-year-old leader suffers from a number of ailments, including diabetes, cardiac and renal problems. Out on bail, Prasad has been under medical supervision in Delhi while staying with his eldest daughter Misa.The fodder scam case pertains to excess withdrawals worth ₹47 lakh from the treasury of Banka and Bhagalpur districts. The CBI registered a case in the fodder scam on March 27, 1996. It filed a charge sheet naming 44 accused, including Prasad, former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra, who died two years ago, and former animal husbandry minister Vidya Sagar Nishad, who died last year.In March 2012, the special CBI court framed charges against 28 accused as 16 others had died during the trial period. At present, only 22 accused are alive. Prasad has been convicted in similar cases pertaining to a number of districts in Jharkhand, which was part of undivided Bihar when he ruled the state in the 1990s.On Tuesday, the RJD chief was the only one to physically appear before the court while 21 others appeared through their lawyers, Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fodder-case-cbi-exempts-lalu-from-attending-hearing-in-court-101637695195218.html
24-11-2021||India||Congress’s Kirti Azad among three new TMC entrants||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee barely stepped out of her home in New Delhi on Tuesday. Yet, she created ripples with three leaders from other parties joining the Trinamool Congress (TMC) that is on an expansion mode to gain national prominence.Former diplomat turned ex-Janata Dal (United) leader Pavan Varma, former cricketer Kirti Azad who had been in both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, and former Congress Lok Sabha MP Ashok Tanwar joined Bengal’s ruling party, marking the TMC’s biggest single-day haul in the national capital.Tanwar, who was once a close aide of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, quit the party in 2019 to float Apna Bharat Morcha. After his induction, Banerjee maintained that the TMC family is “now complete”.“I have told Tanwar to work in Haryana, and whenever he calls me, I will go there to campaign,” Banerjee said. She added that Tanwar will also be asked to campaign in Goa elections next year.Tanwar, a former president of the Congress’s youth arm Indian Youth Congress, was known for his organisational skills. He fell out with the dominant section of the Haryana Congress unit and quit the party.“Glad to be part of @AITCofficia. Indian politics is at a rare crossroads today - on one hand we’re witnessing triumph of optics, on other, tragedies of the marginalized and poor continue. The real issues are getting buried - we need a new politics to turn the tide!” Tanwar tweeted.Varma and Azad can serve as important national voices for the TMC that appears to no longer be content as Bengal’s top party. With 2024 elections due in less than three years, it wants to gain prominence at the national level and sees a scope for expansion with the Congress is on decline.“I’ll work under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee and I’ll work at the ground level. India today needs a political personality like her at the Centre,” said Azad.“TMC has the potential to become a principal challenge to the BJP,” Varma told news channel India Today.A few months ago, the TMC inducted two senior Congress leaders, Sushmita Dev and Luizinho Faleiro, leading to uneasiness at the top level of the Congress party.This is the first time the TMC is aggressively inducting national-level leaders. Its third consecutive victory in the Bengal assembly election in May put the party in a prominent position nationally and its leaders say that the outfit is the only one capable of taking on the BJP effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congresss-kirti-azad-among-three-new-tmc-entrants-101637695015253.html
24-11-2021||India||Member of SC-appointed panel writes to CJI over report on farm laws||Anil Ghanwat, one of the members of the Supreme Court-appointed committee on the three contentious farm laws, on Tuesday appealed to the top court to make public the report at the earliest or authorise the committee to do so.The panel, after studying the laws and consultation with stakeholders, had submitted its report to the apex court on March 19.In a letter to Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Ghanwat said: “After the government’s decision to repeal the farm laws in the coming Winter Session of the Parliament, the committee’s report is no longer relevant with regard to those laws but there are suggestions in the report on farmers’ issues that are of great public interest.”“The report can also play an educational role and ease the misapprehensions of many farmers who have, in my opinion, have been misguided by some leaders who do not seem to appreciate how a minimally regulated free market can allocate national resources to their most productive use,” he added. Ghanwat also requested the top court to direct the Union government to implement a consultative robust policy process for infusing reforms in the agricultural sector. Earlier too, in a letter dated September 1, Ghanwat had requested the CJI to release the report in public domain, saying its “recommendations will pave the way to resolve the ongoing farmers’ agitation.”On January 12 this year, the Supreme Court, while staying the implementation of the three farm laws amid continuous protests, had constituted a three-member committee to look into these laws and suggest reforms.Ashok Gulati (agri economist and former chairman of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) and Pramod Kumar Joshi (agri economist and Director for South Asia at International Food Policy Research Institute) are the remaining two members of the committee. Meanwhile, Ghanwat, who is a senior leader of Maharashtra-based farmers’ union Shetkari Sanghatana, told reporters on Tuesday that he would be soon travelling across the country to unite farmers in support of reforms in the agriculture sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/member-of-sc-appointed-panel-writes-to-cji-over-report-on-farm-laws-101637694775156.html
24-11-2021||India||In Punjab twist, AAP chief praises Sidhu: ‘Congress stifling him’||Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday praised Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu for the “courage shown by him” in exposing false promises made by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi-led state government.“Yesterday, chief minister Channi claimed his government has ended the sand mafia and reduced the price of the sand. Immediately, Mr Sidhu said this information is wrong and he (Channi) is lying. He highlighted that the sand mafia is still operating and it is being sold on old prices. I salute his courage,” Kejriwal said on the second day of his two-day visit to poll-bound Punjab.He was replying to a question on the dissenting voice of the Punjab Congress chief at a press conference, where he was accompanied by AAP Punjab chief Bhagwant Mann, in-charge of party state unit affairs Jarnail Singh and co-incharge Raghav Chadha.Sidhu himself has said that the promises or announcements being made by Channi are lies, said Kejriwal. “Sidhu Sahib is raising people-centric issues but the entire Congress party is indulging in suppressing his voice. First it was Captain (Amarinder Singh), now it’s Channi who has indulged in suppressing him. However, he (Sidhu) is rightly raising this voice,” Kejriwal added.He also took potshots at Channi, saying the Punjab CM has not fulfilled his promises of giving free electricity to the people of the state, constructing mohalla clinics etc. “Corruption is still rampant in the state,” he said.Congress was not available for any comment.Punjab will go to assembly polls in February-March next year.Replying to a question on AAP MLAs leaving the party and joining other parties, Kejriwal said, “Ahead of elections, MLAs from all parties switch sides. Party-hopping is common everywhere. If there is completion over MLAs switching sides and joining rival parties, then I can assure there are a minimum of 25 MLAs and two MPs from the Congress party who are in touch with AAP. But we don’t want their ‘kachra’ (garbage).”Kejriwal also announced an eight-point guarantee to transform the education sector Punjab, including regularising the services of contract teachers. “Today, I am here to discuss issues pertaining to teachers. I met a few teachers yesterday. They told me that they are earning ₹10,000 per month. This is way below the minimum wage in Delhi. I promise the services of the teachers would be regularised immediately after the AAP forms government in the state.”The eight guarantees include creating a Delhi-like environment in the education sector in Punjab, regularising outsourcing and contractual teachers, implementing a transparent transfer policy, banning non-teaching work from teachers, permanent recruitment on vacant posts, sending teachers abroad for training, bringing in a transparent policy for new promotions and providing cashless medical facilities for teachers and their family members.He added, “Teachers are made to do anything but teaching. This is the condition of the entire nation. I want to promise that the teachers will be made to teach students. They won’t be allowed to carry out Census, data entry work at government offices, etc.”Meanwhile, when a journalist asked him about the party’s CM face in the state, many party workers started shouting Mann’s name. “Every party usually declares its CM candidate a few weeks before the day of polling. We will also do this. However, we will declare the face before other parties”.“I make it clear that Kejriwal is not a CM candidate,” the AAP chief added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-punjab-twist-aap-chief-praises-sidhu-congress-stifling-him-101637694595092.html
24-11-2021||India||Japan likely to host second in-person Quad summit in January 2022||The second in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, could be hosted by Japan as early as January 2022 against the backdrop of pledges by the leadership of India, Australia, Japan and the US to forge ahead with efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.India and Japan are also exploring the possibility of holding their second 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers on the margins of the planned Quad Summit, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The first in-person Quad Summit was hosted by the US in Washington in September and the upcoming meeting will be the first for Japan’s new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Japan’s Kyodo news agency recently reported that preparations are underway to hold the next Quad Summit in Tokyo.The summit could be held as early as January and the members of the Quad have reached an understanding that the next three in-person summits should be hosted by Japan in 2022, India in 2023 and Australia in 2024, the people cited above said.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Japanese counterpart Yoshimasa Hayashi agreed during a phone conversation on Monday the two sides will work together for the “early realisation of...Kishida’s visit to India” and coordinate to hold the next 2+2 ministerial dialogue, according to a readout from Japan’s foreign ministry.The first India-Japan 2+2 dialogue was held in New Delhi in November 2019 and the two sides had explored the possibility of holding the second meeting in April this year. The two countries signed the Agreement on Reciprocal Provision of Supplies and Services in September 2020 to allow their militaries to access each other’s bases for logistics support, and the second 2+2 dialogue is expected to build on security cooperation across the Indo-Pacific.The next Quad Summit is set to have a packed agenda, with the key deliverable being the donation of more than 1.2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines across the Indo-Pacific by the end of 2022. These doses will be US-developed vaccines manufactured at India’s Biological E with financial support from the US and Japan, while Australia will back last-mile vaccine rollouts and lead in coordinating last-mile delivery efforts.Countering China’s aggressive actions across the Indo-Pacific and framing standards for critical technologies such as 5G and AI are also expected to be on the agenda, the people said.The US National Security Council coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, Kurt Campbell, said at an event organised by the United States Institute of Peace on Friday that all members of the Quad “recognise that the critical, crucial member in the Quad is India”, and Washington and New Delhi have a “desire and dynamism” to tackle problems together.Over the next year, the Quad will work on rolling out Covid-19 vaccines, creating infrastructure in Southeast Asia, investing in education and technology, including 5G, and cooperating in cyber, space and maritime domain awareness, he said.Campbell also said the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the death of Indian troops in the Galwan Valley clash in June 2020 had resulted in a “real sense of heightened tensions” between China and India. He added that it “would be difficult to exaggerate the strategic significance that has had in Delhi”, and there is a “new strategic paradigm which has forced or encouraged India to reach out and to build stronger bonds” with the US and other countries.At the same time, American participation in the Quad signals “that the US is here to stay in the Indo-Pacific and we’re going to defend and support the operating system that has been so good for so many of us for many years”, Campbell said. He also acknowledged that Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated during his recent virtual summit with US President Joe Biden that a number of things the US is doing, including Quad and AUKUS, are causing China “some heartburn”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/japan-likely-to-host-second-in-person-quad-summit-in-january-2022-101637694297118.html
24-11-2021||India||Don’t inflame passions over CAA, Yogi warns ‘abba jaan’||The Uttar Pradesh government will initiate strict action against all those who incite passion over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Tuesday. The state, which used to witness violence on every third or fourth day under the previous regime, will also “not protect rioters but run bulldozers on their chest”, he added. The chief minister was addressing a convention of polling booth-level BJP leaders in Kanpur when he warned “the person who is once again trying to incite feelings in the name of CAA”. While the chief minister did not make any reference, his remark appeared to target AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi who recently demanded the withdrawal of CAA. “I am asking followers of ‘chacha jaan’ (uncle) and ‘abba jaan’ to listen carefully that if attempts are made to vitiate the atmosphere of the state by inciting feelings, the state government will deal with it strictly,” he said.In September, the chief minister had sparked a row by using the Urdu term for ‘father’, saying that rations distributed by the previous state government went to those who say “abba jaan”.In a direct attack later, Adityanath called the Hyderabad-based leader, whose party is contesting the coming UP assembly elections, an agent of the Samajwadi Party.“Everyone knows that Owaisi is inciting feelings as an agent of the SP. But now UP is not known for riots but as a riot-free state,” he said.Assuring stern action against rioters, Adityanath said: “Our government does not protect rioters but run bulldozers on their chest.” Taking a swipe at the chief minister for his remarks, Owaisi tweeted: “Not a bulldozer, they mowed down with ‘Thar’. Those who were mowed down were not rioters or mafia. They were farmers of Lakhimpur Kheri.”The AIMIM chief was referring to the October 5 Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including four farmers, lost their lives after a vehicle belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ ran over cultivators protesting against the agricultural laws. Farmers alleged that the minister’s son, Ashish, was present inside the vehicle.“And the father (of the main accused) is still a minister. ‘Thonk dengey waley Baba, I am the agent of those who got India freedom and those who kept citizenship of Indian away from religion,” Owaisi added. Meanwhile, BJP president J P Nadda, who paid obeisance at Namdev gurdwara in Kanpur, asserted that no other leader has done the kind of work that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done for the Sikh community.He also credited Modi with ensuring that copies of Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib reached India from Afghanistan.“Being a soldier of the BJP, I bow my head at the feet of Guru Namdev ji and say with pride that no one else has done the work that our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done for the Sikh community and the Sikh brothers,” he told people at the gurdwara.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done a lot of work for the Sikh community and has fulfilled their old demands. The prime minister has sent those involved in the 1984 riots to jail, no matter how influential they were,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-inflame-passions-over-caa-yogi-warns-abba-jaan-101637694175449.html
24-11-2021||India||Ahead of winter session, Congress calls internal meeting to plan House strategy||The renewed importance of the winter session of Parliament, one that will see repeal of the three contentious farm laws, has prompted the Congress party to call an internal, brainstorming meeting on November 25 to strategise for the session.The meeting, to be attended by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former party chief Rahul Gandhi, and party’s floor leaders, among others, will finalize the Congress’s list of demands related to the repeal bill of the three laws. The party is not in favour of continuous disruptions in the session and doesn’t want a repeat of the washed out monsoon session, senior Congress leaders insisted.The meeting is also expected to take a holistic view on other key issues, opportunities of floor coordination and the general direction of the party in both Houses of Parliament.The meeting assumes significance as the winter session would be the last full session available to the parties ahead of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand, as many of the leaders would be invariably out campaigning during the budget session.The session might also test the complex camaraderie between the Congress and the Trinamool Congress — the two parties accounting for 120 MPs in Parliament. The outfits had acted together in the previous (monsoon) session, resulting in its near washout. But this winter, the gaps between an aspirational Trinamool and a struggling Congress is widening.The uneasiness has even crept in an otherwise excellent equation of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The Trinamool chief has been camping in Delhi since Monday, but according to her aides, she has not sought any appointment with Gandhi.Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha, Jairam Ramesh, said in an interview to HT that the House must run in the session. “Let us have a well-informed debate to revisit why those acts were made. I would certainly like this session to function normally. I do not want a repeat of the monsoon session. The washout was forced upon us by the government,” he said.The Congress will support the proposal to form a committee to look into farm issues, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19. But it also wants to debate the situation in Afghanistan and India’s neighbourhood scenario, the border situation in the light of the India-China conflict and a debate on environmental issues in the light of the Modi’s promises in the Glasgow climate summit.Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will call an all-party meeting for their respective Houses. The government has called an all-party meeting on November 28, to be attended by the Prime Minister, to discuss the farm repeal bills and the proposed committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-winter-session-congress-calls-internal-meeting-to-plan-house-agenda-101637693997027.html
24-11-2021||India||Chinese cemetery of 1962 war, Galwan clashes to serve as ‘education base’||A high-altitude, wind-swept military cemetery in Xinjiang which houses the tombs of more than 100 Chinese soldiers who died fighting Indian troops during the 1962 war and in the Galwan Valley clash last year is being renovated to serve as a base for patriotic education.The desolate cemetery was designated a Communist Party of China (CPC) “education base” in September, and large-scale renovation work is currently ongoing, a report published by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) portal said last weekend.The designation of the Kangxiwar Martyrs’ Cemetery as a patriotic education base and its renovation was hastened after a Chinese travel blogger managed to enter the site in July and click smiling selfies, triggering an online furore in the country.On November 15, the blogger was jailed for seven months for dishonouring dead soldiers.The cemetery is likely the first such “patriotic education base” in connection with Sino-India military history.“Patriotic education” or “demonstration” bases are a strategic part of the ruling CPC’s efforts to spread party propaganda in the country, especially this year, the CPC’s 100th anniversary.As of 2019 September, there were more than 470 such bases in China.The Kangxiwar Martyrs’ Cemetery, located 4,280 metres, or more than 14,000 feet, above sea level in the Karakorum mountains in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), is China’s highest cemetery.Located some 100km from a stretch of the disputed Sino-India border, it was built in 1965 to commemorate dozens of PLA soldiers killed in the 1962 India-China war.Currently, it houses gravestones in memory of 108 Chinese troops, including four who China acknowledged were killed in Galwan Valley in June 2020 during the border clash with Indian soldiers. The remains of many have also been moved to the deceased’s home towns.In September, the cemetery was designated as a patriotic education base by the Xinjiang government following the launch of the renovation project in August.“In August this year, the renovation project of the cemetery with the theme of ‘Heroes of Border Defence, Monument of the Plateau’ was officially launched and is expected to be completed in November next year. It is a great consolation to the (deceased) heroes and their families,” the official PLA portal said in a report last weekend.Chinese travel blogger Li Qixian triggered an online storm after posting photos of himself stepping on a stone engraved with the name of the cemetery.Li then posed next to the tomb of Chen Xiangrong, one of the four PLA soldiers killed at Galwan Valley, with a smile on his face and pointing his fingers at the tomb in a pistol-like gesture.Li is now in jail for “infringing upon the reputation and honour of the martyrs.”He has been blacklisted by China’s tourism authors and is expected to make a televised public confession this week.At least nine persons have so far been arrested, detained or have had proceedings initiated against them for insulting the “PLA heroes and martyrs” online.China passed a law in 2018 that criminalised the act of insulting or slandering “heroes and martyrs”.Those found guilty face up to three years’ in jail under an amendment to the law that took effect this March, just weeks after China acknowledged its Galwan Valley casualty figures for the first time, though the number is disputed by security officials in India.During investigation into how Li could access the cemetery, military and civilian authorities found that the cemetery had fallen into disrepair. Investigators, according to the online report, found that the memorial facilities were broken and inscriptions on tombs had blurred.“The overall facility was outdated and in disrepair, and there was no special place for displaying historical materials of heroes and martyrs,” the report said.Interestingly, the remains of more PLA soldiers were found in the area, the report said, adding that authorities were conducting DNA tests to identify them.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-cemetery-of-1962-war-galwan-clashes-to-serve-as-education-base-101637693995740.html
24-11-2021||India||Cabinet may clear draft legislation to repeal farm laws today||The Union cabinet is likely to approve a draft bill on Wednesday to set in motion a legislative process to repeal three contentious farm laws at the heart of a massive year-long farmers’ agitation.An official familiar with the development said the draft bill has been vetted by the law department.The Cabinet’s nod will allow the government to table the “repeal bill” in Parliament to revoke three separate laws enacted by the government in Sept 2020 to liberalise trade in farm produce.A bulletin from the Lok Sabha on Tuesday evening listed the The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 as one of the 26 pieces of legislation to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament, which begins on November 29.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Nov 19 announced that his government will revoke the laws during the winter session of Parliament. The laws had drawn out tens of thousands of farmers in protests.Under Article 245, Parliament is vested with powers to both pass and annul laws. If Parliament is in recess, the government can repeal or enact laws by bringing an ordinance, which needs to be ratified by Parliament later.The legislative process of passing, amending or scrapping a legislation is largely the same, experts said. A fresh repealing bill needs to be approved by Parliament in case of junking an existing law.“A bill to repeal an existing law and its passage is all that is needed. It has to be passed by a majority like any other law,” said GC Malhotra, former secretary general of the Lok Sabha.The three farm laws that will be repealed are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.These laws were aimed to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce, allow food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreement.Farm unions say the legislation would leave them at the mercy of large corporations, leaving them with little bargaining power.The decision to scrap the laws comes ahead of crucial state elections in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous, bellwether state, and Punjab, where farmers are an influential voting bloc....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-may-clear-draft-legislation-to-repeal-farm-laws-today-101637693816835.html
24-11-2021||India||Tripura: SC refuses to delay municipal polls, asks for report on unrest||Municipal elections will not be postponed in Tripura but police will have to submit within two days an action-taken report on incidents of violence in the state ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Supreme Court said on Tuesday.“Postponing elections is a matter of last and extreme resort,” a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Vikram Nath said. “While we are not inclined to accede to the prayer for postponing polls, we are equally of the view that it is the duty of the director general of police (DGP), the inspector general of police (IGP – law and order) and the home secretary of the state of Tripura to assuage any misgivings about the fairness of the law enforcement machinery in supporting the electoral process.”The top court was hearing a petition by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) alleging contempt against the Tripura administration and police for failing to ensure a safe environment for campaigning to take place ahead of the municipal polls for 334 seats in urban local bodies. This includes 13 municipal councils, six nagar panchayats, and 51 wards of Agartala municipal corporation.The last date for campaigning ended on Tuesday. Voting is to take place on Thursday, followed by counting of votes on Monday.Hours after the apex court judgment, the Tripura police said that measures were taken to ensure free and peaceful civic polls on November 25 in over 200 seats. The ruling BJP has already won uncontested 112 out of the total 334 seats earlier.A total of 644 polling stations have been set up of which 370 have been identified as ‘ A’ category and rest 274 as ‘B’ category. Four Tripura State Rifles and armed police personnel each would be deployed in ‘A’ and ‘B’ category polling stations. Additionally, two sections of Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF) were deployed at strong room and government press. All returning officers and observers were provided personal security officers.“After the directions of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, additional 15 sections of CRPF are also being provided for the Agartala municipal elections and outside,” said a statement from the assistant inspector general of police.Police said it registered 57 cases, launched a special drive to execute total 161 pending warrants and made 433 preventive arrests after announcement of the civic polls. “DGP Tripura calls upon all the eligible voters to exercise their franchise fearlessly and freely. Tripura police has made elaborate arrangements to ensure free and fair elections,” said the statement quoted above.Earlier in the day, the TMC, represented by lawyers Jaideep Gupta and Gopal Sankaranarayanan, painted a grim picture of the situation in the state, saying that violence against their candidates and party functionaries continued unabated even as police remained a mute spectator. The party earlier secured an order on November 11, when the top court directed police and state authorities to secure a free and unhindered environment for the petitioner to exercise their political rights.“It is a complete terror state,” Sankaranarayanan said, pointing out how the court’s order was flouted as he listed out 17 complaints where no arrests were made. Gupta informed the judges that several opposition candidates have withdrawn their candidatures fearing a threat to life. He referred to a news report to show that the BJP is set to win 112 seats even prior to the elections, as their candidates are unopposed. Both lawyers requested the court to postpone the polls by a week to restore confidence of political parties and the electorate.Concerned over these allegations, the bench called for a report on the deployment of security forces in the state. In addition to the three battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), two more CRPF battalions are being drafted at Agartala, said advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for the state.These were in addition to the Tripura Rifles and local police, he said. On the allegation of inaction on first information reports (FIRs), Jethmalani accused the petitioners of making a mountain out of a molehill as the allegations pertained to scuffles and minor offences for which arrests were not necessary.The bench issued a slew of directions, asking the DGP and IGP to hold an emergency meeting with the state election commission on the eve of the polls and assess requirement of further deployment of central paramilitary troops in critical areas. In view of the additional requirement, the court said that upon such a request being made to the Union home ministry, the same shall be duly considered.With a direction already issued by the apex court on November 11 asking police to submit an action-taken report detailing steps taken to ensure free and fair polls, the bench supplemented it with an order asking the state to provide a chart showing each complaint received, registration of FIR, action taken pursuant to it, and arrests made.Requiring the information by the next date of hearing on Thursday, the bench said, “The law enforcement agencies must discharge their duties in an evenhanded and non-partisan manner to obviate the grievance which has been urged before this court that candidates and supporters of the AITC (All India Trinamool Congress) are being unfairly targeted by contesting political groups.”The affidavit to be filed by the state will have to contain detailed steps taken on multiple fronts – preserve law and order, ensure security for political workers, voters and contesting candidates, protect the electoral process leading up to the counting of votes and the declaration of the results, and to deal with criminal offenders.The direction came with a subtle warning by the judges. “The DGP and state home secretary shall observe these directions scrupulously so as to obviate the need for the court to adopt coercive steps in the event that a breach of its directions comes to light,” the judges said.The BJP criticised the TMC over the issue.“The Supreme Court rejected the petitions filed by the All India Trinamool Congress to postpone the civic polls. The verdict of the apex court is victory of democracy and Tripura people. We have been observing the conspiracy that was hatched to mar the polls that came to light now,” said state law minister Ratan Lal Nath.Another BJP leader, Sudip Roy Barman, appeared to criticise the party’s leadership. “The childish leadership of the parachuted leader failed to identify the main political opponents. I don’t have any personal quarrel but some activities going on here are marring the name of party and the party leadership, “ he said.TMC leader Kunal Ghosh said, “We welcome Sudip Roy Barman that he unveiled the mask of the BJP hooligans. The TMC has gained mass acceptance in the state and that’s why, the BJP is taking attempts to obstruct the polling. Instead of attacking the oppositions and harassing common people, the ruling BJP should show us if they can drop him from the party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-in-tripura-supreme-court-refuses-to-delay-municipal-polls-asks-for-report-on-unrest-101637693696463.html
24-11-2021||India||‘Jaganmohan has damaged the brand that was Andhra’: Chandrababu Naidu||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader Chandrababu Naidu broke down in the Andhra Pradesh assembly on Friday, vowing not to re-enter the House till he becomes chief minister again. He spoke about his plans and the outburst that surprised many. Edited excerpts: You broke down in the state assembly the other day and resolved not return to the House till you’re chief minister again. What caused the emotional outpouring that’s unusual for a leader of your experience and standing?I have fought many opponents in the 40 years of my public life. But what we’re facing today is unprecedented, be it corruption, misuse of power and victimisation of the people and the political class opposed to Jaganmohan Reddy. As chief minister, he tolerates no dissent. The police under him are one-sided in their approach. False cases have been registered against me and my party leaders and workers. Rowdy elements were sent to attack my residence. When my party (Telugu Desam) workers turned up in my defence, they were booked by police. They claimed the troublemakers came to discuss issues with me. I want to ask what issues do rowdy elements have to discuss with the leader of opposition who is an NSG (national security guard) protectee on account of the naxal threat? You talked about unpleasant references to your wife during the assembly proceedings.Andhra has become a hub for drugs. They’re commercially cultivating ganja worth ₹20,000 crore per annum on 25,000 acres of land. We raised the issue in the media and on the streets. That led to an attack on the Telugu Desam party headquarters. In the assembly session that followed, they character assassinated my wife, who is not in politics.Was she attacked because she’s from a political family, being the late NTR’s daughter and your wife? Yes. By singling us out, Jaganmohan is signalling to others that he’d brook no opposition. He wants to muzzle dissent to silence people into submission. Isn’t your image of a strong leader compromised by the way you broke down, deciding not to show up during the tenure of the current assembly?I’m strong but at the same time, I’m human and sentimental. That’s my self-image and that of the political class and public servants we need.Elections in Andhra are due in April 2024. In the long interregnum, how would you fulfil the mandate to be the opposition? Will all 23 Telugu Desam MLAs boycott the assembly?We’ll decide on our MLAs’ role before the next assembly session. We respect the fact that we were voted to sit in the opposition. Our task is to raise questions the government has to answer. But they’re not allowing us to speak, leave alone responding to our arguments. Instead of handing us the mike, they abuse us, using filthy language. I’ll go to the people to tell them that the chief minister is subverting the role they willed for us. He wants to destroy all opposition. I’m targeted personally because I’m an obstacle to his nefarious designs. But I’d keep fighting to restore Andhra’s prestige and that of its people, especially women. You also faced Jaganmohan’s father YS Rajasekhara Reddy when he was chief minister. How’s it different now?Rajasekhara was a political opponent with whom one could fight on issues. Even he couldn’t control his son, who always relied on strong-arm, unlawful tactics. He’s a threat to the political and social life of Andhra, which we had turned into a global brand. He has damaged the attributes that made the state the destination of world leaders such as Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Mahathir Mohamad. Be it the legislature, the executive or the judiciary, our entire democratic ecosystem is in peril on account of his shenanigans. Hasn’t Jaganmohan shown sensitivity to public opinion by withdrawing the legislations he brought to set up three state capitals?He reversed the laws to pre-empt an adverse court decision. He didn’t repeal them out of respect for popular sentiment. He has no regard for what people think or want. He told the assembly that he’d reintroduce the bills after changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaganmohan-has-damaged-the-brand-that-was-andhra-he-wants-to-muzzle-dissent-eliminate-all-opposition-chandrababu-naidu-101637693455019.html
24-11-2021||India||India, Russia close to sealing AK-203 deal||India is working towards concluding a ₹5,100-crore deal with Russia to jointly manufacture AK-203 assault rifles at a facility in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India next month for an annual summit, officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The defence ministry on Tuesday gave its final clearance to the proposed deal, HT has learnt.The joint venture between Kalashnikov and a new weapons manufacturing division carved out of the erstwhile Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) seeks to provide a push to the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India campaign).The project envisages the production of up to 700,000 AK-203 assault rifles. All outstanding issues relating to cost and indigenous content in the weapons have been ironed out and India’s defence ministry is looking at an early conclusion of the deal, one of the officials cited above said.“There are no pending issues and the Amethi facility is ready to kick off production next year after the deal is signed,” said another official. Both officials declined to be named.In August 2020, the defence acquisition council (DAC) – India’s apex military procurement body – granted some key approvals to accelerate the acquisition of AK-203 assault rifles to be made in India with transfer of technology from Russia.The government has taken a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector over the past two years. These include raising foreign direct investment in defence manufacturing, creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying 209 defence items, including assault rifles, which cannot be imported.India set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent more than ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation seven new defence companies carved out of OFB. He said these entities will play a critical role in helping the country cut down military imports in line with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. One of those units, Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited, will be involved in manufacturing the AK-203 rifles.Putin’s two-day visit to India for the annual summit, expected to be held on December 6, will have a major defence and security overhang. The delivery of the first squadron of S-400 air defence systems – part of a $5.4-billion contract with Russia for five systems – is expected to coincide with Putin’s visit.India and Russia are also expected to renew their military-technical cooperation arrangement for the period 2021-31 and sign several defence-related agreements during the summit, people familiar with planning for the meeting said on condition of anonymity. A key pact that could be inked is the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), which will allow militaries of the two nations to access logistics and support facilities at each other’s bases.India is also looking at the acquisition of additional Su 30-MKI and MiG-29 combat jets and 400 more T-90 tanks from Russia.The maiden India-Russia 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers, which was earlier to be held during November, is now expected to be held around the same time as the annual summit. The developments in Afghanistan and related challenges such as terrorism and drug trafficking are expected to figure in the 2+2 dialogue.India currently has 2+2 dialogues only with the US, Australia and Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-close-to-sealing-ak-203-deal-101637692974392.html
24-11-2021||India||Mahant Giri was living in mental trauma, being threatened by disciple: CBI||Mahant Narendra Giri, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, the apex body of all Hindu monastic orders, was living in such grave mental trauma due to the threat and fear created by Anand Giri, Adhya Prasad Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari that he was compelled to die by suicide on September 20 at Baghambari Math in Prayagraj, according to the charge sheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on November 20. Although Mahant Narendra Giri was under psychological pressure for months, a threat by Anand Giri to circulate purported objectionable videos and audios of the Mahant and a woman triggered him to take the extreme step that day “to avoid defamation and insult in the eyes of society, his followers and devotees”, added the charge sheet, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT. The threat was first issued by Anand Giri on May 23 during a call between him, Mahant Ravinder Puri of Niranjani Akhara (Haridwar) and Narendra Giri. The call was supposed to iron out differences between Anand Giri and the Mahant over his expulsion from Baghambari Gaddi and Bade Hanuman Temple for alleged misappropriation of funds and continuing to maintain close ties with his family, which is against the tradition of a sanyasi. The Mahant had also removed Adhya Prasad Tiwari and his elder son Dilip Tiwari as priests of the Bade Hanuman temple and took back a flower shop inside the premises, run by Tiwari’s younger son, Sandeep Tiwari. “During the said conversation, accused Anand Giri threatened Mahant Narendra Giri that he is in possession of many objectionable audio and videos. The wordings of Anand Giri were – ‘Mai aapko bhejunga to apke pairo ki zameen khisak jayegi aise aise video, audio mere pass hai (you will be shocked to know the kind of videos and audio I have on you)’,” stated the charge sheet.CBI says Narendra Giri was under so much duress following the threat that he asked from a few people whether videos/photos of one person can be edited showing face of other person with the help of computer.“On September 20, he (the Mahant) also told Manish Kumar Shukla and Abhishek Mishra (his disciples) that he was very disturbed as he had received reliable information that Anand Giri was going to release edited videos showing him with some woman,” according to the charge sheet. Narendra Giri also spoke to Mahant Santosh Dass alias Satuaa Baba in Varanasi about this. Santosh Das is the chief of the Satuaa Baba ashram near Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi.In the run up to the suicide, between September 10 and 12, Narendra Giri also indirectly enquired from a couple of his disciples about Celphos (a fumigant) and the time it takes someone to die after consuming it, the agency has claimed. And a day before dying by suicide, he asked his disciple Sarvesh Dwivedi to bring a nylon rope from the market to fix it on the roof for drying clothes.He was found hanging in mysterious circumstances inside the Math on September 20; he left behind a seven-page suicide note blaming the accused. CBI filed the charge sheet in the case on Saturday in the court of the chief judicial magistrate in Allahabad charging the three accused of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy. Describing the motive behind the crime, the agency said that the accused hatched a criminal conspiracy to compel/force Mahant Narendra Giri to revoke Anand Giri’s expulsion as well as return the flower shop to the Tiwaris, It adds that their objective was to get “their position in the Baghambari Gaddi and Bade Hanuman Mandir back” and that “ in pursuance thereof (they) humiliated and harassed (Narendra Giri) mentally and psychologically”. All three accused are currently in judicial custody. Advocate Sunil Pandey, one of the lawyers appearing for Anand Giri and the other accused, said, “Narendra Giri and Anand Giri were ‘Guru and Shishya’, the dispute between the two was a misunderstanding due to formation of one ‘Ganga Sena’ by Anand Giri as Narendra Giri wanted that Anand Giri must concentrate on the Baghambari Gaddi and not on creating any such outfit or body . However, the misunderstanding was cleared but some people surrounding Narendra Giri tried to take advantage of the situation.”“CBI has filed a voluminous document and at present we are going through the charge sheet. Once done, we will file a bail application before the high court,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahant-giri-was-living-in-mental-trauma-being-threatened-by-disciple-cbi-charge-sheet-101637692914372.html
24-11-2021||India||Bill to ban cryptocurrency part of govt’s Parliament agenda||A bill that “seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India” is among 26 pieces of legislation planned to be brought to Parliament in the session beginning next week, according to a Lok Sabha release on Tuesday -- the clearest sign yet that the Union government is moving to ban instruments such as Bitcoin for transactions in the country.India at present has no regulation for cryptocurrencies – a set of decentralised digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that are not regulated by any sovereign banking regulator. No official data is available but industry estimates suggest there are 15 million to 20 million crypto investors in India, with total crypto holdings of around ₹40,000 crore ($5.39 billion), Reuters reported, although some exchanges peg this value as high as $10 billion. The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 seeks “to create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The Bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses,” said the bulletin issued by the Lok Sabha. On November 13, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to discuss the future of cryptocurrencies, amid concerns that unregulated crypto markets could become avenues for money laundering and terror financing, a person aware of the matter said, asking not to be named. The RBI had in 2018 banned the banking system from cryptocurrency transactions, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2020.It is unclear as of now the nature of options the government may or may not give for people who hold cryptocurrencies, although people aware of the matter have said in the past that people could be allowed a window to liquidate their holdings and pay taxes on gains.“After the meeting, it was agreed that various unscrupulous elements are trying to mislead Indian youth by positioning cryptocurrency as the shortest, quickest and surest way to become rich. Similarly, several people are indulging in non-transparent advertising, risking gullible people, which the government wants to be stopped,” said the person quoted above. The meeting was held after consultations with experts in government agencies and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), after which the government concluded that these should be banned. Independent stakeholders, including the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) urged the government to put in regulation instead of an outright ban.A senior leader from an opposition party, who asked not to be named, said they will ask for “the bill to be referred to a parliamentary panel”.The government, however, intends to move ahead with a plan to authorise the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to float its own digital currency. Technically known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), these are distinct from cryptocurrencies in the manner that they are regulated by a centralised authority – the central bank. In India’s case, people aware of the matter said previously that this domestic digital currency could be initially pegged at a 1:1 ratio with the rupee. The bill could also allow for the use of technologies known as blockchain and distributed ledgers, which underpin the cryptocurrency mechanism but have been used also to create secure records and identity management.Countries are at present divided on how to approach the regulation of cryptocurrencies. According to an October 2021 note by Fitch Ratings, the exposure of American corporate and financial institutions to cryptocurrencies is predicted to grow – several companies, such as Tesla, have accepted Bitcoin for payments, and plan to resume doing so if concerns over their environmental impacts are addressed.On September 24, China banned cryptocurrencies and rolled out its own digital currency, known as the e-CNY.A Fitch report on CBDCs from May 2021 said such digital currencies have the potential to boost cashless payments and wider digitalisation of economies. “For central banks in some emerging markets, a key driver for researching CBDCs is the opportunity to bring underbanked communities into the financial system, and improve the cost, speed and resilience of payments.”“The world’s biggest economies and their central banks have announced they are working on CBDCs: the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank are trailing behind the People’s Bank of China, which already is testing its CBDC with more than 50,000 citizens. The Bahamas issued its central bank digital currency – the “sand dollar” – in October,” it added.The difference between a decentralised and centralised currency is at the heart of the arguments for and against both kinds of digital currencies. While cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin offer anonymity of the nature of cash bills and draw their value from its demand and supply, they do not carry any sovereign guarantees making collapses in value immitigable. On the other hand, CBDCs do not carry such risks but they do not offer the anonymity of cash. Additionally, experts have raised concerns over the impact on banking institutions that currently act as intermediaries in the financial system.“This is a big moment for India. From a banking ban in 2018 to listing the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 in the Parliament’s winter session. Our nation has come a long way in these 3 years! It speaks volumes about how India is determined to dominate the web 3.0 era,” said Nischal Shetty, founder of Wazirx, a cryptocurrency exchange. “While the description of the draft bill appears to be the same as in January 2021, several noteworthy events have occurred since January. First, the Parliamentary Standing Committee invited a public consultation, and then our Prime Minister himself came forward to call for crypto regulations in India. That being said, let’s respectfully wait to find out more about the draft bill to be tabled in the Parliament,” Shetty added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-ban-crypto-part-of-govt-s-parl-agenda-101637692855736.html
24-11-2021||India||Odisha man says 63 chickens died due to ‘loud music’; complaint filed||The queer case of a wedding and 63 funerals is playing out at Kandagaradi village in Odisha’s Balasore district, leaving local police bemused.The wedding was that of Ramachandra Parida’s daughter. At 11 pm on Sunday night, the wedding procession entered the village. As is the norm these days, even in villages, there was a DJ, loud music, even fireworks.The deaths (not funerals), were of 63 chickens in a poultry farm belonging to Ranjit Parida, Ramachandra Parida’s neighbour, who claims his birds died of shock from the loud music. He also claims that he argued with the wedding party about the loudness of their music, but to no avail. The roughly 2000 birds in his poultry farm were agitated by the music, he adds. And 63 died. On Monday, he filed a complaint at the Nilagiri police station alleging that the birds died of shock from the loud music and the fireworks.Ramchandra Parida claims that the allegation is frivolous. “So many broiler chickens are transported on the road every day amid blaring horns. How is it possible that the birds in his farm died due to DJ music? In any case we lowered the volume of the music.”Nilagiri police station inspector-in-charge Droupadi Das said she has called both Paridas for a discussion on the complaint. “Such a case is completely new for me. We are yet to register the case and may to have consult a veterinarian.”Parida, 22, an engineering graduate who in 2019 borrowed ₹200,000 from a local cooperative to start his farm said he tried to revive the chickens after they collapsed. He adds that he checked with a veterinary doctor who said that it was the loud noise that killed the birds.He initially sought compensation from his neighbour, but after it was refused, filed the complaint.Prof Suryakanta Mishra, a zoology professor who had authored a book on animal behaviour, said that loud noise does increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in birds. “Chickens are governed by a circadian rhythm that is controlled by the natural light/dark cycle of day and night. As such, chickens mostly rest and are inactive at night, especially when it is dark. Sudden excitement or stress due to loud music could disrupt their biological clock.”No details are available on what music the DJ was playing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-man-says-63-chickens-died-due-to-loud-music-complaint-filed-101637692374357.html
24-11-2021||India||Third wave of pandemic won’t be as severe as previous ones: AIIMS director||The third wave of the coronavirus pandemic may not have the same severity as the first two as fewer Covid-19 cases in India indicate that the vaccines have been effective in providing protection against the viral disease, All India Institute of Medical Sciences director Randeep Guleria said on Tuesday.“It is unlikely that the third wave of Covid-19 of a magnitude comparable to the first and second will hit India. With time, the pandemic will take an endemic form. We'll continue to get cases but the severity will be highly reduced,” Guleria was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.India has been witnessing a fall in its daily tally of Covid-19 cases for a week now. On Tuesday, the country logged 7,579 infections—the lowest in 543 days and also the second consecutive day that new cases remained below the 10,000-mark.Guleria also said that there is no need for booster doses right now since there is no surge in Covid-19 cases but the government should focus on inoculating those who still have not taken a single dose and also on those whose second jab is overdue.The AIIMS director, however, asked people to exercise caution. “We have to be watchful and careful of all the viruses in the world in this world of quick mobility,” he said.Guleria was speaking at the book launch of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava’s ‘Going Viral: Making of Covaxin - The Inside Story’.ICMR’s Bhargava also said that there is currently no scientific evidence to support the need for a booster vaccine dose against Covid-19.On Monday, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya held a meeting with officials to discuss low vaccination rates in Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Puducherry. These states and Union Territories are yet to inoculate at least 70 per cent of their population with the first dose.The government has also launched the month-long ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign for inoculating those who are yet to get their first dose and also vaccinating those who are overdue on their second dose.India is aiming to vaccinate its entire population by the end of this year but low vaccination rates in certain states coupled with people delaying their second dose could be a cause of concern, according to some medical experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-wave-of-pandemic-won-t-be-as-severe-as-previous-ones-aiims-director-101637686974345.html
24-11-2021||India||A mother daughter duo and a news podcast||Stuck inside all summer during the nasty old COVID-19 pandemic, all Leela Sivasankar Prickitt and her mother Lyndee Prickitt could do to feel connected to the world was report on it. And so Newsy Pooloozi, a podcast was born!In a candid chat, they spill the beans on their initiative to connect to the world via a podcast. What inspired you to do a children’s news podcast which is a very rare thing?Leela: Both my parents are journalists so if I wanted a say in the conversation, I needed to know the news. Since the lockdown we were stuck in our Delhi apartment which is kind of boring and mamma over here was sick of baking, believe it or not. I started baking by myself too but that`s not anything compared to Newsy Pooloozi. I was a podcast nerd. I listened to podcasts at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and every time in between. We decided why don’t we start a podcast because even mamma liked podcasts but we also thought about what kind of podcast. A news podcast I had never heard of so I said why not a world news podcast. There are a few world news podcasts out there.Lyndee: Actually there are a few children’s news podcasts but none of them are world news. Basically, it started as a lockdown project because being stuck in a hot Delhi apartment and being sick of baking what else could we do with our time and since Leela was such a podcast fanatic, when I mentioned would you like to start your own podcast, she was so excited that she literally jumped on the sofa.Why did you name the podcast Newsy Jacuzzi?Leela: We didn’t. Our family did, my dad actually recommended the name.Lyndee: Because we wanted something fun the kids would like and boy they had fun saying it, Leela and all the other kids. All the kids correspondents and Leela especially love saying it and it fits because Jacuzzi is like a bubbling, whirling, swirling pool and that`s kind of what news can be too. It’s like all this news is bubbling around you. But we have changed and when we rebranded we wanted something equally fun to say.Did you face any hardships in re-branding the podcast? Lyndee: Well, when we found out the news it was pretty stressful. Yes, there were some tears but no blood thankfully, but there were some tears. We weren’t that emotional but it was stressful. It had become like a part of the family. It was something we created together and it was pretty emotional and also happened around the time of Leela’s birthday. It was pretty rotten. But you know, we just roll with the punches and now we are just figuring out how to get around it and so it made us tougher. It kind of showed us some life lessons, toughened us up a bit.Leela: We banged our heads against the wall, kidding. I loved the name Newsy Jacuzzi. It also happened around my birthday and sort of came like a present, a horrible surprise. It made me tougher, I don’t know how exactly but it just did because I have gone through a hard experience so I think that if another hard experience comes any day now, I will be pretty okay with it, not thoroughly okay but I would know how to handle it. What kind of news do you cover in the podcast? Lyndee: We always start with the big news story of the week, which can be politics or whatever is current in the news around the world but sometimes its science because science is absolutely underplayed in the mainstream media and is absolutely fascinating especially to kids so we always love to have science stories, we call them the World of Wow. We also have ace stories that are arts, culture, and entertainment and in culture, we like to feature a lot of different cultural events, festivals. We do festivals whether it’s religious or secular festivals from around the world so Halloween, Diwali, Eid, the hungry ghost festival, you name it. If it is happening in the world we want to bring it to kids’ attention and that’s how we like to spread knowledge and information. We also do text stories and we also like to end with an oddball to keep you smiling. Yes, we also have a silly story at the endLeela: It’s not silly, it`s educationalLyndee: Yeah, it’s an educational story that’s a bit silly to make sure you end the podcast with a smile.How has this affected your relationship with your daughter?Lyndee: It is interesting because this happened during the lockdown when I also had to be her virtual assistant teacher so I was her mom, her producer, and her assistant teacher and at a certain point it became too much. I said to Leela I can be your mom, I can be your producer, your assistant teacher but I cannot be all three. One of them has got to go and I don’t want to not be your mother and out of these, she said the assistant teacher is out of the window. So, she prefers me as her producer rather than an assistant teacher because that was really becoming stressful. So, you know we had to find a new way of working and in some ways, it was interesting because as her parent I had to rely a lot on her. Usually, as a parent of a young kid, you are the one that`s always relied upon so there’s been a change in the dynamic where we have to work well together and you know what they say doesn’t work with animals and children now I know why. No, I am just kidding. In some parts, I am really tense but for most parts, it’s really fun and it`s for sure made us closer.What are the future plans for the podcast?Lyndee: Well, first of all, we are going to get some really cool merchandise. We are already getting it together. Some business cards, some pencils, some stickers, t-shirts because we are now Newsy Pooloozi so we thought why don’t we celebrate and maybe also add mugs and water bottles. We have two other bits of information we would like to share. We have just signed some contracts with some really interesting and totally different companies. One is ‘DIY.org’, they produce educational training videos for kids and we are about to be doing their ‘How to make a podcast’ video series for them and that’s exciting. The second thing is that our content every week is going to be licensed and going to be taken for a program that helps children learn how to read called `Listen wise’. They are based in America and work with 1000 of schools and they want some of our content so that they can help the kids be interested in world events, so those are some exciting things coming on the horizon for us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-mother-daughter-duo-and-a-news-podcast-101637668013417.html
24-11-2021||India||Manish Tewari’s views on UPA action after 26/11 attacks trigger controversy||Congress’ Member of Parliament Manish Tewari’s announcement of his upcoming book created a controversy when its excerpts seemed to suggest that the former union minister was in favour of a tougher response to the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks or 26/11 attacks as they’ve come to be known. The attack, orchestrated by handlers from Pakistan, saw 10 Lashkare-Taiba terrorists come in from the sea and take hostages at the Taj mahal Palace Hotel and the Oberoi Hotel for 60 hours. By the end of the attack, 172 people were dead.The contentious passage of the book 10 Flashpoints; 20 Years as released by Rupa publications reads: ``For a state that has no compunctions in brutally slaughtering hundreds of innocent people, restraint is not a sign of strength; it is perceived as a symbol of weakness. There comes a time when actions must speak louder than words. 26/11 was one such time when it just should have been done. It, therefore, is my considered opinion that India should have actioned a kinetic response in the days following India’s 9/11.’’Tewari didn’t respond to HT’s queriesAt that time, Tewari was an official spokesperson of the Congress party and in UPA 2, he became the Information and Broadcasting minister. The Bhartiya Janata party lost no time in using the excerpt to attack the Congress. Party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said that the book proved how ``useless’ the UPA government was and how it was ``soft on Pakistan’’. ``Instead of focussing on countering Pakistan, they were busy with “saffron terror”,’’ said Bhatia, referring to what the BJP and some right wing groups see as an attempt by the then government to foist fake cases against Hindu organisations. Other senior BJP leaders including CT Ravi and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi also attacked the opposition party.Lok Sabha floor leader of the Congress Adhir Chowdhury said, “Tewari should focus more on China that has captured many of our areas in Ladakh and built villages in Arunachal Pradesh. He is regaining consciousness now. Why had he not talked about it that time?”Tewari only response to the controversy was to tweet: “I am rather amused at @BJP4India reaction to one excerpt from a 304 Page book that tries to dissect responses to National Security Situations that Impacted India.I wonder would they react similarly to some “hard analysis’ about their handling of the National Security Remit also?’’. Tewari is one of the group of 23 Congress leaders that have been campaigning for internal reform and democracy by holding elections to every party post.The Maharashtra government set up a high level inquiry commission after the attacks and Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist was hanged post a high profile trial. India ended peace talks with Pakistan and built international pressure for it to act against Lashkar and its terror activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/excerpts-from-new-book-suggest-tewari-wanted-tougher-response-to-26-11-attacks-101637665253167.html
24-11-2021||India||Galwan clash hero Colonel Santosh Babu awarded Maha Vir Chakra posthumously||Colonel B Santosh Babu, 37, who was killed during the clash with Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley in 2020, was on Tuesday posthumously awarded Maha Vir Chakra (MVC) for extraordinary courage and leadership, by President Ram Nath Kovind at an investiture ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. Babu’s widow, B Santoshi, and mother, B Manjula, received the award.The President also awarded Vir Chakra (VrC) to five other Galwan braves who fought off numerically superior Chinese troops on June 15, 2020. Four of them were awarded the VrC posthumously. The MVC is India’s second-highest wartime gallantry award followed by the VrC.The posthumous VrC awardees are Naib Subedar Nuduram Soren (16 Bihar), Havildar K Palani (81 Field) Naik Deepak Singh (16 Bihar) and Sepoy Gurtej Singh (3 Punjab). Havildar Tejinder Singh (3 Medium) was the only living recipient of the wartime honour. The brutal clash pushed the India-China bilateral relationship to a breaking point.The wartime honours given on Tuesday were announced by the government on Republic Day 2021.Babu’s citation said: “Undaunted by the violent and aggressive action by overwhelming strength of enemy soldiers, the officer in true spirit of service before self, continued to resist the enemy’s attempt to pushback Indian troops. Despite being grievously injured, Colonel Babu led from the front with absolute command and control despite hostile conditions to deter the vicious enemy attack at his position.”Also Read: China ties passing through bad patch, says JaishankarTwenty Indian soldiers were killed in the seven-hour deadly conflict near Patrolling Point (PP) 14 in Galwan Valley, where outnumbered Indian troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).Apart from 16 Bihar; soldiers from 3 Punjab, 3 Medium Regiment and 81 Field Regiment were involved in what was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in more than five decades.The first wave of fighting in Galwan Valley erupted around 6pm on June 15 after Colonel Babu led a squad of 30 soldiers to a location near PP-14 to verify if the PLA had removed some structures erected in the area despite an understanding reached on June 6 by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a disengagement plan to cool border tensions.The squad, however, found that a few tents and an observation post were still intact and the Chinese soldiers had not retreated from PP-14. The Indian soldiers confronted the Chinese troops, who refused to remove their installations and vacate the area, triggering a violent clash that involved more than 600 rival soldiers at its peak.Reversing the trust deficit created by the Galwan clash has proved to be enormously hard. India and China have been locked in a standoff in the Ladakh sector for over 18 months, and are currently negotiating a withdrawal of troops and weapons from friction points on the disputed border.India has deployed 50,000 to 60,000 troops and advanced weaponry in the Ladakh theatre to counter Chinese military buildup and the possibility of any misadventure by neighbour whose belligerent actions triggered the border standoff in early May 2020.The PLA did not agree to suggestions made by the Indian Army at the 13th round of talks on October 10. The Indian Army said it made constructive suggestions for resolving the outstanding problems on LAC but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals. China accused India of unreasonable and unrealistic demands in an unusually aggressive statement.Military talks are unlikely to result in a breakthrough and only higher intervention can show the way to resolving the 18-month border crisis, experts have said. There is no end in sight to the standoff, with army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane stating on October 9 that if PLA is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre so is the Indian Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-clash-hero-colonel-santosh-babu-awarded-maha-vir-chakra-posthumously-101637651092783.html
24-11-2021||Today's||The future of India’s coal ecosystem||At COP26 in Glasgow, India signed a climate pact promising to “phase down” coal. But critics held India responsible for diluting the language from a commitment to “phase out” coal — a claim Delhi rejected. The argument is that since coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels, it needs to go first, and the claim is that alternatives such as solar and wind are now increasingly available to replace coal.

Ambitions collided, they went their separate ways. Mulayam Singh, of course, became the much bigger leader — building on a Yadav-Muslim social alliance to become a formidable power centre in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and national politics. Ajit Singh was a marginal part of every conceivable political alliance, but failed to maintain his father’s wider peasant alliance and lost his own election both in 2014 and 2019.
24-11-2021||Editorials||When India and the US talk trade||When commerce minister Piyush Goyal met his American counterpart, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai, the recent past would have heavily weighed on both. The US has turned more suspicious of free trade — with a firmly entrenched narrative back home, which has outlasted Donald Trump, that trade has cost jobs. The Joe Biden administration has limited political capital to challenge the American Right and Left’s scepticism of trade, and has shifted focus to what it calls a “worker centred” trade policy. India has stayed away from a key regional trade pact, embraced the idea of self-reliance, and adopted a set of protectionist measures. But the government recognises that progress on bilateral trade ties with a set of valued partners is necessary for both economic and strategic reasons. Then, there is what can be a called a twin bilateral paradox. The first is that while the defence and security relationship has deepened, even signing a mini-trade deal has been difficult. The second is that even in the absence of a trade deal, trade figures are fairly robust and have bounced back smartly this year.
