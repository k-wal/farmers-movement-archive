With exams on online mode since past one and a half years during the Covid pandemic, the state government has now allowed college and university campuses to conduct offline classes and exams for fully vaccinated students. “We are working on conducting the next semester examinations offline and discussed the issue at the recent meeting held by the university. It was unanimously decided to conduct it in offline mode, and its detailed planning will start after the Diwali vacation,” said Mahesh Kakade, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) examination and evaluation department head. Students and student organisations are demanding to have both online and offline options for conducting exams. “I am still at my village in Nashik and would return next year due to financial reasons. As I am supporting my family now, it would be convenient if the exams are held online for the next semester too,” said Kedar Jambhale, a second-year Commerce student. Kamlakar Shete, student and vice-president of Yuvak Kranti Dal, Pune city said, “We conducted an online survey to take opinion of students about conducting exams, in which 11,000 participated and 93.04 per cent demanded to have online exams for the next semester.

18-11-2021||Mumbai||BMC shortlists contractors that BJP has accused of rigging tenders||In a fresh controversy, the bidders shortlisted for a tender floated by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) turned out to be the same who the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – which is in the opposition – has named as the cartel of contractors that has been favoured by the ruling Shiv Sena. The bids were opened on Thursday. The civic administration said it would verify the allegations levelled by BJP. Earlier this month, BMC had floated a tender for appointing seven different contractors to reinstate utility trenches across seven municipal zones. A day before the bidding was opened, BJP councillor Vinod Mishra had written to the municipal commissioner as well as the mayor, stating that the process of awarding the tenders was already fixed. He had also given a list of seven contractors who he said will be getting the contract on Thursday.Additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu on Thursday said that before taking the final step of awarding the contracts to the contractors, the BMC administration will be verifying all the allegations made by Mishra.The councillor had alleged that BMC has taken down a tender – which it had floated three ago – by amending its conditions to make sure that members of the alleged contractor lobby gets the contract. He claimed that the tender for carrying out trenching works was first floated in September. However, as the contractors quoted 25-30% lower prices than the estimated ones, the tender was cancelled.He said BMC had later floated another tender for the same project at an estimated price of ₹550 crore and the bidding was supposed to open on Thursday. Mishra said the earlier contract was valued around ₹380 crore, and for the latest contract, the contractors have quoted 15-20% below the estimated price.“To make sure the contract gets awarded to the favoured candidates, the administration made it mandatory for the contractors to have their own mastic plant in the latest tender. The contract is being awarded to seven different contractors who are part of a cartel. This whole thing was pre-decided and I had shared the details of the contractors to the municipal commissioner and mayor, a day before the bidding was opened,” said Mishra, who wrote to the administration, urging them to cancel the tender and issue a fresh one.When HT contacted a representative of one of the seven firms that has been shortlisted, which Mishra claimed to be part of the cartel, it said that the price quoted between the latest contract and the earlier contract is different as the cost of bitumen increased by 20% in the past month.“BMC will pay us only 80% after the project is completed and the remaining 20% will be paid after the maintenance period gets over,” the representative said.“Laying utility trenches is different from road construction as it requires more labourers. Besides, the price of raw materials has also increased, owing to which the price quoted now is higher than that of last time,” the representative said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-shortlists-contractors-that-bjp-has-accused-of-rigging-tenders-101637259304853.html
18-11-2021||Mumbai||Defamation suit: Nawab Malik, father of Sameer Wankhede present documents before court||The Bombay high court (HC) took on record three documents submitted by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra minority affairs minister Nawab Malik and two documents by Dyandeo Wankhede – the father of Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede – in the defamation suit filed by the latter, seeking injunction against the politician and his associates from posting or making any statement on social media till the suit was decided. In his defamation suit, Dyandeo Wankhede has sought ₹1.25 crore as damages and deletion of all articles, statements and comments made by Malik against the NCB zonal director and other members of the family. However, HC had said that it would only decide on the issue of injunction on future comments and statements made by Malik against Wankhede on any media platform. The single-judge bench of justice Madhav Jamdar, which had reserved its order after hearing arguments of both Wankhede and Malik on November 12, was approached by the politician’s counsel on Wednesday, seeking permission to submit additional documents pertaining to the suit. The bench permitted it and held the hearing of both the sides on Thursday in chambers. Senior advocate Atul Damle, representing Malik, submitted three documents, which included two primary school-leaving certificates and a primary admission certificate of Sameer Wankhede, which showed his name as Sameer Dawood Wankhede and religion Muslim. The admission certificate had the same information. The primary school leaving certificate is of St Paul School and admission form and school leaving certificate of St Joseph School. The documents submitted by Malik were to prove that he had not resorted to any defamatory act against the petitioner by stating that Sameer’s original name was Sameer Dawood Wankhede on Twitter, based on the documents shown by him previously and even on Thursday. Advocate Arshad Shaikh, who represented Dyandeo Wankhede, submitted two documents which included the birth certificate issued by the Mumbai civic body on November 17 and a 1974 caste certificate which showed that he belonged to the Mahar community. On November 12, Shaikh had submitted an affidavit listing 28 documents to substantiate that the petitioner’s name was Dyandeo and not Dawood as claimed by Malik. “It will be an unending process. He [Malik] kept quiet for four days and now he continues to write my son’s name as Sameer Dawood Wankhede. Malik’s contention is that Sameer’s name got corrected when he was in Class 5 to get the caste certificate, implying that he knew he would be joining IRS (Indian Revenue Service),” Dyandeo Wankhede argued. After taking the documents of both the sides on record, the bench said it would pronounce the order on November 22 at 5.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defamation-suit-nawab-malik-father-of-sameer-wankhede-present-documents-before-court-101637258826187.html

18-11-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Vijay Yatra concludes after all-night journey on Purvanchal Expressway||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav finished his Samajwadi Vijay Yatra in Lucknow at 4am on Thursday after having covered the entire stretch of the newly inaugurated 341 kilometre Purvanchal Expressway.Describing the yatra as one of the longest by the “Samajwadi people”, he said it would come to a stop in the true sense when his party regains power in the state.The yatra was a “symbolic reiteration” that the expressway was the previous SP government’s project, a claim that Yadav has often made.In a tweet at around midnight, Akhilesh Yadav quoted noted American poet Robert Frost’s verse: “But I have promises to keep/ And miles to go before I sleep/And miles to go before I sleep”.The tweet also had pictures of the SP chief on the rath surrounded by supporters.“With great difficulties comes a night...that brings in a new dawn. Now, there will be a new morning, there will be a change in 2022 (assembly polls),” he said in another tweet in Hindi, at the end of the nearly 17-hour Samajwadi Vijay Yatra.The fourth leg of the yatra had begun at the zero point of the Purvanchal Expressway at Haideria village in Ghazipur at around 11am on Wednesday. It ended at Chand Sarai village (the 341 km point) of the Purvanchal Expressway in Lucknow on Thursday.Standing atop his Benz bus converted into a rath, Akhilesh Yadav said: “This leg of the yatra has ended at 4am. I think this is one of the longest yatras of Samajwadi (SP) people, but in the real sense, I think the yatra hasn’t ended...It will go on and will stop when we see the SP government back.”After setting out from Ghazipur at 11am on Wednesday, the yatra reached Mau around 3pm, Azamgarh at 7.30pm, Ambedkarnagar around 10.30pm, the Sultanpur airstrip on the expressway at midnight, Ayodhya at 1.30am, Barabanki around 2.30am and Lucknow around 4am.“Originally, the yatra was to end in Lucknow on Wednesday evening. But with many unscheduled halts due to the crowd of supporters along the way, Akhilesh’s yatra went on all night,” said SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.Akhilesh Yadav undertook the Samajwadi VIjay Yatra on the Purvanchal Expressway the morning after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Purvanchal Expressway at the emergency airstrip for Indian Air Force (IAF) in Sultanpur on Tuesday.The same day, the SP cadres did “symbolic floral inauguration” of the expressway, calling it the Samajwadi Purvanchal Expressway.Akhilesh Yadav has repeatedly been saying that the expressway was a project of his government, which the BJP government was claiming as its own now.PM Modi had inaugurated the expressway on Tuesday afternoon after landing on the 3.2 km emergency airstrip in a C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft of the IAF. An air show by IAF involving combat jets followed the inauguration.At the start of his yatra on the Purvanchal Expressway in Ghazipur, Akhilesh Yadav had said on Wednesday: “This expressway is incomplete yet. Samajwadis saw the dream and conceived the plan to build it to cut the travel time between Ghazipur (in UP) and New Delhi. It was to be an expressway to prosperity. They couldn’t make a better road than this in the entire country. After SP government comes to power, it will build mandis (markets) along the expressway and take the expressway to Ballia and connect it with Bihar.”Responding to the Akhilesh’s yatra, political analyst Professor SK Dwivedi, who is former head of the department of political science at Lucknow University, said: “It’s high time that political parties shelve identify politics of caste, religion, Jinnah etc. They should do development politics. They should not fight over who made what. The expressway is built and it’s a good thing for the state, the country and its people. Credit should be given to both those who conceived it, and those who built it.”This was the fourth leg of Akhilesh’s Samajwadi Vijay Yatra. The first leg of the yatra was taken out on October 12 and 13 in Kanpur, Hamirpur, Jalaun and Kanpur Dehat. The second one was in Hardoi on October 31. The third was from Gorakhpur to Kushinagar on November 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-yadav-s-samajwadi-vijay-yatra-concludes-after-all-night-journey-on-purvanchal-expressway-101637258823457.html

18-11-2021||Mumbai||In 39% of high-rise fires, firefighting system did not work: Mumbai Fire Brigade||Of the 324 fires reported in the city’s high-rise fires between January 2020 and October 2021, 127 buildings, or 39.2%, did not have an operational firefighting system, according to Mumbai Fire Brigade data. In the remaining 197 buildings, this system was operational and was used during firefighting. In the last month alone, the city witnessed two major high-rise fires, the latest being on November 5 when two senior citizens were killed in a fire on the 14th and 15th floors of Hansa Heritage building in Kandivli in northwest Mumbai. On October 22, a massive fire gutted two flats on the 19th floor of the 60-storey One Avighna Park at Currey Road in south-central Mumbai. One man fell to his death from the building’s 19th floor. The frequency of fires in high-rise buildings has prompted civic authorities to make official statements urging Mumbaiites living in high-rise buildings to ensure fire safety in their buildings. On November 5, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued a statement reiterating that it is the responsibility of the owner or occupier of the building to ensure fire safety in its premises and that the fire extinguishing system, equipment and alarm system in all the buildings – especially the tallest ones – are operational, in compliance with the Maharashtra Fires Prevention and Life Safety Act, 2006. BMC had warned that action will be taken against buildings if they fail to comply with the norms. In this statement, the civic body also warned residents against using flammable material for unnecessary interior decorations work and altering fire protection systems and electrical structures. According to fire brigade authorities, a building’s height is the single-most challenging aspect of fighting high-rise fires. The second is wind speed. Without a robust internal firefighting system that is designed to mitigate a fire immediately, loss of life and property is magnified. In Mumbai, any building taller than 32 meters (approximately 10 floors without a podium) is a considered a high-rise, according to BMC’s Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) 2034, and any building taller than 120 metres (approximately 40 floors without a podium) requires an approval by a special state-appointed committee comprising a structural engineer, a geotechnical consultant and the city’s chief fire officer. “International studies show it takes about 7.5 minutes for a fire to become a full blown major fire,” a senior fire officer said. “The Mumbai fire brigade’s response time after we receive a fire call is about 15 minutes. A building’s firefighting system can respond right away, within the first 7.5 minutes. In cases where this is not operational, the fire would have already intensified by the time our firefighting system starts.” The officer added, “During this time, the smoke generated due to building furniture, beds, curtains, etc, will hamper visibility of any trapped residents, and of firemen, and increase the time taken to access the spot of the fire once we are inside the building. Every minute counts.” At present, Mumbai fire brigade’s tallest ladder is of 90 meters. This can access a fire up to a maximum of 30 floors from outside the building. If there is a fire on higher floors in a building where the firefighting system is not operational, the fire brigade has to set up a ‘series pumping network’ using its own apparatus, which is carried to the floor either using a fire lift or the staircase of the building. “This can take up to one hour. A lot of time is lost,” the officer said. According to the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety act, it is the responsibility of the owner or occupier of the building to provide fire safety in the building. Once the fire brigade gives its no-objection certificate (NOC) to a building, it is the building management’s responsibility to do bi-annual audits to ensure the firefighting system is in working condition. It also has to submit audit reports to the fire department. Called Form B, all buildings in the city need to submit this to the fire brigade after getting their premises inspected by licensed agencies, the official said. “This is different from the original NOC a building is given soon after construction.” After the fire at Kamala Mills Compound in Lower Parel in December 2017, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) set up fire compliance cells to inspect if buildings have submitted their fire safety audits. The parameters that decide if a building is not following fire safety rules include a non-functional internal fire-fighting system — fire alarms, sprinklers, hose pipes and riser systems — blocked fire exits, and non-functional fire lifts. Mumbai’s chief fire officer Hemant Parab said, “This is now routine procedure. Apart from these inspections, the Fire Brigade has been conducting awareness camps for residents, elected representatives, security firms, students and volunteers. Disaster Response training workshops are conducted in the Disaster Management Training Institute in Parel.” Vilas Nagalkar, senior architect said, “Fire safety in high-rise buildings includes not just riser systems, but also a fire lift, sprinklers, and smoke detectors. A large number of casualties in fires happen due to inhalation of smoke, so air vents are a must on every floor. It is also pertinent that an operational riser system has high water pressure, as we saw in case of the fire at One Avighna Park, where the water pressure in the firefighting system was weak. Occupants must ensure refuge areas are kept free of encroachment. In many cases, we have seen the building managements lock up refuge areas so that they are not used as store rooms, or the corridors are occupied hampering movement in case of a fire.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-39-of-high-rise-fires-firefighting-system-did-not-work-mumbai-fire-brigade-101637258646728.html
18-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Fire Brigade gets 55-metre water tower to fight fire||To help tackle fire incidents in high-rise buildings, densely populated residential areas and congested pockets of city slums, the Mumbai Fire Brigade has introduced its newest fleet of firefighting vehicles two weeks ago. The fleet has a 55-metre-tall water tower with five expandable arms along with an inbuilt high-capacity water tanker. The Mumbai Fire Brigade purchased the vehicle for ₹12 crore. The order for the same was placed in November 2019 but got delayed due to the pandemic. Unlike the existing hydraulic ladders of the fire brigade, which helps scale the height of the building externally up to 90 metres, the arms of the water tower of the new fleet can flexibly extend horizontally up to 55 metres. They can stretch over other structures in case the fire breaks out in a congested area with narrow roads, and can easily douse fires in slum areas even if the vehicle is forced to park on the main road. In the current scenario, in case a fire breaks out in narrow lanes, the fire fighting vehicles are parked on the main road, and the fire brigade runs their hosepipes through these lanes up to the site of the incident. The high-capacity water tanker attached to this vehicle can shoot water up to a distance of 30 metres. Explaining the functionality of the new fleet, a senior civic official told HT, “In case of a fire incident in a high-rise tower or a densely populated slum area, the latest fleet can reach the spot to douse the fire with its 55-metre expandable water tower, which was not the case earlier as the firefighters struggled to curb such incidents in densely populated areas and high-rise buildings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fire-brigade-gets-55-metre-water-tower-to-fight-fire-101637258645667.html

From the order dated 4.10.2021 passed by the presiding officer, it appears that the petitioner was present in the tribunal in civil dress without adorning robes.” “Prima facie, it appears to us that the petitioner over-zealously attempted to seek adjournment in a case where one of the parties appears to have been represented by the learned advocate under whom the petitioner was interning,” added the court. “Having regard to the overall facts and circumstances of the case, we hereby direct that till the next date of listing, the petitioner Abhay Kumar Gupta shall not be arrested pursuant to the impugned FIR no. 614 of 2021,” directed the court. “However, the petitioner shall cooperate with the investigation,” ordered the court. Advocate Anil Kumar Mishra represented the petitioner in court. During the proceedings, he apprised the court that the order (passed on October 4, 2021) also recorded that on being asked the petitioner told the him that he was a law student and not a practising lawyer. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hc-stays-arrest-of-law-student-charged-with-posing-as-lawyer-101637258644531.html

Wankhede has rubbished the allegations. Malik also said that he has obtained all the records from Wankhede’s birth, school admission and school leaving certificate, with certified copies of handwritten entries and submitted them before the Bombay high court (HC), the director general of police and Mumbai police commissioner. “Wankhede is getting exposed and was afraid that his first wife (Dr Shabana Quraishi) may expose him. To silence her, Wankhede has framed her cousin in a drug possession case with the help of a peddler. Her cousin was arrested by the anti-narcotics cell of the Mumbai police and is still in jail. Wankhede threatened her family that they will all be framed as drug peddlers if they expose him,” Malik said.Recently, Malik has been levelling a series of allegations against Wankhede. He has accused the NCB officer of attempting to “kidnap Aryan Khan” and frame him in the case after failing to extort money from his family. Malik also claimed that Wankhede is a Muslim, but he secured the IRS (Indian Revenue Service) job in the Scheduled Caste (SC) category using his father’s old identity, who converted to Islam before marrying Wankhede’s mother Zaheda Bano. He also accused Wankhede of framing an IPS officer’s son after a spat between the families. Wankhede has rubbished all allegations.On Wednesday, NCP shared two school leaving certificates from St. Joseph School, Wadala and St. Paul High School, Dadar and both the certificates mentioned Sameer Wankhede as a Muslim.Wankhede’s wife Kranti Redkar said that those were errors that were rectified by the family back in 1989. “Half info shared by people with evil thoughts to defame Sameer Wankhede. There was an error made. Later this was duly rectified by mr. DNYANDEV with all legal formalities and procedures in 1989,” she tweeted along with documents such as the school leaving certificate of St. Paul High School in which his name was mentioned as Wankhede Sameer Dnyandev and his caste was mentioned as Mahar (Scheduled Caste).She also tweeted his birth certificate showing his father’s name was Dnyandev Kachruji Wankhede and his mother’s name mentioned as Zaheda Bano.

The total rise in price over this period has been Rs6.4 per kg. Consumers would now have to pay Rs63.90 per kg. CNG prices have been steadily ticking up following the trend of petrol and diesel. On October 4, CNG prices were hiked by Rs2 and on October 14 the hike was ₹2.6. The Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) has announced that the revision in CNG price is being implemented. The gradual increase in CNG prices is attributed to 62% hike in the price of natural gas that is used in households for cooking and turned into CNG for use as fuel in automobiles. “The price hike is due to an increase in input cost and transportation cost of gas. But as compared to petrol and diesel, the CNG prices are reasonable for consumers,” said a senior official from MNGL on condition of anonymity. Though the CNG prices have steadily increased, the prices of petrol and diesel have remained unchanged since the first week of November. “The prices of petrol and diesel have not changed since November 5. However, CNG price have increased by Rs1.8,” said Ali Daruwala, spokesperson, All India Petrol Dealers Association (AIPDA). Prices of petrol and diesel in the city on Thursday are Rs109.50 and Rs92.50 per litre respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/at-rs63-90-kg-cng-prices-see-third-hike-in-1-5-months-in-pune-101637258583244.html

The audit department pointed out that the bills were submitted sans any documents. An inquiry was initiated during which various officers whose signatures were present on the papers claimed that these signatures had been forged and that even the stamps were fake. Immediately, the electricity department issued notices in the matter. Elected members across parties raised questions in the general body meeting and alleged the presence of a nexus between the administration and contractors. Criticism from the elected members forced the administration to lodge the police complaint.Additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar said, “This is a serious matter and the administration has conducted a primary inquiry. It has been found that the signatures and stamps used on the papers submitted are forged. Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar has asked to file a complaint and we have filed it at Shivajinagar police station.”“We sent two officers on Thursday to lodge the complaint. I spoke with the police officials and requested that a criminal case be registered. Along with the police inquiry, the administration has also initiated a departmental inquiry and the guilty will be punished,” Khemnar said.Meanwhile, opposition parties including the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) demanded that a forensic test of the signatures be conducted.Leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar said, “All political parties are very angry at this incident and it is a serious crime. The administration must file a police case. I am sure there is a mastermind from the civic administration who guided this scam. Only a person who knows the municipal administration thoroughly can commit such a crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-files-police-case-for-1-crore-worth-forged-bills-for-electrical-works-at-crematoriums-101637258525021.html

The party bagged 47 of the 52 seats in the Kanpur-Bundelkhand region then.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is the party’s election in-charge in UP, has held meetings recently to finalise the strategy for the region of ahead of the polls.Apart from being the centre of politics of BSP founder Kanshi Ram, Bundelkhand has been a BJP stronghold too.After the demolition of the Babri Mosque on December 6, 1992, regional political players like the Samajwadi Party and the BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) upstaged the BJP to capture the Bundelkhand political landscape. But the party bounced back strongly in 2014. Since then, it has swept two Lok Sabha polls (2014 and 2019) and one assembly election (2017).Bundelkhand has a significant population of non- Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits, who voted for the BJP in these elections. Dalits account for about 30% of the population in Bundelkhand and Muslims 7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-to-launch-6300-crore-projects-in-bundelkhand-region-of-uttar-pradesh-101637258523293.html

The Western Railway has built two additional platforms costing Rs70 crore. The two railway platforms and one island platform along with three interchanging railway lines will be used at Jogeshwari station for the operation of these trains. The zonal railway has sent the proposal on operations of the trains to the Ministry of Railways. Once approved, outstation trains will start operating from Jogeshwari station. The divisional railway manager, Western Railway GVL Satya Kumar told HT, “Two railway platforms have been constructed at Jogeshwari station and we have sent the proposal of train operation to the railway board.” The railways had earlier planned to operate nearly 100 outstation trains towards Gujarat and North India from Jogeshwari but have stated that the demand for outstation trains post the pandemic has been low. “We will be reassessing the number of trains for operation from Jogeshwari as we have witnessed a decrease in the demand for the daily operation of outstation trains,” said a senior Western Railway official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/passengers-can-soon-board-outstation-trains-from-jogeshwari-station-101637258403579.html

On Wednesday, a contractor and his associates were booked for physically assaulting the associate of a corporator in Ramtekdi regional ward office around 1 pm. Dnyaneshwar Garad (41), a resident of Ramnagar in Hadapsar, has lodged a first information Report (FIR) stating that contractor Vijay Alkunte and his associates Shubham Kamble, Vishal Orse, Laxman Dongre and three others brutally assaulted him on the premises of the Wanowrie ward office. According to the police, Ramtekdi Prabhag 24 corporator Ashok Kamble, Garad and his supporters had come to the ward office and met deputy engineer Kunjan Jadhav responsible for overseeing the implementation of development works in the ward area. At that time, Kamble said that despite tenders for drainage and concretisation work being sanctioned, the work was yet incomplete. Replying to him, Jadhav immediately told Garad to call up Alkunte. An enraged Alkunte retorted, “Who are you to call me. Are you an officer of the PMC to inquire about the work. I will start the work when I will,” and came to the spot along with the others and physically assaulted the victim. He even threatened to kill him if he repeated his mistake next time, police stated. Sub-inspector SH Kenjale said that investigation was on in the case and action against the accused will be taken.

18-11-2021||Lucknow||BJP names top leaders Nadda, Shah, Rajnath as incharges of Uttar Pradesh regions||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) think tank on Thursday named party chief JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh as incharges of the six organisational units that the party has divided Uttar Pradesh into for better management. This was decided at a meeting in Delhi where the party leadership also reportedly mulled over taking out four rath yatras across the poll-bound state. These rath yatras by top BJP leaders could culminate with a massive rally in Lucknow to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a plan similar to the model BJP followed ahead of the 2017 UP assembly polls. The yatras could be named Vijay Sankalp Yatras, party leaders said. Rajnath has been named in-charge of Avadh and Kashi region that includes the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shah has been named in-charge for Braj-Paschim region. Nadda would oversee Gorakhpur-Kanpur region.“The party’s top leaders would interact with booth presidents and booth level workers,” party leaders said.Nadda is expected in UP for a couple of days from November 22 to fine tune the party’s strategy.Nadda will also address booth president’s conference in Gorakhpur on November 22 and in Kanpur on November 23 while Rajnath would address booth president’s conferences in Jaunpur and in Sitapur on November 25. Shah would address similar conferences in Braj and Paschim (western UP) though the dates of his interaction have not been announced so far. BJP has also named an election panel for the state headed by Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan. “There is also a plan to get our top leaders to contest UP polls. The possibility of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and other leaders, who are currently MLCs, contesting is high,” BJP leaders said. The BJP has already completed verification of committees up to the booth level. The party has also announced a manifesto committee under veteran minister Suresh Khanna. “The manifesto committee would collect feedback from across the state before finalising the manifesto,” UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said after the meeting in Delhi that he attended with state general secretary (organization) Sunil Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-names-top-leaders-nadda-shah-rajnath-as-incharges-of-uttar-pradesh-regions-101637257743423.html

18-11-2021||Mumbai||Those who put Anil Deshmukh in jail will pay the price: NCP chief Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party Chief Sharad Pawar slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) Central government on Wednesday and said that those who put the former home minister Anil Deshmukh in jail will have to pay the price. “You are spreading propaganda against a person. He (Deshmukh) came to meet me and said that the complaint has been made by the police commissioner. Until the probe is complete, he doesn’t want to stay in this position and he is stepping down as home minister. You have sent him behind bars and will be made to pay the price of every day and every hour,” the former union minister said at a public rally in Nagpur, without directly naming the BJP.He also questioned the whereabouts of former Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh, who made the allegations of extortion against Deshmukh. “No one knows the whereabouts of the police officer who made the accusations against Deshmukh. The court has declared him a proclaimed offender. On the other hand, Anil Deshmukh is lodged in jail,” Pawar told reporters on Thursday. “What was Anil Babu’s crime? One day, Param Bir Singh came to meet me and said he had complained about Deshmukh to the chief minister. When I asked him for details, he said that Deshmukh had given him these (extortion) instructions. I said, ‘How is it possible and even if we assume that he has, have you implemented them?’ He replied in negative. I am unable to understand what Deshmukh’s crime was if his so-called instructions were not implemented,” Pawar said at the rally. Singh had alleged that Deshmukh ordered to collect ₹100 crore from businesses and other establishments. The allegations were made soon after he was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner following the Antilia explosives scare and subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. Deshmukh resigned from his post soon after this. Deshmukh was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) over money laundering charges and is currently in judicial custody.On Wednesday, the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court declared Singh a proclaimed offender in connection with the extortion case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/those-who-put-anil-deshmukh-in-jail-will-pay-the-price-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-101637257022914.html
18-11-2021||Lucknow||Smriti Irani launches Sansad Khel Mahakumbh in Amethi||LUCKNOW Union minister Smriti Irani launched the Sansad Khel Mahakumbh – a sporting connect with youths recently kick-started in the state by union home minister Amit Shah from Basti – in her Amethi Lok Sabha constituency on Thursday.The Khel Mahakumbh would continue till November 30 and the BJP leadership has tasked its MPs to organise sporting activities in their constituencies. The UP government has announced intent to invest ₹180 crore in building infrastructure and support for Indian wrestlers till the 2032 Olympics. During her previous visit to her constituency in September, Smriti had helped organise the national wrestling championship in Amethi for the first time. On Thursday, she launched the Sansad Khel Mahakumbh, as part of which various sporting activities, including wrestling would be organised in all the 98 nyay panchayats of Amethi till November 24. “Sporting activities would later be held at the block level and subsequently culminate at the district level,” an official said, adding that locally popular sports like ‘kho-kho’ would be part of the sporting events. Smriti also launched ‘har ghar dastak’ – a Covid-19 inoculation campaign aimed at increasing vaccination coverage in Amethi, where the UP government sanctioned a Covid testing laboratory in April. In the run-up to 2022 UP polls, the BJP has been repeatedly pointing towards how the BJP government had ensured maximum vaccination and conducted maximum Covid tests among all the states. Smriti also inaugurated an OPD and emergency block of community health centre (CHC). “OPD and emergency blocks would help people get better medical facilities,” said Smriti. Asked about Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi’s decision to allot 40% seats to women and go into the 2022 UP polls with the slogan ‘ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon (I am a girl, can put up a fight), Smriti responded with a sharp retort. “Probably, it means that she is saying that there is a ladka (man) at home who cannot fight... the Congress previously divided people on caste and religion and is now trying to divide people on the basis of their sex,” she said in Amethi. Since winning the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the Congress citadel, in the Modi wave, Smriti has kept the connect with Amethi alive, getting top leaders to sanction big ticket projects. She has herself bought a piece of land, a few kilometers from Gauriganj in Amethi, where her son performed bhoomi pujan in July for a local residence that Smriti promised in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Once ready, Smriti would become only the third MP from Amethi to have a house in Amethi. However, Congress leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui pointed out that while Smriti was yet to come up with a local residence, the Congress leadership had long back built a house in Bhuemau village in Rae Bareli, the adjacent Lok Sabha constituency represented by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. Amethi and Rae Bareli together have 10 assembly segments and having breached Amethi in 2019 LS polls, party leaders admitted that BJP had set sights on the assembly seats. Reacting to Smriti’s visit, Congress spokesperson Zishan Haider said, “Unlike the Congress leadership which has, irrespective of victory or defeat, treated Amethi, Rae Bareli as their home, the BJP has been engaging in plain politics. About Smritiji, all I can say is that she is a good actor, but now is becoming a bit too predictable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/smriti-irani-launches-sansad-khel-mahakumbh-in-amethi-101637256723351.html

At a special hearing later in the evening, the Patna high court said, “Prima facie, it appears that this episode puts the independence of judiciary in jeopardy”, and ordered the Bihar director general of police (DGP) SK Singhal to file a status report in a sealed cover and be present in the court on the next date of hearing, November 29, in view of the magnitude and enormity of the issues involved”.According to the high court order which took suo moto cognisance of judge Avinash Kumar’s complaint, Ghoghardiha station house officer Gopal Krishna, and sub-inspector Abhimanyu Kumar Sharma, forcibly entered additional district and sessions judge Avinash Kumar’s chambers and started abusing him.“On his protest, both police officers started misbehaving and manhandling the judge, and not only this, they also physically assaulted him. They also took out their service revolvers and wanted to attack the officer. However, certain court employees and advocates reached there due to which life of the officer was saved,” the high court order said.The two policemen were later thrashed by the lawyers.Jhanjharpur bar association vice president Balram Sah said lawyers rushed into the judge’s chambers on hearing loud noises inside shortly after the two police officers barged in. Jhanjharpur’s Advocates’ Association promptly convened a meeting to pass a resolution condemning the incident. “It is an attack on judiciary by the administration”, the resolution said.The lawyers have demanded strict action against the two police officers and the district superintendent of police Dr Satya Prakash.Some lawyers said a recent order by the judge against senior police officers appeared to have angered the police. There was, however, no confirmation.Judge Avinash Kumar is known to be unsparing in his criticism once wrong is established. In July this year, he recommended sending the district superintendent of police Dr Satya Prakash to Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel National Police Academy, Hyderabad, for a crash course on handling matters relating to offences against minor girls.The judge’s sharp comment came in a case where the SP signed off on a charge sheet in a minor girl’s rape where the police only charged the accused with kidnapping, not rape. Also, the police treated the girl as an adult despite a medical board opinion that she was 15 years old when she was kidnapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/2-bihar-cops-barge-into-judge-s-chambers-assault-him-threaten-to-shoot-lawyer-101637254623107.html

The resolution will now be sent to the state government for approval. The opposition has, however, raised doubts saying that this might merely be a poll gimmick.The ruling party had promised Thane residents that they would waive property tax in 2017, though they had to face a lot of criticism for not being able to fulfil it.Senior Sena corporator, Ram Repale, informed the general body on Thursday that the Urban Development Minister, Eknath Shinde and CM Uddhav Thackeray have approved the tax waiver for up to 500sqft flats in Thane. Former mayor, Ashok Vaity, passed a resolution in the general body to waive property tax, which was seconded by leader of the opposition, Shannu Pathan.The waiver will, however, be implemented only after the approval of the state government. Mayor Naresh Mhaske said, “This is a historic decision for Thane city. The resolution is passed in the house and soon a panel of civic officials will meet the state officials. We will also request the State to allot funds to the corporation as tax waiver will add to its financial burden.”However, BJP corporator Manohar Dumbre remarked that the ruling party required five years to pass the resolution. He also added that Sena should ensure that the decision is implemented and is not merely a poll gimmick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-promises-to-waive-property-tax-for-thane-flats-with-area-up-to-500sqft-101637252524043.html

The department has invited applications from private players till December 15 for setting up these stations. Transport minister Sheela Kumari said the automated fitness testing centres will help reduce road accidents as unfit vehicles will be scrapped out. “The initiative will also help in identifying unfit vehicles and those causing air pollution. All those vehicles will be debarred from operation”, she added. At present, motor vehicle inspectors manually examine various parts of a vehicle during a fitness test. Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said, “In this new system, all parts of the vehicles will be checked by machines without any human intervention. The new system will be more efficient as only those vehicles passing the test as per specified parameters will be issued a fitness certificate. We have planned to set up one such automated testing centre in each district.” As per the department, new commercial vehicles are issued fitness certificate with 2 years of validity which are subsequently renewed for one year. Interested individuals or companies can apply for setting up automated fitness testing centres at transport commissioner office situated at Vishwesharaiya Bhawan latest by December 15. “After closing of application window, a special team will be constituted to review applications and verify proposed venue for setting up the centres”, said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transport-dept-invites-private-players-to-set-up-automated-testing-stations-for-fitness-test-101637252164133.html
18-11-2021||Patna||Raid on MU vice chancellor reignites debate over selection process||The searches on Wednesday at the office and premises of Magadh University vice chancellor Rajendra Prasad, his subordinates and others in a corruption case has reignited the debate on the mechanism of selection of persons for the apex position in the state’s institutions of higher education.It was the same issue that had reached the Supreme Court in 2013 during the term of late Devanand Konwar as Bihar’s Governor and later all the appointments of VCs were quashed. Governor is the ex officio chancellor of universities in the state.The apex court had then called for a transparent mechanism involving short listing of candidates through a search committee and “meaningful and effective” consultation between the chancellor and the state government for appointment of VCs. The issue had led to face-off between the state government and the chancellor office and eventually led to the transfer of Konwar to Tripura.However, not much has improved since then.Referring to Wednesday’s searches, Bihar’s education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said such things earn Bihar a bad name. “Though the matter is beyond education department’s purview, the appointment and functioning of VCs should be transparent and only the deserving ones should be picked. At the top, one must appear to be clean and transparent,” he said.On Thursday, the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar( Futab) said acts of corruption, as reported about MU VC, “bring shame to the entire teaching community and raises the issue of serious flaws in process of their selection”. “Therefore, the Chancellor should ask all the VCs and those officials dealing with university finance, including examination, to immediately declare their assets,” said Futab working president KB Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, an MLC.Citing the usual practice of obtaining police verification reports before appointment to any high office, they said it seemed to have been given a go-by. “The VCs wield more powers than even a cabinet minister but unfortunately the power is not being used to improve academic and administrative environment,” they said.Social analyst Prof NK Choudhary said both Raj Bhawan and the government would have to take the blame for continuous slide in higher education and selection of VCs with dubious record. “Premises of VC being raided was unheard of earlier. We are getting reports that huge cash has also been recovered. All this points to deep malaise and the factors that have led to such a situation need to be addressed forthwith. It means something seriously amiss and the authorities must get to the bottom of the matter, as exposing one may not be enough. There may be more black sheep and their patrons,” he said.A number of VCs from MU, JPU, BRABU, Purnia University in the recent past has come under vigilance cases. Recently Prof. Jaiswal from PPU had to resign before completion of tenure, while the VC of VKSU was sent on forced leave after inquiry pointed to irregularities at their level. Several other VCs of NOU, TMBU and BNMU had to resign after a very short period of their selection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/raid-on-mu-vice-chancellor-reignites-debate-over-selection-process-101637252162833.html

The money is part of a Central scheme in which the ratio of contribution is 50%, for the state as well as the Centre. Sources in the district welfare government said the applications filed till 2014-2015 had been cleared, with funds awaited for couples who had applied after that.

18-11-2021||Pune||PMC mulling F&B sales counters outside mobile ‘Ti toilets’||Despite the public objecting to the sale of food and beverage items outside the mobile “Ti (she)” toilets started by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in October 2016, the civic body has decided to allow private players to maintain these toilets by selling tea, coffee, cold drinks, mineral water and snacks outside the mobile toilets. These toilets were started by the PMC to address the shortage of women’s toilets at public places in the city. They were designed by modifying Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses that were not in use for commuting purposes. The first three mobile toilets were stationed outside the Mahatma Phule vegetable market, FC road and J M road. There are now 11 such toilets at public places in Aundh, Shivajinagar, Shaniwarwada, Baner, Sinhagad road, Bopodi, Yerawada, Lohegaon, Vishrantwadi and Wanowire. The running and maintenance of these toilets was awarded to private player, Sara Plast Private Limited, with the PMC providing a sanitary pad disposal machine, toilet seat sanitiser, and hand sanitiser. The contract was awarded to Sara Plast Private Limited in 2018 for a period of 11 months which ended in September 2019. Thereafter, the corporation has received several complaints regarding the misuse of and lack of maintenance of these toilets though according to PMC officials, the toilets were not in use during the pandemic.The PMC has now floated a tender for the running and maintenance of these toilets and Sara Plast Private Limited has quoted the lowest charges of Rs18,000 per bus (toilet) per month for the maintenance of these toilets. The civic administration has tabled the proposal before the women and child welfare committee for approval to award the five-year contract to Sara Plast Private Limited not only to run and maintain the toilets and charge for their usage but also to sell tea, coffee, cold drinks, mineral water and snacks and to advertise on the buses (toilets) as the PMC will not bear any costs. As mentioned in the proposal, the corporation has newly introduced the clause of allowing the firm to sell tea, coffee, cold drinks, mineral water and snacks. The corporation has also mentioned that the public had objected to the selling of food and beverage items at these toilets.Rupali Dhawade, chairperson of the women and child welfare committee of the corporation said, “We have decided to visit the toilets and check their condition. According to the administration, out of 11 toilets, nine are operational. The administration is claiming that the toilets will be separate from the spaces where food and beverage items will be sold. However, we will see how they manage hygiene and other issues. We will also consider public opinion on this as there was resistance to the idea in Baner.”Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The PMC will not bear any cost of the facility if we allow the private player to sell tea, coffee, cold drinks etc. However, hygiene will be an important issue which the company will have to strictly follow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-mulling-f-b-sales-counters-outside-mobile-ti-toilets-101637251623488.html

He further said that the riots occur when the secular or left government is in power. Bhonde also alleged that a large section of the Muslim community is involved in illegal activities and that money is being used for rioting. Bonde made the claims in a discussion on Twitter Spaces. The audio copy of the claims was posted by Maharashtra the Nationalist Congress party (NCP) minister Nawab Malik on Twitter on Thursday. Bonde reiterated the comments later in a press conference held in Amravati. “Listen to this BJP MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) from Amravati,” Malik tweeted, quoting a popular Hindi phrase, “Jhoot bole kauva kaate,” (If you lie, a black crow will bite you). “Gujarat saw no (communal) riots post-Godhra riots. In Ahmedabad, there were riots every year. However, no riots were reported ever since the Modi government came to power (in Gujarat), in the past 10-15 years. Even in Yogi ji’s government (in Uttar Pradesh) there were no riots reported. Similarly, no communal riot was reported in the five years of Devendra Fadnavis government (in Maharashtra)… But whenever a secular or left government comes in power they (Muslims) dare to do such activities because they know they have some protection from the (political) leaders,” Bonde can be heard saying in the audio clip. “Whenever BJP comes in power, they (Muslim community) don’t dare to create nuisance and I’m not saying this as its office-bearer… This is a fact and everyone should understand this. I have seen in the past five years of the Fadnavis government, not a single case of the riot was reported even in sensitive areas,” he added. Later, in a press conference, he said he is firm on his statement. “Riots occur in the states where the so-called secular or left government is in power because they and their ministers protect and encourage riots and it is my experience,” Bonde told reporters in Amravati. Bonde was arrested by Amravati police on Monday in connection with the violence over the weekend, along with a few local leaders. He was released on bail by a local court the same day. Amravati city witnessed arson and vandalisation of shops, establishments and vehicles during a bandh called by the BJP on Saturday. It was called to protest against violence in Amravati, Nanded and Nashik districts on Friday, during a one-day protest called against violence against the Muslim community in Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-communal-riots-when-bjp-is-in-power-claims-anil-bonde-101637251082755.html

The district’s eligible adult population is 9.9 million, and the overall population (2011 Census) is 11 million. According to data released by the district information officer, 1.07 million people from Thane’s urban pockets are yet to take the vaccine, while 6,34,000 from the rural areas haven’t been inoculated yet. The rest are from other areas. Manish Renge, district health officer (DHO), said, “While it is true that around 1.78 million in Thane district are yet to get the first vaccine dose, the vaccination drive has picked up pace. Between 40,000 and 60,000 people are getting vaccinated every day at present.” Until earlier this week, Thane District completed inoculations of 8.86 million beneficiaries. Among these, 5.686 million received at least one dose, while 3.18 million are fully vaccinated. In effect, around 78% of the overall beneficiaries have been inoculated at least once and 42% are fully vaccinated. Officials said vaccine hesitancy, a shortage of doses in May and June, a reluctant tribal population of over 1.5 million and disparity in distribution of doses are some of the reasons for this gap between Thane and Mumbai. Thane District is also more complex than its more famous neighbour. It comprises six municipal corporations: Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayander, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Ulhasnagar and Kalyan-Dombivli. According to official district information office data for only public vaccination centres, Navi Mumbai has completed 51% first-dose coverage, Mira Bhayander 45%, and Thane 36%, Bhiwandi-Nizampur 36%, Kalyan Dombivli 34% and Ulhasnagar 27%. These figures do not include private vaccination data, which could take the percentages up. Dr Ravindra Sanglikar, pulmonologist, Vedant Hospital, Thane, said, “It’s been two weeks after Diwali, and there is no rise in Covid cases. It would seem the district has developed some level of herd immunity. However, getting vaccinated is important and the unvaccinated population will definitely have a role to play in case a third wave happens. Thane has a significant moving population, and many commute to Mumbai for work. The low vaccination figures can prove risky for Mumbai as well.” Dr Santosh Kadam, president, Indian Medical Association, Thane chapter, said, “If 100% vaccination is achieved we can avoid a third wave. Moreover, with herd immunity and vaccination, the need for hospitalisation will reduce. We can make use of makeshift Covid facilities and avoid a lockdown-like situation if more get vaccinated.” Renge explained, “Access to vaccination centres, and remote pockets within city limits are primary reasons for Thane district lagging. Besides, there was shortage of vaccine doses from May all the way up to mid-August. When supply stabilised, the festive season began and people were reluctant to visit vaccination centres. Some even went to Mumbai for their inoculation.” To increase reach, therefore, authorities said they are conducting vaccination drives in public places and installing mobile vaccination centres.Then, there is the tricky question of disparity in supply. District officials claim that Thane did not receive adequate doses. “When vaccination was started for all, Thane received far fewer doses than Mumbai,” a senior officer said on condition of anonymity. “Now when Mumbai has achieved its target, Thane is getting enough doses. There was a time when there was chaos and one could see long queues outside vaccination centres.” District authorities said they aim to complete 100% first dose vaccination by end of November. “Unlike Mumbai, Thane has a huge rural and semi-urban population in areas such as Ambernath and Badlapur. Reluctance and a lack of awareness about the benefits of the vaccine kept many away. However, with increased inoculations and awareness initiatives, a positive response is noted,” said Rajesh Narvekar, district collector, Thane. Narvekar has ordered all civic bodies, municipal councils and gram panchayats to identify pockets that have proportionally less-vaccinated populations. Thane Municipal Corporation data says 27% of the people within the corporation limits have not taken even one dose. That number rises to 30% in Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation. Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, on the other hand, says 95% of its eligible population has taken the first dose. “We have undertaken a door-to-door survey to check those that are still unvaccinated,” an NMMC officer said. Dr Anjali Chaudhari, district vaccination officer, Thane, said, “There is fear and reluctance in the minds of some in the district’s rural areas. Conducting the drive in public places will allow them to notice how fearlessly people are getting vaccinated and this may drive their fear away.” According to Zilla Parishad officials, the harvest season and Diwali festivities were the reason for a low turnout and the general lack of interest to get vaccinated from among those in the rural areas of Thane district. From November 11 till November 18 a special drive focusing on creating greater awareness with the help of teachers, gram panchayat members, and women and child development officials was initiated in rural areas. Moreover, around 1.5 million people from tribal pockets are being reached out to, Zilla Parishad officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/178mn-in-thane-district-yet-to-take-first-vaccination-dose-against-covid-data-101637249824032.html

18-11-2021||Pune||Students taking private tuitions increased by 6.6% in Maharashtra: ASER||Students enrolled who undertook learning activities through online education at home are fewer in government schools (42.7 per cent), as compared to private schools (51.2 per cent) in Maharashtra, as per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2021 released on Wednesday. This has in turn also affected students’ learning ability as now more students in the state depend on private tuitions as compared to 2018. The report further revealed that students taking private tuitions have increased by 6.6 per cent in Maharashtra. The report was published by NGO Pratham and has evaluated all Indian states based on different parameters.According to the report, it is seen that the proportion of children taking tuitions has increased from 2018 to 2021, regardless of grade, school type, or sex.“Currently, almost 40% of children in India and 20.7% of children in Maharashtra take paid private tuition classes. The largest increases in the proportion of children taking tuitions are seen among children from the most disadvantaged households. Taking parental education as a proxy for economic status, between 2018 and 2021, the proportion of children with parents in the ‘low’ education category who are taking tuitions have shown an increase,” states the report.The report also highlights that there are some differences in the proportion of children taking tuitions bsed on the status of schools reopening, with tuition classes more common among children whose schools were still closed at the time of the survey.The report revealed that in Maharashtra there were 14.2 per cent students receiving private tuitions in 2018 and that has increased to 20.7 per cent in 2021.“This difference in tuition-taking is larger in higher classes than in lower ones,” said the report.Dinkar Temkar, state education director (primary) said that as competition increases so does the private tuitions.“Earlier, students would get admission based on class 12 results but now for courses like engineering and medicine, there are competitive examinations. And so the need for private tuitions has increased. Moreover, many government schools could not use the interactive methods of teaching while imparting online education as there were limitations. Many government schools were catering to students from rural parts which had many different challenges and so the percentage of interactive activities have been less in government schools in the last two years,” said Temkar.Harishchandra Gaikwad, president, Pune district principals’ association said that there is a trend today to take private tuitions.“Many parents enrol their children for private tuitions because there is an ongoing trend. Teachers in government schools are experienced and take pride in teaching students,” said Gaikwad.There has been a 9.2% rise in student enrollment in government schools in the 6-14 year age group in Maharashtra in three years since 2018, as per the report. Talking about the enrollment of more students in government schools, Mukund Kirdat, city- based education activist said that the number may be temporary.“There is an increase but it is not much. In Pune itself, there are hardly 1,500 students who are now enrolled in government schools. Due to the pandemic with financial difficulties, this trend can be seen,” said Kirdat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-taking-private-tuitions-increased-by-6-6-in-maharashtra-aser-101637248682588.html
18-11-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray may be discharged in a day or two; may take few days to resume work||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, who is recuperating after a cervical spine surgery at HN Reliance Hospital last Friday, is expected to be out of action for a few more days. It also means the state government’s policy and political decisions could be put on hold, according to state government officials. According to senior Shiv Sena leaders, Thackeray is expected to get discharged in a day or two and is likely to rest for a few more days before resuming work. However, he will begin work from home, and for the same, he is expected to shift to his official residence Varsha bungalow at Malabar Hill, instead of his Bandra residence Matoshree. “Thackeray has undergone major surgery for the spinal disorder. The discharge was expected on Wednesday or Thursday, but his family preferred to follow up treatment at the hospital. The discharge is expected in a day or two. He has been advised to rest for a couple of weeks after the discharge, which will be followed by physiotherapy sessions for recovery. He is expected to resume work online next week. He will not be able to travel, sit or stand for a long time,” said an official from the chief minister’s office (CMO). The surgery was performed by Dr Shekhar Bhojraj and Ajit Desai on November 12, after his hospitalisation two days before it. Another state official said certain decisions of the state government may get delayed as Thackeray won’t be available for discussions for some time. It could include a decision on slashing value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel and a decision on the chief secretary, as the incumbent Sitaram Kunte is retiring on November 30. Thackeray will have to decide whether to give an extension to Kunte or select a new chief secretary. Besides, the government may take a call on suspension of IPS officer Param Bir Singh, who was on Wednesday declared absconding by a city court. A state cabinet meeting is scheduled to take place on November 24 and the chief minister is likely to attend it online from Varsha. “He has been clearing the files which are extremely important. It is true that the policy decisions have taken a backseat as major proposals need either the clearance of the state cabinet or the CM. There is no certainty if the cabinet scheduled for next week will happen. Even if it took place, Thackeray will attend it online. He has not handed over his charge to the deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar or any other senior minister from Shiv Sena,” the official said. Besides the key decision, the uncertainty over the winter session also lingers large. The session is scheduled to be held in Nagpur from December 7, but it has become certain now that it will be postponed by a few weeks. According to the officials from Mantralaya, the decision over the date of the session and whether to hold it in Nagpur or Mumbai will be taken after the CM resumes the work. A Shi Sena leader said that Thackeray was suffering from back and neck pain for a few weeks before he underwent the surgery. The leader said that though the surgery could have been deferred by a few months, it was avoided keeping the hectic schedule in mind during the local body elections to be held early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-may-be-discharged-in-a-day-or-two-may-take-few-days-to-resume-work-101637248388183.html

Another lane will be constructed from the left side of the creek towards Atmaram Chowk in Kalwa to ease the traffic congestion in Kalwa, informed housing minister Jitendra Awhad on Thursday.Awhad did a survey of the ongoing projects with MMRDA officials while the changes were also on the agenda of the meeting held recently with Urban Development Minister, Eknath Shinde.SVR.Srinivas, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, had come to survey the projects on the agenda to check its feasibility.Awhad said, “Ending the third Kalwa Bridge near the hospital will only add to the traffic woes. So, we had suggested that it be extended to Patni ground, which the commissioner has approved. To avoid the congestion near the civic hospital, a parallel road to Kharegoan from the Creek to Atmaram Chowk will bypass the vehicular load near the hospital. The design for the said road is also ready. Similarly, the work on the pedestrian bridge near Vitawa will also be completed in four months.”He also said that they have demanded that the state start the toll collection on Mumbra Bypass Road as most heavy vehicles use the bypass. “Imposing toll will ensure vehicles do not use the road unnecessarily while the road will also be maintained,” Awhad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3rd-kalwa-creek-bridge-in-thane-to-be-extended-to-patni-says-minister-awhad-101637248387052.html

Now work in on in full swing. The deadline will be extended to complete the project and we are monitoring work on a regular basis,” said an official from the MSRDC on request of anonymity.As part of the project, the existing six lanes on the said stretch will be turned into eight lanes and the distance reduced to 13.3 km. With this “link” in place, the total length of the expressway from Pune to Mumbai will be reduced by 6km and travel time reduce by 20-25 minutes.“Once the missing link project is completed we expect the number of accidents to go down by 50 percent. People will be able to travel avoiding the Khandala ghat,” official said, adding, “The new route will not have steep turns which reduce accidents.” The work on this road section is devided into two phases. In the first phase two 8-lane tunnels, 1.66km and 8.89km in length, will be constructed.In the second phase two 8-lane viaducts – 900m and 650m each - will be constructed. This second phases will run from the Khalapur toll plaza to the Khopoli exit.“One viaduct will be a cable-stayed bridge like the Bandra -Worli sea link. It will have a 650-metre span,” added the official.The total project comprises two tunnels, two viaducts, three bridges, one small bridge, culverts and the 4+4 lane highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/2023-deadline-for-pune-mumbai-expressway-missing-link-to-be-missed-msrdc-101637248382603.html
18-11-2021||Pune||No concrete solutions for SPPU chowk leave traffic in a mess||At a time when the Pune Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (PUMTA) is planning various measures to ensure smooth flow of traffic at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) chowk, residents of and commuters travelling through Aundh, Baner, Pashan and Aundh road are facing major logjams, almost every day. Ever since the demolition of the old flyover a year ago and of the long turn towards Senapati Bapat road, navigating Raj Bhavan road and university chowk has become a nightmare.Vaishali Patkar, who travels daily between Balewadi and SB road, said, “All the traffic gets jammed at one junction at the University chowk and it takes more than 30 to 45 minutes to cross the small stretch between the university gate and the turning towards Senapati Bapat road at Bhosale nagar. Nowadays, I avoid travelling via the university in the morning and evening. Many a time, I get stuck in traffic which is made worse by pollution.”While it takes at least 25 minutes to cross the university signal while travelling from Baner to Senapati Bapat road, commuters are not keen on diversions as they feel it is a waste of time and money and will not help the situation.Sanskriti Menon said, “Diversions are not going to work and the only solution is to increase public transport. I also feel that diverting traffic through the university is a bad idea. The university is a place for students to pursue their studies. Students will be back on campus soon and for no fault of theirs, they will be subjected to noise and pollution and the tranquil atmosphere will be highly disturbed.”Another commuter, Sujit Kulkarni, echoed similar sentiments. “More public transport will help. Also, people should start using more and more share rides. Like Sride is one option I use frequently,” he said.Harshad Abhyangkar, an urban planning and transport expert, said, “I remember that when the earlier flyovers were being built, PMPML buses were diverted ‘to streamline traffic’ whereas private vehicles enjoyed the shortest route. This increased fuel expenses for PMPML and duration of the trip for PMPML commuters. They should not repeat the mistake once again. If at all they want to divert, they should divert cars and two-wheelers. In fact, they should additionally provide more PMPML buses, un-diverted. If some private vehicle users do not like PMPML enjoying a diversion-free ride, they can keep their vehicles at home and take the bus instead.”Meanwhile, some people are of the view that if it takes a four-wheeler at university circle one to one-and-a-half hours to travel, it will take just 10 minutes on a bicycle if there is a dedicated track. Some residents blamed politicians for PMC’s ‘elaborate and devious’ plan to purposely create traffic chaos to justify destructive road projects such as HCMTR, Balbharti-Paud phata road and Kothrud-Panchawati tunnel.“These projects are illogical and will not solve traffic issues. They will in fact create more problems and increase pollution. The real reason these are even being designed and pushed is for the benefit of a few contractors and builders,” said a resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-concrete-solutions-for-sppu-chowk-leave-traffic-in-a-mess-101637247963734.html

Union minister for Road Transport Nitin Gadkari recently conducted the ground breaking of the flyover on Sinhgad road, and at the event he suggested the PMC to adopt the techniques used by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). Gadkari suggested that within the same cost PMC would be able to build double-decker flyovers, which would help to address future traffic problems. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol and standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane then asked the administration to look into the possibility. Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner said, “The administration checked the proposal and it is adding more ₹25 crore in cost. As the cost is increasing, the administration has suggested not to do it, but municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar will take a call on it.” Meanwhile, Nationalist Congress Party city unit president Prashant Jagtap supported the administration not to build a double -decker flyover. The ruling party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stays aggressive on adopt ing the new technology to build the double decker considering the future needs. 12 parties interested in bidding for riverfront development project A total of 12 parties have shown an interest in bidding for the riverfront development project between Sangamwadi and Bund Garden, Pune Municipal Corporation officials said on Thursday.This section is only phase one of the riverfront development project in the city.

There would definitely be people remaining for their first dose. We will soon figure out the estimated number after consulting all the Urban Primary Health heads. The number of people coming for their first dose is much less than what it used to be. Hence, the number of people remaining would be less than 10%,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.Meanwhile, a health officer attached to NMMC has said that the percentage of people remaining for the first dose would be around 5%.In the door-to-door campaign that has now started in gaothans, the civic officials have been assigned to first identify the people yet to take their first or second dose.“After identifying the person, he/she is informed about the centres where he/she can go. Even then if there is hesitancy, the person is counselled and then vaccinated at home itself. Initially, it was mass-awareness that was being done for vaccination. Now, we are doing one-to-one awareness and even counselling wherever required,” Bangar added.Till now, in 133 sessions, around 4,404 people have received their first dose in the ‘har ghar dastak’ programme and 5,662 received their second dose. The maximum number of people who have got their first dose is 399 from Ghansoli in 10 sessions, followed by 383 in Ithanpada in seven sessions.

18-11-2021||Lucknow||Easy transfer of farm land for industrial purpose needed, IIA urges UP govt||LUCKNOW The Indian Industries Association (IIA) has suggested to the state government to make available 200-500 acres land along expressways for ensuring rapid industrialisation of these areas and a new policy to ensure easy and direct transfer of farm land from owners to industrialists. As part of its industrial policy, the UP government has decided to set up industrial parks along the expressways. With this objective, it has decided to prepare land banks along expressways. To start with, land banks will first be prepared on Agra-Lucknow expressway and Purvanchal expressway. “We have suggested to the state government to make available 200 to 500 acres land along expressways for setting up industrial units,” said Ashok Agarwal, national president, IIA. Transfer of rural land for industrial use and change of land use is a major issue for both land owners and industrialists. The IIA has urged the state government to make land transfer hassle free for owners. This will also encourage farmers to offer their land for industrial use, said officials. “Transfer of farm land for industrial use is no easy job. A new policy is needed to remove all obstacles for using farm land for industrial purpose. There must be no restriction on a farmer if he wants to directly sell his land to an industrialist for industrial use,” pointed out Agarwal. “If this policy is adopted along expressways, then both farmers and industrialists will approach each other without any hassle,” he added. The industrial associations had also suggested to the state government to develop industrial parks near inhabited places so that easy availability of water and electricity could be ensured to industrial units.

18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Gratitude song at dusk, hopeful prayer at dawn||Can there ever be a limit to one’s love for nature? My answer is, “Not at all!” For me, it is impossible to explain the extent of my closeness with nature. I also lack the capacity to fully define its innumerable vistas and phases. I thrive on proximity to nature and it rejuvenates me like nothing else. Enjoying the company of natural surroundings is by far the best means of getting rid of depression or other such maladies. An admirer of nature, rejects all other means of entertainment. Once a nature aficionado, is always a nature aficionado even at the cost of becoming a laughing stock or being called a fanatic. But tranquillity and pleasure are the guaranteed outcomes of this association. William Wordsworth is so perfect in proclaiming, “Nature never did betray the heart that loved her.” Nature lovers are recognisable everywhere, on account of their distinct preferences. One of our relatives, a staunch lover of nature, never stays inside a wedding hall for more than a couple of minutes. He says, “I would rather sit out in the open, in the vicinity of trees and listen to the birds’ songs. Can’t tolerate this ear-shattering noise in the name of music. Rather this way we can converse with each other, otherwise we are so busy that we hardly ever meet.” Basically, such people with specific priorities live on an altogether different pedestal. I’m grateful for the attitude that I came to have i.e. my steadfast love for nature. I cannot even count the blessings that nature has bestowed upon me on account of this adoration. Let me share one of my own experiences. Recently, we took the hard decision to shift from our over three-decade-old house to a new place. But as it was a well-thought over plan, the change was quite welcome. At the time when we shifted, our evening tea time would coincide with the sundown every day. My husband and I chose to sit in the balcony to relish the cheering cup so as not to miss an iota of the full panoramic view of the setting sun. I reckon that being in the seventh decade of one’s life, has some link with this special affinity for the parting sun. The way the departing sun turns the azure sky into a riot of speckled shades of blue, orange, grey and finally turning it into dark grey, is nothing short of magic. Simultaneously, the birds swarm to the trees for the night’s rest. The choir presented by them at this time seems to be a gratitude song for a well-spent day. Another thing that seems too fascinating is that the same retiring sun which we see in the evening, appears the very next morning with a renewed vivacity, as if saying, “Here’s another glorious and golden day at your disposal; make it unique by doing something extraordinary to change this universe into a better place; thus, giving your life a charismatic aura.” parambirkaur@gmail.com The writer is a Ludhiana-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gratitude-song-at-dusk-hopeful-prayer-at-dawn-101637243943488.html

18-11-2021||Mumbai||Gurudwara can hold Prabhat Pheri, says high court; raps state for singling out community||The Bombay high court (HC) rapped the state authorities for singling out the Sikh community by refusing them permission to conduct religious rituals related to Guru Nanak Jayanti, which will be celebrated on November 19. The court directed the concerned authorities to permit the community to conduct the rituals after it was assured that all Covid-19 protocols would be strictly adhered to while conducting the Prabhat Pheri from 4am to 10am on Friday. A division bench of justice Gautam Patel and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing a petition filed by Dhan Guru Nanak Darbar Dera Sant Baba Thahriya Singh Sahabji, a gurudwara in Ulhasnagar was informed by advocate Bharat Bhatia that it was founded in 1948 and had been conducting Prabhat Pheri for 60 years to commemorate Guru Nanak Jayanti. Bhatia submitted that Prabhat Pheri started at 4am with a group of people carrying the Guru Granth Sahib, followed by devotees who do kirtan. The pheri, Bhatia submitted, ended at 7am and was being held similarly for the past 50 years. The bench was informed that the gurudwara through Hira Labana, an authorised representative, had applied to the assistant commissioner of police, the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation and others for permission to organise and conduct Prabhat Pheri this year, but was denied. Hence, they approached the HC. Bhatia argued that while other communities had been allowed to take out processions to commemorate their religious events, the denial by the authorities to the Sikh community was discriminatory. Bhatia said that the organisers had already issued directives to devotees intending to join the Prabhat Pheri to have double vaccination and was also willing to abide by the decibel level restrictions while doing kirtans. The state, through additional government pleader VM Mali, however, objected to the Prabhat Pheri stating that the organisers in 2018-2019 allegedly violated some sound pollution norms and had also invited DJs. After hearing the submissions, the court held, “We are quite unable to see how one particular religious institution can be singled out for a refusal of permission on a particular day.” The court further held, “We understand that to the petitioner, as to every other religious institution or organisation, the Covid-related restrictions will apply. We accept the statement of the petitioners as an undertaking to the court that they will strictly abide by all those restrictions including limiting the number of persons attending at any one time to the maximum permitted under the government-issued regulations and notifications. Only those who are fully vaccinated will be entitled to participate or be present. Sufficient care will be taken to scrutinize vaccination certificates or government-issued e-passes showing the vaccination status. Temperature checks are mandatory.” The court directed the authorities to grant required permission to the gurudwara and dispose of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gurudwara-can-hold-prabhat-pheri-says-high-court-raps-state-for-singling-out-community-101637241842093.html
18-11-2021||Dehradun||4 men who vandalised Salman Khurshid house arrested, key suspect missing: Police||HALDWANI: Four men suspected to be part of the group that vandalised Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s house in Nainital district on November 15 have been arrested, Nainital police officers said on Thursday.Among the four is Chandan Singh Lodhiyal, the 27-year-old who allegedly fired shots at the former Union minister’s house. A pistol has also been seized from him. The other three have been identified by police as Umesh Mehta, 30, Krishna Singh Bisht, 30, and Rajkumar Mehta, 29.Kumaon deputy inspector general Nilesh Anand Bharane said three teams were formed to identify and arrest the accused who pelted stones, fired shots and set a part of the house on fire.He said four persons have been arrested and the main accused, Rakesh Kapil, will also be arrested soon. “If the accused are not caught, a warrant will be issued against them,” the officer added.Bhowali circle officer Bhupinder Singh Dhoni said the four were arrested on a tip-off that they were trying to escape from the district. They were arrested on Ramgarh road by a team led by police station in-charge Ashok Kumar.“During the protest, Chandan Singh opened fire at the house. The other three have admitted to protesting and misbehaving with the caretaker of the house,” he added.The November 15 protest over the veteran politician’s book, Sunrise over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times, in which he has allegedly compared Hindutva with terrorist groups Boko Haram and ISIS, soon got out of hand. According to police, when Sundar Ram, the caretaker of Khurshid’s house, protested the group vandalising the property, the miscreants abused and misbehaved with his wife Nandi Devi and daughter-in-law Anita Devi as well.The violence prompted a sharp counterattack from Salman Khurshid and the Congress who insisted that police arrest the perpetrators. When there was no progress, Congress spokesperson Deepak Balutia demanded that the attack be probed by a high court judge, claiming that the attackers were linked to the ruling BJP.BJP’s Nainital unit chief Pradeep Bisht rejected suggestions that BJP workers were involved in the attack. “There should be an inquiry into the matter as it was not BJP workers or leaders. It is not proper to hold BJP responsible for anything in this matter as arrest or investigation is the job of the police. Congress has a habit of levelling allegations,” he said.The Congress, however, steered clear of backing Khurshid on his comments in the book that provoked angry reactions from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and even the Congress ally in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena. Without referring to the book, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi did call for the need to differentiate between Hindutva and Hinduism, saying the former encourages violence and the latter preaches peace and harmony.Khurshid’s book ‘Sunrise over Ayodhya’, has sections wherein he compared Hindutva with terrorist groups Boko Haram and ISIS. In a chapter titled ‘The Saffron Sky’ in the newly launched book, Khurshid has written, “Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints were being pushed aside by a robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years.”BJP leaders have accused Khurshid and the Congres of “weaving a web” against Hindus. “All this happens at the behest of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Earlier the term Hindu terrorism was invented in the Congress office,” party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said soon after the controversial comment in the book was reported last week.In his defence, Khurshid said:“I have not called these guys terrorists, I have just said they are similar in distorting religion. What Hindutva has done, it has pushed aside Sanatan Dharma and Hinduism and it has taken over a robust, aggressive position similar to Boko Haram and those other guys,” he said. After his house was vandalised, Salman Khurshid put out photos of the violence and asked,” Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/4-men-who-vandalised-salman-khurshid-house-arrested-key-suspect-missing-police-101637240882127.html

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has decided to lay a 26km-long sewage line across all the 21 slums of Digha. NMMC is now done with the tendering of the project and the work at the site will start next week. They are spending around ₹24Cr on it.A senior officer from the engineering department of NMMC said, “Digha is one of the oldest areas in the city but these slums do not have any sewage system till date. This has been a major challenge in terms of keeping the slums clean. Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) has agreed to give us a plot for developing the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). We will finish the entire project within two years.”Presently, NMMC has six STPs in CBD Belapur, Nerul, Sanpada, Vashi, Koparkhairane and Airoli. The total length of their sewage lines is around 361.20km and the sewage generated in their area is over 197.00 million litres per day (MLD).Sanjay Desai, city engineer of NMMC, said, “We have laid sewage lines in all nodal areas of the city. Apart from Digha, a few small pockets (mostly in slums of other areas) are still in need of sewage lines. We will cover the remaining areas very soon.”Dattratray Salvi, 39, an activist from Digha, said, “The population of Digha is now around one lakh. Despite being one of the richest civic bodies in the country, NMMC had been ignoring us for such a long time because we stay in the slums. For the overall development of any city, the authorities should also concentrate on the cleanliness and maintenance of its slums.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/digha-in-navi-mumbai-to-get-sewage-treatment-plant-in-2-years-101637237227475.html

But such an impression is not good for the government. The appointment and functioning of VCs should be transparent and only the deserving ones should be selected for the top position to bring about a much-needed turnaround in higher education. The process must be transparently followed. At the top, one must appear to be clean and transparent,” Choudhary said.On Thursday, the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar( FUTAB) said that the alleged corruption charges levelled against the MU VC, “bring shame to the entire teaching community and points out serious flaws in the process of their selection”. “Therefore, the Chancellor should ask all the VCs and those officials dealing with university finance, including examination, to immediately declare their assets,” said FUTAB working president KB Sinha. The association’s general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh also echoed his views. Citing the usual practice of obtaining police verification reports before appointment to any high office, they said it seemed to have been given a go by. “The VCs wield more power than even a Cabinet Minister but unfortunately the power is not being used to improve academic and administrative environment,” they added.Social analyst Prof NK Choudhary said that both Raj Bhawan and the government would have to take the blame for the continuous slide in higher education and selection of VCs with dubious record.“Premises of the VC being raided was unheard of earlier. We are getting reports that huge amounts of cash has also been recovered. All this point to a deep malaise and the factors that have led to such a situation needs to be addressed forthwith. It means something is seriously amiss and the authorities must get to the bottom of the matter, as exposing one may not be enough. There may be more black sheep and their patrons within the system,” he added.A number of VCs from MU, JPU, BRABU, and Purnia University in the recent past have come under the scanner of the vigilance department. Recently, Prof. Jaiswal from PPU had to resign before completion of his tenure, while the VC of VKSU was sent on forced leave after a probe pointed to irregularities at their level. Several other VCs of NOU, TMBU and BNMU had to resign after a very short period of their selection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/selection-of-top-brass-in-bihar-varsities-under-scanner-minister-calls-raid-unfortunate-101637236921891.html

Deputy Superintendent of Police, Jyoti Deshmukh, has credited the increase for the work of her team to make people understand and convince them to come forward with complaints. Various awareness programmes including approaching people at government offices and speaking to them about where they can go if anyone asks for a bribe has helped people to gain confidence to come ahead.“We have been conducting regular awareness programmes and also recently observed the Vigilance Awareness Week. During working days, our men visit government offices to speak to the common public and tell them about our department and our work. That helps people have confidence that their complaints will be heard. Due to these steps of approaching the public, we have had good response from them after they came to us with their complaints,” Deshmukh said.In a graft case, after receiving a complaint, ACB team first verifies the allegation and then lays a trap after deciding on a place to give the money. In disproportionate assets cases (DPA cases), after receiving an information, ACB seeks for permission for enquiry and after getting the permission, an enquiry is done to find if the government servant has more assets than his income and if so, a case is registered. A third type of case the ACB deals with is of misconduct wherein the officer is booked after finding to be indulging in any misconduct leading to fraud.Started in 2009, the Navi Mumbai ACB unit had highest traps in 2014 with 20 cases registered wherein 27 public servants were arrested. This year, there have been 13 cases in which 21 public servants were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-anti-corruption-bureau-unit-records-13-cases-this-year-highest-in-6-years-101637236321540.html

From the order dated 4.10.2021 passed by the presiding officer, it appears that the petitioner was present in the tribunal in a civil dress without adorning robes,” the bench said in its November 11 order.“Prima facie, it appears to us that the petitioner over-zealously attempted to seek adjournment in a case where one of the parties appears to have been represented by the learned advocate under whom the petitioner was interning,” added the court. “Having regard to the overall facts and circumstances of the case, we hereby direct that till the next date of listing, the petitioner Abhay Kumar Gupta shall not be arrested pursuant to the impugned FIR no. 614 of 2021,” directed the court. The court, however, ordered the law student to cooperate with the investigation.During the proceedings, Gupta’s lawyer Anil Kumar Mishra pointed out that the order (passed on October 4) recorded that on being asked, the petitioner told the presiding officer that he was a law student and not a practising lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dont-arrest-law-student-who-stood-in-for-lawyer-orders-allahabad-high-court-101637236081728.html
18-11-2021||Lucknow||UP tops in sexual offences against children: NCRB data||LUCKNOW Even as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was cracking down on sexual abuse and circulation of child pornography material across the country, Uttar Pradesh tops in the number of incidents related to sexual offences against children, according to the latest data of the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB).The CBI on Tuesday had detained at least 10 people during raids at 77 locations across 14 states and Union territories, in a drive against on sexual abuse and circulation of child pornography material. Raids were carried out at 11 locations in various districts across UP also. As many as 23 FIRs were registered against 83 accused people, in the last two days, for allegedly posting and circulating child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) through various social media platforms.The NCRB data released in September this year stated that 47,221 cases of Prevention of Child from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act were reported in 28 states and eight union territories across the country. Of these, UP reported the maximum – 6,898 cases of Pocso Act in 2020. UP is followed by Maharashtra with around 5,687 Pocso cases, Madhya Pradesh 5,648 cases, Tamil Nadu 3,090 and West Bengal 2,657 cases.The nationwide data revealed that 2,630 cases out of 6,898 cases reported in UP were related to Sections 4 and 6 of Pocso Act for unnatural sex and penetrative sex with children. The victims in as many as cases included 2,533 girls and 97 boys. Out of the total cases in UP, around 3,897 were related to sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault with children that included 3,881 girl victims and 16 boys. Moreover, around 68 cases were related to sodomy with 67 boys and one girl victim, as per the NCRB data.“This trend indicates that paedophiles and child pornography addicts are now dependent on web content, especially during Covid lockdown. This is an unsafe trend for children living around them,” said Umesh Gupta, a child rights activist based in Lucknow. He said, “Parents have to take extra care of their children during lockdown.” Gupta also urged the government to issue special guidelines highlighting this risk.Another Lucknow-based child rights activist and former member of Lucknow Child Welfare Committee Sangeeta Sharma said, “We have come across such reports and it is very alarming. Earlier, the UN body alerted the Indian government and police about such a trend but it kept rising. To curb this, we have to strengthen our child protection network of government and independent agencies,” she added.However, UP Police ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar had earlier stated that the rate of crime against children in UP (8.1 per lakh population) was quite low as compared to the national rate of crime against children (10.6 per lakh population). He said the rate of crime against children related to sexual offences decreased in recent years and currently the state stood at 24th position among all states and union territories across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-tops-in-sexual-offences-against-children-ncrb-data-101637235901608.html

18-11-2021||Mumbai||‘Persons with criminal background can’t continue on State Police Complaints Authority’: Bombay HC||Observing that a person with criminal background cannot be allowed to continue on the State Police Complaints Authority (SPCA), the Bombay high court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by Rajkumar Dhakane, who has been removed from Maharashtra SPCA for having three criminal cases registered against him. “In a post such as this, it is reasonable to expect — even demand — the highest standards of integrity and lawfulness,” said the division bench of justice Gautam Patel and justice Madhav Jamdar while dismissing Dhakane’s petition. Dhakane was appointed as “an eminent member of civil society” on the Authority on July 14, 2020. In August 2020, the home department called for a report from the Director-General of Police (DGP) after newspaper reports highlighted that there were criminal cases registered against Dhakane, a Pune resident. Eventually, he was removed from the Authority on 5 July 2021, after the DGP submitted a report that disclosed that three criminal cases were registered against him in Pune city and in one of the cases registered by Koregaon Park police station, he was booked for attempted murder. Dhakane moved the high court on July 8, contending that he had disclosed the offences registered against him when he applied for the appointment, pursuant to an advertisement issued by the state government and the government satisfied itself about his suitability for the appointment. Besides, he argued that the post is based on tenure– for a fixed period of three years. The argument, however, failed to impress upon the high court. “The very nature of the post makes it difficult for us to accept this argument,” said the bench. “The members of the authority are required to look into complaints about excesses by police officers above a certain rank. It seems to us wholly incongruous that member entrusted to look into alleged police excesses himself has numerous complaints against him,” it added. “We do not see how a person can claim to be entitled to continue in a post such as this and simultaneously say that the state government must wholly ignore all criminal complaints that have been previously made against him,” said the bench. “This is nothing but saying that the complaints against the petitioner should effectively be ignored and that he should nonetheless be considered “a person of eminence”,” it observed.The HC also rejected Dhakane’s argument that there was no provision enabling the state government to remove a member before the end of the tenure. In this regard, the court accepted the state government’s stand that the power to appoint includes the power to suspend or dismiss for a valid reason. Headed by a retired high court judge, the authority comprises a retired police officer of the rank of inspector-general or above, a government officer retired as secretary or commissioner, a person of eminence from the civil society and serving police officer of the rank of director-general of police. It is entrusted to look into complaints against deputy superintendents of police or above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/persons-with-criminal-background-can-t-continue-on-state-police-complaints-authority-bombay-hc-101637234283149.html
18-11-2021||Bangalore||Widespread rains predicted in Karnataka; IMD issues orange alert for Bengaluru||An orange alert was issued for Bengaluru city on Thursday as the India Meteorological Department predicted widespread rainfall for Karnataka over the next four days. A similar warning is also effective for the interior southern parts of the state, according to the latest weather bulletin.The IMD issued yellow alerts for some districts of coastal Karnataka and north-interior parts for the next 24 hours.According to the weather department, the prediction of heavy rains is due to a network of cyclonic circulations and a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.There are three types of alerts -- Red, Orange and yellow -- that are issued by the IMD after analysing the weather conditions. The red alert is issued when there is an expectation of torrential rains of over 20cm in 24 hours. Orange alert denotes very heavy rains from 6 cm to 20 cm of rain.A yellow alert means heavy rainfall between 6 to 11 cm.Bengaluru has received unseasonal rains in the months of October and November that has resulted in a few incidents of building collapse.The incessant rains have left much of the city in a pile of slushy mess, throwing the daily out of gear. Streets were also waterlogged, while motorists and pedestrians struggled to make their way through the downpour.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) continues to make assurances of fixing the city’s infrastructure woes even though there appears nothing on the ground that inspires confidence for the over 12 million residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/widespread-rains-predicted-in-karnataka-imd-issues-orange-alert-for-bengaluru-101637233121488.html

Her husband had died of snakebite.Her mother-in-law made her take off all her jewellery, and her head was shaved. She was now considered “inauspicious” for the household, and the society. She was not supposed to step out of the house or peak out of a window. She was not to be seen by others.She was made to cook for the entire household. She was allowed to cook because she had gotten rid of her hair. But she could not eat what she cooked. She had to face the wall while having lunch comprising a bowl of buttermilk and puffed rice. She ate only once a day.After her in-laws passed away in quick succession, her brother-in-law brought her to Pune where he worked as a priest. Since he considered her as a liability, he found a job for her.Almost all households then employed men as cooks. These cooks would take bath, wear a special silk cloth called “sovale,” and then enter the kitchen. Those men took the rituals associated with cooking very seriously and did not hesitate in reprimanding the lady of the house in case she made an error.Liberal and progressive men like Gowandey after the 1850s started employing widows as cooks. The widows had to be tonsured, of course. Widows who did not shave their heads were not allowed to enter the kitchen and cook.According to a letter Mahatma Jyotiba Phule wrote to the British Government in response to the discussion surrounding “infant marriages and forced widowhood” in 1884, Kashibai was well-behaved and beautiful. She was a chaste woman. She served for several months in Gowandey’s house.In the neighbourhood lived a Brahmin priest. He cast his gaze on Kashibai. She at first resisted his advances. The priest persisted. Six months later, Kashibai was pregnant.Afterwards, at the persuasion of her paramour, she tried several poisonous drugs to abort the foetus, but all her attempts failed.Kashibai gave birth to a healthy son and for the sake of her so-called “disgrace,” she slit the throat of the infant with a knife. The corpse was thrown into the well behind Gowandey’s house.Two days later she was arrested by the police on suspicion, tried before the Session Court in Pune, and was sentenced to a life sentence at Andaman.The incident took place in 1863. It was the first time a woman had been sentenced to such severe punishment.This incident upset and saddened Savitribai and Jyotiba Phule. They immediately started a shelter home for such Brahmin widows in their own house at Ganj Peth, Pune. While everybody else kept discussing the trial and demanded stricter rules for “disgraceful widows”, Savitribai and Jyotiba came forward to take care of the exploited women.The shelter was advertised in Pune and at places of pilgrimage, especially Pandharpur and Alandi. By 1884, thirty-five Brahmin widows had come to the shelter from various places. Jyotiba in his will noted with pride that Savitribai looked after those women as if they were her daughters. She would herself help the widows deliver babies and take care of them till they were ready to fend for themselves.The only way for widows to fend for themselves in those times was to cook for others. The women would go door to door asking if the house needed a cook. Rumours would swirl around these widows. Men, and sometimes women, would spread lies that these women ate meat, drank liquor, and lured men into having sex with them.Women were often reluctant to employ the widows because they feared that their husbands would go astray and maintain a physical relationship with the widowed cooks.To dodge such rumour-mongering, and to assure their employers, the widows had to be extra diligent about observing all the “traditions.”Seven years ago, I met ninety-year-old Shantabai Patwardhan in a decrepit wada in Kasba peth. Patwardhan and her husband worked as cooks all their lives. Her mother, Lakshmibai, was a cook too.Lakshmibai’s is a story of stigma, sorrow, courage, and above all determination to change her life.Ten years after her marriage, her husband died leaving her with no source of income and two infants to care for. The death of her husband left Lakshmibai dazed. She was told that life without her husband was no life at all. But she already knew that.When she came into the grasp of widowhood, she did not know she would get trapped by the chains of stigma. She was forced to stay indoors. She was forbidden to cook because she had refused to tonsure.The year was 1907. She was seventeen years old then.In the first month after her husband passed away, she realised that her children were starving. The women of the house would make her elder daughter go hungry.This was being done to make her shave her head and help the women in the kitchen.Lakshmibai did not want to accept the new lifestyle enforced upon her dutifully. Moreover, she did not want her children to starve, all because she would not get her head shaved.She stole her mother-in-law’s bangles one night and ran away to Pune from their village near Satara with her children.Lakshmibai was taunted when she stepped out to look for a job in Pune. She would go around the lanes of the city with her two children asking for work. But nobody wanted to employ a widow who had long, bouncing hair.During those days, men and women who wanted jobs as cooks, priests, and water-bearers would gather around Tulshibaug every morning. Widows would, of course, sit inconspicuously under a tree. They took the utmost care to make their presence go unnoticed, even though they needed to be employed. Wealthy men looking for cooks and priests would visit Tulshibaug and took men and women with them.Lakshmibai too made it a practice to be present at Tulshibaug daily. But other widows did not like her being there. Some of them did not like her breaking away from the tradition by not cutting her hair. Others feared men would ostracise the entire group because of her. One morning, a group of men and women shooed her away and threatened her with consequences if she set foot near Tulshibaug again.Lakshmibai did not want her daughters to go hungry. She shaved her head.Lakshmibai raised her two daughters alone. She worked as a cook all her life. Her younger daughter became a teacher.Lakshmibai and Kashibai were among many Hindus, so-called “upper-caste” widows of Maharashtra who were victims of cruel fate and stigmas. Lakshmibai was successful in building a life for herself. Kashibai could not.The widows cooked and made it easier for future generations of women to step out and earn their living. But for that, they had to shave their heads. Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food historian. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

18-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi Assembly panel asks Facebook to submit records on complaints on 2020 riots||A Delhi Assembly committee asked Facebook India on Thursday to furnish records of users' reports (complaints) on the content posted on the platform one month prior and two months after the northeast Delhi riots in February 2020.Hearing a representation by Shivnath Thukral, the public policy director of Facebook India (Meta Platforms), in the Assembly, chairman of the Peace and Harmony Committee Raghav Chadha asked for the records.He also quizzed the Facebook official regarding the organisational structure, the complaints redressal mechanism, community standards and hate speech definitions with respect to the social media giant.Thukral said Facebook is not a law enforcement agency but it has a mechanism to co-operate with such agencies whenever required."When things happen in the real world, they reflect on our platform as well. We do not want hate on our platform. There are some bad actors that need to be worked on," he said during the hearing.Thukral said Facebook has 40,000 people working on content management, including 15,000 dealing with content moderation. Any content found against the community standards followed by the platform is taken down immediately, he added.Summonses were issued by the committee to Facebook India to put forward its views on the critical role of social media platforms in curbing the spread of false, provocative and malicious messages that can incite violence and disharmony.The panel has so far heard seven witnesses while examining the role of social media platforms in connection with the northeast Delhi riots that claimed over 50 lives and left hundreds of people injured in February 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-panel-asks-facebook-to-submit-records-on-complaints-on-2020-riots-101637232138879.html

What was his crime? You all know it well. One day, Param Bir Singh came to meet me and said he complained to the CM against Deshmukh. When I asked him what it was about, he said Deshmukh had given him instructions to extort money. Then I asked him if he carried out the instructions. He said he didn’t. I am unable to understand what Deshmukh’s crime was if his so-called instructions were not carried out in the first place,” Sharad Pawar argued while addressing the rally in Nagpur.Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had ordered him to extort ₹100 crore from businesses and other establishments. The allegations were made soon after he was transferred as Mumbai police commissioner following the mysterious discovery explosives near Mumbai’s Antilia and subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran.On Wednesday, the additional chief metropolitan magistrate court declared Param Bir Singh a proclaimed offender in connection with the extortion case.“You (BJP) are spreading propaganda against a person (Deshmukh). He (Deshmukh) came to meet me and said a complaint has been made by the police commissioner. Until the probe was completed, he didn’t want to stay in position and stepped down as home minister. We will not keep quiet. You (BJP) have sent him (Deshmukh) behind bars and you will be made to pay the price of every day and every hour,” former union minister Sharad Pawar said without naming the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-says-those-who-sent-anil-deshmukh-to-jail-will-pay-the-price-101637232241929.html
18-11-2021||Bhopal||New rule: No liquor for the unvaccinated in this district of Madhya Pradesh||Madhya Pradesh’s Khandwa district excise office on Thursday announced a new rule where it mandated that liquor will be sold only to those who have received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.Alcohol will be sold at the liquor stores to only those people who have received both doses of COVID vaccine: Khandwa District Excise Officer #MadhyaPradesh pic.twitter.com/CoCqiITgsNThe order states that the 74 liquor stores across Khandwa have been intimated regarding this new rule which will require the customers to get fully inoculated in order to be eligible for buying liquor.The order pointed out that the measure was taken in a bid to boost vaccination amongst citizens as the state continues its mega vaccination campaign.Madhya Pradesh minister Dr Prabhuram Choudhary earlier in the day said that the state vaccinated half of the eligible population with both the doses of vaccine against coronavirus and that the state is aiming to fully vaccinate the eligible population within December 25.Madhya Pradesh, which has an estimated eligible population of 5.59 crore, vaccinated at least 27,543,593 beneficiaries with both doses of vaccine. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan earlier thanked the state’s health ministry and healthcare workers upon achieving this feat. He also expressed hope that with cooperation from all, the state will fully vaccinate its eligible population within December 25.Madhya Pradesh was among the states which saw a record number of daily cases, large numbers of hospitalisations and deaths during the second wave of Covid-19 between April and July earlier this year, with some hospitals citing lack of medical oxygen to treat patients. The state recorded 792,986 cases so far with the death toll reaching 10,525.

We called the company officials but they are not cooperating. If they will not cooperate, we will arrest them and we will not allow such activity. So, we have requested the company officials to cooperate in the investigation or we will take action against them,” said state home minister Narottam Mishra.Police in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind last week said they busted a gang of drug peddlers, who would get marijuana delivered via Amazon from Visakhpatnam and pay in cash.Mishra said a company registered as a seller with Amazon supplied the marijuana at 12 places. “If Amazon officials were found guilty, we will take strict action against them.” He added three persons have been arrested in the case for the transportation of marijuana from Visakhapatnam. Mishra said marijuana was packed and passed off as stevia leaves. “There are no rules and guidelines regarding online shopping sites. Even arms can be supplied through e-commerce websites.”Mishra said the Madhya Pradesh government will lay down rules for online shopping sites to ensure the platforms cannot be misused.Amazon’s advocate Sumant Narang refused to comment on the issue, saying the matter was under investigation. Mishra also attacked comedian Vir Das for his monologue in the US for allegedly insulting India. Mishra said they will not allow Das to perform in Madhya Pradesh. “If he apologises for his actions, we will rethink it.” He added there are “some clowns” who try to malign India’s image. “...Kapil Sibal and other Congressmen supported him. It is Rahul Gandhi who defamed our country abroad and former chief minister Kamal Nath who is calling great India as defamed India.”A ruling Bharatiya Janata Party leader has filed a complaint against Das in New Delhi. Das uploaded a video of his monologue on YouTube and faced immediate backlash. In the six-minute video, he refers to the most talked about issues facing India including the battle against Covid-19, incidents of rapes, the crackdown on comedians, and farmer protests.In a tweet, Das said his intention was to remind the country that despite its issues, it is great.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/amazon-officials-will-face-action-if-they-don-t-cooperate-mp-govt-on-drugs-peddling-case-101637231764618.html

Also read: Punjab CM Channi leads 15-member jatha to Pakistan via Kartarpur CorridorSAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal inducted him into the party and announced that Sidana, who is a senior leader from the Hindu community, will be his political adviser for urban affairs. With the assembly elections barely two months away, Sukhbir asked Sidana to focus on the SAD campaign in the urban areas. Sidana’s exit comes after another senior Hindu leader Raman Behl left the Congress and joined the Aam Aadmi Party on November 9. The Congress is facing the challenge of retaining its Hindu leaders. Sidana, a member of the Kandi Area Development Board (KADB) till a few months ago, belongs to Jalalabad and had been voicing his concerns regarding the lack of adequate representation in the state Congress. On October 31, he even wrote an open letter to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, citing indiscipline in the party. In reply to a query, Sukhbir clarified that Bathinda Lok Sabha MP and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal will not contest the 2022 assembly elections and a decision on five-time Punjab chief minister and SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal would be taken at the party forum. On the Congress demand to make the special task force (STF) report in the drugs case public since it has been submitted in a sealed cover to the Punjab and Haryana high court, Sukhbir said that the matter was sub judice and he would not want to comment on it. “But what stopped the Congress government from acting against drug traffickers during its four-and-a-half-year term? No one has been arrested so far. The Congress government is only politicising the matter by targeting us (SAD). They could have released the report. I challenge them to cite a single piece of evidence against Akali leaders instead of attempting to frame them in false charges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-loses-another-hindu-face-anish-sidana-joins-shiromani-akali-dal-101637229121125.html

The 4.7km visa-free stretch was reopened for Indian pilgrims on Wednesday.The Channi-led delegation comprised 30-odd members, including officers of the Punjab government and family. The ministers who accompanied the CM were Manpreet Singh Badal, Vijay Inder Singla and Rana Gurjit Singh and two MLAs — Harpartap Singh (Ajnala) and Barinderjit Singh Pahra (Gurdaspur). The CM has sought that the process of getting permission for pilgrims desirous to visit the last resting place of the Sikhism’s founder be simplified. “A procedure of on-arrival permission should be followed,” he said.Also read: Punjab BJP jatha leaves for Pakistan via Kartarpur CorridorKartarpur Corridor Project Management Unit chief executive officer Muhammad Latif, Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee office-bearers and Gujranwala commissioner greeted the Indian guests who arrived at the gurdwara.

The long-pending ‘ardaas (prayer)’ of the Sikh ‘sangat (community)’ has been fulfilled.” The CM added he was fortunate enough to be part of the sangat paying homage since the demand of the ‘Khule Darshan-Didar’ of Gurdwara Sri Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur, was fulfilled after seven decades. “Our Gurus showed the path of humility, unity, peace and welfare. The corridor will play a pivotal role in ensuring this,” he added.On returning, he said, “It is the need of the hour that both the national governments of India and Pakistan should make concerted efforts for simplifying the process to enable pilgrims for obtaining permission to pay reverence at this holy shrine.”Channi announced that the state government will soon start free buses from across the state to enable pilgrims to pay obeisance at the revered gurdwara. He said these buses will ply till the corridor for facilitating pilgrims, having permission to visit Sri Kartarpur Sahib.Batting for the opening of cross-border trade through Punjab’s borders, the CM added that India and Pakistan should deliberate on this. “Besides giving an impetus to economic activity, it will help in improving people-to-people contact between both the countries,” he added.‘THANK MODI, KHAN’Channi also thanked the people of Pakistan and the administration for showering love and affection on him and his family during the visit. He also expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan for reopening the corridor.Singla said, “The Union government has not given permission to all ministers at once. Some ministers will get permission over the next few days. Some of them will be going on Friday.” Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu was not part of the Channi-led ‘jatha’ (group) which went to pay obeisance at the gurdwara. Sidhu’s media adviser Surinder Dalla on Wednesday night had said that the PCC chief would go on November 20.

18-11-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka BJP begins Jan Swaraj Yatra to mobilise support for panchayat polls||Four teams, led by senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), will commence their state-wide tour of the party from Thursday to meet the grassroots level workers and mobilize support for the upcoming panchayat polls in Karnataka. The Jan Swaraj Yatra begins from today under four teams led by senior party leaders BS Yediyurappa, KS Eshwarappa, Jagadish Shettar and Nalin Kumar Kateel across the state starting in different regions. “Today I will go to Koppala. We will start the Jan Swaraj Yatra from there. There are four teams. One under our leader BS Yediyurappa, Jagadish Shettar, one under our party president (Kateel) and another under Eshwarappa. They will travel across the state and meet elected representatives and request all voters to help our party candidates win. One team will visit two districts per day,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Thursday in Bengaluru. The statements come weeks before the December 10 polls for 25 seats in the upper house of the state legislature. Those whose terms are expiring in January include BJP minister Kota Srinivas Poojary and Congress leader of the house SR Patil among others. The BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) are hopeful to win as many seats as possible to retain some control over the upper house. The BJP, which has 32 seats currently, is hoping to mobilize support to get a majority in the upper house to allow easy passage of contentious bills without having to depend on their rivals for support. The Congress has 29 members and the JD(S) has 12 members currently. Several members of the opposition, especially from the JD(S), are trying to defect to the BJP to secure a seat in the upcoming polls.“Other than a couple of districts, we have sent a list of the probables up (to Delhi). We are hopeful of the list getting approved by this evening. If not, by tomorrow morning it will be done,” Bommai said. The state-wide tour also comes at a time when the BJP is trying to thwart growing accusations that its senior leaders are involved in the raging Bitcoin scandal. Bommai also faces the people after the party lost the bypolls in Hanagal in his home district of Haveri, which is speculated to be a backlash from the Panchamasali sub-sect and his own partymen plotting against the former. The BJP had not approved the statewide tour of Yediyurappa and instead forced him to be part of this yatra which, people aware of the developments said, was to keep the 78-year-old under control. The grassroots have also expressed their reservations about the possibility that new entrants may be given a chance in the upcoming MLC polls by overlooking core-party workers which is likely to adversely impact other elections like zilla and taluka panchayat that are expected to be held early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-bjp-begins-jan-swaraj-yatra-to-mobilize-support-for-upcoming-panchayat-polls-101637223422591.html
18-11-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal rolls out six-point action plan to clean up Yamuna river by 2025||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced a six-point action plan to clean up Yamuna river by February 2025. The mission includes improving the Capital’s sewage treatment capacity and network, cleaning up major drains, de-silting storm water drains, and taking firm action over the release of untreated waste. Addressing reporters, Kejriwal pointed to his promise during the 2020 assembly elections to clean up the Yamuna within five years and to bathe in it to highlight the success of his mission. “Yamuna is close to everyone in Delhi. It is the lifeline of Delhi. Everyone wants to see a clean Yamuna. It took 70 years to dirty the Yamuna. All the dirt of 70 years cannot be cleaned in two days. But we have now prepared a six-point action plan to clean the Yamuna by February 2025. We have started work on these points on a war footing,” Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said. The first “action point” is to increase the city’s sewage treatment capacity and improving the quality of the waste treatment process. At present, Kejriwal said, New Delhi can treat only about 600MGD (million gallons per day) of sewage as a result of which a lot of sewage is left untreated and released directly into the Yamuna. Also Read: Untreated effluent from Haryana contaminating Yamuna waters: Report“The city actually needs sewage treatment plants (STPs) with a total capacity of 800-850MGD. We are doing three things on this front. One, we’re setting up new sewage treatment plants such as the coronation plant and the ones being built at Okhla, Kondli, Rithala and other places. Two, we’re increasing the capacity of the existing plants. Three, the existing plants are operating with old technology because of which even treated water is dirty. We will upgrade the technology to ensure treated water that is released is of 10/10 purity,” the CM said. The mission’s “second action” point is to clean up the city’s major drains. Kejriwal said the Najafgarh, Badshahpur, supplementary and Ghazipur drains will be cleaned with a new technology without diverting its waste to plants. The remaining drains, he said, will be diverted to the city’s STPs. Arvind Kejriwal also pointed to the plan to properly treat industrial waste and take action against set-ups that flout norms, which is the mission’s third “action point”. “A lot of industries show on paper that their waste is released only after proper treatment. But the reality is that industrial waste treatment is practically not happening. All effluent treatment plants that are not operating properly will be repaired and upgraded. The industries that fail to send their waste to effluent treatment plants will be shut down,” the Delhi chief minister said. He also spoke about the need to improve the community toilets at various slums and slum-like clusters across New Delhi, the fourth “action point” of the Delhi government project. “At present, the waste from all community toilets in ‘jhuggies’ (slums) is released into storm water drains, as a result of which their sewage is released directly into the [Yamuna] river. This waste will be diverted and linked to sewage lines, so that it’s treated properly,” Kejriwal said. The fifth “action point” is to increase household sewage connections across the city. “Many people still haven’t taken sewer connections in the city. Many households release their sewage directly into the local ‘nullahs’ (large drains). We have decided that the Delhi government will install sewer connections in people’s houses. They won’t have to apply for it or seek permission. We will charge a nominal rate, which will be adjusted in their water bills,” Kejriwal said. The sixth “action point” of the Yamuna clean-up mission is to de-silt and rehabilitate the city’s entire sewer network. “I am personally monitoring this project. We have set specific milestones for each action point and I will ensure that deadlines aren’t missed,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-rolls-out-six-point-action-plan-to-clean-up-yamuna-river-by-2025-101637223180903.html

18-11-2021||Patna||BJP ministers insist on making liquor law more holistic, CM remains firm||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar might have insisted on stricter implementation of the prohibition act, but ministers of the lead coalition partner, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), kept reminding him about the need to revisit the liquor law to help the state march towards de-addiction. This came during the high-level meeting held in Patna on Tuesday. Citing the recent report of the national family health survey (NFHS), state health minister Mangal Pandey urged the CM to relook into the law in view of the survey report that stated that liquor consumption in dry Bihar was more than Maharastra. “We shall definitely look into the veracity of the report during the review meeting on prohibition, as we relied on the NFHS data for immunisation and other health parameters,” Pandey told the CM. Earlier, state BJP chief and the Member of Parliament (MP) from West Champaran Sanjay Jaiswal questioned the rationale behind carrying out the prohibition law that failed to check the flow of illicit liquor and asked for a review of the act in the entirety. Road construction minister and BJP MLA from Bankipore Nitin Nabin drew the chief minister’s attention towards the growing prevalence of drugs among the young generation due to the administrative focus on checking on the liquor flow. “As the police kept their crackdown on liquor, drug Mafiosi seem to have got enough scope to entice the youth towards drugs which is deadlier than the alcohol,” Nabin informed Kumar in presence of other cabinet colleagues. Industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain supported Nabin’s contention and said that drugs had emerged as a major source of addiction in Bhagalpur and other parts of the state. “The government shall not take other sources of addiction for granted for the sake of rigorous enforcement of liquor law,” said Hussain. A senior BJP leader said that they always insisted on a logical way to encourage people to shun the habit of liquor, instead of terrorising them by law. “We always advocated for the Gujarat model of liquor ban and work for total deaddiction,” he added. Pandey, when asked for his comments on his suggestion, said that he urged the CM to first examine the veracity of the NFHS survey and act accordingly if it’s true. “Sometimes, surveys are also found incorrect. I also congratulated the CM on completion of the one year of the new government and its efforts to deal with the crises like the Covid pandemic and floods,” said the health minister. Nabin said he raised the issue of the growing prevalence of the drug and urged him to work out modalities for cracking down on the drugs cartel as well, which is crippling the young generation. “The role of the station house officers (SHOs) should also be reviewed with respect to the recovery of drugs, besides liquor, in their jurisdictions,” said the minister. The latest NFHS report for 2019-20 stipulates that about 14% of men above 15 years consume liquor in urban areas, while 15.8% of people consume liquor in rural areas. In Maharashtra, about 13% urban and 14.7% rural population are in habit of taking alcohol. Similarly, 0.5% women and 0.4% women in rural Bihar take liquor as compared to 0.3% urban women and 0.5% rural women. People of Jammu and Kashmir are the least consumers of alcohol, while the states of Goa, Sikkim and Telangana have the highest percentage of liquor consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bjp-ministers-insist-on-making-liquor-law-more-holistic-cm-remains-firm-on-nochange-101637210341231.html

Wednesday’s AQI reading was 375.On the weather front, New Delhi had recorded a minimum temperature of 9.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, while the maximum temperature recorded was 27.5 degrees Celsius.The minimum temperature is expected to dip to 10 degrees Celsius on Friday after which it is expected to rise up to 12 degrees Celsius during the weekend, according to the Indian Meteorological Department’s weekly forecast. While the winter is likely to be colder than normal, New Delhi hasn’t yet recorded any western disturbances this month, which is unusual.

18-11-2021||Chandigarh||AAP Punjab MLAs to visit Kartarpur Sahib on November 19||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs from Punjab will visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan on Friday on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti.According to the party, all 11 MLAs will visit Kartarpur Sahib along with Punjab AAP chief and party MP Bhagwant Mann.In a major decision, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government decided to re-open the Kartarpur corridor from November 17. It was shut in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Guru Nanak Jayanti, also known as Guru Nanak Gurpurab, celebrates the birth of the first Sikh Guru and is considered one of the most sacred festivals among Sikhs. The day is celebrated on the full moon day of the Kartik month as per the Hindu calendar. It is also marked as Kartik Poornima. This year the day falls on November 19.The visa-free 4.7-kilometre long corridor joins the Indian border to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan. It became operational in 2019.More than 20 months after the Kartarpur corridor was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a jatha of Sikh pilgrims from India crossed over to Pakistan on Wednesday ahead of the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.Pakistan had issued around 3000 visas to Indian Sikh pilgrims on the eve of the 552nd Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev from November 17-26."They [the jatha] will visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Sri Panja Sahib, Dera Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib and Gurdwara Sacha Sauda," said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi."Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi has issued around 3000 visas to Indian Sikh Yatrees to participate in the 552nd Birth Anniversary celebrations of Baba Guru Nanak in Pakistan from 17-26 November 2021. During their stay in Pakistan, the Sikh Yatrees would pay obeisance at different Gurdwaras including Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib and Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur," read a Pakistan High Commission release.The move came keeping in view the significance of the upcoming occasion of Guru Nanak Gurpurab, and the sentiments associated with the religious festival.Earlier in this year, Pakistan has denied permission to Sikh pilgrims from India on two occasions in June this year-- one on the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev Ji and the second on the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh Ji, the MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.Visas of the Sikh pilgrims have been issued under the Pakistan-India Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines of 1974, which provides for the visit of Sikh pilgrims from India to Pakistan for the birthday celebrations of Baba Guru Nanak.The 1974 Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines between India and Pakistan is a set of principles that was implemented while keeping in view the sentiments and devotion of the various communities in the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-punjab-mlas-to-visit-kartarpur-sahib-on-november-19-101637204814215.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been on the offensive over Akhilesh Yadav’s remark on Jinnah during a public meeting in Hardoi earlier this month. Yadav used Jinnah’s name along with Mahatma Gandhi and other freedom fighters, saying they helped India get freedom and never backed away from the struggle."The politics of appeasement of the Samajwadi Party has brought Jinnah. That's why I tell Akhilesh Yadav that he should change his name to Akhilesh Ali Jinnah. And he should change the name of his party to Jinnahwadi Party," Maurya said on Wednesday.As the campaign for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls intensifies, chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s deputy warned the Samajwadi Party that Jinnah would not win them elections. He also targeted the former UP chief minister over the party’s link with gangster-turned-politicians."Neither (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah nor Atiq Ahmed or (Mukhtar) Ansari could help him win in this election. The people of UP have chosen lotus (BJP). The advantage is reaching the people of the state with honesty. There were mafia and goons here, those have ended and the people are in peace," he said.Referring to Samajwadi Party’s electoral defeats in the last two Lok Sabha elections and the 2017 Assembly polls in UP, Maurya claimed that the party is in panic and is going to lose the fourth time.“We are aware of the ground reality as we have an organisation that is spread to the booth. But the Samajwadi party knows too, they have goons, criminals and mafia," he added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-deputy-cm-says-samajwadi-chief-should-change-his-name-to-akhilesh-ali-jinnah-101637202852913.html

18-11-2021||Dehradun||Nepal again rakes up border row, stakes claim to 3 U’khand villages||Nepal has once again raked up the border issue in Pithoragarh district by claiming three villages in the Kalapani area , raking up an issue that reared its head last year when Kathmandu published a new map showing India’s Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limipiyadhura as part of its territory.The move comes in the context of the country’s ongoing census.Nebin Lal Shresth, director general of Central Bureau of Statistics of Nepal which is responsible for the population census, said while speaking to a leading Nepalese daily Kathamnadu Post on November 10 : “The three villages are under Nepal’s territory but has a presence of Indian armed forces. Hence, there has to be an appropriate solution at the government level so that our team can go there for the population census.”According to an officer of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) which mans the Indian side of the international border Nepal has no claim on the villages. “There is no question of allowing Nepalese authorities to go to the three villages for their census as they are Indian villages.”“They fall in Indian territory and the residents there are Indian citizens. How can the Nepalese authorities carry a census in our area?,” added this officer who asked not to be named.Mahendra Singh, Commandant SSB under whose command the area falls, said that the agency has , however, “given Nepalese authorities access to two of their border villages for the census.”“The two villages named Changru and Tinkar fall in their territory only but the way to them goes through Indian territory. We have given the Nepalese officials permission to go to their villages from our territory as per norms and regulations. We have also strictly told them that they should only go to those areas for which permission has been granted,” said Singh.“SSB is always on alert to stop any unauthorised entry from Nepal side to India while working in coordination with the counterparts in Nepal- Armed Police Force,” he added.RESPONSE FROM MEARelations between India and Nepal soured last year after India opened a road connecting Dharchula to Lipulekh to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar. Both fall in Indian territory.Following the development, Nepal’s parliament on June 18 passed a constitutional amendment under which it unanimously voted to endorse a new political map that showed Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/nepal-again-rakes-up-border-row-stakes-claim-to-3-u-khand-villages-101637196210839.html

18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Dug-up roads, litter an eyesore in Ward 10||First impressions can be misleading and this ward is a case in point. While the well-maintained parks and gardens will leave you awestruck at first, the horticulture waste strewn around road berms, dug-up roads at every few metres and the remnants of the weekly vegetable mandi leave much to be desired. Even outside the traffic police lines in Sector 29, old and rusty barricades and signage can be seen carelessly dumped.Considered to be a stronghold of Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla, ward 10 of Chandigarh comprises Sector 27, 28 and 29. Sector 29 was added to the ward after recent delimitation, while Sector 30, which was earlier part of this ward, has now become a part of Ward 18. This time, the ward has been reserved for women.Apart from sanitation concerns, residents here are also irked by the monkey and dog menace, absence of cycle tracks in some parts and the fact that the civic body failed to carry out proper fogging during the peak of dengue season. Grouse aplentyPardeep Kumar Aggarwal, president, Sector-28 residents’ welfare association (RWA), said, “Earlier we used to dump horticulture waste at Sahaj Safai Kendra (SSK) but now this has been stopped, due to which, residents dump it on road berms. Proper and regular lifting of this waste is needed. There is also a problem of defacement, by means of posters, going unchecked.”He added, “The stray dog menace has aggravated so much here that we have now asked residents to carry a stick for their safety while going out for walks. We have had at least eight dog-bite cases here.” Sudesh, a homemaker staying in Sector 28, says, “A major problem is the unplanned digging being carried out by various firms to lay underground cables. The unattended, open trenches pose a risk to residents, especially children and senior citizens.”Harish Chander Chabbra, secretary, Sector-29 RWA, has a long list of civic issues. “The Apni Mandi that is held in Sector 29 leaves behind too much litter, which is never properly cleaned. Earlier, the market had taps from where residents and shopkeepers used to drink water. But these were removed, causing inconvenience.” Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla said, “I am in touch with the residents of my wards through different WhatsApp groups in which issues and problems are shared. I have been taking up all the issues in a timely manner, but the unplanned digging by private telecom companies still remains unchecked. We had even suggested that MC, while laying the roads, should put a pipe that could be used to lay cables by any agency but so far it has not been taken up.” He added, “Monkey and stray dog menace also remains unchecked despite our best efforts. The lights for service lanes are not being approved either by the MC or administration.” Know your ward Localities: Sector 27, Sector 28 and Sector 29, Chandigarh.

18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala MC house disrupted over voting rights to nominated councillors||The third house meeting of the Ambala municipal corporation held on Wednesday ended after several members of the non-BJP parties objected to the claims of newly sworn-in nominated councillor Sandeep Sachdeva of having voting rights.Sachdeva along with Suresh Sahota, both belonging to the BJP, were administered oath by mayor Shakti Rani Sharma after 14 pending agendas of the last meeting were discussed. The objections were raised after the house decided to discuss new agendas kept forward and BJP members showed disagreement on the issues asking for voting, including the nominated members.On this, a senior member of the Haryana Janchetna Party (HJCP), Rajesh Mehta and his associates contradicted which was seconded by Congress councillor Mithun Verma. Later, the mayor intervened and decided to have a legal opinion.Commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata said, “To get more clarity on the voting rights, we will write to the department of urban local bodies, which will be informed to the house accordingly.”Experts believe that the decision will be crucial as both mayor’s HJCP and the ruling BJP have eight councillors each in the 20-member house, besides two from the Congress and one from the HDF (one other member is accused in a murder case and remains absconding).Action against JEHJCP councillor Shardul Singh raised the issue of discrepancies in the construction work in his ward and alleged that junior engineer (JE) Vishal presented wrong facts before the house.On this, the mayor recommended action against the official. Khadgata said a show-cause notice will be issued to the JE and action will be taken accordingly.The highlights of the discussion on pending agendas of the second meeting remained increasing the number of safai karamchari and menace created by stray animals about which the mayor said sweeping in wards will be improved and the tender of the company engaged in catching animals has been extended after it expired recently. The commissioner said, “The house proceedings went smoothly. Other than previous agendas, a few post-facto sanctions, including the nomination of land to gaushala on five acres of land, were passed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-mc-house-disrupted-over-voting-rights-to-nominated-councillors-101637189578749.html

People even fear to come to the park due to stray dogs.”Former councillor of the area Bobby Kamboj said, “During my tenure, the park was well maintained, but ever since it came under the MC, it is not maintained properly.”Superintending engineer, MC, Sanjay Kanwar did not respond to the repeated calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-sector-68-city-park-cries-for-attention-101637189401630.html
18-11-2021||Chandigarh||World COPD Day: Important to focus on lung health, says Padma Shri Dr Digambar Behera||If a patient suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) gets infected with Covid-19, the chance of mortality increases. Even in light of Covid, COPD remains a leading cause of death and now it is more important to focus on lung health. This was stated by Padma Shri recipient Dr Digambar Behera during a panel discussion on Wednesday. The discussion was organised by Zorgers Healthcare to raise awareness on World COPD Day. Dr Behera said people should keep their lungs healthy by avoiding cigarettes, air pollution or occupational exposures and by staying active either through regular physical activity or pulmonary rehabilitation. While speaking on the occasion, Dr Vishal Sharma and Dr Sunny Virdi, pulmonologists, said, “The main risk factors for COPD are tobacco smoking, atmospheric air pollution as well as indoor pollution due to smoke from biomass used for cooking. However, lifestyle changes like eating healthy, exercise and vaccination help cope with limitations created by the disease.” “Smoking is suicide by instalments. There is a huge risk among COPD patients to get severe Covid infections as smoking leads to weakened immunity,” said another pulmonologist, Dr Suresh K Goyal. Varun Gupta, founder, Zorgers, said, “Around 10-15% of our patients are COPD and these patients are in a high degree of need for non-invasive ventilation equipment likes Bipap, CPAP or Portable ventilators and many of them do require oxygenation as well where oxygen cylinder or concentrator is also required to keep them comfortable at home under the supervision of a nurse and a treating pulmonologist.” Pulmonologists Dr Zafar Ahmed Iqbal and Dr Rahul Katyal were also present during the panel discussion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/world-copd-day-important-to-focus-on-lung-health-says-padma-shri-dr-digambar-behera-101637189400002.html
18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PU students urge university to hold online exams||With Panjab University (PU) planning to conduct the upcoming semester exams in physical mode, the students have urged the university to hold them online as the teaching for the current semester was conducted in the online mode.A day after the university announced that they were preparing to hold the semester exam in the offline mode, members of the Punjab Students Union (PSU-Lalkaar) on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to the university urging them to hold the exams in online mode.The students said they stand on online exams for online classes, offline exams for offline classes. The teaching for the current semester was held online at PU due to the pandemic and semester exams are scheduled to start in December.The members of the PSU-Lalkaar also suggested that the university should either conduct at least 30 days of offline teaching before the exams if they wanted to take offline exams.Students associated with the Student Organisation of India (SOI) also wrote to the university on Monday regarding the mode of upcoming semester exams. They requested the university to hold the semester exams in online mode. “With teaching conducted online, conducting offline exams appears to be unfair to the students who have been taught in online mode for the last one year,” they wrote.“Students are saying that classes for this semester were held in online mode and no physical classes were held on campus. So, exams should also be held in online mode. The university must conduct offline classes in the upcoming semester so that exams can be held offline as well,” said Manjodh Singh Padda of the SOI.An official of the university said, “We will deliberate on the matter.”Meanwhile, PU on Wednesday announced that the practical examination for the postgraduate classes will be held from December 20 to 24, instead of December 21 to 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pu-students-urge-university-to-hold-online-exams-101637189338311.html

Each person, whose second dose is overdue, is being contacted and a special drive has been undertaken to vaccinate them at the earliest,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg.He added, “So far, Trident Group, Kandhari Beverages Private Limited and Hotel and Restaurant Association of Chandigarh, have offered to provide gift hampers or coupons to the winners of the lucky draw.”The UT health secretary also said that any organization, association or society, that wants to contribute at least 25 gift hampers or coupons of ₹1,000 each, may contact Rakesh Popli, director hospitality, or Rajiv Tiwari, director public relations, UT administration, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-organise-lucky-draw-for-people-getting-vaccinated-between-nov-18-and-30-101637188138182.html
18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PU’s iconic Student Centre to reopen from Dec 1||The iconic Student Centre of Panjab University (PU), which remained closed after the pandemic broke-out, last year in March, will reopen from December 1.The university has approved its reopening from December 1 and will be announced soon, sources at the university said on Wednesday. The eateries at the Student Centre, which is one of the main attractions on the campus, will be allowed to reopen. However, some riders are expected, too, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.PU is in the process of phased reopening of the campus and so far many departments have reopened for postgraduate students. The step to reopen the Student Centre is said to bring normalcy on the campus as it is the epicentre of student activities.PU’s Student Centre is considered the heart of the social activities of students. Its building houses an old Coffee House, recreation room, offices of the students’ council and the dean-students’ welfare and a couple of eateries. “It is a welcome decision not only for students but also for all those whose livelihood depends on it,” said Nikhil Narmeta of the NSUI.President of the Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA), Mritunjay Kumar said, “The Student Centre is an epicentre of campus life in PU and its reopening will help in bringing normalcy on the campus. If the university is considering reopening it, that is a welcome step. Since AC Joshi library is open, students need a place where they can interact with each other.”The reopening of the famous South India Coffee house at PU’s Student Centre is still unclear. In October last year, the South India Coffee House was auctioned for ₹1,03,000 per month for a period of five years. It had announced its closure in June 2019. The Coffee House, which was opened in 1975, had announced its closure due to a decrease in footfall and consequent losses.Meanwhile, the university is in the process of further reopening the campus for students. A meeting of the panel in this regard is expected in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pu-s-iconic-student-centre-to-reopen-from-dec-1-101637187839830.html

The plea was taken up for hearing on Wednesday but deferred to Thursday as the petitioners were claiming that the Chandigarh can notify elections anytime now and petition would become infructuous.The pleas argue that the notification on reservation of wards should be issued after excluding the population of colonies that have been demolished or partly demolished. They also sought a fresh notification on reservation of seven wards, which have been reserved for scheduled caste category. The plea stated that though Chandigarh had in December 2020 duly emphasised that the latest population data, based on electoral rolls, would be taken into account, the same was not done while determining the selection of wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-elections-high-court-to-take-up-plea-challenging-reservation-notification-today-101637185497952.html

The project has been moving at snail’s pace and the damaged sewer line was yet another setback. The under-construction railway under bridge (RUB) at the Pakhowal road railway crossing - from Pakhowal canal bridge towards Sarabha Nagar - had turned into a pool of filthy sewer water after the chamber of a main sewer line (72-inches wide) was damaged during the construction process in the last week of October.The main line caters to the dense population residing in Dholewal area, Dugri, Gill Road, and Partap Chowk among other areas. The MC has blamed the railway department for damaging the line. An official, requesting anonymity, said, it took some time to carry out repairs as it was the main line and sewer lines in many areas would have choked if it had been completely closed for repairs. The flow of sewer waste was controlled for repairing the line.Sabharwal said that both - the MC contractor and the railway department officials have been directed to expedite the construction work and the project should be completed by December 31.Under this project two RUBs and one ROB is being constructed at Pakhowal road railway crossings under the smart city mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pakhowal-road-rob-rub-project-damaged-sewer-line-repaired-101637184237738.html

18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: IELTS-qualified brides ditching spouses due to contract marriages, says expert||With men increasingly using IELTS-qualified brides as a crutch to fulfil their dream of settling abroad, many cases of fraud and cheating have been filed against the women and their families after they snapped ties with their husbands on reaching foreign lands, citing “compatibility issues.” Panjab University sociology professor Dr Rajesh Gill, while speaking at a webinar at the Punjab Agricultural University, says the contractual nature of such unions is responsible for the dissolution of these “NRI marriages.” Blaming men for “clinging on women’s shoulders” after failing to clear the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam, which is mandatory for securing a visa, Gill said, “The men hunt for an intelligent woman with a good IELTS score. They invest money on her, hoping that she will realise their ‘foreign dream’. Later, when the bride faces compatibility issues and snaps ties, they cry fraud and blame the bride for not honouring the sanctity of marriage. However, the fact is that the whole foundation of contractual marriage is based on lies.” “Instead of blaming the girl, this system of contract marriages needs to be abolished and the men should be made competent enough to clear any qualifying exam so that they do not have to use women as a crutch to fulfil their dreams,” Gill said, adding that around 3,000 Punjabi grooms, who had funded their wives education in a foreign country, but far from getting a spouse visa had been deserted by their wives, have collectively suffered a loss of around ₹100 crore. PAU professor Preeti Sharma said that the seminar on ‘NRI Marriages: Issues, Challenges and the Way Forward” had been held in collaboration with the National Commission of Women, New Delhi, to review sensitive, crucial concerns pertaining to NRI marriages in Punjab and to forward solutions.Dr Manoj Kumar, associate Professor, Post Graduate Government College for Girls, Chandigarh, said one should properly vet the groom before getting married and avoid illegal migration through the course of marriages. “Governmental as well as societal reforms are required to avoid such circumstances,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-ielts-qualified-brides-ditching-spouses-due-to-contract-marriages-says-expert-101637182497643.html

18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: 9 months on, anti-smog project hangs fire amid worsening air quality||Nine months after municipal corporation officials tested anti-smog guns in the presence of Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, the cutting-edge guns are nowhere in sight even as smog continues to obstruct commuters’ vision, especially in the morning and evening, due to worsening air quality in the region. At the time of the trial, which had taken place in February under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), officials had said that the anti-smog guns will help lower the pollution levels in the industrial hub, and yet the project has failed to see the light of the day. Meanwhile, the air quality index for Ludhiana had dived into the ‘very-poor’ category due to stubble burning, bursting of fire crackers during the festive season and weather conditions conducive to formation of smog. Anti-smog guns spray atomised water into the air to settle dust and other suspended particles, thereby reducing air pollution. An official, who requested anonymity, said, “Authorities have planned to purchase four machines for the city under NCAP. The Union government has allotted ₹52 crore to improve the air quality of the city, of which 70 lakh is to be used to purchase the anti-smog guns.” City has failed to meet air-quality standards for 5 years Ludhiana ranks among the nine non-attainment cities in Punjab as per NCAP norms, which means it has consistently failed to meet the national ambient air-quality standards (NAAQS) for harmful particulate matter, which is 10 microns or less in diameter, for five years. A local, Manjit Singh of Chandigarh Road, blamed the lackadaisical approach of the municipal corporation for the rising pollution levels in the city. “An anti-smog project is the need of the hour. The guns will not only be useful during Diwali or stubble burning season, but round the year as Ludhiana has approximately 1-lakh industrial units.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said tenders for the project had been floated. “It, however, took some time to complete the formalities and to take a call on which machine was to be bought. The tender will be opened next week, after which the guns will be purchased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-9-months-on-anti-smog-project-hangs-fire-amid-worsening-air-quality-101637181657535.html
18-11-2021||Kolkata||‘Impossible to work in BJP’: Ex-TMC lawmaker’s U-turn on civic poll eve||KOLKATA: Nine months after his Delhi-bound chartered flight to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence along with five Trinamool Congress (TMC) rebels, former Bengal lawmaker Prabir Ghosal attacked his new party on Wednesday, saying it was “impossible for anyone to work in the BJP”.Taking the BJP leadership by surprise, Prabir Ghosal, who joined the TMC on the eve of the 2016 assembly polls and won the Uttarpara seat before switching to the BJP in January, wrote an article for Wednesday’s edition of Jago Bangla, the ruling TMC’s official mouthpiece.“The number of people who ask for money all the time outnumbers those who work for the BJP,” Ghosal wrote in his piece which strongly criticized the saffron camp.On January 30, Shah welcomed former TMC minister Rajib Banerjee and a group of rebels into the BJP at his Delhi residence. Banerjee, who was Bengal’s forest minister, resigned from the Domjur assembly seat in Howrah district a day before taking the chartered flight. Those who joined the BJP along with Banerjee in January were Vaishali Dalmiya, the then MLA from Bally in Howrah who had been expelled by the TMC; Prabir Ghosal, the then MLA from Uttarpara in Hooghly district; Rathin Chakraborty, former mayor of Howrah town; Partha Sarathi Chatterjee, former MLA from Ranaghat in Nadia district and actor Rudranil Ghosh.In the March-April assembly polls, Rajib Banerjee, Dalmiya, Ghosal, Chakraborty and Ghosh lost to the TMC.Rajib Banerjee returned to the TMC on October 31. Prabir Ghosal did distance himself from the BJP after the verdict was announced on May 2 but hasn’t walked out of the party yet. The other three also are seen in very few BJP events.“All I have seen in these nine months is BJP leaders and workers in my district asking for money from me for holding party programmes, be it a street-corner meeting or a rally,” Ghosal said on Wednesday afternoon.“Also, there are so many factions in the BJP’s old organisation that anybody will lose count. I find it quite impossible to work here. No state BJP leader has contacted me in months,” he said. The article published in the TMC mouthpiece was seen to signal Ghosal’s exit. But he claimed that he hasn’t spoken with “any senior TMC leader so far about returning to the party”.BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh rubbished his allegations and stressed that Ghosal can just walk out of the party.“If Ghosal wants to return to the TMC, he is free to do so. Why is he maligning the BJP by levelling false allegations? I was the state president till September. He never came to me with his complaints. He is making up stories to impress Mamata Banerjee,” said Ghosh.On Wednesday afternoon, the chief minister said at an administrative meeting that civic body elections, which are long overdue, will be held in Kolkata and Howrah first and will be followed by elections in other districts. There are 120-odd civic bodies across Bengal. Within hours, BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar announced two election committees for Howrah and Kolkata. While Vaishali Dalmiya and Rudranil Ghosh were made co-in-charge of the Kolkata committee, Rathin Chakraborty was put in charge of the committee for Howrah. Several BJP leaders said this was an effort to keep the TMC turncoats in good humour on the eve of the civic polls.Although the BJP bagged 77 assembly seats six months ago, five legislators have joined the TMC since June and the party lost two seats in the October 30 bypolls which had to be held because the winners did not take oath in the assembly to retain their Lok Sabha seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/impossible-to-work-in-bjp-ex-tmc-lawmaker-s-u-turn-on-civic-poll-eve-101637181357771.html

The services of the NHM workers were terminated on October 18, after they went on a strike without giving prior intimation, to press for salaries at DC rates. In the letter to the terminated staff, NHM nodal officer for UT, Dr Charru Singla said, “Many of the terminated staff, realising their mistake on proceeding on a sudden strike, have appeared before NHM mission director and requested to take them back under NHM. All those who wish to re-join may submit their written request by November 22, while the requests will be considered by the screening committee for appropriate decision.”The screening committee comprises medical superintendent of Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, NHM nodal officer and district family welfare officer. The letter further read that the guidelines issued by the Central government for service conditions, including pay to NHM staff, will be strictly followed. As per the decision of the executive committee, the status of salaries or wages to NHM employees is being ascertained from other UTs, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to re-examine the aspect of pay to NHM staff as per the DC rates, separately.Work will be under scrutiny “Also, the NHM workers conduct will remain under strict watch for at least next six months. In case of any indiscipline or poor performance, their contractual appointment may be terminated again without any notice,” the notice added.Meanwhile, Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “The sudden strike by NHM employees had hampered the health facilities.

The others can apply too and if their assurance will be satisfactory, they will be hired again.”Around 500 NHM employees, working under the UT health department as doctors, paramedical staff and managerial employees, including nursing officers, pharmacy officers, auxiliary nurse midwives, lab technicians, dental technicians and other Group-4 staffers, have been working at salaries lower than the approved minimum wages since 2013. Meanwhile, Amit Kumar, general secretary of the NHM union, said, “All the terminated employees want to return to their duties as we have been protesting for the last 20 days. Every employee has a family to look after and without salaries, it is difficult to manage. Also, we will request the authorities to consider the pay hike of the NHM employees at par with DC rate.”FACT FILE:In August, over 300 NHM workers went on indefinite leave for 12 days to press for their demand for equal wages for equal work.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Sabina passed these orders on a petition filed by Keshav Singh, who alleged that in June 2020, results of the fifth semester of the course he was enrolled in at Government College, Hamirpur, were declared wherein he got 5 marks only out of 70, due to which he could not get admission to NIT. He applied for rechecking after which he scored 47 marks in that paper. He said the re-evaluation result was declared after counselling of MSc and by that time all seats were filled up and admission of the petitioner was not accepted. He has alleged that though he again qualified for IIT Jam, 2021, the mental harassment and depression which he faced is irreparable. He lost a period of one year during the era of this cutthroat competition and thousands of people overtook him. He has alleged that due to negligence of the respondent university, he remained deprived of investing his one year for making his career bright. The court has directed the respondents to file their reply within three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/evaluation-of-answer-sheet-hc-issues-notice-to-himachal-pradesh-university-registrar-101637180637374.html

Similarly, TPR has increased to 0.30% in November as compared to 0.20% in October and 0.27% in September. The TPR in the first 16 days of November is highest after July’s 0.32%, when the second wave was tapering off. If TPR is below 5%, it indicates that the infection is under control in a community. The UT recorded 2,183 Covid infections from November 1 to 16 at 136 persons on an average contracting the virus every day. In October, the number was 2,819.However, it is Kashmir which is contributing to the escalating Covid parameters. Of the 2,183 cases so far in November, 1,864 have been reported in Kashmir and of the 23 deaths, the Valley saw 20 fatalities.Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) said hospitals in Valley are once again witnessing a rise in the number of severe infections. ”The number of Covid admissions has increased five times over the last few days,” said DAK president and influenza expert Dr Nisar ul Hassan. “Most of these admitted patients are either unvaccinated or have received a single dose of vaccine,” he added. In Kashmir, Srinagar has been consistently contributing to the total caseload for the past few weeks. In November, it added 921 cases to the Covid tally.The active cases have shot up by 70% this month — from 902 on October 31 to 1,544 on November 16. The active cases are highest in Srinagar (640), Baramulla (267), Ganderbal (115) and Budgam (113), while 93 such cases are there in Jammu. DAK general secretary Dr Arshad Ali said the number is expected to rise further in coming days as people have abandoned Covid precautions. “Many people don’t wear masks and don’t care about physical distancing,” he said.The data reveals that on an average, 45,047 tests were conducted daily in November against 43,482 daily tests in October. As many as 49,374 average daily tests were done in September, 53,359 in August and 56,719 in July.As many as 13.06 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in November so far. Around 65 lakh people were vaccinated in J&K with one or both the doses in September and October. DAK spokesperson Dr Riyaz Ahmad Dagga said we have a significant portion of the population which is susceptible to the virus. “People must continue to adhere to the health guidelines to avoid a catastrophic slip-up. And, it is vitally important to vaccinate the unvaccinated people quickly to prevent further spread of the disease,” he added. 168 more test positive in last 24 hoursMeanwhile, the UT on Wednesday recorded 168 new Covid cases and two deaths, an official health bulletin said. The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 197 with active positive reaching 1,513.The total recoveries reached 3,28,630 and its rate climbed up to 98.21%.

The varsity’s wind analysis report, which was submitted by climate change and agriculture meteorology department head Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, says the wind speed had exceeded 5km per hour only on three days between October 1 and November 15, and had remained below 2-3km per hour for the remaining days. “In the circumstances, it is unlikely that the smoke travelled 300km and polluted Delhi,” she said, adding that the smoke had raised the pollution level in Punjab more than Delhi. “It was on October 23, 24 and November 2 that the wind speed was found to be over 5km. On the remaining days, when the wind speed was below 2km per hour, photochemical smog was seen locally,” said Sidhu. Photochemical smog is produced when ultraviolet rays from the sun react with nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. “It is visible as a brown haze, and is most prominent in the morning and afternoon. Earlier, it was only seen in densely populated cities with high-emission levels, but nowadays it is being witnessed in the villages in Malwa region as well,” she said“In layman’s terms, Punjab’s smoke is not travelling 300-400km to choke Delhi’s lungs, rather the farmers are harming their own children and brethren by setting their fields on fire,” said Sidhu. In 2019 and 2020, Ludhiana’s air quality index on Diwali was at 263 and 346 points. However, this year, it crossed 400 points, as per an air-quality website. However, the Central Pollution Control Board website showed the peak pollution level at 293 points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stubble-burning-hurting-punjab-more-than-delhi-finds-pau-report-101637180217309.html

In a series of tweets, he said that as per the law, the government had the powers to proceed on the basis of the report. “It should be immediately made public, an FIR should be registered on its basis and a time bound investigation should be initiated to catch the big fishes responsible for narco-terrorism (sic),” he posted.Sidhu’s demand for making the 2018 STF report public has not found favour with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi who insists that opening it is the prerogative of the high court. “How can we open a court document? It is not a government document,” Channi told Hindustan Times in an interview last Sunday.Sharing reports of the National Crime Records Bureau, the PPCC chief tweeted that it was promised to the people of Punjab in 2017 that the backbone of drugs would be broken in four weeks, but the state continuously retained the top position in drug case rate. “We have been accused of carrying forward the inglorious legacy of Akalis by waging a sham war on drugs,” he said in another post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stf-report-on-drug-cases-should-be-made-public-says-punjab-congress-chief-navjot-sidhu-101637180097505.html
18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Rumblings in J&K Congress: Over a dozen Ghulam Nabi Azad loyalists resign from party posts||Yet again the internal fissures in the J&K Pradesh Congress have come to the fore as over a dozen leaders of the party, loyal to Ghulam Nabi Azad, have resigned from their respective posts. They have sent their resignation letter to AICC president Sonia Gandhi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and incharge J&K affairs Rajni Patil. Those who submitted the resignation are GM Saroori, Jugal Kishore Sharma, Vikar Rasool, Dr Manohar Lal Sharma, Ghulam Nabi Monga, Naresh Gupta, Subash Gupta, Amin Bhat, Anwar Bhat, Inayat Ali and others. On the condition of anonymity, one of the leaders said, “The resignation was sent 10 days ago, but we have been saying it for the past two to three years that we are not being heard in the party. Therefore we resigned from the party posts, but not from the membership”. “Undoubtedly, we are Azad loyalists but not the part of G-23. Moreover, it was not the first instance. At least 10 to 12 letters have been shot to the high command in the past three years telling it to save the JKPCC,” he added. The leader said that majority of those in the JKPCC were not happy with the present leadership and want Ghulam Nabi Azad to rejuvenate Congress in J&K. “Under GA Mir, over 200 leaders, including former minister, MLAs, MLCs and those on key posts have left the party in the past two to three years and joined other outfits,” he added. The leader, however, denied that JKPCC was a divided house. “Party’s official working is not up to the mark and that’s the problem,” he said. JKPCC president GA Mir, meanwhile, feigned ignorance to mass resignations of Azad loyalists from their party posts. “By going to the press, they have violated the discipline and my view is that they will have to get ready to face the consequences,” said Mir. A loyalist of Mir said, “If there was any grievance it should have been raised within the party. If they had sent their resignations to party high command then they should have waited for the reply. Why they went to the media?” “Rahul Gandhi met all of them in Srinagar and Jammu and then to say that they are not being heard is ridiculous,” he said. Mir loyalist claimed that they all were acting on the instructions of Azad. “Bypassing state president and writing to Sonia and Rahul is a violation of the discipline,” he added. Former Congress MLC Naresh Gupta said, “We have tendered resignation from party posts but not from membership. We are the ones who worked for 30 to 40 years and under the leadership of Azad, Indira Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul raised the Congress in J&K.” “We want that new faces should come in the Congress, but the leadership was adamant and we were not being heard. We wanted the party leadership to listen to us and see the reasons behind exit of multiple leaders,” he added. Gupta said none of them was going to join the BJP. “Almost 90% leadership of the J&K Congress want the party to be reinvigorated,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rumblings-in-j-k-congress-over-a-dozen-ghulam-nabi-azad-loyalists-resign-from-party-posts-101637179977227.html

The application comes at a time when court is likely to decide on opening of reports lying in a sealed cover since 2018 on the role of high-profile politicians and police officials. Majithia’s application will be taken up by the bench of Justices AG Masih and Sandeep Moudgil on Thursday. Earlier this year, advocate Navkiran Singh, who was an intervener in the 2013 petition, had filed an application seeking opening of the reports. Subsequently, the Punjab government, after Charanjit Singh Channi took over as CM too had filed an application demanding the same. Majithia said in the garb of public interest, a “malicious and malafide agenda” has been launched by his political opponents to target him and give an impression that he has been insulated from a fair investigation process. The application claims that the intervenor, Navkiran Singh, who was the first to demand opening of these reports, is an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and was acting due to political reasons. In the plea, Majithia also levelled allegations against Punjab home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, who he claimed were indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” on the issue of drugs against him. The plea says the special investigation teams filed 10 challans in the drug cases and no evidence surfaced against the Akali MLA. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) too examined a case in 2017 but no prosecution complaint has been filed till now, he added. The plea claims the allegations made by his political opponents against him are based on statements publically available, which were scrutinised by the investigating agencies, reviewed by court-appointed SITs and discarded by the trial court. Without there being any substantial material on record, his political opponents were targeting him only for reaping political benefits when the Vidhan Sabha elections are just round the corner, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-mla-bikram-majithia-moves-high-court-says-he-be-made-party-in-bhola-drug-case-101637179738296.html

Addressing a public meeting here at Phillaur (Jalandhar) in favour of SAD-BSP candidate Baldev Singh Khaira, Sukhbir claimed, “It is shocking that the CM has, in his meeting with Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) representatives, made it clear that the Congress government would not waive loans of farmers as promised by it.”He added that this proved that the Congress government made false promises during its campaigning for the 2017 assembly polls, with the sole intention of just getting their votes.“Channi must seek forgiveness from farmers for this perfidy. The CM has also not done justice with cotton farmers who crop had been damaged due to the pink bollworm attack in the Malwa region, even as the loss is at least ₹40,000 per acre,” he claimed, adding, “Channi says one thing and does another and cannot be trusted.”  Sukhbir held meetings at Phillaur city, Goraya, Gohawar and Takhar villages. He also held one-on-one interaction with different sections of society where he shared his vision for the inclusive growth of Punjab. While answering the public queries, he gave a broad outline of the road map he envisioned for the state, if the SAD-BSP were voted to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/explain-failure-to-waive-farm-loans-for-five-years-sukhbir-to-cong-govt-101637179617037.html

The jatha comprising the panj pyare (five beloved of Guru) crossed over to Pakistan at 11am. Officials of the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI) and the Border Security Force (BSF) honoured the members of the jatha with siropas (robes of honour) at the Dera Baba Nanak integrated check-post (ICP). The first batch of pilgrims, including Neelam Grewal, the vice-chancellor of Guru Kashi University at Talwandi Sabo, was accorded a warm welcome upon crossing the zero line by Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) president Ameer Singh and chief executive officer of Pakistan project management unit Muhammad Latif. Grewal said she received a phone call on Tuesday and filled the form to visit the shrine. Ameer Singh said it was good that the corridor had finally been opened. “Our prayers have been heard,” he said. “A list of 50 persons comprising some dignitaries and panj pyare was approved by the Centre for Wednesday’s visit but 28 members visited the shrine,” said a senior customs official at the Dera Baba Nanak ICP. The online registration process for visiting Kartarpur has also been started, the official added. “Those who are getting themselves registered through the online portal will be able to cross over to Pakistan after 10 days,” he said. But the online portal shows available slots from November 19 if one applies now.Sources said the first jatha pilgrims also included some of those who had applied slightly before the corridor was closed due to the pandemic outbreak. Lovepreet Singh of Gurdaspur said, “I had applied for visiting Kartarpur Sahib before the lockdown restrictions were imposed. My file was processed and I had got clearance. On Tuesday, I got a call informing me that I can visit the holy shrine. I am quite happy as my wish has been fulfilled.”Jaspal Singh from New Delhi said, “We were given a warm welcome after crossing the zero line. Around 500 people from Pakistan had already been there for paying obeisance. The devotees from Pakistan said they were eagerly awaiting the reopening of the corridor for the last two years.”The reopening of the corridor coincides with the 552nd birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday announced the Centre’s decision to reopen the visa-free 4.7-km corridor that connects Dera Baba Nanak Sahib gurdwara on the Indian side with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of the first Sikh Guru. On Thursday, another group of pilgrims, including Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi along with other Congress MLAs will visit Kartarpur. It was not confirmed whether Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu will also be part of the group. “The list is yet to be finalised, but we think around 100 people will go on Thursday,” said a customs official.A delegation of BJP leaders will also visit the historic gurdwara via the corridor on Thursday. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is also taking a delegation to pay obeisance at Kartarpur on Friday. AAP senior leader Harpal Singh Cheema said, “All of our MLAs led by party state president Bhagwant Mann will go to Kartarpur on Friday. We are waiting for the clearance.”The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has also announced to take a delegation to Kartarpur on Friday on the 552nd birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. The delegation will be headed by gurdwara body chief Jagir Kaur. “We are finalising the list of pilgrims who will be part of the SGPC jatha. The list will be sent to the Centre,” said an SGPC spokesperson.LPAI manager Sukhdev Singh said they have made adequate arrangements for hassle-free journey of pilgrims at the Dera Baba Nanak ICP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/28member-jatha-visits-kartarpur-on-day-1-of-reopening-of-corridor-101637179138558.html

Also, they are more prone to this disease, as they play outdoors and are not aware of the ways the disease spreads.Dr Puneet A Pooni, professor and head of the department of paediatrics, said, “Parents must ensure that kids wear full-sleeved clothes, use mosquito repellent, maintain good personal hygiene and avoid stagnation of water to stop the breeding of the mosquitoes.’’Dr Deepak Bhat, professor at the department of paediatrics, said that fever is the most common symptom of dengue, and parents must use paracetamol/crocin only and avoid Nimesulide, Ibugesic Plus and Meftal P as these medications can increase the risk of bleeding.According to Dr GS Dhooria, professor, department of paediatrics, sponging during fever (with tap water) and adequate liquid intake can lower risk. “For liquids intake, do not use packed juices, cold drinks, Glucon-D etc. Instead, ORS water or home-made lemon water must be used,” he said.All paediatricians stressed that the parents that as fever recedes, parents must watch out for warning signs. If the child has persistent stomach pain or vomiting, lethargy, mild bleeding from the nose or gums, decreased urination, dry and cool skin or restless, medical help must be sought immediately. Timely diagnosis and prompt response can prevent dengue.23 new dengue cases emergeAs many as 23 fresh cases of dengue were reported from the district in the last 24 hours, district health department officials said on Wednesday. The total count of confirmed dengue patients in the district has reached 1,623, while 4,137 people are suspected to have contracted the disease.Of the total confirmed cases, 1,197 have been reported from Ludhiana city, while the others have been reported from Khanna, Jagraon, Payal, Samrala and Sahnewal among other areas.Meanwhile, three new cases of Covid-19 were reported from the district during in the last 24 hours.

They are bound to comply with it,” the bench said.The application was filed in a pending petition by two lawyers Anil Kumar Hajelay and Manashwy Jha seeking various prayers including conducting hybrid hearings in district courts on physical hearing days because of the Covid-19 threat.The fresh plea has contended that despite the high court’s directions, the subordinate courts were not complying with it. Hajelay claimed that even when advocates are making such a request, permission was not being granted by some of the trial court judges.Delhi government additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal said that he has also faced similar difficulties. Advocate Anurag Ahluwalia, who was representing the Delhi high court, said he would seek instructions in this regard.The court listed the matter for further hearing on November 18.The court had earlier said there was an apprehension of a rise in Covid-19 cases and directed that the infrastructure for hybrid hearings in district courts and other quasi-judicial bodies must be in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/trial-courts-should-comply-with-delhi-hc-order-can-t-refuse-virtual-hearings-101637177640593.html

18-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram corporation to procure jet packer machine to speed up road repair||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is looking to procure jet patcher machines to repair potholes in a matter of hours, a process that usually takes around a week to complete, said officials on Wednesday.Unlike a conventional hot-mix machine, a jet patcher machine can fix potholes at any time in the year. MCG officials said that jet patcher machines can be used during rains or peak winter season, and its pollution-free component also allows its use during high pollution periods in the national capital region (NCR).“The period between February and May, as well as September are currently the only months in which we can carry out any type of road construction work. We cannot carry out road repair work in June, July, and August due to the rain, or in October, November, and December due to high levels of air pollution. In January, the temperature is too low for initiating bitumen-related work,” said a senior MCG official in the engineering wing, requesting anonymity.The official quoted above explained that with the new machines, it will be possible to ensure potholes are filled as soon as they are noticed--which is of extreme importance during the monsoon season. He said the jet patcher machine costs around ₹2 crore and takes around five minutes to repair a pothole.The MCG has floated a tender to empanel an agency that will maintain roads under the jurisdiction of the civic body by using jet patcher machines to fill potholes. Bids for this tender will be opened next Monday.TL Sharma, chief engineer, MCG, could not be reached for a comment.In a jet patcher machine, air is dispersed at a high speed from a blower to clean the top road surface, then tar is added over the affected patch at a jet-like speed, then a cold mix is subsequently added.Both a hot mix and cold mix have the same components, such as asphalt and bitumen. In a hot mix, these components are heated at a high temperature above 300 degrees Celsius, and ideally used in the construction of high-volume traffic stretches, such as highways. In a cold mix, these components are mixed with water and require no heating. Cold mix is ideal for fixing potholes and other repair work.After the cold mix is added, a final layer of tar is added to even the road surface. Jet patcher machines are usually fixed on top of construction vehicles.Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban roads design expert at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, said that jet patcher machines will help MCG save both time and money.“With a jet patcher machine, patchwork can be completed within a couple of hours. The other advantage is that the machines are movable and can be transported to any other part of the city on short notice. The biggest advantage, however, is that they will eliminate the need for MCG to float different tenders for localised road repair work. Instead, they can simply use jet patcher machines across the city, thereby saving time and operational costs,” said Sewa Ram.How a jet patcher machine worksIn a jet patcher machine, air is dispersed at a high speed from a blower to clean the top road surface, then tar is added over the affected patch at a jet-like speed, and a cold mix is subsequently added.

During the meeting, personnel at the station level were also asked to ensure that no person takes a house on rent without being vetted/verified first by the police station concerned. “ All police stations of Delhi have been provided with three Inspector rank officers— a station house officer, inspector(law and order), and Inspector (investigation). This will help in better supervision of criminal investigations, handling law and order challenges and also better management of citizen services at the station level. The availability of three Inspectors will also ensure that each Inspector gets an assured weekly off without hampering the quality of day-to-day management at police stations,” a police spokesperson said. During the meeting, the police chief also told senior officers to ensure coordination between the Railway Police, the Metro Police and the local police for better prevention and detection of crimes in major transportation hubs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-protocol-delhi-police-chief-orders-focus-on-bars-restaurants-101637177576976.html
18-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Sabz Burj gets a new lease of life||New Delhi: It is called Sabz (green) Burj, but covered with turquoise blue tiles. The monument, counted among the earliest Mughal-era buildings, has received a new lease of life following a four-year-long conservation bid. Located at the busy intersection of two key arterial roads—Mathura Road and Lodhi Road— the domed tomb lies to the west of Humayun’s Tomb and serves as a gateway to the world heritage site. Though it is said to be built in the 1530s, there is no record of who built the tomb and for whom. It demonstrates Timurid architectural style synonymous with Central Asia and is double-domed like Humayun’s Tomb. The tomb’s outer dome is dotted with glazed tiles and displays unique geometric and interlacing patterns in different colours, and forms a prominent part of the neighbourhood’s skyline. With the word “sabz” in its name means “green”, the tomb is largely covered in turquoise blue tiles. The lotus finial atop the dome and the neck, however, consist of green tiles. The incised plasterwork also gives a hint of green colour in parts. Experts say that the name of the monument might have originated through local folklores. The monument was used as a police station in the early 20th century. During this period, the painted interiors were plastered over due to which much of the façade decoration was lost, and replaced with layers of cement. By the 1980’s, much of the tile work on the dome had fallen away and was re-tiled with modern tiles fixed with cement mortar. Conservation work at the monument was carried out by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) in partnership with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and funded by Havells through CSR intervention which will also be illuminating the building. The four-year long conservation project involved restoration of tiles on the dome and decorative plaster patterns on all eight sides of the facade. Tiles matching the physical and chemical properties of the 16th century tiles have now been restored on the dome as well as on the drum where pieces were missing. A unique feature of the monument, that came to light during conservation works, was the revelation of a painted ceiling with detailed floral motifs and patterns created in real gold and lapis lazuli. Lapis lazuli, or lapis for short, is a deep-blue metamorphic rock used as a semi-precious stone that has been prized since antiquity for its intense color. Taking into account the immense importance of the ceiling, no restoration of missing portions was carried out by the team. Ratish Nanda, CEO, Aga Khan Trust for Culture India, said the ceiling of the tomb and the building was covered with cement during the time it served as a police station. “The intricate pattern on the ceiling is made of pure gold and lapiz. This is the most significant element of the tomb. However, the building was covered with cement plaster during the time it served as a police station. We tried to remove the layers and unveil the original ceiling as much as we could,” said Nanda. He said while there was no grave at the mausoleum, one could estimate that the tomb belonged to an important nobleman since the ceiling was made of gold. “The ceiling is sensational and of great significance. The yellow traces that we now see is pure gold. The gold painting has been done on pure blue lapiz background. This tells us that someone significant was associate with the tomb,” said Nanda. Ujwala Menon, AKTC’s conservation architect, said over 20,000 tiles were tested for achieving the physical and chemical composition used for the original building. The new tiles were made by skilled craftspersons whereas all surviving original tiles were retained. “The tilework on the dome and the neck, the painted ceiling that has been revealed, the incised plasterwork and the detailed ornamental work in the building that has been restored are some of the significant elements that add to the importance of the structure,” said Menon. Historian and author Swapna Liddle said the high drum of the tomb was a typical feature of Timurid period. Liddle said the architecture made the monument unique. “The ‘Nila Gumbad’ also, to an extent, shows Timurid style,” said Liddle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sabz-burj-gets-a-new-lease-of-life-101637177516973.html

We are awaiting the approval from the Centre,” a senior official of the Indian Government, Hyderabad (IMGH), a unit of the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL), under Union ministry of finance, said on condition of anonymity.As a precursor to the efforts to set up the museum, IGMH is organising an exhibition of the machinery used for minting of coins during the Nizam regime, along with the old coins, currency, dyes, casts and other rare artefacts at the Royal Mint for a week from December 6.“It will be thrown open to the people as part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav programme being held to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence,” the official said, adding that once the Centre government gives its nod, it would be converted into a permanent museum.According to Anuradha Reddy, convenor of Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), Hyderabad chapter, the museum of Royal Mint has been a long-pending demand of the heritage lovers of Hyderabad.“The Mint Compound at Saifabad is a treasure of city’s heritage. The machinery used for minting coins was imported from London those days and it should not be allowed to turn into a scrap. We have been requesting the authorities that the sprawling premises be converted into a numismatics and royal mint museum with access to the common man,” she said, adding that INTACH has been extending its cooperation to IGMH in running the week-long exhibition.According to D Raja Reddy, chairman of Numismatics Society of India, the decision to organise an exhibition of the old coinage and currency of the Nizams besides other rare artefacts of that period and the proposal to convert it into a museum was taken at a meeting of the society held at Salarjung Museum in the last week of October.“The meeting was held in Hyderabad after a gap of nearly 80 years, where it was decided that the heritage of the Nizam’s era should be showcased at the exhibition,” Dr Reddy said.Heritage conservationist Mohd Safiullah said it was in 1803 that Nawab Sikandar Jah, the Nizam III, who had first established the mint at Royal Palace at Sultan Shahi in the old city of Hyderabad. However, it was manufacturing hand-made coins, while the British were using machine-minted coins.In 1893, the Royal Mint of Hyderabad was shifted to a new building at Dar-us-Shafa, during the regime of Mir Mahaboob Ali Khan, the sixth Nizam. He introduced first machine-minted coins, known as Charkhi coins. “In 1903, the sixth Nizam imported the sophisticated machine from London and erected it at the present Mint Compound at Saifabad. It started operating from July 13, 1903,” Safiullah said.According to Dr Reddy, even after the end of the Nizam rule with Hyderabad state being merged with Indian Union on September 17, 1948, the minting of coins at the Royal Mint, Saifabad, continued in the name of the last Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan, till January 26, 1950, when India became a Republic.The Royal Mint continued to be used for manufacturing coins by the Indian government till ‘1990s along with three other mints – Noida, Kolkata and Mumbai. Apart from coins, it was used for making medals, souvenirs and badges, Safiullah said.The mint was later shifted to its current location in Cherlapalli on August 20, 1997. Since then, the Mint Compound at Saifabad has been closed. “We hope, it will come alive after being converted into museum,” Anuradha Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hyderabad-nizam-s-mint-to-be-converted-into-a-museum-101637177398200.html
18-11-2021||Gurugram||Affordable housing rates revised in Haryana, dearer by ₹200 per sqft||For the first time in seven years, the Haryana government on Wednesday revised the rate of affordable housing projects, increasing them by ₹200 per sqft. According to the new directions, the rate of affordable housing flats in hyper potential zones will now be ₹4,200 per sqft, in high potential zones, the rate will now be ₹3,600 per sqft, while in other areas, the rate will now be ₹3,200 per sqft. The cost of a balcony in affordable flats, which was earlier fixed at ₹500 per sqft, has been increased to ₹1,000 per sqft.The affordable housing policy was launched in 2014 with fixed rates, which are being revised for the first time, officials said. The Haryana government has divided districts into hyper potential zones, high potential zones, medium potential zones, and low potential zones based on demand and rates.Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) officials said that the rates were revised due to an increase in the prices of raw materials and labour. “The decision to increase the price has been taken across the state, keeping in view the change in the cost of input,” said Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner.In another move, the government has also linked 75% of the payment to the status of the construction of the project. The license of an affordable housing project can now also be renewed after four years, which was not allowed earlier, the notification by DTCP said.Pankaj Tomar, a real estate expert, said that the price increase will have an only nominal impact on the buyers as the area of affordable flats is between 400 to 800 sq ft. “The price rise will be somewhere between ₹1 lakh and ₹1.60 lakh per flat. Buyers can still easily afford these flats,” he said.Developers who build affordable projects welcomed the move, but said that they had expected more from the government. “The increase in rate is a positive step, given an almost 50% increase in the price of cement, steel, labour cost and other raw materials. However, we expected more as the rate was not revised for the last seven years,” said Pradeep Agarwal, managing director, Signature Developers.National Real Estate Development Council, which has been pursuing this matter with the Haryana government, said that the costs of raw material and labour increased several times in the last seven years, and the increase should have been higher. “The cost of construction has risen and the rate of increase should have been proportionate, but this is a step in the right direction,” he said.The price increase was approved in a Cabinet meeting on November 2, and the notification was issued by DTCP on Wednesday.Gurugram has over 100 affordable housing projects under construction, in which around 40,000 units are in various stages of development. The affordable housing projects have gained traction, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic as a large number of people are buying their own homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/affordable-housing-rates-revised-in-haryana-dearer-by-200-per-sqft-101637177397034.html

The maximum temperature was recorded at 27.4 degrees Celsius.At the Aya Nagar observatory, the minimum temperature fell to 9.1 degrees Celsius, which was four degrees below normal. According to IMD, coldwave conditions are declared when the temperature shows a departure of four or more degrees.IMD officials said, Aya Nagar was only the second area in north India that recorded this phenomenon. The minimum temperature at Rajasthan’s Bhilwara was recorded at 7.2 degrees, 5.4 degrees below normal, according to the regional meteorological centre (RMC) website.Mahesh Palwat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services, said under the impact of La Nina—a climate pattern that occurs in the Pacific Ocean every few years and affects weather around the world—north India can record lower than normal temperatures this winter.“While winters this year is likely to be colder than normal, but during November this year, Delhi has not recorded any western disturbance, which is unusual. After October 24, there has not been any active western disturbance over Delhi. With one western disturbance, we can record a steep drop in temperatures. Till then, minimum temperatures will remain in the same range,” said Palawat.Meanwhile, a mild improvement in local winds on Wednesday led to a marginal reduction in pollution levels in the national capital. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the air quality index of Delhi was 375, categorised as very poor. On Tuesday, Delhi’s AQI was 403, in the severe zone.“Air quality is likely to remain in the very poor zone till November 21, and start improving slowly after that because of increased wind speed,” said a senior Met official on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-coldest-day-of-the-season-cold-wave-like-weather-at-aya-nagar-101637177279181.html

18-11-2021||Delhi||Construction ban extended till Nov 21, Metro projects among those exempted||The ban on construction in Delhi will now continue till November 21, after the latest directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Tuesday evening, but with several exemptions.The CAQM, in its directives, has exempted projects related to railway services, Metro, airports and inter-state bus terminals as well as those related to national security and defence.For the national capital, the exemptions would mean that the ongoing work on Metro’s phase-4 expansion and the elevated cross-taxiway, a new runway and Terminal-2 at the Delhi airport could continue.However, the halt on work at other key infrastructure projects aimed at decongesting city’s arterial stretches will go on. An official of the Public Works Department (PWD), that is implementing many such projects, said they have deputed the workforce on sprinkling water at construction sites to retain them.“The labourers are wary that the ban may continue for long. We hope that an exemption is provided to road infrastructure projects which are almost on the verge of completion,” the official said.PWD is currently working on Pragati Maidan integrated transit corridor development, the Ashram underpass, Benito Juarez Road-San Martin Road underpass and the streetscaping of eleven arterial stretches. Officials said 90% work on the Pragati Maidan and Ashram underpass projects has been completed, and the ban, if extended, may lead to deadlines being missed.At the Delhi airport, work is currently on to build an elevated cross-taxiway, a new runway four and work inside Terminal-2 -- projects that help the Indira Gandhi International Airport double its capacity from 20 million passengers per annum to 40 million passengers.Among important railway projects in the city where work will continue is construction of the new Yamuna Bridge – being built parallel to the old Yamuna bridge (Loha pul). The new structure was set to be completed by December, 2020, but Covid19 delayed work. “No projects have been impacted in Delhi. This includes the new Yamuna bridge project, or the new skywalk being built at the New Delhi railway station,” said Deepak Kumar, chief PRO, Northern Railway.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), is currently undertaking several construction works for three corridors of Phase 4 Metro network expansion. A senior DMRC official, who asked not to be named, said the agency will maintain strict pollution control norms at all sites. “DMRC has been conscious about following environmental norms, and we will continue to follow all the pollution and dust control regulations,” the official said.According to the Supreme Court-mandated Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), construction activities need to be stopped if the air quality index -- on a scale of 0 to 500 -- touches ‘‘severe plus (500+)’ or emergency category.Meanwhile, the National Campaign Committee for Central Legislation on Construction Labour -- a construction workers’ body -- filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, seeking ex-gratia relief schemes for daily workers who will suffer loss of income due to ban on work.Blanket ban on construction activities, without identifying and excluding the ones which do not contribute towards air pollution is “irrational, arbitrary and whimsical”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/construction-ban-extended-till-nov-21-metro-projects-among-those-exempted-101637177276998.html

The meeting was held in response to a 24-hour deadline set by the Supreme Court for the authorities to prepare a list of urgent steps to control rising air pollution levels.Also read | As schools remain shut, calls get louder for a solution to Capital’s pollution crisisRai said the Delhi government on Saturday banned construction and demolition (C&D) activities till November 17, but it has now been extended till November 21. Similarly, the work from home directive to all government offices will remain in force until November 21. The Delhi government also shut down educational institutions till November 21, that will now continue until further orders, Rai added.“Police and the transport department have been ordered to ensure that commercial vehicles, barring essential services, are not allowed to enter Delhi. To encourage public transport in Delhi, one thousand private CNG buses will be hired, the process for which will begin tomorrow. So, in addition to the existing public bus, a thousand more will be added to encourage use of public transport,” Rai said.To further cut use of private vehicles, Rai said the government has also asked the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to allow standing passengers in Metro trains and buses.“So far Covid norms only permit full sitting in both Metro and buses to prevent crowding, which restricts capacity. Metro and DTC have both written letters to the DDMA to reconsider this position as the Metro sees a large share of the commuters standing and travelling. Keeping this in mind letters have been written for the DDMA to issue new directions so that the carrying capacity in both buses and Metro can be increased,” he explained.The CAQM also asked states to crack down on 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles. The state government said the transport department and the police have been handed a list of all such vehicles to take appropriate action.“Checking of PUC (pollution under control) certificates at petrol pumps will be reinforced. In addition to 372 water tankers that are operating currently, fire engines will be deployed at the 13 hot spots in Delhi to increase spraying capacity,” said Rai, adding that a traffic police special task force has been formed cut traffic congestion at busy stretches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gopal-rai-lists-new-10-point-plan-as-delhi-continues-to-gasp-101637177156824.html
18-11-2021||Gurugram||Schools, colleges in Gurugram to remain closed, over 930 industries to stay shut||As pollution levels continue to fluctuate between “very poor” and “severe” in the National Capital Region (NCR), officials of the Haryana government on Wednesday said they will follow Tuesday’s Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) directions, which include the closure of all educational institutions until further notice. The directions came on the heels of the Haryana government’s Sunday order to close all schools and ban construction activities till November 17 in the four districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar. Sanjeev Kaushal, the additional chief secretary for disaster management in the state, said, “Last Sunday, the state disaster management authority issued orders that schools will remain closed till November 17, but now, in accordance with Tuesday’s CAQM order, schools, colleges, educational institutions will remain closed till further notice. The directions of the CAQM are quite comprehensive and cover all issues. These orders will be fully complied with. The same has been communicated to all the deputy commissioners.”Rashmi Malik, the principal of Salwan Public School said, “The school is completely closed for all students but students from Board classes (classes 10 and 12) can come to get their doubts cleared. We will follow online mode of education for the others.”Gurugram recorded “very poor” air for the third consecutive day on Wednesday, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 344, according to Central Pollution Control Board data. Its neighbouring cities of Faridabad and Manesar also recorded “very poor” air quality with AQI readings of 378 and 336, respectively. According to the weather bulletin issued on Wednesday evening by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, NCR’s air quality is likely to improve marginally but remain in the “very poor” category on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. It is likely to improve significantly from Sunday owing to relatively strong winds. Meanwhile, CAQM on Tuesday also ordered that “all industries in NCR with gas connectivity shall be run only on gas as a fuel, failing which industries concerned shall be closed. This commission has already repeatedly directed not to permit any industry to use unapproved fuels. All industries in NCR still using unapproved fuels shall be closed by respective governments with immediate effect.” On Monday, a high-level meeting was convened by the additional chief secretary of disaster management, before CAQM’s meeting on Tuesday, where the state industries department had said that over 900 industries in the NCR were still using unapproved fuels. “With the implementation of the CAQM’s order, the functioning of around 933 industries in Haryana’s NCR districts will be affected as many of them are still using furnace oil, diesel or other such fuels to operate. Only industrial units that are using PNG and CNG will be allowed to function,” added Kaushal. The state government also closed down two power plants in Panipat, in accordance with the CAQM order, which said that only five of the 11 thermal power plants located within a 300km radius of Delhi – NTPC, Jhajjar; Mahatma Gandhi TPS, CLP Jhajjar; Panipat TPS, HPGCL; Nabha Power Ltd. TPS, Rajpura and Talwandi Sabo TPS, Mansa – will remain operational till November 30.Along with this, CAQM encouraged work from home in NCR districts to reduce vehicular emissions.The state government also considered implementing the odd-even scheme for traffic in four NCR districts, but dropped the idea after consultation with CAQM on Tuesday, said officials. S Narayanan, member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board said, “The Supreme Court heard the matter of increasing air pollution in NCR and action taken by different states, after which the apex court instructed us to follow the directions of CAQM and will hear the case again on next Wednesday. No additional directions were issued by the state government. The Haryana government proposed that the odd-even scheme can also be implemented in four districts of NCR, but CAQM said that it could lead to confusion among passengers as it is not being implemented in Delhi or other NCR districts of Haryana. We were rather directed to implement pollution control measures for severe plus category, so the proposal was struck down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/schools-colleges-in-gurugram-to-remain-closed-over-930-industries-to-stay-shut-101637177096910.html
18-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Govt issues order, bans entry of trucks in Capital||New Delhi: A day after the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas, issued a set of directions to control pollution in the region, the Delhi government on Wednesday issued an order banning the entry of all trucks (except those carrying essential commodities) coming from other states into Delhi till November 21. “It is hereby ordered that the entry of trucks in Delhi shall be barred with immediate effect till November 21 or till further orders. This order shall not apply to trucks carrying essential commodities such as raw vegetables, fruits, grains, milk, eggs, ice that is to be used as a food item, and tankers carrying petroleum products,” the order issued by Delhi transport department said. A senior official of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) that on Wednesday, trucks were turned back from the state borders. “Enforcement teams were deployed on all borders of Delhi on Wednesday. All trucks that were carrying non-essential items were turned back,” the official said.Officials could not give an exact figure on how many trucks now enter Delhi every day, but the order is unlikely to cause major chaos as most of the non-destined commercial vehicles now bypass the city by taking the eastern and western peripheral expressways that form a ring around the Capital.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the contribution from trucks in Delhi’s air has reduced over the last couple years due to the expressways, but they are still one of the biggest polluters in the vehicle segment. “These are heavy duty vehicles, and trucks enter Delhi in the night when temperatures are low and these emissions can stay trapped in the air till the next day. In our analysis in 2015, we found that trucks were contributing to around 30% of the total pollution due to vehicles,” she said. Tanushree Ganguly, Programme Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said while the ban on entry of trucks into Delhi was a good move, there also needs to be a restriction on the movement of private vehicles in order to complement the ban. “Cutting down intra-city vehicular traffic would not only reduce vehicular exhaust emissions but also contribute to reducing re-suspended dust and idling emissions,” she said. The Delhi traffic police said teams have been formed to keep a check on the movement of trucks at the Delhi borders. “We have deployed teams that will check the freight being carried by the trucks and they will be allowed to enter the city only if they are carrying essential items,” a senior traffic official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-govt-issues-order-bans-entry-of-trucks-in-capital-101637177038055.html

The woman’s body was found lying on the bed while the man’s body was found hanging from the ceiling fan of a room, said police officials. The police suspected that the man hanged self after strangulating his wife to death over some dispute after a housewarming party on Tuesday night. Senior sub-inspector of Gomti Nagar extension police station, Bhutan Singh said that the deceased were identified as Sadhna Mishra, 31, and Shyam Kishore Mishra, 34, residents of Gonda. He said the couple along with their two kids, aged 6 and 8, earlier lived in a rented house in Gomti Nagar and the man along with his two brothers Ram Kishore and Brij Kishore used to run a building material business as well as a mobile store near Husadiya crossing in Gomti Nagar. The SSI said the three brothers together purchased a house in Gangotri Vihar Phase II colony in Khargapur locality and shifted to their new house on Tuesday night. He said the initial investigation suggested that the couple confronted over some issue after the housewarming party got over during which the man might have accidentally strangulated his wife to death, and thereafter hanged self after realising his fault. He said that the couple was happily married for 14 years. The police, however, had called forensic experts and further investigating into the matter was on. The two bodies had been sent for post-mortem examination to ascertain their cause of deaths, the SSI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/couple-found-dead-few-hours-after-shifting-to-their-new-house-in-lucknow-101637177037000.html
18-11-2021||Other||Tamil Nadu moves Supreme Court over Vanniyar quota||Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government and BJP’s ally the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) have filed separate petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the Madras high court order of November 1 that struck down the 10.5% internal reservation allotted for the Vanniyar community within the existing 20% quota for Most Backward Classes (MBCs). The government’s main grounds for an appeal are three fold -- there is a prima facie case that it has acted diligently and that the entire admission would suffer hardship. Secondly, the government’s petition says that the high court’s order is “erroneous, contrary to existing provisions of law and deserves interference” from the Supreme Court. Thirdly, the government states that the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioner. HT has seen a copy of the 318-page petition. The Tamil Nadu government’s special leave petition is represented by advocate D Kumanan who prayed to the Supreme Court to grant a special leave to appeal against the judgement of the Madras high court and pass appropriate orders based on the circumstances of the case. The petition also seeks interim relief such as a stay on the judgement. The reservation for government employment and education was brought in by the previous AIADMK government just before the model code of conduct came into effect in February this year. The reservation was implemented after the DMK formed the government in May. The Madras high court’s November 1 order running 814-pages declared it as ultra vires the constitution. The court said that they find the impugned legislation is in violation of Articles 15, 16 and 29 of the Constitution of India as it treats one caste- Vanniayars--differently and discriminates others. The petition argued that the government passed the enactment based on “adequate, authenticated” data on population of the MBCs and Denotified Communities (DCs) enumerated in 1983 by the Tamil Nadu Second Backward Classes Commission under retired IAS officer J A Ambasankar. The commission submitted its door-to-door enumeration of the entire state’s population to the government in 1985. “The caste-wise population data disclosed by Ambasankar Commission is the only authenticated data available as of now before the state and such data can be effectively used to plan for sub-classification within the backward classes,” the petition read. Carving out a quota from an existing reservation is called sub-categorisation. The government also quoted the Supreme Court’s May 2021 judgement in the case of Jaishrilakshmirao Patil versus The Chief Minister and others which decided on the powers of the state to legislate for the identification of socially and economically backward classes. The judgment was also in favour of the existing powers for making special reservation and sub-classification within backward classes, the government said in its petition. In the majority of this judgement, the apex court held that the state’s power remains undisturbed to make reservation in favour of a particular community, caste, the quantum of reservations and the nature of benefits fall within the ambit of Article 15 and 16 (except for identification of SEBCs). This has been the observation in the Maratha case, too the petition said. The state also argued that there is no necessity to consult the National Commission for Backward Classes in respect of the state lists in this matter. The petition further says that the high court referred to the 1992 Indra Sawhney versus Union of India case but did not follow an observation from it where the SC had held that caste if often a social class in the country. “As such, a caste, which is socially and educationally backward may be classified as Backward classes,” the petition said. Meanwhile, the PMK filed two petitions with the Supreme Court challenging the same. “One if from the party and the other is filed independently by the party founder as both are respondents in the original case in the high court,” said PMK spokesperson and advocate K Balu. PMK founder S Ramadoss in his petition argued that internal reservation for Muslims and Arunthathiyars have been provided within the overall 69% reservation in place in Tamil Nadu which has been upheld by the courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tamil-nadu-moves-supreme-court-over-vanniyar-quota-101637176976874.html

Further, even though the production is increasing year after year, the procurement is not keeping pace with it,” he said.He said though the rice production in Telangana during Kharif 2020-21 was over 5.57 million tonnes, the procurement was only 3.26 million tonnes, which is 59% of the production. “This was far less than the 78% procured in Kharif 2019-20. As a result, the state government was unable to implement a rational cropping pattern,” he said.The chief minister said he had met Union minister for food and public distribution Piyush Goyal in New Delhi on September 25 and 26 and sought that the annual procurement targets be fixed, but there was no communication from the Centre so far.KCR requested the Prime Minister to direct the FCI to procure another 500,000 tonnes of rice produced during the last Rabi season 2020-21 and also confirm the target of procurement of rice from Telangana during the next Rabi season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/telangana-cm-kcr-writes-to-pm-modi-urges-centre-to-expedite-rice-purchase-101637176859791.html

During the same month last year, another leopard had barged into the official residence of Kanchan Verma, then vice chairperson of the Ghaziabad Development Authority. Officials of the forest department said the animal was spotted around 2.02am in the CCTV camera installed outside the house. “Late in the night, the occupants of the house heard some noise and checked the CCT]V footage in the morning. An animal was spotted and from the built and tail, it seems to be a leopard. The fishing cat, in comparison, is smaller than a leopard. We have roped in teams to trace the leopard and also trying to find its pug marks,” said Ashok Gupta, forest ranger, Ghaziabad. “It seems that the animal ventured into thick vegetation and could not be traced so far. On Thursday, we will bring in a cage and set a trap. Last year, a leopard had surfaced from the official residence of GDA vice chairperson but it could not be traced after a hectic search of almost a week,” said added. The Raj Nagar area is close to open fields having thick vegetation and open spaces, which are also close to neighbouring villages. The locality also shelters many big residential and official complexes of different Central government departments, which have thick green cover and safe hiding places for animals. “There is hardly a distance of 500 metres between the spot in Sector 13, where the animal was sighted, and the official residence of GDA vice-chairperson, where a leopard was spotted last year. Further, areas around these spots have thick greenery and provide a safe hiding place for leopards. The administration should take notice and sound alert in the area so residents are aware of the animal’s presence,” said Rajendra Tyagi, councillor from Raj Nagar. The spots where the two leopards have been sighted in a span of a year are at a stone’s throw distance from the official residences of the district magistrate, SSP Ghaziabad and other official residences of administrative officials.Leopard sightings are not uncommon in Ghaziabad. In December 2014, the carcass of a leopard was discovered from the stretches of Yamuna river in Pychara village in Loni, Ghaziabad. A day later, another leopard was found dead in the fields of Abupur in Modi Nagar, Ghaziabad and suspected to have died of electrocution. A leopard was sighted in Vaishali on August 1, 2019. In April 2017, a male leopard was also captured from Krishna Vihar Kuti area close to Hindon airbase after it injured two people and a cattle. According to officials, leopard is listed under the Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and included in Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife Fauna and Flora). It is also listed as ‘near threatened’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-forest-officials-launch-hunt-for-leopard-captured-in-cctv-camera-101637176858277.html

A CCTV camera in the area captured the five suspects who came there carrying backpacks. A police officer, who asked not to be named, said they got the first clue when a CCTV footage showed that the suspects used bike in the heist. He said from the registration plate of the vehicle they traced the owner of the bike, Sachit Saxena. He said Saxena led them to the other four suspects. The police did not share details about the house owner or whose money it was, but said the cash has been recovered. Besides Saxena, the police identified the other suspects as Prashant Basista, Aniket Jha, Ramesh and Dhananjay Gulia. Police said all five have no criminal record. The officer quoted above said it was Saxena who got the tip-off about the cash in the house. “The accused had come prepared with chloroform, tape, cutter, ropes and masks to commit the robbery. They had given each other code names 1,2,3,4 and 5 not to reveal their identity while communicating during the heist. On Monday evening, they assembled outside the house around 10pm and waited there for at least three hours. Around 1.30am, they entered the house from the back door,” the officer said.Police said the five suspects first murdered Mina Rai who woke up on their entry. “They overpowered her, pinned her to the ground, tied her hands and legs and taped her mouth. They used chloroform to ensure that she doesn’t raise an alarm, and strangled her. After this, when they were searching the other room, Sujata woke up. She too was overpowered, and smothered with a pillow.

Several principals said students have been thrust into uncertainty again, and the mental fatigue due to repeated suspension of in-person classes will affect young children the most.“All public and private schools, colleges, and educational institutions in NCR shall remain closed until further orders, allowing only online mode of education,” the CAQM said late Tuesday night.While public and private schools in the national capital reopened for classes 9 to 12 in September, students up to class 8 started returning to school only from November 1. Most private schools in the capital reopened only after Diwali (November 4) for middle school and were planning to reopen for the primary sections this week. With the latest order, schools will now continue with online learning in these classes.Also read | Gopal Rai lists new 10-point plan as Delhi continues to gaspSudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference which has over 120 Delhi schools as members, said the abrupt suspension of in-person classes yet again has affected children.“Students have expressed disappointment as they have been struggling with mental fatigue. The uncertainty over in-person classes has been going on for around two years now. We had just reopened our canteen and the woman running it had invested a significant amount of money on safety protocols, hiring new staff, and procuring all necessities. Authorities have to find a way to mitigate pollution instead of locking children indoors because the air inside homes is also not great. Not everyone has air purifiers,” she said.With the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examinations underway for minor subjects, class 10 and 12 students are allowed to come to schools along with support staff needed for conducting examinations. However, schools have ensured that only those needed on the premises are called in until further orders.Anuradha Joshi, principal of Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, said, “We already had a blended mode of learning in place since schools were asked to allow students to opt for either online or in-person learning. So we are okay either way. But with repeated closures, children end up becoming lonely and their social and emotional learning takes a hit,” she said.Minakshi Kushwaha, principal of Birla Vidya Niketan, said authorities need to tackle pollution urgently. “Covid was beyond us, but pollution is a recurring problem and it needs to be a top agenda for all stakeholders throughout the year. While the pandemic allowed us to develop blended learning as an alternative option that could be used during extreme weather conditions, it will only work if it is a one-time measure. The present order comes after a series of Covid-induced lockdowns and these disruptions [of in-person learning] will impact the stability that children need,” she said.For government schools, the problem is particularly severe as they were slated to hold midterm examinations later this month for classes 9 and 11. Mary Jyotsna Minj, principal of a government school in West Vinod Nagar, said, “Attendance in schools can pick up only with time as concerned parents are reassured about the children’s well-being. Suspension of in-person classes yet again will break that momentum. We are also slated to hold midterms for classes 9 and 11 later this month in the pen and paper mode. But now, everything depends on when schools can reopen and how they are allowed to function.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-schools-remain-shut-calls-get-louder-for-a-solution-to-capital-s-pollution-crisis-101637176736963.html
18-11-2021||Other||Tamil Nadu seeks timeframe for governors to decide on bills||With Tamil Nadu awaiting a decision from constitutional authorities on two crucial issues -- for the exemption from NEET and the release of prisoners in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case -- the state’s Speaker M Appavu came down heavily on governors sitting on Bills indefinitely and also said that if the President rejects a Bill, people are entitled to know why.Appavu was speaking at the Presiding Officers’ conference held in Shimla on Wednesday. The conference was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Appavu said that this was an important issue facing state legislatures and also pitched for fixing a time frame within which governors have to send bills to the President for his consideration. “When a Bill is passed by a majority and sent for the assent of the governor, the governors sometimes sit over the bill without giving his assent or returning the Bill for an indefinite period, even though the Constitution requires it to be done ‘as soon as possible’,” Appavu said. He added that “another problem” which erodes authority of legislatures is that where a Bill is required to be reserved for the consideration of the President, the governors “are taking months together” even though they are bound to do so immediately. Pointing out that though governors are heads of the state executive since they are appointed by the Union government, they are overruling the will of the state’s people when they stall the assent to a Bill. “We have to work together to set a binding time frame within which bills have to be assented to, returned or reserved for the consideration of the Hon’ble President of India by the Hon’ble Governors,” Appavu said.He said that another “Constitutional issue” is for the President to give reasons if he withholds the assent and returns the bill. This would help the House to enact another bill by correcting shortfalls that caused the bill to be rejected, he said. “How else will the House that enacted the Bill know what is the real impediment in withholding the assent?” he questioned saying that the House reflects the will of the people so it amounts to rejection of them too. “Therefore, are not the people entitled to know at least the reason for which the Bill was not assented to?”The Speaker’s comments assume significance in the backdrop of a Bill passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly on September 13 seeking exemption for students from the state from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) required for undergraduate medical college admissions. The Bill was passed by the ruling DMK with the support of all parties except the BJP and it happened during the time when then Governor Banwarilal Purohit was transferred and before Governor R N Ravi took charge on September 18. The Bill is pending with Ravi and it is unclear if the Bill has been sent to President Ram Nath Kovind. In 2017, the President had rejected a similar Bill seeking NEET exemption passed by the Assembly under the previous AIADMK regime. In another sensitive issue in the state, in 2018 the Tamil Nadu cabinet passed a unanimous resolution in the assembly regarding the release of the seven prisoners convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The resolution was sent to then Governor Purohit but he did not take any action for more than two years. In January this year the Supreme Court, while hearing a plea, expressed that they were unhappy with the delay. In February this year, Purohit without taking a call passed the buck and said that the President was the competent authority to decide on the resolution. After forming the government in May, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin wrote a letter to President Kovind urging him to remit the life sentence of the seven convicts and to direct their immediate release.The BJP in Tamil Nadu reacted saying that the Speaker should have had more awareness on the issue. “The Governor and the President operate as per the Constitution and no where is a time frame set,” said BJP’s spokesperson Narayanan Thirupathy. “Also the Supreme Court has so many times refused to instruct a time frame in several cases. I think the Speaker should have been aware of these aspects.”Appavu recalled that President Kovind participated in the centenary celebrations of the Tamil Nadu assembly where he unveiled a portrait of DMK’s late patriarch M Karunanidhi. Quoting Karunanidhi, Appavu said that the legislature is like a mirror to the executive branch. “The mirror reflects not only the beauty but also the flaws. Similarly, the Legislature should not only laud the good work of the Government but also criticize it when it falls short,” he said while seeing changes. On the role of presiding officers, he said that they are the ultimate arbiters. “A very heavy responsibility is cast on the Presiding Officers to ensure that the independent and sovereign functions of the Legislature are guided in accordance with the Constitution so that the Judicial branch is not called upon to test the decisions of the Speakers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tamil-nadu-seeks-timeframe-for-governors-to-decide-on-bills-101637176679784.html
18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of agitation’s anniversary, rift between farm leaders widens||Ahead of the anniversary of farmers’ agitation against Centre’s three farm laws, the rift between farmer seems to be widening with farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni launching a fresh salvo on Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders, accusing them of “stifling his voice” by creating a parallel SKM wing in Haryana.“Over 700 farmers have sacrificed their lives and hundreds are facing FIRs during the agitation. It is painful that some leaders, who are followed by farmers, are lying to them and conspiring to defame their counterparts from Haryana,” he added.Charuni’s statement comes in response to SKM leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan announcing that the SKM leaders from Haryana, in a meeting, had unanimously decided to take out a protest march on November 24.Ugrahan had also claimed that his union, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), has support from farmers of three districts of Haryana – Sirsa, Fatehabad and Kaithal. He had requested farmers from these areas to ensure a huge gathering at the protest march.Charuni claimed that his decision to hold meetings under Mission Punjab has given strength to the agitation while the decision to continue protests at borders has weakened the stir.‘Parallel SKM Haryana was created’He said in the beginning of the agitation, he was made the leader of SKM Haryana. But now, a parallel SKM has been created to counter Charuni’s decisions and create a rift among farmers of Haryana, the leader claimed.Charuni had earlier announced to launch a Saheed Samman Yatra (foot march) from Mohara grain market in Ambala on November 25 but a few days later, the SKM leaders announced to launch a parallel protest march from the same venue on November 24.Charuni said to avoid any confrontation among farmers and farm leaders he has withdrawn his decision to launch the foot march as the other group associated with the SKM has decided to launch a parallel protest from the same venue.“We have withdrawn our decision of the protest march from Mohra in interest of the farming community as we do not want to weaken the agitation at any cost,” Charuni said.He said before announcing the parallel protest march, the SKM leaders should have at least discussed it with the local farm leaders.‘Punjab leaders worried over my popularity’Charuni, who has already announced that farmers should field their own candidates for the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab, said, “Farm leaders from Punjab are jealous of my increasing popularity in their state as people of Punjab are calling me for meetings and rallies.”“Some farm leaders from Punjab conspired against me and announced to launch parallel protest march. Par is pavittar andolan ke liye hum apna sar jhuka bhi sakte hai aur katwa bhi sakte hai (But for this pure agitation, we can bent our head and even sacrifice our lives),” he added.Charuni said he is happy with the SKM’s decision to launch a protest march on the anniversary of the agitation and said he will support the SKM’s call.He accused morcha leaders of lying that they held a meeting and decided to launch the protest march.Meanwhile, another farm leader from Haryana’s Hisar, Suresh Koth, has slammed Charuni and said he had taken many steps in Charuni’s favour. He said the decision to start protest march was taken on demand of farmers from Ambala and later the SKM leaders had approved it.He said the agitation is going in the right direction as all farm leaders are fighting for the rights of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ahead-of-agitation-s-anniversary-rift-between-farm-leaders-widens-101637176678618.html

The chief executive officer of GMDA has also instructed officials to upload before and after pictures of these patches on the myGurugram mobile app for transparency on the repair work. The decision was taken during the core planning committee meeting of the authority on Tuesday. During the meeting, the executive engineer of infrastructure-I division informed that the master road from IMT Manesar to Pataudi Road is damaged and needs to be repaired. A 3.5km stretch of the road will be repaired at a cost of ₹1.43 crore. Shaveta Sharma, executive engineer of infrastructure 1 division of the authority, said, “The present condition of the road does not allow movement of heavy traffic, and, to make it motorable, we will be conducting patch work on this road. It can include laying layers of bitumen or gravel or any other repair work. The road in this region needs to be of 50 MSA (million standard axle), whereas currently it is of 10MSA. The whole design of the road is not in sync with today’s traffic, and, after doing a thorough study of the road, we are finalising a detailed project report for further improvement, but, meanwhile, this patch work will be done to make the road motorable.” During the core planning committee meeting, the chief executive officer directed that “the status of the roads and patches for the point of time just before the work is undertaken and after the completion of the work should be uploaded on the app.” Sudhir Rajpal, chief executive officer of GMDA, could not be reached for a comment despite several attempts.Industrial associations from Manesar have been requesting GMDA to repair this road since February as this road connects to the KMP Expressway and also diverts traffic towards National Highway 48. Manoj Tyagi, general secretary of IMT Industrial Association, said, “Repairing this road will help reduce congestion as traffic for Manesar and Pataudi both pass through this area. This road is also the key connecting path for KMP Expressway and due to potholes and damages, travel becomes difficult.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-authority-to-repair-264-patches-on-imt-manesar-pataudi-road-101637176565510.html

18-11-2021||Delhi||Clips of US show by Vir Das spark row, complaint filed in Delhi||A roughly seven-minute monologue by comedian Vir Das at an event in the United States sparked a controversy in India on Wednesday with a storm of criticism and a police complaint filed against him for allegedly insulting the country. At an event at the John F Kennedy Centre for Performing Arts on November 13, Das contrasted the “two Indias” he hailed from, taking on issues such as women’s safety, Covid-19, pollution and the farmer’s protest. The satirist uploaded a 6 minute 53 second video clip of his monologue on his YouTube channel on November 15, sparking a political row. Aditya Jha, a spokesperson of the Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), filed a complaint with the Delhi Police against Das for allegedly “insulting the country” in his monologue. Delhi Police is yet to file an FIR in the case.“There is enough evidence in the speech to show that he has insulted the country. He has made perverted comments about women in India among other topics. He talks about raping women at night. Police said they were busy in a crime review meeting today. I will follow up the status of my complaint again tomorrow (Thursday),” said Jha. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said, “We are looking into the complaint.”Mumbai BJP secretary Vivekanand Gupta also wrote an email to Delhi Police seeking registration of an FIR against Das, “for hurting the feelings of nationalistsIn the video, Das spoke about “two Indias”, taking digs at the “duality of the citizens” “I come from an India where we worship women during the day and gang rape them at night,” Das told the packed Washington, DC venue.As controversy swirled over his comments, Das clarified his stand. “The video is a satire about the duality of two very separate India’s that do different things. Like any nation has light and dark, good and evil within it. None of this is a secret. The video appeals for us to never forget that we are great. To never stop focusing on what makes us great...Please do not be fooled by edited excerpts... I take pride in my country and I carry that pride across the world...” “It ends in a gigantic patriotic round of applause for a country we all love, believe in and are proud of. That there is more to our country than the headlines, a deep beauty. That’s the point of the video and the reason for the applause.”He found backing from Trinamool Congress member Mahua Moitra as well as Congress leaders Kapil Sibal and Shashi Tharoor.Sibal said that none can doubt that there are two Indias. “…Just that we don’t want an Indian to tell the world about it. We are intolerant and hypocritical,” he said. Tharoor praised Das as a stand-up comedian who knew the real meaning of the term “stand up” was not physical but moral.Moitra thanked Das for speaking truth about “Two Indias”. “Reactions also from 2 Indias - one having a laugh & other filing complaints with police!” she tweeted.  But Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi hit out at Das, saying that “generalising the evils of a few individuals and vilifying the nation as a whole in front of the world is just not done”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/clips-of-us-show-by-vir-das-spark-row-complaint-filed-in-delhi-101637176500326.html

The two cases were reported from Lok Bandhu hospital where they had gone to see a doctor for fever, according to health department officials. One of the patients is 40-year-old while another is 70-year-old. Both the new patients are in home isolation at present, they said. So far, one woman and four men have tested positive for Zika virus in Lucknow. These cases were detected in Lalkuan, Husainganj, Alambagh, Azad Nagar and LDA colony. Lucknow reported first Zika case on November 11. “Health teams visited Azad Nagar and LDA colony from where two new cases were reported, on Wednesday. Samples of nine people who were in close contact of the two positive patients have been taken for Zika test,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, chief medical officer of Lucknow. “The teams met neighbours of the two cases and explained them preventive measures,” said Yogesh Raghuvanshi, district health education officer. The urban malaria unit also conducted source reduction exercise to eliminate mosquitos, he added. The teams also visited other areas of the city from where Zika cases were reported earlier. They took 66 samples from these areas after screening about 8,000 residents. Reports of 113 samples that were taken a day before came and all were negative. “Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from the Aedes genus. Hence, if residents protect themselves from mosquito bites, the virus won’t spread. Using mosquito net at home, keeping surrounding clean and free from stagnant water, and wearing clothes that cover body adequately are the measures for protection against Zika virus,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general of Association of International Doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-fresh-zika-cases-reported-in-lucknow-101637176499216.html

18-11-2021||Chandigarh||Air pollution in Delhi: Haryana shuts down two thermal power plant units, industries||The Haryana government on Wednesday told the Supreme Court (SC) that two units of the Panipat thermal power plant having a total capacity of 450MW have been closed down till November 30 as a measure to control air pollution in the national capital.As per an affidavit filed by the state government in compliance of the November 15 directions of the apex court, all industries except the ones that have been converted into piped natural gas, compressed natural gas or cleaner fuel have been directed to be closed down till November 30.Officials said following the Supreme Court’s directions, a meeting of the administrative secretaries of power, environment and climate change, agriculture, transport, urban local bodies, industries, officers of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) and deputy commissioners of Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat was convened to discuss and firm up measures to curb air pollution in the national capital territory of Delhi.The state government told the apex court that the agriculture department will issue advertisements in all prominent newspapers and electronic media, requesting the farmers not to burn crop residue in Haryana at least for the next 15 days.Also, the deputy commissioners of Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat have been directed to implement work from home measures in government and private sectors by issuing suitable advisory.“Further, it was decided that there will be special drives in all national capital region (NCR) districts to check plying of heavy vehicles for carrying stone, construction and demolition material without appropriate cover. Such vehicles will be challaned and not allowed to ply till compliance is made. There will be special drive for implementing 10- and 15-year ban on diesel and petrol vehicles, respectively, in the NCR districts,” the affidavit said.The state government said the urban local bodies department will constitute teams along with the district administration to check solid-waste burning and violations at construction sites including non-covering of construction material, areas and non-sprinkling of water through anti-smog guns. The department will also use maximum number of machines for sweeping and intensifying sprinkling activities through tankers and anti-smog guns.The Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas on Tuesday directed the state governments to implement these measures for reducing the air pollution in the national capital.Some of the measures, as per the Commission, are to remain in force till November 21 when the air quality is likely to improve due to relatively strong winds. However, these measures are also subject to review.The apex court had on November 15 said the major contributors of air pollution in the national capital region were construction activities, running of non¬essential industries, transport and running of coal-based power plants.The apex court had also said the affidavits filed in the matter indicate that stubble burning is not responsible for causing air pollution to that extent except for the two months of October and November.“However, we find that there is a rise in stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana. With a view to avoid air pollution, we direct both the state governments to persuade the farmers not to set fire to stubble at least for a period of two weeks,” the SC bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/air-pollution-in-delhi-haryana-shuts-down-two-thermal-power-plant-units-industries-101637176436912.html

The court said this conduct is “impermissible” and is nothing but unauthorized encroachment and trespass into the mandir’s premises.“Accordingly, the administrator, with the cooperation of the Delhi Police and the SDMC, is permitted to take action for removal of all the unauthorized encroachments within the Kalkaji Mandir premises within two weeks. If any of the shopkeepers and illegal residents in the Mandir premises are entitled to seek alternate accommodation, the DUSIB may consider their request and provide alternate premises on humanitarian grounds.“However, it is made clear that the pendency of any application for alternate accommodation before DUSIB shall not come in the way of the removal of encroachments and unauthorized construction of shopkeepers from the Mandir premises,” the court said in a 16-page order.The court, while hearing a bunch of pleas on various issues like cleanliness, puja rights and collection of offerings, also ordered that South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to inspect the toilet complexes at least twice a day for the next 15 days to ensure the maintenance of the cleanliness and hygiene of the toilet complexes.With respect to the disposal of garbage, the court has directed the SDMC to conduct an inspection along with the administrator, Rtd Justice JR Midha to ensure that adequate steps are taken to ensure garbage disposal at the Mandir premises, and the same takes place at least three times a day.“The SDMC shall also ensure that adequate garbage bins are provided in the premises for collection and disposal of garbage,” the court noted in a 16-page order passed on November 15.The directions were passed pursuant to the report submitted by the administrator Midha highlighting various issues including sanitation, drinking water facility, encroachment of the vendors, fire safety etc.Taking note of the suggestions made by the administrator that a fire audit is required in the temple, the court asked Delhi Fire Services to conduct an inspection of the mandir premises and submit a report on the steps that would be required for ensuring access for fire tenders and for the maintenance of fire safety in and around the Mandir premisesDuring the hearing, the court’s notice was brought to a video of some police officials assaulting a devotee during the Navratras. The court issued directions to the DCP of Delhi Police to ensure that adequate personnel are posted at the temple, along with women constables also.The judge further added that the same set of constables should not be deployed at the mandir and the set needs to be changed at least twice a month.Among other directions, the court said that a medical centre should be run continuously at the Kalkaji Mandir premises to cater to the devotees who visit the temple round the year.The court also directed the Delhi Jal Board to send a team to the mandir for inspection and take immediate steps for laying down a temporary pipeline for uninterrupted supply of drinking water to the devotees in the Mandir, as also for running water supply to the toilet complexes.The administrator’s finding had said that there are three piyaos in the mandir premises, however, regular water is not being made available by the Delhi Jal Board, or any of the baridaars, or even the Shri Kalkaji Mandir Prabandhak Sudhar Committee.The matter would be heard on December 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/remove-squatters-from-kalkaji-mandir-orders-delhi-high-court-101637176317057.html
18-11-2021||Delhi||HC censures govt over illegal street vendors, says city is bursting at seams||Taking a strict view of the increasing number of illegal street vendors in the national capital, the Delhi high court on Wednesday said it cannot “let the city to go to the dogs”.“We can’t let the city go to the dogs….We are here to protect the rule of law,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said, adding that the city is “bursting at the seams” currently.“What is troubling us today and what is a cause of concern is the number of street vendors. Your population may be rising but the area in Delhi is constant. So how many vendors are you going to be permitting? What are the zones? It (the city) is bursting at the seams,” the bench said, while hearing a plea by the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, challenging the validity of Delhi Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Scheme, 2019, framed by the Delhi government.The plea, filed through senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, has sought to strike down various provisions of the scheme contending that it is arbitrary, discriminatory, and illegal.The court said it does not want another Lajpat Nagar or Nehru Place to come up and the authorities have to limit the number of vendors so that there is no crowding on the streets and residents have sufficient space to walk. “Please understand that for a place where there are 120-odd tehbazaari (hawking) right holders, there are about 4,000 (vendors). Where do people walk? We don’t want another Lajpat Nagar or Nehru Place,” the court said. The court, while issuing notice to the authorities, directed them to file their replies within two weeks detailing the justification for the constitution of the current town vending committee (TVC) and also the background of NGO members who have been included in the TVC.During the proceedings, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, urged the court to not take any action for three months while assuring it that the work on the ground will be carried out.To this, the court replied that it can’t grant leverage even for a single day. “.. forget about three months, three months is too long, not even a single day... We have not said anything or passed any order staying actions of TVC. We are very clear, we can’t let the city go to the dogs. We are here to protect the rule of law. Rule of law does not mean you only look at one constituency and say that, “look their rights are there, they need to be protected”. Vendors have a right but no right is absolute,” the bench said.Citing an example of Connaught Place, the court said despite being a “no hawking and vending” zone, the area is flooded with vendors.“When you permit them, you permit them in such an unregulated manner that today that market has lost its character. People pay lakhs of rent per month. They say they made a mistake by abiding by the law as there are 10 vendors sitting outside their shops and customers cannot enter, because there is a problem of hygiene and law and order.

Khattar, who was speaking to the media after chairing the district grievance redressal committee meeting in Gurugram, said all efforts are being made to check pollution, including implementing the directions of the Supreme Court. “The government has imposed a ban on construction, and only factories using clean fuel are being allowed to operate. We are also mulling implementing the odd-even formula for vehicles if there is a consensus among different agencies,” said Khattar. However, state government officials said they considered implementing the odd-even scheme in four NCR districts, but dropped the idea after consultation with CAQM on Tuesday. The CM said that 14 out of 16 grievances were resolved at the meeting, while matters related to the public raised by public representatives were also heard and resolved. In the matter pertaining to the transfer of colonies to MCG, Khattar said that five out of eight private colonies have been transferred and the rest will also get transferred gradually. “The matter of transferring DLF Phase 3 was discussed and it was decided that till December 31, 2021, residents can pay maintenance to the developer, after which the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram will get the pending work completed,” he said. For unauthorised colonies in the state, the CM said that the 1,200 such colonies have registered at the portal created for the purpose, and now the government has decided to reopen the portal for the remaining colonies. “Every plot owner will have to pay the development fees for getting basic amenities,” he said. The chief minister also announced that a foot overbridge would be constructed at Tau Devi Lal Stadium on Medanta side, so that sportspersons can cross the road safely. “There have been instances where sportspersons were injured due to accidents. We have decided to construct a foot overbridge,” he said. Khattar also announced that as part of a new policy, the government will soon allow flexibility in the property registration process. “A property in any tehsil of the district can be registered across the district instead of within the tehsil. This will greatly reduce the burden on people and make it easier for them to register deeds,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-cm-khattar-forms-committee-to-curb-pollution-101637176256867.html

After meeting Gandhi, Chandy said whatever he wanted to say he has conveyed it to the party president and general secretary Tariq Anwar and he did not want to make them public. Leaders close to him said he expressed reservations over recent disciplinary actions against some leaders and criticised the style of functioning of the new leadership in the state. Tariq Anwar is expected to visit the state on Thursday, a senior leader said. But the official faction maintained that they made changes with the knowledge of central leaders. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said if senior leaders have any reservations or apprehensions they will be cleared soon. “We always respect seniors. If they have some reservations we will talk to them,” he said in Kozhikode in north Kerala. Senior leader Ramesh Chennithala is also expected to arrive in the national capital next week. Dissension in the state unit aggravated after the appointment of new Pradesh Congress Committee president K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from Communist heartland, Kannur and Opposition leader VD Satheesan. The move sidelined two powerful blocs, led by Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala, who dominated the state unit for more than a decade-and-a-half. Serious differences between leaders have percolated down the party chain of command. Disciplinary actions were taken against leaders who aired their discontent in public. Last week a former state secretary M A Latheef, a staunch loyalist of Chandy, was suspended for “anti-party activities”. He said he was suspended without any notice and he has no idea why disciplinary action was taken against him. But later the PCC made it clear that action was initiated for dissident activities. Some of the expelled leaders like Anil Kumar and P S Prashant later joined the ruling CPI(M) in August. Earlier, Chandy had criticised the way senior leaders were suspended and asked the new leadership to exercise restraint and take everyone along. But the PCC president maintained that discipline was supreme in the party. In the April assembly elections, the party was expecting to return to power, given the pattern of power alternating between the state’s two major formations, but it faced a humiliating defeat. The fact that party leader, Rahul Gandhi, is a member of Parliament from Kerala added to the ignominy. It led to a major internal shift in the power structure and leadership was forced to intervene in the faction-ridden unit. “Changes were brought in the name of factions but new factions have emerged in the party now,” said political commentator Sunnykutty Abraham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oommen-chandy-urges-sonia-gandhi-to-call-off-revamp-of-kerala-congress-unit-101637176196830.html
18-11-2021||Noida||Fake call centre busted in Noida, 8 men arrested for cheating US citizens||Eight people, who allegedly cheated US nationals of approximately ₹6-7 crore by pretending to be officials of an investigating agency and threatening to link their names with drug cartels, were arrested during a joint operation conducted by the Noida police and the department of telecommunications, (DOT), Government of India, on Wednesday morning. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said the suspects operated from an office in Sector 62. “Around 4am on Wednesday, a team from Sector 58 police station and DOT conducted a search at the office and arrested eight people,” said Singh. The suspects have been identified as Sumit Tyagi (25) and Rahat Ali (28) from Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad; Arun Chauhan (24) from Hapur; Vishal Tomar (24) from Noida’s Sector 39; Keshav Tyagi (24) from Meerut; Prashant Lakhera (24) and his brother Satyendra Lakhera (26) and Sunil Verma (25) from Panna in Madhya Pradesh. Prashant and Satyendra are the cousins of the mastermind of the racket Vinod Lakhera (35), who is on the run. During interrogation, Singh said, the suspects revealed they mostly targeted Americans to escape local police’s surveillance. “The suspects were in contact with some US based vendors, who provided them data of people allegedly involved in the use of drugs. The suspects targeted such people through a mobile application and sometimes, identified themselves as investigating agency officials or someone close to the agency. They told the victims that they had information of them buying drugs from California or Mexico. Since drug use draws strict punishment in the United States, some people got scared when they received such fraudulent calls and fell for the trap. The suspects then tricked the victims to pay gift cards worth USD 100-150 (between ₹7,500- ₹11,000) or threatened to link their names with some drug cartel and jail them,” said Singh. Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, Noida said the suspects then encashed the gift cards into Indian currency using a website. “Sometimes, the suspects also took the victims’ mobile phones and computers on remote access and fraudulently withdrew money from their accounts. They used to cheat people and make USD 3,000-4,000 per day, which roughly translates to ₹ 2.22 lakh – ₹2.96 lakh,” he said. The suspects said they had taken on English names to make fraudulent calls. Police said Sumit Tyagi identified himself as Rick Allen from Santa Clara city in California; Arun Chauhan identified as Jack, VIshal Tomar as Henry, and so on and so forth. Rahat Ali alias Wilson said he joined the company after watching an advertisement six months ago. “I joined the company and realised that this was a fraud. Since I had no other job, I continued this,” he said. Police have recovered ten computers, one laptop, one printer, ten headphones, one internet router, four hard discs, 16 RAM, 99 letterhead pads and six mobile phones from the suspects. Police said they are yet to find out the total number of people the gang has cheated. A case has been registered against the suspects under Sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the IPC and Section 66 of the Information Technology Act. The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody. Police have advised job seekers to verify a call centre/company’s credentials before joining them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fake-call-centre-busted-in-noida-8-men-arrested-for-cheating-us-citizens-101637176136953.html
18-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: EDMC carries out anti-mosquito pilot drive using drone||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) started using drone on Wednesday for spraying larvicide in places that are inaccessible to municipal workers. The pilot exercise was carried out on the banks of Yamuna, near the Yamuna Bank Metro station. Mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said a 12 litre container of larvicide was attached to the drone and a 3km area was covered by the flying device. Beer Singh Panwar, chairman of the standing committee, said on Wednesday, the EDMC hired only a single drone for the exercise and more will be hired for the anti-dengue programme in the coming days.A senior municipal official from the public health department said the drone will be used to spray larvicides and anti-mosquito drugs on rooftops and water tanks in vulnerable areas where domestic breeding checkers of the corporation are unable to reach. The civic bodies had also used drones during the disinfection drives last year to control the spread of Covid-19. The drones had sprayed sodium hypochlorite solution in areas that municipal workers could not reach. However, the efficacy of using drones for covering a large surface area was widely questioned at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiedmc-carries-out-anti-mosquito-pilot-drive-using-drone-101637176076782.html

Of the total 25 wards in Kuppam municipality, the YSRCP won one ward unanimously and another 18 during the polls which took place on Monday.The TDP managed to win just six wards, according to the results declared on Wednesday. Taking a dig at Naidu over his party’s poll performance, state minister for panchayat raj and senior YSRCP leader Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said it would be better if the former chief minister stepped down as TDP chief.“It is now evident that Naidu cannot win from Kuppam in the next assembly elections. He is welcome to come to my constituency, Punganur, and prove his worth by defeating me. This is my challenge. Otherwise, he should quit politics and take a rest in Hyderabad,” Reddy said.The principal opposition party in the state, however, accused YSRCP of manipulating the electoral process and winning the Kuppam municipality through misuse of official machinery and abuse of police forces.“If people have voted for the YSRCP out of their love for chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, party leaders should explain why TDP leaders were arrested and prevented from campaigning. Why were TDP leaders arrested while YSRCP leaders freely entered the polling booths? Why did the YSRCP bring impersonators from other districts and rig the polling process? Why did the party spend hundreds of crores in just one municipality?” TDP politburo member and lawmaker Nimmala Ramanaidu said. Kuppam was a stronghold of the TDP since 1989 and was represented by Naidu for the last seven terms. Ever since the YSRCP came to power in the state in May 2019, the party has been focusing on Kuppam with a view to end Naidu’s political career.In the gram panchayat elections held in February this year, the YSRCP had won 75 out of 89 gram panchayats in Kuppam while the TDP had won only 14.In the subsequent local body elections in April, the TDP managed to secure only three out of 65 mandal parishad (block parishad) territorial constituencies (MPTCs). It also lost all four zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) in Kuppam.The YSRCP’s comprehensive victory in the latest polls has come as a major jolt to TDP cadres in general, and Naidu in particular. “The development in Kuppam is an important psychological result which will hit the morale of the TDP, whose strength is already dwindling, public support waning and optics of a potential resurgence is deteriorating,” political analyst and senior journalist Sriram Karri said.Karri also pointed out that the beginning of the TDP’s downfall had begun with its defeat in the 2019 assembly elections and the strategic mistake of leaving the National Democratic Alliance. “The TD has time till next elections to recoup but a superficial reading and anecdotal analysis points to no silver lining for the yellow party,” he observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-civic-polls-ysrcp-makes-inroads-into-tdp-bastion-101637176019811.html
18-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court refuses relief to teacher who refused to get vaccinated||The Delhi high court on Wednesday refused to grant interim relief to a Delhi government school teacher who is unvaccinated and had moved the court, challenging a circular that made vaccination mandatory for coming to school.Justice Rekha Palli refused to allow the teacher to join duty — he has been marked “on leave” as he is unable to come to school without vaccination— saying she was not inclined to interfere unless there was a medical issue.“I am not inclined. Why should she not get vaccinated? There is no case for interim relief,” the court said, adding that being unvaccinated “puts everyone at risk”.The court issued notice and sought the city government’s response on the teacher’s challenge to the order of the directorate of education, restraining unvaccinated teachers from attending school from October 15.Appearing for the Delhi government, counsel Siddharth Krishna opposed the petition and said that allowing the petitioner to come to school would put students at risk.Senior lawyer Sanjoy Ghose, appearing for the teacher, stated his client “does not want to expose her body to external substances” and presently, she has strong immunity as her antibody count was 427. The senior counsel contended that vaccination was voluntary and being unvaccinated was not a crime. The counsel also emphasised that there was nothing to prove that mandatory vaccination prevented transmission of the novel coronavirus.Urging the court to allow the petitioner to resume work, he stated that she was willing to undertake the Covid-19 test every month and practice Covid-appropriate behaviour.To this, the court said, “Not at all. I will not touch that matter. I am not inclined at all unless there is a serious problem.” Palli said it was because of vaccination that there were now milder cases of the virus. “Today the position that we are in, it is because of vaccination,” she said.The petitioner agreed to get herself vaccinated without prejudice to her rights and contentions but urged the authorities to “take responsibility for any short-term or long-term consequences”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-refuses-relief-to-teacher-who-refused-to-get-vaccinated-101637176018737.html

18-11-2021||Noida||Noida resident makes wedding wear ‘dream’ come true for the underprivileged||Come wedding season and all the would-be brides and grooms go all out with their near and dear ones to buy that one wedding outfit--shimmering with hues of gold and glittering with artificial stones---- that will make them look like a princess or prince ‘straight out of a fairy tale’ on their special day.While everyone tries to look like a “dream” on their wedding day, for many under privileged people, it is actually a ‘dream’ to wear such lavish clothes, which are out of their budget.  However, Anoop Khanna, a resident of Noida’s Sector 47, is now making their ‘dream’ come true with his wedding wear bank. Here, residents can donate their wedding dresses, which are then lent to the underprivileged for free for their wedding and are returned to the bank. With the wedding season underway, a number of men and women are making use of this unique wedding wear bank.Started in 2017 with one bridal dress, the bank today has 15 bridal lehengas and 20 sherwanis that are lent for free. Niharika Maheshwari, who earlier stayed in Noida, was the first to donate her bridal lehenga to the bank. “I did not want my bridal wear to go to waste sitting in my wardrobe. I felt it had become dead to me after my wedding and if it can be used to put life to a poor girl’s wedding, there will be nothing like it,” says Niharika, who has now moved to Delhi. Back then, her lehenga cost her around ₹70,000. Sector 51 residents Rahul Thakur and his wife also donated their wedding wear two years ago.“I read about the initiative on social media and decided to donate my wedding suit. My wife also liked the concept and donated her wedding dress. We had invested around ₹1 lakh in both the dresses but it was of no use to us anymore. It feels good to see that in the past two years, our dresses have been used for four weddings,” says Thakur, who works with a private firm.Khanna started the initiative out of his chemist shop in Ganga Shopping Complex in Sector 29.“In 2017, Niharika gave me this idea (of a wedding bank) when she donated her wedding dress to me asking me to use it for the wedding of a poor girl. Since then, the dress has been used for the wedding of three girls from nearby slums.It took me sometime to spread word about the initiative and it is only in the past one year that the initiative has become so popular among the people of Noida,” says Khanna.He says his shop also gives a choice to people to choose from different styles and colours. “If you decide to give a sari to your sweeper or domestic help, you are not giving them a choice of style, design or colour. They have to accept whatever you give them. However here, people have the option to choose,” says Khanna. However, there are some rules to borrow from the bank. Anyone who borrows the dresses has to return them back to Khanna after getting it dry-cleaned. But, how does he ensure the dresses loaned for free are not misused? Khanna says he has some rules in place to check this.“A person who borrows a dress from us cannot loan another one for the next 15 days. We always take a guarantee from the person borrowing the dresses by either taking their Aadhaar or ration card,” said the 60-year-old. However, no misuse has happened since Khanna started the initiative.After the pandemic, the bank was not much in use in 2020, said Khanna. “Last year, most people opted for low-key wedding celebrations. Hence, none of the dresses were borrowed. But this year, at least eight of the bridal lehengas have been booked. Most of these bookings are from women who are domestic helps, sanitation workers or small scale grocery vendors in the city” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-resident-makes-wedding-wear-dream-come-true-for-the-underprivileged-101637175896820.html
18-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC denies bail to man who helped gangster Fajja escape custody||New Delhi: The Delhi high court has denied bail to a man, arrested for allegedly helping an under trial gangster to escape from a hospital, saying that the conspiracy of helping the prisoner escape from the lawful judicial custody is of huge magnitude and could have serious effects on public safety and graver consequences on the society.Justice Subramonium Prasad said granting bail to the accused, at this juncture, has the potential to encourage “copycat criminal behavior” and dismissed the plea of accused Bhupender Singh alias Bhuttan.The high court said that an operation of this complexity, that is, to aid an undertrial of notorious credentials to escape lawful custody, has wide ramifications that may shake the confidence of the public in the police administration as well as the criminal justice system.The court noted that in this case around 10-12 persons were involved in the successful escape of gangster Kuldeep alias Fajja and two minors were made accomplices and abettors to the act of escaping the undertrial as they created chaos by throwing chilly powder in the eyes of the police personnel who were accompanying him.According to the prosecution, Singh was the one who took the undertrial on his scooty from Jaipur Golden Hospital to Rohini to a safe house for providing refuge to him.Fajja was encountered by the police after a high voltage gunfight. Singh was arrested on March 28.The judge said the contention of Singh’s counsel that the maximum punishment for the offences, he is charged with, is of no consequence as the gravity of the conspiracy to enable a dreaded gangster to escape from lawful custody has a greater bearing on this court while deciding this petition.“The evidentiary value of the disclosure statement and whether the petitioner (Singh) can be identified in the CCTV footage will be decided during the course of the trial. This court needs to bear in mind that the act was meticulously planned and swiftly implemented.“The conspiracy of helping Kuldeep alias Fajja escape from the lawful judicial custody is of huge magnitude which could have serious effects on public safety and graver consequences on society as a whole. To execute this conspiracy, it required skill, tact, and a high level of intricate planning and plotting,” the court said.It added that tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses also cannot be ruled out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-denies-bail-to-man-who-helped-gangster-fajja-escape-custody-101637175776864.html

18-11-2021||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad await UP government’s directions on closure of schools||A decision to keep schools, colleges and educational institutions in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad closed will be taken once the state government issues directions in this regard, said officials from the two district administrations on Wednesday. A decision on the educational institutions was expected a day after the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on late Tuesday issued directions for the closure of schools and colleges in the National Capital Region (NCR) till further orders in the wake of high pollution levels. District magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar Suhas L Y issued an order on Wednesday evening stating that schools and colleges will remain closed till November 21. However, the order was rolled back late at night.“The order in the evening was issued in accordance with the directions given by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board. Since this order was withdrawn, our order automatically stands cancelled. A decision to close schools and colleges will be taken once we receive official communication from the state government,” said Suhas on late Wednesday night. Vipin Kumar, additional district magistrate of Ghaziabad, also said there were no directions from the state government. “We are awaiting orders and will comply with the directions once received. As of now, there is no order and schools and colleges will open on Thursday,”said Kumar. On Tuesday, the CAQM directed that all private and government schools, colleges and educational institutions in NCR shall remained closed till further orders. Educationists said that the CAQM decision on the closure of schools in the wake of high pollution levels is unprecedented. “We have not received any official communication about closure of schools from the district administration yet. Initially, the closure of schools was due to the pandemic and it has affected studies since last year. Hence, the students have been away from physical classes for a long time . Now, it is the pollution levels which have led the CAQM to order for the closure of schools. This is surely going to affect students and their studies in the long run,” said Jyoti Gupta, director of Delhi Public School, Sahibabad. In absence of directions by the UP government, schools remained opened in Ghaziabad on Wednesday and is likely to remain open on Thursday as well. Schools in Gautam Budh Nagar remained open on Wednesday and principals say they did not receive any directions regarding closure of schools. “I read news reports about the directives issued by the CAQM but we have not received any formal communication from the authorities regarding closure of schools. We will be conducting classes as usual on Thursday as well,” said Chhavi Singh, principal at Government Girls Inter College in Badalpur, Gautam Budh Nagar. Aditi Basu Roy, principal of Grads International School, Greater Noida, and president of the All India Principals’ Association (Gautam Budh Nagar) said closure of schools at this time will adversely affect students’ studies. “The Class 10 and 12 boards are underway and we also have to complete syllabus for other classes and prepare students for exams. If schools are closed now, it will adversely affect studies as students have only recently regained momentum in grabbing concepts in physical classes, which was difficult in online classes that were held during the pandemic. While Classes 1 to 5 can manage, the studies of students in class 6 and above will be hampered if schools are closed,” she said. Members of parents’ associations expressed satisfaction with the CAQM decision. “The decision by CAQM is correct as high pollution levels can affect younger children. Children are yet to get Covid vaccination. So, it is better that they continue with online classes,” said Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson of the Ghaziabad Parents’ Association. Seizure of old vehicles a major enforcement issueDirections issued by the CAQM also included strict crackdown against diesel vehicles more than 10 years old and petrol vehicles more than 15 years old. Officials of state transport department said they will focus on enforcement but will face difficulty in getting land for dumping the seized vehicles. According to official estimates, the Ghaziabad transport region--comprising Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Hapur and Bulandshahr--have an estimated six lakh diesel vehicles more than 10 years old and petrol vehicles more than 15 years old while the enforcement against these still lack sting. Officials did not disclose the seizures made till date but said they seized about 170 diesel vehicles, 67 petrol vehicles, 453 vehicles for not having pollution under control (PUC) certificates. It also issued 169 challans against vehicles caught overloading and another 90 vehicles, which were found carrying construction material in the open between November 10 and 15. Officials said most of the errant vehicle drivers were from Noida and Ghaziabad. “Both Noida and Ghaziabad are taken on priority basis, due to high levels of pollution. For dump yard, we have a space in Noida Sector-62. We are also trying if some space in Surajpur police line can be allocated for storage of seized vehicles. Likewise, we have also requested the Ghaziabad police to allow storage of seized vehicles at Harsaon police lines,” said Rajeev Srivastava, deputy transport commissioner, Uttar Pradesh. “The enforcement will continue.We have also asked for diversion of manpower and resources on priority basis to tackle erring vehicle drivers in both districts,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-ghaziabad-await-up-government-s-directions-on-closure-of-schools-101637175656738.html

18-11-2021||Lucknow||Poll pitch intensifies as Akhilesh Yadav traverses Purvanchal Expressway during Samajwadi Vijay Yatra||A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the 341 km Purvanchal Expressway, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav traversed along the same Purvanchal Expressway on Wednesday after beginning his Samajwadi Vijay Yatra from Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh.PM Modi had landed in a C-130J Super Hercules aircraft at the emergency airstrip on the expressway in Sultanpur district for its inauguration on Tuesday.On Wednesday, the SP chief declared the BJP would be voted out of power in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.A large crowd was witnessed as people, along with party workers, assembled at many points along the route of Vijay Rath Yatra to welcome Yadav and other leaders as the yatra passed along Mau, Azamgarh, Ambedkar Nagar, Ayodhya, Amethi and Barabanki on way to Lucknow. “Uttar Pradesh will witness a change in 2022 polls. I can see a wave of change,” said Yadav while addressing the people from atop the Vijay Rath.After reaching venue of his first meeting along the expressway at Haidariya in Ghazipur by helicopter, Yadav rode the rath to begin his journey to Lucknow, raising the pitch of his attacks on the BJP government. Akhilesh Yadav questioned the PM for inaugurating the incomplete project. He said the BJP was taking away the credit for the developmental projects conceived by the Samajwadi Party government.The SP’s move has evoked mixed reactions in political circles.“This is a reflection of the level of politics the Samajwadi Party has been pursuing over the years. Instead of indulging in such politics, Akhilesh Yadav should speak about the development of Uttar Pradesh,” said UP BJP spokesman Avnish Tyagi.Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science at Lucknow University, said, “UP’s politics has remained focused on castes. The political parties should focus more on development than on castes. The SP should have come out with a roadmap for further development instead of targeting the BJP and claiming credit for the Purvanchal Expressway project.”Videos released by the Samajwadi Party show the people showering garlands and flower petals on Akhilesh Yadav as he alights from a mechanically elevated platform atop the Vijay Rath.Akhilesh Yadav, who left Ghazipur at about 12.30 pm, reached Azamgarh at about 7.30pm, the Samajwadi Party said in a tweet.

18-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: AAP councillors suspended after ruckus at EDMC house meeting||New Delhi: The general body meeting of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) was disrupted on Wednesday after disagreement over over the topic of discussion by councillors, following which the mayor suspended all the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillors for 15 days. Officials said that the AAP councillors wanted a discussion on rising dengue cases while the mayor and the BJP councillors were planning to start off with a discussion on pollution.“We were discussing air pollution problem in Delhi but the opposition members wanted to discuss dengue cases first. We had agreed to discuss dengue too but it is the chair’s (mayor) prerogative to decide the order in which discussions can take place,” said EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal. Officials said the house meeting was suspended thrice due to unruly behaviour by the councillors.The mayor alleged that the opposition councillors entered the well of the house and engaged in “uncivilised behaviour”. “A fight could have broken out between AAP and BJP councillors and we were forced to suspend the house proceedings three times,” he added.Manoj Kumar Tyagi, the leader of opposition and one of the 15 suspended members, said that the issue regarding the order of discussion on dengue and air pollution had been resolved after the house proceedings were suspended for the first time. “But a BJP councillor had used abusive language against one of the opposition members. So we entered the well and demanded the suspension of the BJP councillor, but the mayor insisted that the well of the house must be cleared first. So instead of suspending the member who broke the decorum, 15 AAP councillors have been suspended,” said Tyagi, calling the mayor’s behaviour “dictatorial”.Disruptions and ruckus is not uncommon in the EDMC’s general body meetings. Earlier, 20 AAP councillors were also suspended in last house meeting on September 27 this year for allegedly creating ruckus and disrupting the meeting. Several microphones and plastic screens meant for ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour were also damaged during the proceedings at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiaapcouncillors-suspended-after-ruckus-at-edmc-house-meeting-101637175536759.html

Air pollution has reached toxic levels and filtration of the polluted air is the need of the hour, said Noida authority officials. Noida recorded an Air Quality Index reading of 345, in the “very poor” zone on Wednesday.“If this works out well then we can build more such towers to mitigate air pollution in the city,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Union minister for heavy industries, Krishan Pal Gurjar, Union minister for state for power and heavy industries, local MP Dr Mahesh Sharma, Noida MLA Pankaj Singh, and other officials were present at the launch of this tower.“The tower will benefit the residents and the commuters who pass through this road,” said Pandey at the inauguration.Rupees 37 lakh will be spent on maintenance of this tower annually, said authority officials.They said the tower was built using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds arranged via the Central government’s public sector undertakings (PSUs). A budget of ₹2.5 crore was allocated for the project. The work on the ground started on September 25 this year after the Noida authority approved the project in its board meeting on September 24.The tower will clean the polluted air around it and release purified air, said officials. Equipped with intake and exhaust fans, the tower will initially run with the help of electricity. The authority, however, plans to run the tower with the help of solar energy later.Built on a green belt area of 400 square metres along the DND Flyway, the anti-smog tower will work at a filtration rate (the capacity of the tower to clean air per cubic metre) of 80,000 cubic metres per hour.The tower will help clean pollutants in the air in Noida sectors 15, 15A, 16, 16A (Film City), 17 and 19, among others. Nearly 100,000 commuters travel along the DND Flyway and the Delhi-Noida Expressway link road, and the installation of the tower will be beneficial for them too, said the authority officials.A machine fixed inside the tower will remove nearly 80% of the particulate matter i.e. PM2.5 and PM10 (which experts consider the primary pollutants in this region) in the air, and help bring down the pollution levels in the area, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-first-anti-smog-tower-along-dnd-flyway-becomes-operational-101637175416676.html
18-11-2021||Delhi||No stock at most liquor shops in Delhi as new excise regime faces teething issues||New Delhi: The “dry day”-like streak in Delhi continued on the first day of the new excise regime on Wednesday as new liquor vends could not start operations either due to the unavailability of liquor stock or because their premises were not ready. The uncertainty was evident even in restaurants and pubs over licenses and liquor supplies, the rules for which were changed with this notification of the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021-22. None of the shops in Mayur Vihar, Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Lajpat Nagar, INA, Dwarka and Govindpuri opened on day one of the new system. “We could not open our stores today because we haven’t received our liquor stock. This is despite us getting a provisional license. We have no idea when we’ll get delivery of our order,” said Monu Bansal, manager of the four shops that will be coming up in east Delhi’s Star City and Galleria malls. Many residents too had to return empty-handed “It is like a dry day in Delhi today. I have a party at my home tomorrow and I went to at least four shops, but to no avail. The shops either have no stock of alcohol or are shut. The entire transition to the new excise rules seems to be poorly managed. I will have to go to Gurugram now to buy liquor,” said Tamanna Rastogi, a resident of Malviya Nagar. A senior excise official on condition of anonymity said the department is working on resolving the supply issue, but refused to comment any further. The new excise policy also has a number of changes in the way restaurants and bars can operate in the city. It allows the sale of liquor in bottles at restaurants and operates till 3 am. A major restaurateur in Delhi who is dealing with the government to resolve the issues cropping from the transition to the new regime said there is no clarity about most of the new rules. “Firstly, most of our restaurateurs are facing a lot of problems in getting the new licenses from the department. The department has only limited people and they are all primarily busy in issuing provisional licenses to the 850 odd private retail liquor vends in the city. Next, we have received no communication so far on when we can start operating till 3am and whether we can start serving liquor to those who are 21 years and above. A lot of things need clarification,” said the restaurateur on condition of anonymity. Officials of the excise department did not respond to these queries put up by HT. As per the new rules, restaurants and pubs in the city can serve liquor in open spaces, such as terrace, balcony, etc, inside their premises and can also have live music arrangements, such as performing bands, DJs, karaoke, etc, without hassle. It also allows microbreweries in the city to start takeaway service for draught beer, serve in events and sell directly to restaurants and pubs. However, no orders have been issued on this so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-stock-at-most-liquor-shops-in-delhi-as-new-excise-regime-faces-teething-issues-101637175357863.html
18-11-2021||Pune||Ahmednagar civil hospital fire: State govt cancels medical officer’s suspension||Pune: The state government has revoked the suspension order of a 27-year-old medical officer, who was arrested along with three nurses of the Ahmednagar civil hospital, in connection with the fire at the hospital’s ICU on November 6, acting civil surgeon Dr BK Ramteke confirmed. “Dr Vishakha Shinde she was a PG student and resident doctor, but not a permanent employee, so the state government has revoked her suspension,” said Dr Ramteke. “About other three nurses – one who was permanently suspended continues - while the other two who were working on a contractual basis their service has been terminated,” he said. The government formed a probe committee under divisional commissioner, Nashik range, to look into why firefighting systems were not in place at the hospital. The fire audit carried out in March this year had recommended installation of equipment in the hospital to deal with fire incidents. Meanwhile, according to the police, the death toll in the fire incident increased to 12, as a 60-year-old male patient died during treatment on Wednesday. The Ahmednagar police will also be recording the statement of Popatrao Pawar, sarpanch of Hirvebazar and recipient of the Padma Shri award, as he was present in the civil hospital when the fire incident broke out. Pawar was in hospital to give a sample for RT-PCR Covid-19 test, as he was due to go Delhi to receive his award. “When the fire broke out, I called up the fire brigade, informed the collector. He tried to help the fire brigade. Manoj Patil, superintendent of police, Ahmednagar had called to know exactly happened when the fire broke out. I told him about the chain of events, however, I have not yet been called officially to record my statement,” said Pawar. Sandip Mitke, deputy superintendent of Ahmednagar rural police, said, “We will be recording Pawar’s statement in the fire incident as he is one of the witnesses when the fire broke out at the ICU.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ahmednagar-civil-hospital-fire-state-govt-cancels-medical-officer-s-suspension-101637175356712.html
18-11-2021||Pune||Novel mosquito repelling molecule synthesised by CSIR-NCL scientists||A team of researchers from the CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL), Pune, has synthesised a potent molecule that helps repel adult female Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes which are vectors of debilitating and often fatal diseases such as dengue and chikungunya and also vectors of the Zika virus. During the Covid-19 pandemic, several states in India reported an alarming increase in dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus cases, putting an additional burden on already stretched healthcare facilities due to coronavirus.A research team led by Dr D S Reddy, currently the director of the CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, used the “silicon switch” approach to synthesise a library of compounds based on the DEET scaffold, which is the present-day’s gold-standard insect repellent. Out of the 25 compounds synthesised, one of the molecules offered longer duration of protection than DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide), suggesting that the incorporation of silicon improves efficacy. Results of this exciting study have been published in the journal ACS Omega.The lead authors of the paper, Dr Avalokiteswar Sen and Dr Srinivasa Reddy, are confident about the prospects of the findings. However, the identified molecule needs to undergo several studies, including long-term safety assessment, before it reaches the market. “The discussions are on with some leading companies to take forward this insect repellent molecule for further studies towards commercialisation. Twenty-five silicon-containing piperidines were synthesised, and the influence of silicon incorporation on insect repellency was investigated. One of the compounds showed better protection time than the gold-standard DEET and corresponding carbon analogs. The novel organosilicon mosquito repellents possess the potential to be developed as effective mosquito repellents,” said Dr Sen.“The main goal of this research was to understand the effect of silicon introduction on insect repellency. Since our previous research indicated that the replacement of C with Si improves potency and other pharmacokinetic parameters, 25,32 the 4,4- dimethyl-1,4-azasilinane part was kept constant while the other groups were varied,” said Dr Reddy.The research team included Akshay S Kulkarni, Remya Ramesh, Safal Walia, Shahebaz I Sayyad, Ganesh B Gathalkar, Seetharamsing Balamkundu, Manali Joshi, Avalokiteswar Sen, and Dr Srinivasa Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/novel-mosquito-repelling-molecule-synthesised-by-csir-ncl-scientists-101637175058287.html
18-11-2021||Pune||ASER 2021: Smartphone availability among students doubles in 3 yrs||Pune: The smartphone availability among children aged 6 to 14 years in Maharashtra has doubled in the past three years. However, the increase in numbers does not necessarily translate to an increase in access, according to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2021 released on Wednesday. A similar trend was seen across India. The report also reveals 9.2% rise in student enrolment in government schools in the 6-14 years of age group in Maharashtra in three years since 2018, as per ASER 2021. The proportion of children taking tuition, according to ASER, has increased from 2018 to 2021, regardless of grade, school type, or sex. Currently, almost 40% of children take paid private tuition classes across India. In Maharashtra, enrolled children taking tuition have also increased from 14.2 per cent in 2018 to 20.7 per cent in 2021. About smartphones, students in higher grades such as class 9 and above, as per the ASER report, were given more accessibility smartphones as compared to students from class one and two. “In 2018, 42.3% of children in government schools across Maharashtra had at least one smartphone at home. This proportion increased to 76.3% in 2020 and grew further to 85.5% in 2021. However, household economic status along with parents’ education level affects smartphone availability for students,” stated the report. Dinkar Temkar, state education director (primary), said that the accessibility has improved for students. “However, as schools are reopening now for higher standards, younger students will also have more access to smartphones to resume their studies. As we are going back to offline mode, we are trying to engage students in offline education and get them away from smartphones,” said Temkar. The report has also highlighted that as parents’ education level increases, the likelihood that every household has a smartphone also increases. “In 2021, over 80% of children in Maharashtra with parents who had studied at least till class 9 had a smartphone available at home, as compared to just over 50% of children whose parents had studied till class 5 or less. Notably, though, even among children with parents in the ‘low’ education category, over a quarter of households had bought a new smartphone for their children’s studies since the lockdown began in March 2020,” said the report The report was published by NGO Pratham and has evaluated all Indian states based on different parameters. The report states that the availability of smartphones in children’s homes has almost doubled from 2018 to 2021, regardless of school type. Speaking about the accessibility of smartphones, city-based education activist Mukund Kirdat said that in some pockets, smartphones are accessible for children, however, that may not be the case for most parts of Maharashtra. “Different regions face different issues. Pune district number clearly states that many students do not have access to smartphones at all. And even if they do, there are other siblings at home who need the phone. There is also a mobile network connectivity issue which affects the online education of the child,” said Kirdat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/aser-2021-smartphone-availability-among-students-doubles-in-3-yrs-101637175056921.html

The menace can be solved by the police keeping a strict vigil through their beat constables and cordoning off the area where the vendors squat,” the court said.“We direct the Delhi Police to ensure that unauthorised hawkers and vendors do not return on a daily basis. The SDMC must put up boards declaring the area to be “no hawking. no vending”. The DCP shall be personally responsible for compliance,” the bench said further said. In its plea, the Munirka Village residents’ welfare association said hawkers have illegally occupied the road and pedestrian zones in and around Munirka Village and near the Munirka Metro station. The RWA representative also said incidents of snatching and harassment of women were common in the area due to crowding on footpaths.He told the court that they have written to all the authorities but no action has been taken.During the hearing, advocate Rishikesh Kumar, appearing for the police, told the court that drives are conducted at regular intervals but the vendors keep returning.To this, the court replied that orders have been passed by the Supreme Court stating that it is the responsibility of the police to remove unauthorised vendors from the area. It said there needs to be a different mechanism if the vendors keep returning, including barricading the area.The police counsel said they will formulate some mechanism to barricade the area and also find other solutions to the problem.“Please show some will and mark the entry and exit points to get the work done. It is not rocket science; you are not sending a rocket to Mars,” the court said.The court asked the authorities to conduct more drives and submit fresh status reports. The matter will be next heard on January 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ensure-illegal-hawkers-do-not-return-to-munirka-area-hc-tells-police-101637174996756.html

The AQI of Greater Noida was 362, while that of Noida was 356, both readings also falling in the “very poor” category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Authorities are scrambling to combat the air pollution crisis, with the Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM) widening the curbs across NCR late Tuesday. It extended the ban on construction and demolition activities, and also shut all schools in the NCR until further orders.Meanwhile, Ghaziabad municipal corporation is missing crucial equipment needed in its fight against pollution. The corporation was to get 30 big air filters — for being placed in public places— and six higher capacity anti-smog guns with a capacity of 6,000 litres each. The corporation refused to divulge details of machines it procured so far and only said that “about 60% of machines brought with the funds have arrived”.The fund of ₹61.5 crore was also to be utilised for revamp of 200 parks; conversion of 579 vehicles to CNG, the development of a city forest near the New Bus Adda Metro station and also for paving of dusty roads with greenery and stones, among other measures. “We have placed the work orders this July for all equipment that we need from the ₹61.5 crore funds that we got. Equipment for about 60% of the funds were delivered over the past two months and they are currently being deployed on the basis of a duty roster. The work order for the remaining equipment was issued this month. So, it is likely that we will get them only by December,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner, Ghaziabad. Last December, the corporation officials had said the plan will be implemented within six months and well before the onset of winter in 2021. “However, the pandemic caused delays in procurement and hampered the progress. But we are expediting the processes,” said a corporation official, asking not to be named. Environmentalists have decried the lackadaisical attitude of the civic body towards the current air emergency and said it has become a regular occurrence for the corporation to make plans, but not adhere to timelines, at least in Ghaziabad city. “The pollution levels have risen manifold this season and local sources of pollution have also come into play. It was easy to blame stubble burning until now, but the fire counts have reduced considerably in the past one week, but the pollution in the city has not. Now, the major share in pollution is from local sources such as vehicular and industrial emissions,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. “What will be the use if these equipment arrive mid-winter, when residents have already suffered over a month of high pollution levels?” he said. The CAQM, while citing officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said the period between November 17 and 21 is likely to be unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. A forecast from the Union ministry of earth sciences’ System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) on Wednesday said, “From Nov 20th onwards, surface winds are likely to be strong resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality. The effective farm fire count is 2,643 and its contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 today is 6%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-yet-to-procure-all-equipment-needed-to-fight-air-pollution-101637174940709.html

Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Baner Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust (BPLRW), representing residents of the area, a bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta, on Monday, issued the notice to the PMC. “The Bombay High Court has heard the PIL and taken cognisance of the issue of the incomplete 36 metre-wide Baner Pashan Link road. The High Court has passed an order to issue a notice to the PMC, the district collector, the Urban Development Department and Town Planning and the valuation department to file their response regarding the grevance of the petitioner, i.e, Baner Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust. The respondents have to file their response by 10.01.2022, when the matter will be heard again by the bench headed by Dipankar Datta,” said Satya Muley, the counsel appearing for the trust. The trust had approached the Bombay High Court in September 2021 as work is still incomplete 30 years after the road was sanctioned. When contacted, the PMC road department said they have not received the notice yet “We are happy with court decision and we are hopeful for justice,” said Rajendra Chuttar, president of the trust. He along with 2,000 families have been holding talks with the PMC for completion of the link road since 2014. HT first reported this issue in 2017.“The connectivity has been severely hampered due to incomplete roads with the most important being the 36-metre Baner-Pashan link road, from Wakeshwar chowk on Sus Pashan road to Rolling Hills chowk, as per the development plan (DP) of 1993. This road is pending due to a delay in land acquisition by the PMC. The road has been partially constructed in 2014 and is existing from both the ends, but two small stretches, collectively of 200 metres, are remaining incomplete rendering the entire 1.2km long road inutile. The existing alternative is a narrow 7m-wide road with incomplete footpaths, and no possibility of widening due to existing structures,” said Chuttar. Residents made several representations since 2014 to the PMC commissioners and several elected representatives. They have even conducted lawful silent protests on several occasions, sans any positive result. The PMC authorities have remained non-committal as to when the road will be completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hc-asks-pmc-state-to-file-say-on-baner-pashan-link-road-delay-101637174516791.html

18-11-2021||Pune||Pune civic chief to introduce five year plan model for city’s development||PUNE: To avoid diversion of funds, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar has decided to introduce five year plans for every department for holistic development of the city. He has decided to prepare an outcome budget for the upcoming 2022-23 annual budget. Kumar acknowledged that the diversion of funds has affected development of the city by creating liabilities and putting pressure on the upcoming annual budget.The commissioner’s move is inspired by the launch of India’s first five year plan in 1951, which mainly focused on the development of the primary sector. Kumar has prepared a roadmap for the budget, introducing the concept of five year plans for each department. He has issued an order to this effect and given detailed instructions to all departments. He has directed that provision be made for committee work (mentioned in last year’s budget) in next year’s budget. For the outcome budget, each department head will set key measurement (quantitative and qualitative) indicators and prepare a presentation.Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said that a majority of funds for big projects are carried forward or diverted into non-priority works owing to lack of land for big projects. Therefore, the commissioner has instructed all department heads to include environment assessment and PMC-acquired land points before introducing and allocating funds for development projects.Additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar said, “The commissioner has introduced a new concept in next year’s budget preparation. It will help the development of the city in a planned manner. Plan and non-plan work will give an exact idea of financial provision for particular works or development projects. It will put brakes on the practice of diversion of funds into non-plan development works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-civic-chief-to-introduce-five-year-plan-model-for-city-s-development-101637174336843.html

He was speaking at the All India Presiding Officers’ Conference at Shimla.

He also noted that women’s role in the armed forces is increasing ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come to power.Rajnath Singh was in Jhansi where the Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv is part of the ongoing Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will dedicate and launch several new initiatives of the Ministry of Defence to the nation in a grand ceremony being organised in the precincts of Jhansi Fort on the final day of the event on November 19, also the birth anniversary of Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi. The Ministry of Defence has organised the three-day Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv jointly with the Uttar Pradesh government.“She lost her everything at a young age, but not her self-respect and honour. This was ingrained in her, putting her on the pinnacle of bravery. Her heroism gave a new dimension to the power of women, which she, in fact, reawakened,” Rajnath Singh said.He said being a woman was never a hindrance for her in the battlefield.“Many think women are weak, they should learn from freedom fighters like Laxmi Bai, Avanti Bai, Jhalkari Bai who showed unparalleled bravery on the battlefield,” he said.He mentioned that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose named one of the Indian National Army (NA) regiments after Laxmi Bai.“Netaji believed the freedom struggle was incomplete without the participation of women who account for half the population,” the defence minister said.Post independence, women did not have the right participation in the defence forces, he said, adding that things were changing now.“Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken over, the participation of women is increasing in every force,” he said.“The army has opened the doors for women. We have increased their numbers in three wings of the defence forces,” Rajnath Singh said.The girls, Rajnath Singh said, were getting admission in Sainik Schools while the portals of the National Defence Academy have been opened for them.“You will be surprised to know two lakh girls in the country have appeared for admission in NDA,” he said.Rajnath Singh said the country has progressed rapidly on the path of self- reliance under this government.With the joint efforts of government and the industry the goal of Make in India would not only be achieved but also “Make for the World”, he said. “This is an important resolution related to defence, we will accomplish this,” he said.He lauded chief minister Yogi Adityanath for maintenance of law and order in the state. The goons and mafias have either fled the state or they have given up crime, he added.About the Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv, Rajnath Singh said, “It connects us with the pride of India and the struggle for the independence of the country. Rani Laxmi Bai’s bravery and sacrifice are associated with every part of Jhansi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rajanath-singh-inaugurates-rashtra-raksha-samarpan-parv-in-jhansi-101637170196065.html
18-11-2021||Lucknow||Four SP MLCs join BJP ahead of 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls||Political poaching escalated ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday winning over four Samajwadi Party (SP) MLCs (members of legislative council ) to its fold. Soon after the joining, UP BJP vice president Daya Shankar Singh, a member of the party’s joining committee, said that two dozen opposition lawmakers waiting to walk into the BJP camp soon.Earlier this month, the SP had won over BJP’s OBC lawmaker Rakesh Rathore. The BJP had quickly hit back by getting SP’s Dalit lawmaker Subhash Pasi to join the party in the run-up to the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh welcomed the four SP MLCs: Ravi Shankar Singh aka Pappu Bhaiya, Narendra Singh Bhati, CP Chand and Rama Niranjan. He told them to bring their “friends” in the SP also to the BJP. The Samajwadi Party currently dominates the 100-member upper house of the state legislature. The SP leads the house with 48 MLCs followed by the BJP’s 36 while the BSP (6), Congress (2) and Apna Dal (1) also figure there along with independents (3), teachers’ group MLCs (2) and independent groups (2). The term of 35 MLCs is set to end on March 7, 2022, and BJP leaders said many of those joining the party now, would be fielded for local body MLC seats when the elections are called. “We have closed the gap in the legislative council with the SP and, very soon, we would lead in the upper house too,” said UP BJP MLC and party’s state vice-president Vijay Bahadur Pathak. Ravi Shankar Singh, SP MLC and grandson of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, said he had made up his mind to leave the party ever since Chandra Shekhar’s son Neeraj Shekhar was denied the ticket from the Ballia Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 polls. Ballia has been the traditional Lok Sabha seat of Chandra Shekhar who represented it 10 times while Neeraj won the seat in the 2008 by-polls and the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. When asked if the SP-SBSP pact would have any impact on eastern UP, where the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has been drawing impressive crowds, Singh said, “SBSP won’t have any impact anywhere. After inking a pact with the BJP in 2017 UP polls, Rajbhar did little except strengthening himself.”UP BJP leader Daya Shankar Singh said, “We speak to Om Prakash Rajbhar (SBSP chief) and no one knows where he will go.” “We will have a joining almost every other day as there is a long queue of leaders wanting to join us. The joining will be done at various levels, at regional level, state level and several leaders would be joining in Delhi too,” Daya Shankar said. The BJP has set up a joining committee to vet new inductions. The committee comprises veterans and is headed by former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai with deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma and Daya Shankar as members.Reacting to the poaching of its MLCs, SP leader IP Singh said: “BJP has little to call its own. They have appropriated leaders from other parties. But now even this tactic won’t work as people are waiting to vote them out.”“By the way, there are many in the BJP waiting to join us,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/four-sp-mlcs-join-bjp-ahead-of-2022-uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls-101637166055662.html

18-11-2021||World||Joe Biden plans to skip January’s World Economic Forum in Davos: Report||President Joe Biden plans to skip January’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a gathering of global political and economic elites that many of his predecessors also chose not to attend.Biden will instead dispatch administration officials to meetings at the Swiss ski resort, according to two people familiar with the matter. In past years when a U.S. president hasn’t attended, the delegation has included senior officials who work on economic issues and trade.White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Biden’s decision to skip the meetings marks a departure from former President Donald Trump’s approach. Trump went twice while in office, in 2018 and 2020, breaking a long-running string of absences by U.S. presidents. He’d planned to go in 2019 but canceled that trip due to a partial U.S. government shutdown.Barack Obama, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush never attended during their presidencies. Bill Clinton went once as president, in 2000, to mark the 30th anniversary of the gathering, though he’s attended regularly since leaving office. The in-person event is scheduled for Jan. 17-21 and is intended “to address economic, environmental, political and social fault lines exacerbated by the pandemic,” the organizers have said. A Davos meeting was held virtually earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-plans-to-skip-january-s-world-economic-forum-in-davos-report-101637259822272.html
18-11-2021||World||France bans wild circus animals and mink farms||The French parliament voted Thursday to end wild animals being used in live circus shows and outlawed mink farming, in new animal-rights legislation hailed as a step forward by campaigners.Performances of wild animals such as lions, tigers or bears will be prohibited in two years, and owning them outlawed in seven years, under the wide-ranging law that has been under debate since 2020.The new regulations, once signed into law by President Emmanuel Macron, will also ban live dolphin shows and mink farming, meaning the country's last mink producer will close.Macron's centrist Republic on the Move (LREM) party called the legislation "a historic step in the animal rights combat," while former actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot welcomed "a major advance".Circus owners denounced it, however, while some campaigners said it did not go far enough.As well as the measures targeting circuses, the new law will raise the maximum penality for mistreating animals to up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($85,000), and will tighten restrictions on the sale of pets.Loic Dombreval, the LREM co-sponsor of the law, conceded that other controversial issues had not been included within the scope of the legislation, which won cross-party support in both houses of parliament."There will inevitably come a day when... we will debate sensitive issues such as hunting, such as bull-fighting, or some animal-rearing practices," said the lawmaker, who is also a veterinarian.Broad supportPolls show that a vast majority of French people support the ban on wild circus animals, and dozens of cities and towns around the country already bar them.Public opinion in Europe has moved decisively against animal circuses, once a popular form of family entertainment, following revelations about cruel treatment and campaigning from rights groups.Several events in France in recent years have added momentum for the ban, including the death of a sickly performing bear called Mischa in 2019 that had been rescued from animal trainers, as well as the shooting of an escaped tiger in Paris in 2017.The tigress, named Mevy, escaped from her enclosure at the Cirque Bormann-Moreno and began roaming the streets of the French capital before being gunned down by her owner in the name of public safety.France lags behind around 20 European countries that have either banned or heavily restricted the use of animals for entertainment already.Arbitrary lawEnvironmentalists and more radical animal rights groups had wanted the new law to improve the conditions inside industrial animal farms.The group L214, which had sought protections for the "more than a billion intensely farmed animals" in France, welcomed the legislation but said it "lacked courage".The group has made a name for itself in France by sending its activists undercover into abattoirs and then publishing videos of the often shocking scenes of animals being mistreated or cut up while still alive.Farms that make foie gras pate in France -- which force-feed birds such as geese and ducks to artificially bloat their livers -- have also long been targeted by campaigners, but their operations will not be changed by the new law.Hunting is staunchly defended by supporters as a traditional rural pastime that is essential to keep animal populations under control, while bull-fighting remains part of local culture in some southern French towns.The 120 circus owners in France are likely to protest against the new restrictions and have warned that some animals might end up abandoned."It's an arbitrary law because there are not mistreated animals in our circuses," William Kerwich, head of the circus animal trainers' union, told AFP.He said there would be a reaction from his members on Monday, and a legal appeal.The new legislation also bans the use of wild animals in television shows, nightclubs and private parties.The French fur industry has fought a dogged rearguard action in recent years against the ban on mink farms and luxury fashion houses going fur-free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-bans-wild-circus-animals-and-mink-farms-101637257337645.html
18-11-2021||World||US’ ‘country of particular concern’ list: Pak terms inclusion ‘arbitrary’||Pakistan rejected the US’ designation of the nation as ‘country of particular concern’ on Thursday and termed the assessment ‘arbitrary’. Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson Asim Iftikhar Ahmed said that the assessment was completely against the ‘realities on the ground’.The United States on Wednesday designated Pakistan, China, Iran, North Korea and Myanmar as nations of particular concern for violating religious freedom. “I am designating Burma (Myanmar), the People’s Republic of China, Eritrea, Iran, the DPRK, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan as Countries of Particular Concern for having engaged in or tolerated systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Wednesday.It also designated the Taliban as ‘Entity of Particular Concern’ along with al-Shabab, Boko Haram, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Houthis, ISIS, ISIS-Greater Sahara, ISIS-West Africa, Jamaat Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin.Pakistan said that Blinken’s statement raised issues on the credibility of the assessment. “Such subjective designations do not contribute towards promoting the cause of religious freedom worldwide,” Asim Iftikhar Ahmed said.Ahmed stressed that the Pakistani society was ‘multi-religious and pluralistic with a rich tradition of inter-faith harmony’. “Religious freedom and the protection of the rights of minorities are guaranteed by the constitution and ensured through a range of legislative, policy and administrative measures,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“We believe the redressal of the rising trend of intolerance, discrimination, xenophobia and Islamophobia requires global efforts based on the principles of cooperation and mutual understanding,” he further added.Pakistan faced criticism from several quarters over its treatment of minorities as well its actions on stopping the financing of terror operations from its soil. The nation also remained on the watchdog Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list for not being able to address issues related to terror financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-country-of-particular-concern-list-pak-terms-inclusion-arbitrary-101637253111046.html

IBM is developing automated order taking for McDonald's Corp drive-throughs.US restaurant staffing levels broadly are still at least 10% lower than before the pandemic, helping boost margins, said Rabobank analyst Tom Bailey."You'd see some of the digital automation tools deployed to cover that 10% gap as they grow," he said.The pandemic pushed people to place more orders online for carry out, delivery and drive-through. To keep up, Starbucks shifted its development strategy to new store formats, adding pickup-only locations in urban areas, as well as traditional cafes and suburban drive-throughs.Starbucks and Amazon plan to open at least two more US locations together in 2022, said Kathryn Young, Starbucks' senior vice president of global growth and development.Starbucks baristas will make drinks and the rest of the chain's menu at the new location in New York City, which will have the same staffing level as any other Starbucks, she said.Customers can order through the Starbucks app and grab coffee to go from a counter near the door. Or they can use a credit card, Amazon app or Amazon One palm reader to enter the rest of the space, take snacks from shelves, or sit at tables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/starbucks-links-with-amazon-go-for-first-cashier-less-cafe-101637245432124.html
18-11-2021||World||China: President Xi Jinping’s works now available in Hindi||The first volume of President Xi Jinping’s “Governance in China”, which the state media claims has sold millions of copies globally, is now available in Hindi for the first time.It is rare to find the written works of Chinese leaders in Hindi except Mao Zedong’s, some of whose works including the “Little Red Book” had been translated into the language and widely read by far-left supporters in India.An event organised by the Communist Party of China (CPC), marking the publishing of Xi’s works in the languages of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states and dialogue partners, was held at the multilateral group’s secretariat in Beijing on Wednesday.Among the books that were unveiled were the first volume of “Xi Jinping: The Governance of China” in Hindi, Pashto, Dari, Sinhalese and Uzbek.The book is described by the Chinese government as a “collection of his major work and wisdom on experiences, policies and perspective of the entire Communist Party’s leadership, as well as vision for the future of the world’s most populous country, over the first two years in office.”The book has two more volumes. India is among the member countries of the SCO, having joined the group in 2017.The high-profile event was jointly supported by the CPC central committee’s publicity department and the state-run China International Publishing Group.Xi’s book comes in three separate volumes and has been translated into dozens of foreign languages and made available across the world.It’s part of the ruling party’s sustained efforts to build Xi’s personality globally even as he has fully cemented his power within China, becoming one of its most powerful leaders ever.The CPC wrapped up a key meeting last week, adopting a rare resolution on the party’s history, strengthening Xi’s stature, legacy and future as he looks to secure a precedent-breaking third-term as the country’s leader in late 2022.The use of the SCO Secretariat platform to release the book in multiple languages also gives the CPC’s driven propaganda machinery a chance to gradually access people in 21 countries including its members, three observer countries and nine - including three new - dialogue partners. Iran is transitioning from an observer to full member status.“The works by Xi, general secretary of the CPC central committee, open a window for the SCO countries to understand the CPC and China in the new era,” Xu Lin, deputy head of the CPC central committee’s publicity department and director of the State Council Information Office (SCIO) said at the function, according to a report in the news agency, Xinhua.SCO secretary-general Vladimir Norov and diplomats from Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Sri Lanka, among others, attended the event, the Xinhua report said.According to SCIO, which is the information office of the State Council, China’s cabinet, said in a report that the first volume had sold over 500,000 copies overseas since the foreign language versions were launched in September 2014.“Overall, the book has circulated 6.42mn copies in 24 versions and 21 languages across 160 countries and regions in the world. It is the most popular book by a Chinese leader since the reform and opening up in 1978,” the SCIO said in a report in 2017, probably careful in not comparing it to Mao’s works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-president-xi-jinping-s-works-now-available-in-hindi-101637244542210.html
18-11-2021||World||Taiwan deploys first advanced F-16V fighter squadron||Taiwan held a ceremony on Thursday to commission the first squadron of its most advanced F-16 fighter, a US-made jet that will strengthen the island's defences against threats by China.President Tsai Ing-wen oversaw the ceremony at an air base in the southern city of Chiayi alongside Sandra Oudkirk, Washington's de facto ambassador to Taiwan."This represents the steadfast promise of the Taiwan-US partnership," Tsai said. "I trust that in holding fast to democratic values, there will definitely be more countries with similar values who will stand with us on this front."The F-16V is an upgraded and much more sophisticated version of Taiwan's other ageing F-16 fighters which date back to the 1990s. The island also has French-made Mirage jets and its own indigenous warplane.A fourth-generation multi-role fighter, the F-16V boasts more advanced radar systems as well as more sophisticated weaponry, navigation and electronic warfare systems.It is however less advanced than fifth-generation fighters like China's J-20, Russia's Su-57 as well as the US-made F-22 and F-35 warplanes.Taiwan is in the middle of upgrading 141 older F-16s to make them the V version and has also ordered 66 new F-16Vs.The deployment of the first squadron comes at a time of soaring tensions between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan's fate.The self-ruled democracy of 23 million is claimed by Beijing which has vowed to one day take the island, by force if needs.The ceremony prompted a fiery response from Beijing at a press briefing, with an official saying "China opposes any official contact between the US and Taiwan".Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urged the United States not to send "wrong signals to separatist forces", adding that those supporting Taiwan's independence "have spared no effort to split the motherland and collude with foreign forces"."Their actions are akin to throwing an egg against a rock," he said.Chinese sabre-rattling has reached new heights under President Xi Jinping with Beijing sending record numbers of warplanes routinely crossing into Taiwan's air defence zone and state media regularly publicising invasion drills.In the last decade, China has built up its military to the point where Taiwanese and US military officials have publicly voiced fears it could soon pull off an invasion. Washington diplomatically recognises Beijing over Taiwan.But it opposes any attempt to change Taiwan's status by force and is bound by an act of Congress to help the island maintain its own defences.The F-16V deal was approved by the administration of Donald Trump as he feuded with China on a host of issues but his successor Joe Biden has maintained similar support for Taipei.Maintaining Taiwan's defences has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington.

18-11-2021||World||Europe should not blame Russia for 'all problems': Kremlin||The Kremlin said Thursday that Europe should not blame Russia for "all problems", as tensions with the West simmer over Ukraine and the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border."Russia has an interest in everybody in Europe finally coming to their senses and stopping considering Russia the culprit of all problems," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.He added that Europe should instead "address the primary sources of the problems that are currently suffocating Europe".His remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any "military adventurism" on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland."Recently there have been a lot of hysterical publications in Britain," Peskov said."Russia is not waging any hybrid wars," he added.Later on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address a foreign ministry meeting with "detailed" remarks, Peskov said.NATO and Western governments have denounced a build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, which has been fighting a war with pro-Russia separatists in its east since 2014.Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion.Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, said Thursday it was seeking more military aid from the West.Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border."Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks," Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing.Ukraine seeks more Western armsThe minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels "work is underway to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia".He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for "the supply of additional defence weapons for our army".Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering.In a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Putin said US-led exercises in the Black Sea were "provocative" and were "increasing tensions" between Moscow and NATO.According to the Elysee, Macron told Putin that France was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity.Some Western governments have also accused Moscow of helping orchestrate the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border.Several thousand migrants -- mostly from the Middle East -- have been staying in makeshift camps on the border in hopes of entering the EU.Brussels has accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of luring the migrants to the border as revenge for sanctions against his regime over last year's crackdown on protests.Lukashenko and the Kremlin have rejected the accusations and criticised the EU for not taking in the migrants.The Belarusian strongman has twice spoken by telephone this week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his first direct contacts with a Western leader since last year's disputed presidential election.The Kremlin -- Lukashenko's main political and financial backer -- has welcomed "direct" contacts between Belarus and EU officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-should-not-blame-russia-for-all-problems-kremlin-101637241574569.html
18-11-2021||World||Israel defence minister's cleaner charged with spying for Iran||A man employed in the home of Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz was charged Thursday with attempting to spy for the Black Shadow hackers, who are purportedly linked to Iran.According to the indictment published by Israel's justice ministry, Omri Goren Gorochovsky, a 37-year-old resident of the central city of Lod, was arrested on November 4.An arrest warrant for Gorochovsky said he had an extensive criminal history, including five convictions and prison time served for various offences including bank robbery, raising questions as to how he was hired to work in the home of one of Israel's top security officials.In a separate statement, the Shin Bet domestic security agency said Gorochovsky never gained access to "classified materials" and therefore did not successfully share state secrets.Gorochovsky and his partner worked as cleaners in Gantz's home in Rosh Haayin outside Tel Aviv, the indictment says.Late last month, the Black Shadow hackers claimed a cyberattack targeting an Israeli internet service provider which attracted widespread media attention.In Gorochovsky's charge sheet, Black Shadow is described as "affiliated to Iran".Following the high-profile cyberattack, Gorochovsky allegedly contacted Black Shadow via Telegram on or about October 31 with an offer to pass information from Gantz's home.Using a false name, Israel says the suspect "identified himself as someone working in the home of the Israeli minister of defence, and noted his ability to assist the group in various ways".According to the charge sheet, Gorochovsky told a Black Shadow representative that for a "monetary sum" he would convey information via malware that he proposed implanting with a USB device.Family photosTo prove his credibility, the indictment says, Gorochovsky sent photographs of various items in the minister's house.Those included Gantz's work desk, a package with a sticker that contained an IP address, mementoes from Gantz's previous role as Israel's armed forces chief of staff, family photos and a property tax payment receipt.The Shin Bet said the espionage attempt was quickly thwarted, with Gorochovsky arrested just days after he reached out to Black Shadow.The hacking group, which has not acknowledged any link to Israel's arch foe Iran, has been blamed for multiple attacks on Israel's internet infrastructure.In the most recent case, it obtained the database of the largest Israeli LGBTQ dating site and released sensitive personal data, including HIV status, about as many as a million users.The group has also penetrated an Israeli insurance firm, stealing a trove of data and leaking it when its demand for a ransom was not met.Black Shadow hacks are part of a years-long covert war between Israel and Iran including physical attacks on ships and offensive cyber moves online.The Shin Bet said it had also launched an investigation "in order to reduce the chances of recurrence of these kinds of incidents in the future".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-defence-minister-s-cleaner-charged-with-spying-for-iran-101637240656445.html

18-11-2021||World||UK to hold public inquiry into woman's Novichok poisoning||Britain said on Thursday it would hold a public inquiry into the death of a woman who was killed by the Novichok nerve agent following the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal three years ago.Dawn Sturgess died from exposure to Novichok in July 2018 after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which police believe had been used by Russian intelligence operatives to smuggle the poison into the country.Skripal, who sold Russian secrets to Britain, and his daughter Yulia were found slumped unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury four months earlier.They and a police officer who went to Skripal's house were left critically ill in hospital from exposure to the military-grade nerve agent.While British prosecutors have charged three Russians, who they say are GRU military intelligence officers, in absentia over the attack on Skripal and his daughter, no formal case has been brought against them over the death of Sturgess, 44."This is an important step in ensuring that the family of Dawn Sturgess get the answers they need," Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said in a statement announcing the public inquiry, to be led by Heather Hallett, a retired senior judge."The government is establishing an inquiry after careful consideration of advice from Baroness Hallett that this is necessary to permit all relevant evidence to be heard," Patel said.Britain says the attempt on Skripal's life was ordered by figures high up in the Russian state, and the incident caused the biggest East-West diplomatic expulsions since the Cold War.Russia has denied any involvement, casting the accusations as anti-Russian propaganda.In September, British police charged the third suspect Sergey Fedotov with conspiracy to murder Skripal, a former GRU officer himself, and attempting to kill him, his daughter Yulia and the police officer.Two other Russians, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, were charged with the same offences three years ago.In 2016, another British public inquiry concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin had probably approved a Russian intelligence operation to murder ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210.Two Russians, acting on orders probably directed by Russia’s Federal Security Service, poisoned Litvinenko, an outspoken critic of Putin who fled Russia for Britain, with green tea laced with the radioactive isotope at a plush London hotel, that inquiry concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-hold-public-inquiry-into-woman-s-novichok-poisoning-101637239628419.html
18-11-2021||World||Air pollution may lead to increased risk of developing Covid-19: Study||Long-term exposure to air pollution may lead to an increased risk of developing the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) among people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, according to a recent study. Though the research was conducted in Spain, its results have been published at a time when several cities in India are in the grip of severe air pollution.For the exercise, the researchers tested 9605 participants, of whom 481 (or 5 per cent) were Covid-19 positive. The participants were measured for a series of virus-specific antibodies, with information already available to the researchers on the long-term exposure of such individuals to air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), small particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon and ozone.For a number of volunteers within the total study population, the team was able to establish an association between higher exposure to NO2/PM2.5 and the viral illness, particularly for severe cases that resulted in the patient being hospitalised and, in some cases, being sent to intensive care.In particular, the association with PM2.5 was found to be stronger among men aged 60 and above, as well as people living in socio-economically deprived areas, the researchers said.Speaking on the study, Manolis Kogevinas, its lead author, said, “These results are in line with the association between air pollution and hospitalisation described for other respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and influenza. We have provided the strongest evidence globally on the association of ambient air pollution and Covid-19.”The results of the study were published in the journal Environment Health Perspectives on Wednesday. These provide further evidence on the health benefits of reducing air pollution, and highlight the influence of environmental factors on infectious diseases, the researchers said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-pollution-may-lead-to-increased-risk-of-developing-covid-19-study-101637237275517.html
18-11-2021||World||India, China agree to ease military standoff in eastern Ladakh||India and China agreed on Thursday to ease the ongoing military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh by shifting from emergency response to “normalised control” of the disputed boundary, a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry said.The two sides have agreed to “consolidate” the results in the areas where troop disengagement has taken place and prepare for and hold the 14th round of military talks soon, the ministry said.The statement was issued after the 23rd round of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs held via video link on Thursday.There was no mention in the Chinese statement of disengagement of troops from the remaining areas of friction such as Depsang and Hot Springs. The two sides have been locked in a military standoff for more than 18 months with bilateral ties plummeting to its worst in decades.“The two sides expressed that in accordance with the consensus spirit of the Dushanbe meeting between the two foreign ministers, they will continue to work hard to further ease the border situation and strive to shift from emergency response to normalised control as soon as possible,” the Chinese foreign ministry statement said.The shift from “emergency response” to “normalised control” was a repeat of what state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had told external affairs minister, S Jaishankar during a meeting in Dushanbe in September. “The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the recent situation in the China-India border area, and agreed to consolidate the existing disengagement results, strictly abide by the agreements and consensus reached between the two sides, and avoid recurrences in the current situation,” the statement said.“The two sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels, actively prepare for the 14th round of military commander-level talks, and make efforts to resolve the remaining issues in the western section of the China-India border,” the Chinese statement added.The last round of military talks between India and China in October had stalled after Beijing said New Delhi had made “unreasonable and unrealistic demands”.The meeting between India’s Ladakh corps commander and China’s South Xinjiang military district commander had taken place on the Chinese side of the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point.A brief statement issued by China’s western theatre command (WTC) and published by several state-run media outlets gave little details of the talks but struck a critical note.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-agree-to-ease-military-standoff-in-eastern-ladakh-101637236923349.html

The UK submarines are scrambling to recover the next-generation F35 jet from the bottom of the sea before Russia could find it, the report said.Britain's ministry of defence earlier said that the jet crashed in an undisclosed location in the Mediterranean Sea, with the pilot safely ejecting and returning to the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. Without providing further details, the ministry said that an official probe was launched into the incident."A British F35 pilot from HMS Queen Elizabeth ejected during routine flying operations in the Mediterranean this morning," a spokesperson for the defence ministry said."The pilot has been safely returned to the ship and an investigation has begun, so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."The report suggests that the operation involving divers and miniature submarines to recover the jet in shrouded in secrecy as the radar of F35s is hugely sensitive which allows the jet to fly "unseen" in hostile territory and could be valuable for Russia.The multi-role fighter is capable of evading the enemy by flying undetected and entering contested airspace. It can provide close air support, carry out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions due to its advanced electronic warfare system. The stealth jets also serve as an information and communications gateway, sharing their operational picture with the ground, sea and air assets, according to Lockheed Martin.The F35s, onboard the 3 billion-pound HMS Queen Elizabeth, previously participated in strikes against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, according to news agencies.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-submarines-divers-in-race-against-russia-to-find-crashed-f35-fighter-jet-report-101637219803224.html
18-11-2021||World||#MeToo: WTA casts doubt over email attributed to tennis star Peng||The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) said it has doubts about the authenticity of the email released by Chinese state media attributed to tennis player Peng Shuai, who has not been seen or heard in public since making a sexual assault allegation against a top former Communist Party of China (CPC) official. China’s official broadcaster CCTV’s English channel, CGTN, early on Thursday tweeted an email allegedly from Peng, in which the sports star says she is well and safe. She also goes on to deny the allegations of against former CPC politburo standing committee member, Zhang Gaoli.“Hello, everyone this is Peng Shuai. Regarding the recent news released on the official website of the WTA, the content has not been confirmed or verified by myself and it was released without my consent,” the email says.“The news in that release, including the allegation of sexual assault, is not true. I’m not missing, nor am I unsafe. I’ve just been resting at home and everything is fine. Thank you again for caring about me. If the WTA publishes any more news about me, please verify it with me, and release it with my consent.“As a professional tennis player, I thank you all for your companionship and consideration. I hope to promote Chinese tennis with you all if I have the chance in the future. I hope Chinese tennis will become better and better. Once again, thank you for your consideration,” Peng writes in the email.Earlier this month, Peng, 35, a former Chinese world number one in doubles tennis, had accused former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, 75, of coercing her into having sex and subsequently continuing an on-and-off secret relationship with her for years.Peng’s allegations against Zhang, made in an emotional post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo, was the first #MeToo allegation against a top CPC leader. The vice-premier was among the seven members of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China, between 2013 and 2018, under President Xi Jinping.Peng’s post was swiftly deleted and there’s been no news about her from the time.Reacting to Peng’s letter published by CGTN, Steve Simon, chairman of the WTA, said in a statement he had a “hard time believing” the email was written by Peng.“The statement released today by Chinese state media concerning Peng Shuai only raises my concerns as to her safety and whereabouts,” Smith said in a statement. “I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her.”“Peng Shuai displayed incredible courage in describing an allegation of sexual assault against a former top official in the Chinese government. The WTA and the rest of the world need independent and verifiable proof that she is safe. I have repeatedly tried to reach her via numerous forms of communication, to no avail,” he added.“Peng Shuai must be allowed to speak freely, without coercion or intimidation from any source. Her allegation of sexual assault must be respected, investigated with full transparency and without censorship,” the WTA chief wrote.“The voices of women need to be heard and respected, not censored nor dictated to,” Smith said.Besides the WTA, tennis stars like Naomi Osaka have voiced concerns about Peng’s whereabouts and well-being.“I was recently informed of a fellow tennis player that has gone missing shortly after revealing that she has been sexually abused,” Ms Osaka tweeted with the hashtag #WhereisPengShuai.“I hope Peng Shuai and her family are safe and ok. I’m in shock at the current situation and I’m sending love and light her way,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/metoo-wta-casts-doubt-over-email-attributed-to-tennis-star-peng-101637220540977.html

The two always said they were innocent and offered alibis. No physical evidence linked them to the crime.Malcolm X gained national prominence as the voice of the Nation of Islam, speaking about the importance of Black people claiming their civil rights “by any means necessary" in his highly visible role with the Black Muslim organization.But he later split with the group and, after a trip to Mecca, started speaking about the potential for racial unity. It earned him the ire of some in the Nation of Islam, who saw him as a traitor.Aziz was released in 1985. Islam was released two years later and died in 2009. Both continued to press to clear their names.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-men-convicted-in-malcom-x-s-assassination-to-be-exonerated-today-101637219719372.html

The next full Moon, known as the Beaver, Frost/Frosty, or Snow Moon, is celebrated in many countries as Kartik Purnima, Karthikai Vilakkidu, Thrikarthika, Loi Krathong, Bon Om Touk, and Tazaungdaing.The lunar eclipse will occur on Friday for much of the Earth, except Alaska's time zone westward to the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean where it will take place on Thursday night. According to Nasa, it will be the longest partial lunar eclipse of the century as the Moon will slip into Earth's shadow for a couple of hours.The duration of the partial lunar eclipse will be about 3 hours and 28 minutes.Lunar Eclipse 2021: Date, time and all that you need to knowNasa executive Gordon Johnston said in a blog post that slight dimming of the Moon will not be noticeable until the Earth’s full shadow begins falling on the upper part of the Moon at 2.18am EST. The near-total eclipse will reach its peak at around 4.03am when over 97% of the Moon will be in full shadow. Johnston added that only a small sliver of the left side of the Moon will shine in the partial shadow of the Earth.In India, the lunar eclipse, or the Chandra Grahan, will start at 12.48pm IST and end at 4.17pm IST. The eclipse will reach its peak around 2.24pm. People in the northeastern part of India will be able to watch this eclipse and won't be visible from the other parts of the country.The full shadow of the Earth is not black due to the planet’s atmosphere."This should be a good month for skywatching, with Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn in the evening sky, a potentially visible comet, and one of the best meteor showers of the year!"

Briefing on the Afghanistan situation following the Taliban’s takeover, Deborah Lyons, UN special representative for Afghanistan, told the UN Security Council that the Taliban “appears to rely heavily on extra-judicial detentions and killings” in its response against suspected Islamic State-Khorasan members.“Another major negative development has been the Taliban’s inability to stem the expansion of the Islamic State in Iraq and in Levant Khorasan Province. Once limited to a few provinces and Kabul, ISILKP now seems to be present in nearly all provinces and increasingly active,” Lyons told the Council.IS-K, a sworn enemy of the Taliban, has been responsible for a suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August and recent multiple bombings in Shia mosques.The UN envoy said the Taliban’s “genuine effort” to present itself as a government are partly constrained by the “lack of resources and capacity”, as well as a “political ideology that clashes with contemporary international norms of governance.” She also highlighted “serious internal division” in the Taliban set-up as an impediment to establishing full trust with much of the Afghan population and convincing them of their capacity to govern.The Taliban’s broader acceptance among the Afghan population has been a cause of concern as the all-male cabinet is largely made of Sunni Pashtuns. The international community has been repeatedly calling for a more inclusive government where women and ethnic minorities get enough representation.“Ultimately, however, the Taliban must decide on whether to govern according to the needs and the rights of the diverse Afghan population, or whether to rule on the basis of a narrow ideology and an even narrower ethnic base,” Lyons added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-expanding-to-nearly-all-afghan-provinces-warns-un-envoy-101637199809017.html

18-11-2021||World||State of emergency in British Columbia; more deaths expected||The Canadian Pacific coast province of British Columbia declared a state of emergency Wednesday following floods and mudslides caused by extremely heavy rainfall, and officials said they expected to find more dead.Every major route between the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, where Canada's third largest city of Vancouver is, and the interior of the province has been cut by washouts, flooding or landslides following record-breaking rain across southern British Columbia between Saturday and Monday. The body of a woman was recovered from one of the mudslides late Monday.“Torrential rains have led to terrible flooding that has disrupted the lives and taken lives of people across B.C. I want people to know that the federal government has been engaging with the local authorities,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in Washington. “We're sending resources like the Canadian Armed Forces to support people but also we'll be there for the cleanup and the rebuilding after impacts of these extreme weather events.”The federal government said it is sending the air force to assist with evacuations and to support supply lines.Military helicopters already helped evacuate about 300 people from one highway where people were trapped in their cars Sunday night following a mudslide,“We expect to confirm even more fatalities in the coming days,” British Columbia Premier John Horgan said.Horgan called it a once in a 500 year event. He said the state of emergency will include travel restrictions so the transport of essential goods medical and emergency services will reach the communities that need them. He asked people not to hoard goods.“These are very challenging times. I've been at this dais for two years now talking about challenging times we have faced — unprecedented challenges with public health, wildfires, heat domes and now debilitating floods that we have never seen before,” Horgan said.Horgan said over the past six months there have been drought conditions in Merritt, where the river was at its lowest point in living memory and where people had to be evacuated because of wildfires in temperatures that were unprecedented. And now, he said, much of the community is under water.The weather events are all connected and can be attributed to climate change, said John Clague, a professor in the Earth Sciences Department at Simon Fraser University.“Scientists are now saying these particular events, they’re becoming more frequent, exacerbated or ramped up by climate change,” he said.The record temperatures in the summer set the stage for the wildfires, said Clague. The fires burned the ground in a way that prevents water from seeping into the soil. He said that resulted in the water from the torrential rains pouring more quickly into steams and rivers, causing floods.The total number of people and vehicles unaccounted for had not yet been confirmed near the town of Lillooet. Investigators had received reports of two other people who were missing but added that other motorists might have been buried in a slide on Highway 99.Elsewhere in the province, Abbotsford Mayor Henry Braun said residents of the low-lying Sumas Prairie area south of the city face a significant risk to life and must get out immediately.An evacuation order was issued for about 1,000 properties Tuesday as flooding linked to a severe weekend rainstorm pushed up water levels in the area which is home to many large dairy farms and other agricultural and livestock operations.Braun said in a news briefing Wednesday that conditions were dire overnight because a key pumping station was in danger of being overwhelmed. The station was the only thing keeping water from the nearby Fraser River from engulfing most of the Sumas Prairie flats, he said.“Right now, things are holding steady,” Braun said of the situation at the Barrowtown Pump Station. Crews spent Tuesday night sandbagging around the station.“I’m feeling much better today than last night,” he said, although he cautioned the danger has not passed and river levels, which have dropped two meters since the storm ended, must drop further before flood gates can be opened to allow even more water to escape.Abbotsford Fire Chief Darren Lee said about 180 rescues were completed Tuesday and early Wednesday as trapped residents asked for help to leave their flooded properties.“Overnight we actually brought in additional helicopters when we realized the flooding was worsening in the east Prairie area,” he said. Three helicopters carried people to safety overnight, said Lee, while 11 teams in boats also brought out trapped residents.No one was unaccounted for, Abbotsford Police Chief Mike Serr said.About 80 callers were still awaiting help by daylight and responders planned to “work through the queue” through the morning, he said.Agriculture Minister Lana Popham said thousands of animals had died and the province was rushing to get veterinarians to other animals that are in danger.``I can also tell you that many farmers attempted to move animals and then had to walk away because the roads were disappearing beneath them,″ she said.A trade expert said the loss of major transportation routes will hurt the movement of goods both in and out Canada’s largest port in Vancouver.“Vancouver really has an outsized role to play in our Pacific trade,” said Werner Antweiler, an associate professor at the UBC Sauder School of Business. “Commodities will be impacted in a much more significant way because it’s coming by rail or coming by big trucks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/state-of-emergency-in-british-columbia-more-deaths-expected-101637191729011.html
18-11-2021||World||Twenty-five civilians killed in Niger's lawless west||Suspected jihadists killed 25 civilians in Niger in a lawless desert region near the border with Mali, local officials said on Wednesday.Niger, the world's poorest country by the benchmark of the UN's Human Development Index, faces jihadist insurgencies both on its western flank abutting Mali and Burkina Faso and in the southeast on the border with Nigeria.An interior ministry statement said the attack on Tuesday in the town of Bakorat in the vast Tahoua desert region bordering Mali had killed 25 people, wounded one more, and scorched two vehicles.In another attack on Temaram in the same region, "unidentified armed individuals" also ransacked the town hall and a health centre, and plundered two money transfer shops, the ministry added.It said a security sweep was ongoing in those areas.Two officials earlier said 10 civilians were killed in the clash in Bakorat, which one of them said pitted the gunmen against a self-defence militia in Bakorat.The Air Info newspaper cited a survivor as saying, "The assailants arrived... aboard six 4x4s preceded by several motorbikes."Tuesday's deadly attack was just the latest in the area, where self-defence militias have sprung up in recent weeks.On November 5, 11 soldiers were killed and nine were reported missing following a jihadist attack on an army position in Dagne, in the vast Tillaberi region.The soldiers targeted had been deployed to ensure the safety of the thousands of villagers who had returned to their communities after yet more killings just three days earlier.That assault on the village of Adab-Dab, also in Tillaberi region, killed at least 69 people, including a local mayor.'Innocent people' The insurgency in the west of the country of 25 million people began in 2015, escalating in 2017 with massacres carried out by groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.Human Rights Watch estimated in August that more than 420 civilians had been killed since the start of the year in western Niger.On January 2, 100 people were killed in attacks on two villages.The massacre, one of the worst in the history of the former French colony, occurred between two rounds of the country's presidential election.In March, 141 members of the Tuareg community were massacred in Tahoua.In September, President Mohamed Bazoum, making his first visit to the region since being elected in February, said the attacks on "unarmed innocent people" were a sign the jihadists were losing ground against the army.But on October 20, 11 members of the National Guard and a gendarme were killed in an ambush on a regional prefect's motorcade in the Bankilare district.In early October the UN warned that the Tillaberi region was facing a "major food crisis", with almost 600,000 people exposed to food insecurity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twentyfive-civilians-killed-in-niger-s-lawless-west-101637185375461.html
18-11-2021||World||15 shot dead in crackdown on Sudan anti-coup protests||Sudanese security forces shot dead at least 15 anti-coup protesters and wounded dozens more on Wednesday, medics said, in the bloodiest day since the military's October 25 takeover.The fatalities -- all in Khartoum, especially its northern districts -- raised to 39 the death toll from unrest since the military seized power, a pro-democracy doctors' union said. Hundreds more have been wounded."The day's massacre reinforces our slogans: no negotiations, no partnership, no compromise" with the military, said protest organisers from the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA).Demonstrators had taken to the streets across the capital even though telephone lines and internet services had been disrupted since the military took over, AFP journalists reported."The people choose civilian rule," demonstrators chanted, also shouting slogans against Sudan's ruler, top general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.The demonstrators, mostly young men and women, clapped hands and ululated before the scene turned violent.As clashes broke out, the security forces also fired tear gas, injuring several more protesters, witnesses said.Police have denied using live ammunition and state television announced an investigation into the deaths.The doctors' union said most of the casualties had suffered gunshot wounds to "the head, neck or torso", but added that the demonstrators, undeterred and behind makeshift barricades, kept up their protests.Demonstrations also erupted in Port Sudan, an AFP journalist said, against the coup which halted a democratic transition that followed the 2019 toppling of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir."It was a very bad day for the protesters," Soha, a 42-year-old protester, told AFP. "I saw a person with gunshot wounds behind me and there were a lot of arrests" in Khartoum.Demonstrations after nightfall Hundreds remained on the streets after nightfall, especially in northern Khartoum where tear gas fire reached inside hospitals, doctors said. Rallies in other cities dispersed.Efforts to stem the protests have seen hundreds arrested, including activists, passers-by and journalists. Qatari network Al Jazeera's bureau chief was arrested Sunday and released Tuesday.The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors has said security forces have also arrested injured people inside Khartoum hospitals.The SPA, an umbrella of unions instrumental in the 2019 protests, denounced "immense crimes against humanity" and accused the security forces of "premeditated killings".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Sudan's military the country stood to regain badly needed international aid if it restored the "legitimacy" of civilian government.Washington has suspended some $700 million in assistance to Sudan since the coup."If the military puts this train back on its tracks and does what's necessary, I think the support that has been very strong from the international community can resume," said Blinken.Prior to 2019, Sudan had been under some form of military dictatorship for much of its modern history.US shuttle diplomacy Burhan has declared a state of emergency, ousted the government and detained the civilian leadership, derailing a transition to full civilian rule and drawing international condemnation.He insists the military's move "was not a coup".US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee has been shuttling between the generals and the ousted civilian government in a bid to broker a way out of the crisis.Phee has called for the reinstatement of ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who is effectively under house arrest.The few remaining free members of his cabinet continue to describe themselves as the "legitimate" government and refuse to negotiate with the military leaders.While some of the civilian leaders have been freed since the power grab, new ones have been arrested.Burhan last week announced a new Sovereign Council, the highest transitional authority, with himself as chief and all nine military members keeping their posts.Its four civilian members were replaced.Burhan has also removed a clause in the transitional constitutional declaration that mentions the Forces for Freedom and Change, the key group behind the protests that toppled Bashir.He has continued to promise elections will go ahead as planned in 2023, reiterating to Phee on Tuesday that his actions aimed to "correct the trajectory of the revolution".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/15-shot-dead-in-crackdown-on-sudan-anti-coup-protests-101637183323702.html
18-11-2021||World||Canada sends military to flood-ravaged Pacific coast||Canada is sending the military to help evacuate and support communities hit by "extreme flooding" after record rainfall on the Pacific coast, the government said Wednesday.Downpours in British Columbia this week trapped motorists in mudslides that left at least one dead and two missing, forced thousands to flee their homes, and cut off Vancouver and its port."In response to extreme flooding across Southern BC, we have approved the deployment of @CanadianForces air support personnel to assist with evacuation efforts, support supply chain routes, and protect residents against floods and landslides," Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said on Twitter.A spokesperson told AFP the military was still sorting out the details of the deployment.In Washington, ahead of a meeting with his US and Mexican counterparts, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the rains caused "historical and terrible flooding that has disrupted the lives and taken lives of people across B.C."He pledged federal support, saying: "We'll be there for the cleanup and the rebuilding after the impacts of these extreme weather events."Airlifted to safetyThe torrential rains had let up by Tuesday afternoon. An estimated 300 motorists trapped on highways by mudslides have been airlifted to safety and a few of a dozen evacuation orders have been rescinded.Meanwhile, searches continue for more possible victims, after police announced late Tuesday the recovery of a woman's body from a mudslide near Lillooet, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Vancouver.Television images showed several towns east of the Vancouver covered in mud and partially inundated, with residents now scrambling for food, heat and water -- as the first snow flurries of the season started to fall.On the outskirts of Vancouver, a large fire broke out at an RV dealership in the flooded Sumas Prairie, and farmers scrambled to pull livestock from the water.Abbotsford Mayor Henry Braun and emergency officials told a news conference almost 200 people had been airlifted overnight to safety, after the city of 162,000 warned a pump station was at risk of being overwhelmed due to the Nooksack River carrying a surge of water north from the United States.Most of the area is farmland created by draining Sumas Lake in the 1920s.The pump station, Braun said, "was never intended or designed to take on water from another country."Some highways, meanwhile, remain closed. As a result, motorists wanting to travel to or from Vancouver have to travel south to the United States and back up into Canada.Landslides also cut off rail traffic to and from Vancouver -- one of Canada's busiest freight sea ports.Across the province, people are reportedly finding grocery store shelves empty.Environment Canada said up to 250 millimetres (almost 10 inches) of rain -- what the region normally gets in a month -- fell Sunday and Monday in and around Vancouver, which was also hit last week by a rare tornado.The extreme weather comes after British Columbia suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed a town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sends-military-to-flood-ravaged-pacific-coast-101637174703559.html

Pakistan, Iran and UAE are among the other nations that have provided Afghanistan with food and medical supplies. More than half of the country’s nearly 40 million people are likely to face acute food shortage and nine million are already on brink of starvation, according to a recent World Food Program report. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan had said that his country would “favorably consider the request by Afghan brothers for transportation of wheat offered by India through Pakistan on exceptional basis,” in a statement after a Nov. 12 meeting with Afghanistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan officials Monday.Last month Pakistan had denied India’s request to send the wheat because of the fractious relationship between the two South Asian nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-allows-india-to-send-wheat-to-afghanistan-as-starvation-crisis-grows-101637156700610.html
18-11-2021||World||Maldives rejects ‘India Out’ campaign, describes India as ‘closest ally’||The Maldives government on Wednesday rejected what it said were attempts to spread “false information” through social media using the “India Out” slogan, and described India as the country’s “closest ally and trusted neighbour”.The government in Male issued a statement in response to a fresh campaign in the media and social media that alleged cooperation between the governments of the two countries is undermining the national security and sovereignty of the Maldives.The statement said the strong relationship between the Maldives and India is based on shared historical and cultural ties and matched by dynamic people-to-people contacts. “India has always been the Maldives’ closest ally and trusted neighbour, extending constant and consistent support to the people of Maldives on all fronts,” it said.Though the statement did not name anybody, it is believed opposition parties and a section of the media in the Maldives have been engaged in renewed efforts to whip up anti-India sentiments. The “India Out” slogan was first used on social media platforms last year.Recent media reports, especially in Dhiyares and its sister newspaper The Maldives Journal, have sought to create an impression that India is seeking to establish a military presence in the Maldives through ongoing security cooperation.The Maldives government’s statement coincided with the new Indian high commissioner, Munu Mahawar, presenting his credentials to President Ibrahim Solih at an official ceremony. Solih “highlighted that the Maldives and India share a special relationship and that no third nation can take India’s place”, according to a readout from the president’s office.Solih and the Indian envoy spoke about strengthening bilateral relations, especially in security cooperation, socio-economic development and climate change.The Maldives government’s statement said cooperation and support provided by India, specifically on issues of maritime security, is “aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership between the two countries and to ensure the safety and stability of the Indian Ocean region”.It added: “Support provided by India, on areas such as search and rescue capabilities, casualty evacuation, coastal surveillance, and maritime reconnaissance, directly benefit the Maldivian people. The Government of Maldives has also established partnerships with other countries in similar areas of cooperation, to enhance technical and strategic capacities.”Maldives defence minister Mariya Didi recently told Raajje TV that none of the Indian military personnel present on Maldivian soil “carry weapons” and their presence poses no risk to national sovereignty.The statement further noted that no country could tackle threats such as trans-border terrorism, piracy and narco-trafficking and non-traditional challenges such as climate change, cyber security and human trafficking without the support and cooperation of regional and international partners.The Maldives government also reiterated its gratitude for the assistance provided by India over the years, including during the 1988 mercenary attack on the country, the 2004 Asian tsunami, the 2015 Male water crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.Describing the false allegations regarding ties with India as misguided and unsubstantiated, the Maldives government these were the views of a “small group of individuals with the objective of tarnishing the country’s long-standing cordial ties with India”. The government urged all parties to refrain from spreading false information that undermines relations with neighbours, and called on media outlets to commit to professional standards of journalism in reporting such information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-rejects-india-out-campaign-describes-india-as-closest-ally-101637155614631.html
18-11-2021||India||India slams Pakistan for denying consular access to Jadhav||India on Thursday accused Pakistan of denying unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Indian death row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav and said a new Pakistani law to facilitate his right to appeal his death sentence contains shortcomings. The Pakistan government pushed through a bill during a joint session of the Parliament on Wednesday to help Jadhav appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court. The International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Act of 2021 is on the same lines as an ordinance issued last year to facilitate his right to appeal. “Pakistan continues to deny unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Shri Jadhav and has failed to create an atmosphere in which a fair trial can be conducted,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said while reacting to the Pakistani law. “The law simply codifies the shortcomings of the previous ordinance,” he added. Bagchi said Pakistan had enacted into law “the earlier ordinance that was ostensibly enacted to bring into effect the judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case”. “Nothing could have been further from the truth. As stated earlier, the ordinance did not create the machinery for an effective review and reconsideration of Shri Jadhav’s case as mandated by the judgement of the ICJ,” he said. India, Bagchi said, has repeatedly called on Pakistan to abide by the letter and spirit of the ICJ judgement. Experts have already said the new law will not make a material difference to Jadhav’s case and it was more about meeting legal requirements so that he could mount a proper appeal in Pakistani courts. The law allows a foreign national to file a petition in a Pakistani high court for review and reconsideration of a sentence given by a military court. After India approached the ICJ, the court said in its judgement that “Pakistan is under an obligation to provide, by means of its choosing, effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr Jadhav” given the violation of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of spying and sentenced to death the following year. India rejected the charges levelled against the formal navy officer and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-slams-pakistan-for-denying-consular-access-to-jadhav-101637257984526.html

The singer from the Pamaria community had come to the residence of a villager, Mampi Sarkar, who had given birth to two boys and a girl on October 29. The accused, Aulad Ali, after blessing the children demanded ₹1500, which the poor family was unable to produce. Ali refused to hand over one of the babies and was beating drums. The child died on his lap. Later, villagers assaulted the accused and handed him over to the police. He was arrested. “One of my sons was suffering from mouth ulcer. He also had fever. On Wednesday, a ‘Pamaria’ came to our house and took my son in his lap and started singing and dancing. Thereafter he demanded ₹1500 from us. We told him that we could not give more than ₹300, but he refused to take the amount and kept my son hostage for over three hours. I kept requesting him to hand my baby over to me but he refused to pay heed to my pleas. After three hours when I tried to breastfeed my son he didn’t open his mouth,” the woman said.. The accused, however, told the media, on the way to court, that he had kept the baby only for 5-10 minutes. “It is a baseless allegation that I kept the baby hostage for money. Local people thrashed me brutally after the death of the baby and snatched ₹5000 from me,” he said.Pamaria is a community which sings and dances at special occasions like weddings and child birth. “The accused has been arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by the Sarkar family. He has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder,” said a police officer of Manikchowk police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newborn-dies-after-being-held-hostage-in-bengal-village-pamaria-singer-arrested-101637255583087.html

18-11-2021||India||More evidence of China building villages in disputed areas along borders with India, Bhutan||Further evidence has emerged of China constructing villages in disputed sections of its borders with India and Bhutan, an activity believed to be part of Beijing’s efforts to bolster its claim on these regions. According to satellite imagery posted by the Twitter user who uses the handle @detresfa_, China has built at least four new villages nearly three to four kilometres within disputed territory along the border with Bhutan. These villages are in an area of about 100 sq km that is under Chinese occupation and located a short distance from Doklam, the region where Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in a faceoff for 73 days in 2017. Satellite imagery of the area from May 2020 showed no construction activity within the disputed region of about 100 sq km. However, satellite imagery of the same region from November this year showed four villages where construction work was still ongoing. The satellite imagery showed several rows of houses and new roads at all the four villages. Two of the villages are larger than the others, and all are located in mountainous terrain. Satellite imagery obtained by NDTV from Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs, two leading imagery providers, also showed a village with at least 60 buildings built by China in disputed territory along the border in Shi-Yomi district of Arunachal Pradesh. This is the second such village in a disputed region of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as “south Tibet”. It is located 93 km east of the first village with some 100 homes, whose existence was first reported by the media in January this year. Experts have contended the second village falls within Indian territorial claims. A report submitted on November 3 by the US department of defence to the US Congress said China had built the large 100-home village in disputed territory between the Tibet Autonomous Region and Arunachal Pradesh. The external affairs ministry responded to the US report last week by saying India has never accepted such “illegal occupation” of its territory and will takes all steps to safeguard the country’s sovereignty. The Indian side has stepped up the building of infrastructure, including roads and bridges, in border areas in the wake of China’s construction activities in regions it has illegally occupied over the decades, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on November 11. The construction of villages in disputed areas follows the upgrading and construction of Chinese military facilities, including heliports and missile bases, all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the aftermath of the 2017 standoff at Doklam. A report released last year by Stratfor, a leading security and intelligence consultancy, had said China has more than doubled the number of airbases, air defence positions and heliports near the LAC since 2017. China began building at least 13 new military facilities near the LAC after the Doklam standoff, and work on four heliports began after the faceoff in Ladakh began in May last year, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-evidence-of-china-building-villages-in-disputed-areas-along-borders-with-india-bhutan-101637254142996.html
18-11-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear plea against Rakesh Asthana’s appointment next week||The Supreme Court will hear next week a petition challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Commissioner of Delhi Police. On July 27, the 1984-batch IPS officer of Gujarat cadre was appointed Delhi Police Commissioner for a one year term with just four days remaining for his superannuation.A petition pending on this issue was taken up for hearing on Thursday before a bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna.The petitioner – Centre for Public Interest Litigation – represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan informed the court that a judgment on the same issue was delivered by the Delhi high court on October 12 upholding the appointment of Asthana. He requested that the CPIL petition was deferred by the top court on August 25 awaiting a decision by the high court. Bhushan requested the Court to consider his petition in the light of the October 12 order.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre objected to this suggestion and told the bench that once the high court had passed its decision, the CPIL petition will not be maintainable. Only an appeal against the high court order can be heard, Mehta added.He was supported by counsel for Asthana, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi who informed the Court that the appeal alone was sufficient to be heard and not the petition.The bench said, “We will not direct the petitioner to file an appeal. But to obviate technicality, would the petitioner not be well advised to also file an appeal against the HC judgment, so that in the final hearing this should not come in the way.”Bhushan agreed to file the appeal and said that this will only delay the hearing. The bench allowed the appeal to be filed by Monday and ordered the petition to come up for hearing with the fresh appeal on Friday.The petition questioned Asthana’s appointment on the ground that no panel of names was formed by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) as held by the Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case. Also, a clear direction to ensure a secured, two-year tenure for the DGP stood violated with the one-year appointment of Asthana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-against-rakesh-asthana-s-appointment-next-week-101637253242938.html
18-11-2021||India||‘Nothing further from truth’: India punches holes in Pak claim over Jadhav law||NEW DELHI: India on Thursday accused Pakistan of denying unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Indian death row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav and said a new Pakistani law to facilitate his right to appeal his death sentence contains shortcomings. Pakistan on Wednesday pushed through a bill during a joint session of Parliament to help Jadhav appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court. The International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Act of 2021 is on the same lines as an ordinance issued last year to facilitate his right to appeal.“Pakistan continues to deny unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Shri Jadhav and has failed to create an atmosphere in which a fair trial can be conducted,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said while reacting to the Pakistani law.“The law simply codifies the shortcomings of the previous ordinance,” he added.Bagchi said Pakistan enacted into law “the earlier ordinance that was ostensibly enacted to bring into effect the judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case”. “Nothing could have been further from the truth. As stated earlier, the ordinance did not create the machinery for an effective review and reconsideration of Shri Jadhav’s case as mandated by the judgement of the ICJ,” he said.India, Bagchi said, has repeatedly called on Pakistan to abide by the letter and spirit of the ICJ judgement.Experts have said the new law will not make a material difference to Jadhav’s case and it was more about meeting legal requirements so that he can mount a proper appeal in Pakistani courts. The law allows a foreign national to file a petition in a Pakistani high court for review and reconsideration of a sentence given by a military court.After India approached the ICJ, the court said in its judgement that “Pakistan is under an obligation to provide, by means of its own choosing, effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr Jadhav” in view of the violation of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.According to Pakistan, Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of spying. He was sentenced to death the following year. India rejected the charges levelled against the formal navy officer and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistans-new-law-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-appeal-codifies-old-shortcomings-india-101637249402932.html

18-11-2021||India||Ahead of organisational polls, Congress revives disciplinary panel||The Congress party, which has been busy tackling in-house rebels and issues related to discipline, revived its disciplinary committee on Thursday ahead of organisational elections. Party veteran AK Antony continues to head the panel while Ambika Soni, Tariq Anwar, JP Agarwal and G Parameswar are its other members.A senior party functionary added that G Parameswar, former Karnataka PCC chief and former deputy CM has been given a central post in a balancing act since the state leadership is now tightly in control of DK Shivkumar and Siddaramaiah. While Ambika Soni remains one of the most trusted lieutenants of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Tariq Anwar has been brought in to be given additional responsibilities. The veteran leader re-joined the Congress from NCP a few years ago. Former Delhi PCC chief JP Aggarwal has been included in the committee that handles all issues related to indiscipline and can recommend action to the Congress president. While the party has other such state-level panels, this central disciplinary panel handles cases at the AICC level. The circular, signed by general secretary organization KC Venugopal, mentioned that the appointments have come into force with immediate effect. The AICC also appointed seven national coordinators in the data analytics panel led by Praveen Chakravarthy. A second party leader added that in view of the membership drive related to the organisational polls, there is a lot of data related work to be done as the party also goes online to invite people to join the Congress party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-organisational-polls-congress-revives-disciplinary-panel-101637248862896.html
18-11-2021||India||Assam rebuts Mizoram minister’s construction charge along inter-state border||SILCHAR: Assam forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya on Thursday rushed to rebut Mizoram’s accusation that his government was not adhering to the Union home ministry’s November 5 advisory that required both states to maintain status quo on construction works along their 164.6km inter-state border.“Our districts are maintaining the status quo and no construction is going on in the border areas. We are trying to save our trees which a few groups from Mizoram are trying to destroy,” Parimal Suklabaidya said, his rebuttal to Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana, who uses only one name.At a meeting of Mizoram’s state boundary committee on Wednesday, Lalchamliana instructed deputy commissioners of Kolasib and Mamit districts to resume construction activities on the ground that Assam hasn’t halted the civil works on its side. The instruction to rescind Aizwal’s order came hours after a locally influential body - the JAC on Inner Line Reserve Forest Demand - served an ultimatum to the Mizoram government to withdraw the November 11 move to stop construction in the border districts.Suklabaidya’s well-publicised instructions to the deputy commissioners of the border districts followed on Wednesday.Officials in Assam’s Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi districts denied the Mizo claim.Hailakandi deputy commissioner Rohan Kumar Jha said, “We have instructions from the government and there is absolutely zero construction going on. Officials of Mizoram should enquire properly before making statements which can mislead common people.”Cachar superintendent of police Ramandip Kaur said, “There are some old works going on but we didn’t allow undertaking any fresh construction following the status quo. The allegations of Mizoram are false. Rather there were attempts of illegal construction from Mizoram on our land which we stopped.”The home ministry’s November 5 advisory that asked the two states to halt border works was issued against the backdrop of renewed signs of tension along the inter-state border, mostly around construction activities. A flare-up along the border on July 26 led to the death of six Assam police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-rebuts-mizoram-minister-s-construction-charge-along-inter-state-border-101637247962565.html

Congress's swipe at Narottam Mishra||As Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra has announced a ban on comedian, satirist Vir Das for his recent 'Two Indias' video, the state Congress questioned why the minister is choosing to talk about the Vir Das issue while he chose to be silent over the Kangana Ranaut issue. Kangana Ranaut and Vir Das are two celebrities in soup over their recent comments. While Kangana criticised India's freedom movement by slamming Mahatma Gandhi, Vir Das has been accused of belittling India on an international platform in his video 'I come from two Indias' where he presented two exactly opposite sides of India.Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra, who had issued an ultimatum to designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee to withdraw his mangalsutra ad, has now issued a ban on Vir Das. Mishra said Vir Das will not be allowed to perform in the state. But if he apologises, then the state government will reconsider the decision. While taking a dig at Vir Das, Mishra slammed Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and said that they like 'clowns' like Vir Das as they too defame India on foreign land."Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also defames India on foreign land. MP Congress chief Kamal Nath also does it," Mishra said. "I call such people 'vidushak' (jester). He (Das) would not be allowed to perform in the state. If he apologises, we are going to think over it," he said.State Congress general secretary KK Mishra asked why the home minister was silent on Kangana Ranaut's comment. "She (Ranaut) has made an anti-national statement, but why is Mishra or the BJP government in MP not breaking the silence over it? Why is Mishra not giving a statement against traitor Ranaut?""Will he announce a ban on Ranaut's entry into Madhya Pradesh?" he asked.Madhya Pradesh BJP spokesperson Neha Bagga, however, said Ranaut was neither a member of her party nor the party had supported the actor over her statement. "But it is very unfortunate that Congress leaders like Kapil Sibal are backing Das who has sullied the country's image in the US," she said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-talk-about-vir-das-and-not-kangana-congress-s-swipe-at-narottam-mishra-101637246903792.html
18-11-2021||India||Idukki, Mullaperiyar dams opened as Kerala braces for another wet spell||With another spell of rainfall round the corner, the shutters of Idukki and Mullaperiyar, the two major dams of Kerala, were opened on Thursday to let out surplus water. State water resources minister Roshy Augustine said in Idukki that the dams were opened as a precautionary measure after meeting all requirements. This is the first time that the shutters of Idukki arch dam were opened thrice a year since it was built in 1973. Tamil Nadu also opened the shutters of the 126-year-old Mullaperiyar dam for the second time this year. Though the heavy rainfall has declined in other parts of the state in the last couple of days, the catchment areas received heavy downpour leading to swelling of water in the dams. “Idukki dam was opened as a precaution. Now the water level is manageable. We have alerted people living in downstream areas,” said the minister. Idukki district collector Sheeba George also said all precautionary measures had been taken before opening both dams. The public works department of TN informed its counterpart about the decision to open Mullaperiyar after the water level crossed 141 feet. It opened two shutters to release excess water-- since Tamil Nadu is being lashed by heavy rain it is taking minimum water from Mullaperiyar for the southern districts these days. Kerala dam authorities said Idukki was opened after shutters of Mullaperiyar were opened in the neighbouring state. In Idukki district alone there are 20 big and small dams. The catchment areas of Idukki dam received 30 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours and in Mullaperiyar it was 22 mm. The inflow of water doubled in the two dams forcing authorities to ease them immediately. Shutters of the Idukki dam were opened initially on October 27, then on November 14 and for the third time on November 18. The usual rainfall pattern during northeast monsoon in Kerala is 492 mm between October 1 and December 31, but this time between October 1 and November 15 the state received 820 mm rain against the expected fall of 392.8 mm during the same period, IMD statistics show. Going by the present pattern, the rainfall will be at least 200 per cent higher than usual by the end of December. After a brief respite from the wet condition, the rainfall is likely to pick up by Friday; the India Meteorological Department said adding heavy rain will continue till November 21. It has issued an yellow alert in nine districts. The low-pressure formation in the Bay of Bengal is expected to get stronger and will make landfall along the Tamil Nadu-Andhra coast on Friday. This time Kerala received two heavy spells of northeast monsoon-- in the second-third week of October the state witnessed many landslides and flash floods after torrential downpour claimed 42 lives and in November second week eight lives were lost when the second spell of heavy rain battered the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/idukki-mullaperiyar-dams-opened-as-kerala-braces-for-another-wet-spell-101637247122676.html
18-11-2021||India||BJP minister from Himachal outlines reason for bypoll defeat||Himachal Pradesh minister Rakesh Pathania on Thursday said that the ‘overconfidence’ among the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led to its defeat in the recent bypolls, news agency PTI reported. Pathania, however, pointed out that the BJP now has learnt its lessons and is preparing in a united manner to fight the 2022 assembly elections.Pathania’s comments on the BJP’s defeat came weeks after it faced a 4-0 defeat in the bypolls as Congress wrested the Mandi Lok Sabha seat along with Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly constituency.“Senior party leaders, including BJP national president JP Nadda and HP former chief ministers Shanta Kumar and Prem Kumar Dhumal besides others, are handling the party unitedly,” Pathania was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He also refuted speculations of cabinet reshuffle as well as any change in party’s state leadership and reiterated that the state will head into polls under the Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur. He said the party’s state unit will also discuss the poll strategy on November 24 in a working committee meeting.The BJP also lost a seat to Congress in Karnataka while it faced a Himachal Pradesh-like fate in West Bengal where all four legislative assembly constituencies which went to bypolls were won by Trinamool Congress (TMC) as it wrested two seats won by the BJP earlier this year in Bengal elections while retaining two other seats.The Congress defeated the BJP in the bypolls which were held on October 30, as it wrested Mandi Lok Sabha seat and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly constituency while maintaining its grip on the Fatehpur and Arki legislative assembly constituencies. The Congress also is looking at the prospect of projecting Pratibha Singh, Congress’ winning candidate in the Mandi Lok Sabha seat and wife of deceased former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh, as its chief ministerial face ahead of the upcoming polls next year.Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh will go to polls in 2022. These assembly elections are also seen as a precursor to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-minister-from-himachal-outlines-reason-for-bypoll-defeat-101637246076718.html

The trio was apprehended from a hideout in Kupwara district.In a statement, police said that the three youth – all 16-year-olds and students of class 10, had established contact with a terrorist commander named Tayab Farroqi, operating from Pakistan. They were on their way to meet him by crossing the LoC via Kupwara and take illegal training in handling of arms and ammunition for joining terrorism back in Jammu and Kashmir.The three individuals have been identified as Furqan Sultan Khanday (16), Furqan Nazir Khanday (16), and Kamran Sajad Sheikh (16). All of them hail from Pulwama district in the Valley.Following interrogation, the police found that the teenagers were radicalised by Farroqi through social media platforms.Owing to their young age, Jammu and Kashmir Police decided to counsel them to give them a chance to reform into responsible and peace-abiding citizens. They were handed over to their parents, the statement said.“Jammu and Kashmir Police also appeals to the parents of young people to monitor their activities to prevent them from falling prey to the Pakistani agenda of destabilising the peace in the UT…and also appeals to youth to not get misguided by the propaganda of the terrorists,” the statement by the police read.Meanwhile, between Tuesday and Thursday, as many as five terrorists were gunned down, three overground workers were apprehended with ₹43 lakh and three individuals were detained with ₹30 lakh.Also Read | Day after encounter, 3 detained in Kashmir with around ₹30 lakhJammu and Kashmir has been rife with tension since the controversial Hyderpora encounter on Monday in which besides two terrorists, two civilians died.

18-11-2021||India||India-China meet ends only with agreement on next round of military talks||India and China emerged from the latest round of diplomatic talks on the border standoff in Ladakh sector on Thursday with little to show but an agreement on holding the next discussions between senior military commanders at an early date. The virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs was held against the backdrop of growing evidence of China building infrastructure and villages in disputed sections of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and a lack of forward movement on disengagement at friction points such as Hot Springs and Depsang. The external affairs ministry said in a statement after the WMCC meeting: “It was agreed that both sides should hold the next (14th) round of the senior commanders meeting at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all the friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols.” A readout from China’s foreign ministry said the two sides agreed to maintain dialogue through diplomatic and military channels, and “actively prepare for the 14th round of military commander-level talks, and make efforts to resolve the remaining issues” in the western sector. Both sides described the discussions at the WMCC meeting as “candid and in-depth”. The last round of talks between the senior military commanders, which was held at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point on October 10, had failed to make any substantive progress as Beijing contended that New Delhi had made “unreasonable and unrealistic demands”. The Chinese readout also said the two sides will “continue to work hard to further ease the border situation and strive to shift from emergency response to normalised control as soon as possible”. The shift from “emergency response” to “normalised control” was a repeat of what Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi had told his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar during a meeting in Dushanbe in September. The Indian statement said the two sides recalled the agreement between Jaishankar and Wang during their meeting in Dushanbe that military and diplomatic officials should continue discussions to resolve remaining issues along the LAC. They also reviewed developments since the meeting of the military commanders on October 10, and “agreed on the need to find an early resolution to the remaining issues” in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols to restore peace and tranquillity, the Indian statement said. The two sides also agreed that they would continue to “ensure a stable ground situation” and avoid any untoward incident, the Indian statement added. The Chinese readout said the two sides had agreed to consolidate the existing disengagement results, strictly abide by agreements and consensus, and avoid recurrences in the current situation. The Indian side at the WMCC meeting was led by additional secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry, while the Chinese delegation was headed by the Hong Liang, director of the boundary and oceanic department of the foreign ministry. India and China withdrew frontline troops from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February and from Gogra in August after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks, but there has been no further movement on disengagement and de-escalation since then. The two sides have been locked in the military standoff for more than 18 months, sending bilateral ties plummeting to their worst in decades. The Indian side has insisted relations can be normalised only when disengagement is completed at other friction points such as Hot Springs and Depsang. On the other hand, China has pushed for delinking the standoff from the overall bilateral relationship and greater contacts in areas such as trade and investment. Sameer Patil fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the outcome of the WMCC meeting showed both sides were sticking to their respective stated positions and this is yielding no solution. “In light of recent revelations about China’s activities in other sections of the border, this would mean that China won’t budge from its position. Clearly, there is no incentive for both sides to compromise. This stalemate will continue for some time to come,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-meet-ends-only-with-agreement-on-next-round-of-military-talks-101637244603959.html

Here's what civil aviation minister said||In a possible indication that the regular overseas commercial passenger flight operations to India are unlikely to be ‘fully normal’ in the near future, Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Thursday that though the country was getting back to normal, the resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic in other parts of the world, including Europe, can’t be ignored. Speaking at an event organised by the industry body CII, Scindia also said that the government was ‘evaluating the process’ to normalise international flight operations.Also Read | India reopens to vaccinated foreign travellers after 18 months“Let me commit to you that we are evaluating that process. However, keep in mind what’s happening in the world, including in Russia, parts of Europe, they are going through a fourth wave that too despite the vaccines,” the civil aviation minister said, according to news agency PTI. He further urged people not to ‘erase our short-term memories so soon,’ in what was a possible reference to the devastating second wave of the viral illness, which was at its peak across the country during April and May.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader also said that there was a process to be followed, under which there has to be a dialogue with other ministries before arriving at a decision on overseas flight operations.“I’m all for regaining our space in the civil aviation arena in the world and making a hub in India for more wide body aircraft.

18-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 19, 1996 — Miss World crown for Indian girl Reita Faria, a medical student from Bombay||London- Miss Reita Faria, the 23-year-old medical student from Bombay (vital statistics 35-24-35 inches), was elected Miss World in the beauty contest held here last night (November 17). She won against 51 competitors from all over the world, all of them the chosen beauties of their countries. The second place was awarded to Miss Yugoslavia, the first contestant from a Communist country, and the third to Miss Greece. Miss Faria gets a prize of £2,500 and can earn up to £30,000 in the year she “reigns” as the world’s beauty queen through film and public relations parts. But she surprised the British public accustomed to seeing beauty queens making a dash for films or modelling when she said she was not interested in any of these things. She was anxious to sit for her final examination in April next year and her ambition was to be a gynaecologist. What seems to have helped her in her victory was her obvious intelligence added to her charm and good looks. She is probably the best educated girl to have competed in these contests and having been a medical student for five years has the composure and dignity to withstand the ballyhoo that accompany them. She withstood with calm the long ordeal of the elimination rounds televized over the British and Eurovision networks for 90 minutes.At the end of it all, asked what she wanted to do with her prize money, she said she had longed for a Mercedes car, but because India was going through a difficult time, she would not spend it on such a luxury. She intended to return to Bombay and marry her financee, Mr. Osbourne Labo, who works in a plantation in West Bengal after she passes her final examination. Blondes dominated the competition. Four of those who entered the finals were blondes, the other three brunettes. Miss Canada-Diane Coulter, 18-year-old blonde model who had been made the favourite by Britain’s bookies-did not appear among the 15 finalists. But these included Miss South Africa (Johanna Maud Carter).The new Miss World today called on the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Robert Belinger, at his 200year-old office. She wore a turquoise blue sari for her visit to the Lord Mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-19-1996-miss-world-crown-for-indian-girl-reita-faria-a-medical-student-from-bombay-101637241902573.html

She’s only mouthing what RSS-affiliated pseudo-historians and self-styled scholars have been desperately trying to mainstream for years. Her sutradhars are in power today," Jairam Ramesh tweeted. A recent Padma Shri awardee has been hitting the headlines for her outrageous statements on Indian history. She’s only mouthing what RSS-affiliated pseudo-historians and self-styled scholars have been desperately trying to mainstream for years. Her sutradhars are in power today.The political controversy that followed Kangana's statement was inevitable as the Bollywood actor slammed the Congress and disrespected Mahatma Gandhi and also issued statements defending her claim. Kangana said the battle of 1857 was a major battle in the history of India's freedom movement, whereas the freedom that India attained in 1947 was 'bheek' as no battle was fought in 1947, she defended. In her further comments on her 'bheek' remark, she slammed Mahatma Gandhi and said, "Those are the ones who taught us, if someone slaps you offer another cheek for one more slap and that is how you will get aazaadi. That's not how one gets aazadi, one can only get bheekh like that. Choose your heroes wisely.""So you need to choose who you support because just placing them all in one box of your memory and every year wishing them all on their birth anniversaries is not enough. In fact, it is not just dumb, it is highly irresponsible and superficial. One must know their history and their heroes," the actor whose Twitter account has been suspended recently posted on Instagram.The Congress demanded the withdrawal of Kangana's Padma Shri which Kangana offered to do if anyone could tell her which battle was fought in 1947, the Kangana wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-says-kangana-s-idea-of-freedom-not-new-explains-101637241229068.html

"Responsibilities of each state should be fixed to implement that plan and reduce pollution," he also said in a press conference in Delhi.The Delhi environment minister also cited a study from the Indian Institute of Tropical Management (IITM), a central government-run body, that 69 per cent share in Delhi's air pollution between October 24 and November 8 was from external sources. "People of Delhi can't reduce the 70 per cent of the external sources of pollution," he said. "That's why I am requesting again the Union environment minister to call a joint meeting of environment ministers from NCR states and make a joint action plan," he addedHe also quoted a similar study done by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in 2016 which had shown that 64% pollution of Delhi is due to external sources.This comes as the air quality in Delhi plunged to hazardous levels as the pollutant particles in the environment grew. The city faces a similar situation every year with an onset of winters due to the stubble burning, emissions from transport, coal-fired plants outside the city and other industries, as well as open garbage burning and dust.On Wednesday, the Delhi environment minister unveiled a 10-point plan which included curbs on vehicular movements, work from home for all government employees and a ban on all construction and demolition work.Schools in the city have also been until further notice in view of the pollution.Speaking during the conference on Thursday, Rai also informed that the Delhi government has taken a number of steps to control the pollution, but "requires a joint effort from all NCR states such as Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh."He alleged that construction activities are going unabated in surrounding areas of Delhi, which is further worsening the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-pollution-gopal-rai-urges-centre-to-call-joint-meeting-of-ncr-states-101637239766701.html

So, through a peddler, Wankhede planted drugs and got her cousin arrested through the Anti-Narcotics Cell of the state police," Malik said. “His first wife's family was threatened that if they spoke against Wankhede, the entire family will be dubbed as drug peddlers and arrested,” he said.Sameer Wankhede, who was the man behind the arrest of Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan and Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan, got married in 2006 according to Islamic rituals to Shabana Quraishi. The minister has alleged that despite being a Muslim, Wankhede forged an SC certificate and got the government job on an SC quota.Though Wankhede's first wife did not comment on the issue, his former father-in-law Dr Zaheed Quraishi said he knew Sameer Wankhede's family as a Muslim family. He also confirmed that Sameer Wankhede practised Islam at that time when his daughter got married to Sameer. The government job came a year after the Wankhede's first marriage, his father-in-law said.Amid this ongoing controversy, Sameer Wankhede's father Dnyandev Wankhede approached the Bombay high court asking it to pass an order prohibiting Nawab Malik from tweeting about the Wankhede family. The court on Thursday said it will pass the order on November 22. Among other things, the court took on record a school admission form and a school leaving certificate submitted by Malik that the NCP leader claimed belongs to Sameer Wankhede and shows that he was born a Muslim. . Dnyandev Wankhede submitted a set of counter documents that included his son's birth certificate and his caste certificate allegedly showing that he indeed belongs to a Scheduled Caste.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-fresh-twist-nawab-malik-says-sameer-wankhede-framed-ex-wife-s-cousin-hc-order-on-caste-case-on-nov-22-101637237051167.html

It ended at the Chanda Sarai village in Lucknow at 4 am on Thursday. “I think this is one of the longest Yatras of Samajwadi (SP)... but in a real sense, I think the yatra has not ended...It will go on and stop when the SP government is back.”Originally, the yatra was to end in Lucknow on Wednesday evening. “But due to many unscheduled halts because of the crowds of supporters along the way, the yatra went on all night,” said SP leader Rajendra Chaudhary.Yadav undertook the expressway yatra the morning after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated it at an emergency airstrip of the Indian Air Force in Sultanpur on Tuesday. On Tuesday, SP workers did a “symbolic inauguration” of the expressway calling it Samajwadi Purvanchal Expressway.Yadav has maintained the expressway was his previous SP government’s project which the BJP has appropriated.The fourth leg of Vijay Yatra was originally scheduled from Ghazipur to Azamgarh on Tuesday. But the Ghazipur district administration denied permission for it citing security reasons for Modi’s event.Yadav said the expressway is incomplete at the start of his Vijay Yatra on the Purvanchal Expressway. “Samajwadis saw the dream and conceived the plan to build it to cut the travel time between Ghazipur and New Delhi. It was to be an expressway to prosperity. They could not make a better road than this in the entire country. After the SP government comes to power, it will build mandis along the expressway and take the expressway to Ballia and connect it with Bihar.”Political analyst SK Dwivedi said it is high time that political parties shelve identify politics. “They should do development politics. They should not fight over who made what. The expressway was built and it is a good thing for the state, the country, and its people. Credit should be given to both who conceived it, and those who built it.”SP sees Yadav’s yatras as a lucky charm. “Before this Akhilesh went on a statewide Kranti Rath in 2011 and the party returned to power with full majority and he became the chief minister for the first time. It is going to happen again now,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadav-concludes-yatra-on-newly-inaugurated-expressway-101637232422009.html
18-11-2021||India||Bring Anupama Chandran’s baby from Andhra, conduct DNA tests: Kerala panel||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM The Kerala Child Welfare Committee on Thursday ordered authorities to produce the child of former Students Federation of India (SFI) leader Anupama S Chandran that was given up for adoption by her family against her wishes.The committee, a quasi-judicial body, also told the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare, the nodal agency for adoption in the state, to get DNA tests conducted to confirm the baby’s biological parents.The baby was reportedly given to a couple in Andhra Pradesh in August without the mother’s consent. A deputy superintendent of police will be in charge of the safety of the child during travel from Andhra Pradesh, it ordered.An official of the state child welfare council later said the baby’s foster parents have agreed to co-operate with the ongoing investigation. Once the baby is back in Kerala, the child will be under protection of a senior official provided for in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, until a final decision is made, the committee said in its order.Anupama Chandran, who is on a stand-in protest outside the office of the state council of child welfare for the past week, welcomed the decision but said she will continue her protest till officials who allegedly colluded with her parents are punished.“It is a good development and I wish it should not happen to any mother. I will continue my fight till action is taken against the guilty officials who flouted norms,” she said. Her protest has` embarrassed the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and led to appeals to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to intervene. The chief minister has so far adopted a hands-off approach, a move in sync with the CPM line that Chandran’s protests and the controversy around her child’s adoption were essentially a family matter. The party did, however, remove her father CS Jayachandran, a senior leader of the CPM’s trade union wing CITU, from all party posts in view of the kidnapping charges filed against him by his daughter.On October 20, Anupama Chandran filed a police complaint against her parents, alleging that they took away her newborn last year and given it up for adoption despite her opposition. She alleged that her parents opposed her relation with her husband K Ajith since he belonged to a Dalit family. Her father has insisted that he has her daughter’s written consent for the adoption. Chandran, however, countered that her father forced her to sign the document under duress and that the baby was given for adoption in connivance with the state council of child welfare officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/get-anupama-chandran-s-baby-in-5-days-conduct-dna-tests-orders-kerala-panel-101637231761393.html

Secondly, we have been asking them to share the content of the MoU signed between then Congress president and China. However, they have not done so,” said Vadakkan. “The [current] government has always acknowledged the sacrifices of our soldiers, and claiming that we don’t care is absolutely wrong and misleading.”The Congress has said it will raise the issue during Parliament’s winter session beginning this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-concerned-over-pm-modi-s-continued-silence-on-china-bjp-hits-back-101637230744914.html

The Madhya Pradesh Police claimed to have busted the interstate gang. "There are no guidelines for online businesses but Madhya Pradesh will make one. Amazon was called but they are not cooperating. I appeal to Amazon's MD-CEO to cooperate. Else, we will initiate action," the home minister said.According to reports, the racket might have smuggled marijuana through Amazon claiming them to be curry leaves.“A company registered in 2007 as an Ahmedabad-based textile firm, Babu Tex Private Limited, which used to sell Marijuana as stevia dry leaves. Acting on a tip-off, police raided a Dhaba in Gohad of Bhind and recovered packaging material of amazon e-commercial company and two air tickets from Visakhapatnam to Delhi,” Bhind police chief Manoj Kumar Singh said.While the consignment was busted on Sunday, Amazon India on Monday said it is investigating the issue. "The issue was notified to us, and we are currently investigating it. We assure full co-operation and support required to Investigating Authorities and Law Enforcement agencies with ongoing investigations to resolve the issue at the earliest," an Amazon spokesperson said.The Madhya Pradesh police summoned Amazon India's executives on Monday and Amazon's lawyers were supposed to meet MP Police on Tuesday. But as the home minister confirmed, there has been no response from Amazon as of now. "The international company has the power of artificial intelligence, so it's a big thing happening on their platform," Manoj Singh said.

18-11-2021||India||PM Modi draws up blueprint for financial inclusion, asks bankers to be proactive||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asked bankers to shun their age-old “approver-applicant” attitude and make customers their partners in progress by stepping up the government’s financial inclusion initiatives and proactively reaching out to small entrepreneurs. The bankers, he emphasized, should also show willingness to invest in new ideas for the country’s inclusive economic development.PM Modi said the Indian banking sector is robust due to several reforms undertaken in the last six-seven years, which helped to provide immediate relief to millions of poor though instant transfer of money in their ‘Jan-Dhan’ accounts. He was addressing a conference on ‘Creating Synergies for Seamless Credit Flow and Economic Growth’ in the capital. He said, banking sector reforms undertaken during his regime not only unearthed hidden huge non-performing assets (NPAs) but also recovered about ₹5 lakh crore from willful defaulters, and another ₹2 lakh crore stressed assets will be resolved through recently created National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL). A transparent Asset Quality Review (AQR), undertaken during the Modi government’s tenure in 2015, gross NPAs of public sector banks (PSBs) soared from ₹2,16,739 crore on March 31, 2014 to ₹8,95,601 crore in March 31, 2018 mainly due to indiscriminate lending to unscrupulous influential people such as Vijay Mallya in the past. After the government’s four ‘R’ strategy – recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms – it went down to ₹6,16,616 crore on March 31, 2021, according to official data.The Prime Minister said the government has strengthened banks by recapitalising them and transparently resolving their NPA issues that included transformative legislation -- the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). “Today, Indian banks have become so strong that they are capable of energising the economy of the country, to give it a big push. They can play a big role in making India self-reliant,” he said in Hindi.He asked bankers to become proactive and instead of waiting for the customer to visit them, they should approach people who need finances. “You must shun the feeling that you are an approver and the person in-front of you is an applicant, and banks must adopt the partnership model,” he said.PM Modi underscored the importance of using data to enhance business and improve services. He gave the example of Goods and Services Tax (GST) data that capture financial history of an entrepreneur, which banks should leverage to proactively reach out to scrupulous businessmen who may need funds to further expand their businesses.Recalling his school-days, when banks were not nationalised and the private bankers used to visit schools explaining the importance of opening a bank account to children, he said public sector banks should not wait for their customers to visit them, instead bank branches must approach at least 10 local micro, small and medium enterprises in their vicinity and offer financial help and advice to enhance their businesses. “This is the time when banks should act as wealth creators and job creators, which will help in enhancing the country’s balance sheet,” the PM said.This is possible, he said citing the example of one of the world’s largest financial inclusion initiatives – ‘Jan-Dhan’ accounts. India could accomplish this because of dedication of executives working in public sector banks, he added. “The initiative paid off during the pandemic as it ensured that no poor person was left hungry during the period,” he said. The Covid-19 pandemic hit India in March 2020 and led to a 68-day nationwide lockdown. During this period the government released free food grains and financial assistance to the poor. The financial assistance went directly to the ‘Jan-Dhan’ accounts of the beneficiaries at the click of a button.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-draws-up-blueprint-for-financial-inclusion-asks-bankers-to-be-proactive-101637229601238.html
18-11-2021||India||Congress leader Surjewala challenges CBI, ED chiefs’ extension in SC||Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala has approached the Supreme Court challenging the two Ordinances allowing the Centre to extend the tenure of heads of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Directorate of Enforcement for up to five years.In his petition, Surjewala said that such “ad hoc extension” goes against the Supreme Court rulings that intend to insulate these agencies from any kind of political interference. He cited the 1997 decision in Vineet Narain case where the Court held a minimum secured tenure for CBI and ED directors followed by the Alok K Verma case (2019) where the need to insulate CBI Director from all extraneous influences was laid down.On September 8, the top court, in yet another decision, considered the extension granted by the Centre to the incumbent ED director and said that such an extension has to be in “rare and exceptional” circumstances and for a short period.“These investigative agencies were created to serve the public but with these amendments, they are being subordinated in a clear and malicious fashion to serve the will of the executive,” said the petition filed through advocate Abhishek Jebaraj.It further said that the ordinances go against the Supreme Court rulings that gave much-needed stability to the tenure of Director of Enforcement and Director, CBI to protect them from political interference.The two ordinances – Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance and Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance – that amend Section 25 and Section 4B of the CVC Act 2003 and DSPE Act 1946 respectively were promulgated on November 14.The CBI and ED directors are appointed for a two-year tenure. The twin amendments allow the Centre to extend their original tenure by one year at a time with a rider that “no such extension shall be granted after the completion of five years in total, including the period sanctioned in the initial appointment.” The petition further questioned the two ordinances on the ground that there are no criteria provided save for a vague reference to ‘public interest’ and is in fact, based on the subjective satisfaction of the respondents. “This has the direct and clear impact of eroding the independence of the investigative bodies in question,” the petition added.The petition also questioned the reason for bringing the ordinance 15 days before the Parliament is to convene and said, “This hurried rush, of promulgating the ordinances three days before the retirement of the incumbent director ED, is only intended to allow the government to extend the term of the said director ED which comes to an end on November 17.” He called the ordinances an exercise of abuse of power that is manifestly arbitrary.Surjewala said that this Court has held time and again that the CBI is required to function independently and be insulated from extraneous influences to discharge its functions in accordance with the rule of law. However, such a “piecemeal extension system”, creates a perverse incentive for officials to serve at the pleasure of the government, the petition stated.On Wednesday, Trinamool Congress MP Mohua Moitra filed a petition challenging the two ordinances. She stated that by an ordinance, the Centre cannot nullify a Supreme Court decision and a one year extension period cannot be termed as a “short” extension, considering the fact that the total tenure of both CBI and ED directors is two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-surjewala-challenges-cbi-ed-chiefs-extension-in-sc-101637229123565.html

The Prime Minister said the banking sector of India is currently in a major milestone phase that can give a great push to the country's economy."The reforms made by the government in the banking sector in the last six-seven years, supported the banking sector in every way, due to which the banking sector of the country is in a very strong position today," he said at the session titled ‘Creating Synergies for Seamless Credit Flow and Economic Growth’."You might also feel that the financial health of the banks is in a much-improved condition now," PM Modi added.The conference was organised by the finance ministry and was attended by representatives of various industries, banks and financial institutions. It was held to remove friction in credit flow to productive sectors of the economy battered by the Covid-19 pandemic.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was also present at the conference.He further said a dedicated Stressed Asset Management Vertical was formed in the country during the Covid period. "We have found ways to solve problems and challenges that were there before 2014. We addressed the problem of Non-Performing Assets (NPA). We recapitalised the banks and increased their strength," PM Modi also said."Today the capacity of the banks of India has increased so much that they can play a great role in giving new energy and a great push to the economy of the country and making it self-reliant. I consider this phase as a major milestone in the banking sector of India," he also said.PM Modi also said that the banks should adopt the model of partnership leaving the traditional approver-applicant system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-seamless-credit-flow-meet-pm-modi-promises-support-to-banks-101637226074865.html
18-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu pitches for timeframe for Governors to decide on bills||With Tamil Nadu awaiting a decision from constitutional authorities on two crucial issues- exemption of NEET and the release of prisoners in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case - the state’s Speaker M Appavu came down heavily on Governors sitting on bills indefinitely and also said that if the President rejects a bill, people are entitled to know the reason. Appavu was speaking at the Presiding Officers conference held in Shimla on Wednesday.Appavu said that this was an important issue facing state legislation and also pitched for fixing a timeframe within which the Governors need to send bills to the President for consideration. “When a bill is passed by a majority and sent for the assent of the Governors, the latter, sometimes, sit over the bill without giving his assent or returning the bill for an indefinite period, even though the Constitution requires it to be done “as soon as possible”,” Appavu said. He added that “another problem” which erodes the authority of legislatures is that where a bill is required to be reserved for the consideration of the President, the Governors “are taking months together” even though they are bound to do so immediately. Pointing out that though Governors are heads of the State Executive since they are appointed by the Union government they are overruling the will of the state’s people when they stall the assent to a bill. “We have to work together to set a binding time frame within which bills have to be assented to, returned or reserved for the consideration of the Hon’ble President of India by the Hon’ble Governors,” Appavu said.He further said that another “Constitutional issue” is for the President to give reasons if he withholds the assent and returns the bill. This would help the House to enact another bill by correcting shortfalls that caused the bill to be rejected, he said. “How else will the House that enacted the bill know what is the real impediment in withholding the assent?” he questioned saying that the House reflects the will of the people so it amounts to the rejection of them too. “Therefore, are not the people entitled to know at least the reason why the bill was not assented to?”The Speaker’s comments assume significance in the backdrop of a bill passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly on September 13 seeking exemption for students from the state from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) required for undergraduate medical college admissions. The bill was passed by the ruling DMK with the support of all parties except the BJP and it happened during the time when the then Governor Banwarilal Purohit was transferred and before Governor RN Ravi took charge on September 18. The bill is pending with Ravi and it is unclear if it has been sent to President Ram Nath Kovind. In 2017, the President rejected a similar bill seeking NEET exemption passed by the Assembly under the previous AIADMK regime. In another sensitive issue in the state, the Tamil Nadu cabinet passed a unanimous resolution in 2018 in the assembly regarding the release of the seven prisoners convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The resolution was sent to then Governor Purohit but he did not take any action for more than two years. In January the Supreme Court, while hearing a plea, expressed that they were unhappy with the delay. In February, Purohit, without taking a call, passed the buck and said that the President was the competent authority to decide on the resolution. After forming the government in May, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin wrote a letter to President Kovind urging him to remit the life sentence of the seven convicts and to direct their immediate release.The BJP in Tamil Nadu reacted saying that the Speaker should have had more awareness on the issue. “The Governor and the President operate as per the Constitution and nowhere is a time frame set,” said BJP’s spokesperson Narayanan Thirupathy. “Also the Supreme Court has so many times refused to instruct a time frame in several cases. I think the Speaker should have been aware of these aspects.”Appavu recalled that President Kovind participated in the centenary celebrations of the Tamil Nadu assembly where he unveiled a portrait of DMK’s late patriarch M Karunanidhi. Quoting Karunanidhi, Appavu said that the Legislature is like a mirror to the executive branch. “The mirror reflects not only the beauty but also the flaws. Similarly, the Legislature should not only laud the good work of the Government but also criticize it when it falls short,” he said while seeing changes. On the role of presiding officers, he said that they are the ultimate arbiters. “A very heavy responsibility is cast on the Presiding Officers to ensure that the independent and sovereign functions of the Legislature are guided in accordance with the Constitution so that the Judicial branch is not called upon to test the decisions of the Speakers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-pitches-for-timeframe-for-governors-to-decide-on-bills-101637227802562.html

"Again under house arrest and PDPs Sqib and Suhail Bukhari too have been arrested," she wrote on the micro-blogging site.

The family of the two civilians -- Altaf Ahmad and Mudasir -- have claimed that they are innocent and demanded their bodies be returned for burials as per their rituals. However, police have charged them as "terror associates".Mufti said the "narrative right from the start was based on lies to escape accountability". "They don't want to be held accountable for their actions and that's why they are muzzling voices that speak up against such injustice and atrocities," she added.Meanwhile, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has ordered a magisterial probe into the Hyderpora encounter.

MP Congress chief Kamal Nath also does it." "Such type of people like him, I call them 'vidushak' (jester) would not be allowed to perform in the state. If he (Das) apologises, we are going to think over it," Narottam Mishra said.Several police complaints have been filed against the satirist, who is in the United States right now. He uploaded the video on his YouTube channel on Monday and it is part of his recent performance at the John F Kennedy Centre in Washington DC. In the video, he talked about two India, juxtaposed with each other, and touched on issues like farm protests, Covid-19, rape, freedom of speech etc. Delhi BJP vice president and spokesperson Aditya took objection to Vir Das's comment that women are worshipped in the day and raped at night in India and said these remarks maligned the image of Indian women on a global platform. All such "derogatory" statements were made on an international platform maligning the image of women and the country, Jha claimed.Congress leader Kapil Sibal supported Das and said, “…Just that we don’t want an Indian to tell the world about it. We are intolerant and hypocritical.” Shashi Tharoor praised Das as a stand-up comedian who knows that the real meaning of the term "stand up" is not physical but moral.The video has drawn sharp reactions from politicians, celebrities with Kangana Ranaut, who created a stir with her 'independence' comment, demanding strict action against Vir Das. The Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE), a film body that claims to have over 2.5 lakh registered members, earlier said its members won't work with Das unless he issues a public apology.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-kamal-nath-like-vir-das-minister-bans-das-from-performing-in-madhya-pradesh-101637225301532.html
18-11-2021||India||NIA sleuths raid residences of alleged CPI (Maoist) sympathisers||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday conducted search operations at the residences of alleged Communist Party of India (Maoist) sympathisers, civil rights activists and several other individuals on suspicion that they were extending support to the banned outfit, said people familiar with the developments.The NIA carried out searches in 14 places in Hyderabad and also in Andhra Pradesh’s Prakasam and Visakhapatnam districts. “The searches are based on specific information the NIA obtained after a recent encounter in Gadhchiroli district in which 27 Maoists were killed in a shootout with the police,” said an Andhra Pradesh police official, who wished not to be named.The search operations began at 5am with a raid on the residence of G Kalyan Rao, a poet and leader of Viplava Rachayitala Sangham (Revolutionary Writers’ Association), in Alakurapadu village of Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA authorities are known to have seized pro-Maoist literature from him.Also Read: ‘Knew you were strong’: Emotional reunion of C’garh official abducted by MaoistsKalyan Rao is known to be closely related to the Maoist party’s central committee member Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna or RK, who died from kidney-related ailments in Chhattisgarh on October 14. Ramakrishna was married to Kalyan Rao’s sister-in-law and both took part in the 2004 talks between Maoist party members and the Andhra Pradesh government.NIA authorities also raided the residence of Annapurna, advocate and leader of a progressive women’s association in Visakhapatnam on suspicion that she had close contacts with the banned Maoists.In Hyderabad, NIA sleuths carried out searches at the residences of Padma Kumari, president of Amarula Bandhu Mitrula Sangham (Association of Friends and Relatives of Martyrs) and Bhavani, the organisation’s secretary, in Subhash Nagar, Alwal.Search operations were also conducted at the residence of former Maoists Narla Ravi Sharma and his wife B Anuradha in Hyderabad’s Nagole. In the past, Ravi Sharma was a central committee member of the Maoist outfit while Anuradha had worked in the state committee of the outfit’s Bihar-Jharkhand unit.Last Friday, the Hyderabad police thwarted an attempt by a group of Maoist sympathisers to hold a condolence meeting in Hyderabad to mark the death of central committee member Ramakrishna.The police also raided a printing press at Amberpet, which was publishing a book on Ramakrishna listing out his speeches, interviews and various articles. Cops seized over 1,000 copies of the book apart from computers, hard disks and pen drives among other things. The police arrested V Ramakrishna Reddy, husband of social activist Sandhya, for allegedly “supporting” the activities of the outlawed CPI (Maoist).The NIA made enquiries about the people who tried to hold the condolence meeting and also those who published the book. “The current raids could be part of those enquiries,” the Andhra Pradesh police official quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-sleuths-raid-residences-of-alleged-cpi-maoist-sympathisers-101637225341330.html
18-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu moves SC against HC order setting aside internal quota for Vanniyars||The Tamil Nadu government and Paatali Makkal Katchi (PMK) have filed separate petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the Madras high court’s November 1 order setting aside 10.5% internal reservation for the Vanniyar community within the 20% quota for Most Backward Class.In its plea, the government said it has acted diligently and the admission process will suffer as a result of the high court order while calling it erroneous. Advocate D Kumanan, representing the government, prayed the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal against the high court judgement and pass appropriate orders. The government has also sought interim relief such as a stay on the judgement.The previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government introduced the reservation in jobs and education just before the model code of conduct came into effect in February ahead of the assembly elections. The quota was implemented after Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam formed the government in May. The high court said the quota violated the Constitution as it treats one caste- Vanniayars--differently and discriminates against others.The government has argued the quota was enacted based on Tamil Nadu Second Backward Classes Commission’s “adequate, authenticated” data on the population of the MBCs and Denotified Communities. Retired bureaucrat J A Ambasankar led the commission, which submitted its door-to-door enumeration of the entire state’s population in 1985. “The caste-wise population data disclosed by Ambasankar Commission is the only authenticated data available as of now before the state and such data can be effectively used to plan for sub-classification within the backward classes,” the government said in its petition.A quota under an existing reservation is called sub-categorisation.The government cited the Supreme Court’s May 2021 judgement in the Jaishrilakshmirao Patil versus the Chief Minister and others case on the powers of the state to legislate for the identification of socially and economically backward classes. It added the judgment favoured the existing powers for special reservation and sub-classification within backward classes.The apex court held the state’s power remains undisturbed to provide reservation to a particular community, caste. The state argued there is no necessity to consult the National Commission for Backward Classes. It said the high court referred to the 1992 Indra Sawhney versus Union of India case but did not follow a Supreme Court observation saying caste is often a social class in the country. “As such, a caste, which is socially and educationally backward may be classified as Backward classes,” the petition said.The PMK, which counts Vanniyar as its core vote bank, filed two petitions in the Supreme Court. “One is by the party and the other has been filed independently by the party founder (S Ramadoss) as both are respondents in the original case in the high court,” said PMK spokesperson K Balu.In his petition, Ramadoss argued internal quotas for Muslims and Arunthathiyars have been provided within the overall 69% reservation in Tamil Nadu and courts have upheld this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-moves-supreme-court-against-hc-order-setting-aside-internal-quota-for-vanniyars-101637224142065.html
18-11-2021||India||‘Disclose whereabouts’: Supreme Court tells Param Bir Singh||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh, declared a proclaimed offender, to disclose his whereabouts. Singh had moved the top court seeking protection against arrest.The court told his lawyer that Singh's petition will be heard "only after he tells which part of the country or the world he is in".The top court posted the matter for further hearing on November 22.A magistrate's court in Mumbai had on Wednesday declared Singh a "proclaimed offender" in an extortion case registered against him and some other police officers in the city.This is the first instance of a Mumbai Police commissioner being declared a proclaimed offender. Singh, 59, was the city's 43rd police commissioner.Watch: Param Bir Singh declared 'proclaimed offender', what it meansCurrently posted as Director General of Home Guards, Singh last attended his office in May, after which he went on leave. The state police had told the Bombay high court in October that his whereabouts were not known.The crime branch of Mumbai Police, which is probing the extortion case, had sought the proclamation against him, saying that the IPS officer could not be traced even after the issuance of a non-bailable warrant.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Sudhir Bhajipale also directed Singh to appear before court in 30 days in connection with the case. If he fails to appear, police can initiate the process for attachment of his properties under section 83 of Code of Criminal Procedure.The extortion case against Singh is based on a complaint filed by a real estate developer and hotelier, who claimed the incidents happened between January 2020 and March 2021. Singh is facing an extortion case in Thane too.The IPS officer was shunted out from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March 2021 after the arrest of now dismissed policeman Sachin Waze after an SUV with explosives was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's south Mumbai residence 'Antilia' and the subsequent death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.Singh was then appointed as Director General, Home Guards, following which he accused then Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption, a charge the latter denied.Deshmukh later stepped down as minister and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case against him based on Singh's allegations. Param Bir Singh was last seen in public on April 7, when he appeared before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in Mumbai to record statement in the Antilia bomb scare case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disclose-whereabouts-supreme-court-tells-param-bir-singh-101637221157450.html
18-11-2021||India||‘Hard decisions’ if denied BJP ticket: Manohar Parrikar’s son||Utpal Parrikar, son of late former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, warned on Thursday that he may have to take “hard decisions” if he is denied ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket to contest assembly elections from Panaji even as he was ‘fully confident’ that he would get it. Manohar Parrikar represented the seat for over 25 years.“I have already told the party that I wish to contest the elections from Panjim and I am fully confident that the party will give me a ticket,” said Utpal Parrikar.Atanasio Monserrate, who represents the seat, defected to the BJP along with nine other lawmakers, who won the 2017 elections on Congress’s tickets.Utpal Parrikar said it was not the time to speak about it when asked to elaborate on what he intended to do in case he is denied the ticket for the polls due next year. “I do not need to speak about that now. Manohar Parrikar did not get anything easy in his life. Similarly, I too will have to work for what I want. I may also be forced to make some hard decisions and I pray for the strength... I (need)...to take these decisions.” He added he may also stay with the BJP to fight. “When the time comes to make a decision, I will listen to the people. I have told the party and the party will give me (the ticket). I am confident.”Utpal Parrikar, who visited a temple where a group of supporters wished him, was in contention for the BJP ticket for the by-election when his father passed away in 2019. But the ticket eventually went to Siddharth Kuncalienkar, who had resigned to allow Manohar Parrikar to contest when he returned to the state after a stint at the Centre as the defence minister to take over as Goa chief minister again. BJP allies sought Manohar Parrikar’s return as a condition to support the BJP in forming the government.After minister Francis D’Souza passed away, the BJP gave the ticket to Joshua to contest the by-election from Mapusa.State BJP chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that decisions regarding the party’s tickets are taken by the parliamentary board. “Anyone can stake a claim for the party’s ticket. The decision is ultimately taken by the party’s parliamentary board and not at the local level. I met him (Utpal Parrikar) recently we did not discuss anything about the ticket,” Tanavade said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hard-decisions-if-denied-bjp-ticket-manohar-parrikar-s-son-101637221202347.html

18-11-2021||India||Let’s ensure cryptocurrency doesn’t end up in wrong hands, says PM Modi||Modern technologies have the potential to be used as instruments of conflict and domination, and democratic nations should work together on cryptocurrency to ensure it does not end up in the wrong hands, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday.India has created a “robust framework of data protection, privacy and security”, and is using data to empower people within a democratic framework with strong guarantees of individual rights, Modi said in a virtual keynote address at the Sydney Dialogue organised by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.Describing technology and data as “new weapons”, Modi said: “Technology has already become a major instrument of global competition and key to shaping the future international order...The biggest strength of democracy is openness. At the same time, we should not allow a few vested interests to misuse this openness.”While it is essential for democracies to work together to develop governance standards and norms consistent with democratic values, this process should recognise national rights and promote the larger public good, he said.Also Read: Cryptocurrency crash: Bitcoin drops below $60,000, Ether falls“Take cryptocurrency or Bitcoin for example. It is important that all democratic nations work together on this and ensure it does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth,” he said.Modi added, “We are at a historic moment of choice – whether all the wonderful powers of technology of our age will be instruments of cooperation or conflict, coercion or choice, domination or development, oppression or opportunity. India, Australia and our partners in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond hear the call of our times.”The prime minister’s remarks came five days after he chaired a meeting on the way forward on cryptocurrency, during which the issue of misleading non-transparent advertising on cryptocurrency was flagged. Officials had also warned that such unregulated markets cannot be allowed to become avenues for money laundering and terror financing.The government is considering strong regulatory steps and planning to forge global partnerships and collective strategies since the issue cuts across geographical borders.Describing data as the “greatest product of technology”, Modi said India has “created a robust framework of data protection, privacy and security”, and also has unmatched experience in using data to empower people within a democratic framework with strong guarantees of individual rights.He suggested democracies should come together to build a future that reflects democratic values by investing in research and development of future technology, developing a trusted manufacturing base and trusted supply chains, and deepening intelligence and operational cooperation on cybersecurity and protection of critical information infrastructure.Democracies should also work jointly to prevent manipulation of public opinions, develop technical and governance standards and norms consistent with democratic values, and create standards and norms for data governance and for cross-border flow that protect and secure data, he said.ACHIEVEMENTS IN FIVE AREASModi also listed India’s achievements in five key areas related to technology. He said the country is building the world’s most extensive public information infrastructure, and more than 1.3 billion Indians have a unique digital identity.“We are on our way to connect 600,000 villages with broadband. We have built the world’s most efficient payment infrastructure, the UPI. Over 800 million Indians use internet, 750 million are on smartphones,” he added.Secondly, India is transforming the lives of people by using digital technology for governance, inclusion, empowerment, connectivity, delivery of benefits and welfare. “Recently, we have used technology to deliver over 1.1 billion doses of vaccines, across India’s vast geography using Arogya Setu and CoWIN platforms,” he said.Third, India has the world’s third largest and fastest growing startup ecosystem that is providing solutions to everything from health to national security, and fourth, industry, services and agriculture are undergoing a “massive digital transformation”.The fifth key area listed by Modi was preparing India for the future by investing in indigenous capabilities in telecom technology such as 5G and 6G. “India is one of the leading nations in artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in human-centred and ethical use of artificial intelligence. We are developing strong capabilities in cloud platforms and cloud computing,” he said.All of this is key to resilience and digital sovereignty, and India’s space programme is now open to innovation and investment from the private sector.“India is already a major centre for providing cybersecurity solutions and services to corporates around the world. We have set up a task force with our industry to make India a global hub for cyber security,” he said.India is also preparing a package of incentives to become a key manufacturer of semiconductors and the country’s production-linked incentive schemes in electronics and telecom have attracted local and global players, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lets-ensure-cryptocurrency-doesn-t-end-up-in-wrong-hands-says-pm-modi-101637218020523.html

The Jammu and Kashmir administration reiterates its commitment of protecting lives of innocent civilians and it will ensure there is no injustice,” Sinha said on Thursday.Also Read| Hyderpora encounter: ‘My son was killed under a conspiracy’On Monday, a Pakistani terrorist, his associate Aamir Magray and two civilians - Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Mudasir Gul - were killed in the encounter in the Hyderpora area of Srinagar.While Bhat was the owner of the shopping complex where the encounter happened, Gul was one of the building's tenants.Families of Bhat, Gul and Magray have claimed the deceased people were innocent and demanded their bodies be returned. On Wednesday, protests were held at several places across the valley demanding an inquiry into their deaths.However, the J-K police maintained that Gul was an active associate of militants and was running the call centre on the premises owned by Altaf.Inspector general of police (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said on Tuesday that Bhat was killed in cross-firing with the terrorists. However, even as expressed regret over his death, Kumar added that Bhat would be counted among the "harbourers" of militants.Also Read| Hyderpora encounter: Mehbooba Mufti says her stir against killing of innocentsMeanwhile, as the protests intensified on Wednesday, National Conference (NC) patron Farooq Abdullah had a telephonic conversation with Sinha and had apprised him of the situation."I informed the LG about the contradictory statements made by the police. On Monday, they are civilians trapped in crossfire and Tuesday they are harbourers of terror. If they had so much of the so-called inputs about the deceased on Tuesday, they could have shared on Monday. This is a cooked-up story and needs to be probed," Abdullah was quoted as saying by news agency PTI on Wednesday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-govt-orders-magisterial-probe-into-controversial-hyderpora-encounter-101637215691880.html
18-11-2021||India||Supreme Court orders CBI probe into HZL stake sale in 2002||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a court-monitored Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the initial stake sale of Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) to Anil Agarwal-run Sterlite Opportunities and Ventures Ltd (SOVL) in 2002 when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was in power.A bench, led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, allowed the union government to disinvest its remaining shareholding of 29.5% in HZL since the company was no more a government-held company. It directed the CBI should register a regular case into the 2002 sale and submit its reports to the court quarterly.The court cited a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India besides other instances and added there were “sufficient materials on record” to conduct a full-fledged investigation into the bidding process and valuation of shares and assets of HZL.A preliminary inquiry was started by the CBI in November 2013 to look into alleged corrupt practices. But the government informed the top court that the case was closed since there was no evidence of criminality.In 2002, the Centre decided to divest its controlling shares in HZL.Also Read: Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra challenges CBI, ED Ordinances in top courtAn association of officers related to the public sector undertaking filed a plea alleging illegalities in the disinvestment for benefits to a few by undervaluing the shares. It asked for a CBI probe into the deal and restraining the government from further divesting its share. The petition pointed out that the final decision to close the case was taken even though several officers of the CBI recommended the registration of a regular case for further inquiry.HZL was incorporated as a public sector firm in 1996. The NDA government in August 2000 decided to disinvest 26% of its equity through a strategic sale. Sterlite Industries emerged as the highest bidder, offering ₹40.5 per share for the government’s stake. The transaction was completed in April 2002.Further, as part of the “call option” part of the deal, the government further divested around 19% stake at the same price to the private entity in November 2003. Through this two-phase transaction, the government sold 45% of its stake in the firm for around ₹769 crore.The Madras high court in 2012 approved the Scheme of Amalgamation of SOV with Sterlite Industries (India) Limited owned by Vedanta Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-orders-cbi-probe-into-hzl-stake-sale-in-2002-101637216520438.html

18-11-2021||India||SC sets aside Bombay HC ruling that held 'skin-to-skin contact' key for sexual assault||The Supreme Court on Thursday set aside a verdict of the Bombay high court that said skin-to-skin contact was a necessary ingredient for punishing persons accused of sexually assaulting minors.The apex court said the most important ingredient in convicting sexual offenders under POCSO Act is "sexual intent and not skin-to-skin".In a controversial ruling, the HC had acquitted a man of sexual assault charges under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for groping a 12-year-old child.The top court directed the accused to surrender in four weeks and undergo a punishment of three years and five years punishment as awarded by the Special POCSO court.Earlier in January, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court had set aside the conviction of a man who was found guilty under the POCSO Act for groping a 12-year-old girl four years ago, commuting his punishment.The court had ruled that it could not be deemed an offence under the Pocso Act because there had been no skin-to-skin contact with sexual intent as the child was clothed. "Admittedly, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast. As such, there is no direct physical contact i.e. skin to skin with sexual intent without penetration," the court observed on January 19.Therefore, the court acquitted the accused under Section 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the POCSO Act. However, the court maintained his conviction under Sections 354 (assault of criminal force) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC, and said that the act which he committed amounted to the use of criminal force to outrage her modesty.The punishment for sexual assault under Section 8 of the POCSO Act is imprisonment of three to five years. Whereas, the punishment under Section 354 of IPC is imprisonment of one to five years.The matter was taken up by the top court after Attorney general KK Venugopal had urged the top court to reverse the judgement, saying it was a "very disturbing conclusion" and it would set a dangerous precedent. The country’s top law officer also said that going by the approach of the high court, anybody can get away with a sexual assault offence by wearing surgical gloves.Subsequently, appeals challenging the judgment were filed by the National Commission for Women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sets-aside-bombay-hc-ruling-that-held-skin-to-skin-contact-key-for-sexual-assault-101637214891216.html

18-11-2021||India||PM Modi to host President Putin for one-to-one meeting on Dec 6||Joining hands to tackle new challenges affecting strategic stability at regional and global levels, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host Russian President Vladimir Putin for a one-to-one bilateral meeting followed by dinner at his Lok Kalyan Marg (LKM) residence on December 6.As in his previous visit to Delhi on October 5, 2018, President Putin will focus on hardcore discussions with PM Modi on Afghanistan, Indo-Pacific, strategic stability, climate change, Middle-East and terrorism at LKM residence without going through elaborate ceremonial routines. Last time, a small tent was put inside the PM’s residence, where the two friends had close discussions over Indian delicacies with only the presence of interpreters. The two plus two dialogues between India and Russian defence and external affairs ministers is expected to be held on the same day before the summit.While President Putin’s visit is expected to last for a few hours due to raging Covid situation in Russia, it could be extended as the discussions between the two leaders - who have close personal chemistry - are known to continue for hours, into wee hours of the morning.Although India and Russia are going to sign several agreements on that day, the two countries are unfazed about the orchestrated brouhaha over the Modi government acquiring the much-needed S-400 missile systems from Moscow. While the media reports every time India engages the US or Russia threaten that Washington will impose sanctions citing CATSA Act on New Delhi, the Modi government has had lengthy discussions with the Biden administration on the issue to mutual understanding of each other’s positions. The relevance of S-400 systems to India assumes much importance now as Chinese PLA has already deployed the same Russian systems at Ngari Gar Gunsa airbase, next to Demchok on Ladakh LAC, and at Nyingchi airbase next to Arunachal Pradesh LAC. The PLA as of now is fully deployed at the Ladakh LAC with no less than three divisions of troops, missiles, and rocket regiments with the Air Force on standby. China has deployed two S-400 systems towards India and three towards protecting Beijing and the East coast against Taiwan. It is already in discussion with the Russians to acquire the S-500 systems which is in last stages of development.“One must understand that the purchase of five S-400 systems was contracted early in 2018 when other options were not on the table. It is a must requirement to counter China which has a formidable arsenal on the LAC since May 2020,” said a former foreign secretary in knowledge of the issue.Although PM Modi and President Putin are known to have sweeping discussions over regional and global events, the key focus this time would be stabilization of Afghanistan under the Taliban rule as there is a strong possibility of present Kabul chaos spilling over to the Central Asian Republics and even Pakistan. The rise of ISKP and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan due to no governance experience of the Taliban will not only rally around all the Islamic jihadists to Kabul but also spark off radicalization all over the globe particularly in neighboring countries. Both India and Russia believe that the Taliban first much secure legitimacy within Afghanistan before seeking international recognition.The other major topic of discussion will be Indo-Pacific as new shipping routes to Europe via Arctic Circle will open due to climate change and in this context the discussion will be centered on the Chinese and the US posture in East Asia. Although Russia has close relations with China, Moscow has its own strategic perception of its global status as it has the capacity and capability to stand alone.Just as Russia has good ties with China, India has also excellent ties with the US but the basic equation between age old special strategic partners allies has not changed and under PM Modi will not change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-host-president-putin-for-one-to-one-meeting-on-dec-6-101637211530863.html

18-11-2021||India||Use technology to prevent diversion of funds, CVC tells banks||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has asked banks to use technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), to create profiles and understand the lifestyles of their borrower customers so that any diversion of funds can be identified at an advanced stage in the future, people familiar with the matter said.The apex vigilance body believes that a large number of high-value frauds take place not only due to disregard of systems and procedures in lending but also because banks fail to monitor the usage of loaned money.“The banks have been asked to take advantage of AI to track the usage so that a red flag is raised where there is any abnormality in the operation of the loan account, and money is being diverted. A thorough analysis is required particularly in those cases where large transfers are reported in overseas branches,” said an officer, requesting anonymity.Investigations into high-value frauds reported in the past five-six years have found that accused persons splurged on purchasing bungalows, jets, helicopters, yachts, jewellery, high-end cars and properties abroad using the public money, which was otherwise supposed to be used for the business activity mentioned while taking loans.Vijay Mallya owned a luxury private jet, yachts including one of the largest in the world, a villa in Goa, where he reportedly organised parties, apart from several prime properties in the UK, France and the US, while banks kept on waiting for him to return the money. He owes ₹9,000 crore to Indian banks.Similarly, Nirav Modi used the bank money in properties such as a sea-facing apartment in Worli, a Rolls Royce worth ₹5 crore, art collecting worth several dozen crores, flat in New York, and other countries apart from high-profile launch parties for his brand. Mehul Choksi too diverted his money abroad in the US and Antigua and Barbuda, where he currently resides as a citizen. Nirav Modi and Choksi and are accused of cheating Punjab National Bank of ₹13,578 crore.Banks failed to monitor and analyse these activities, which could help in alerting about fraud at an early stage, said a second officer.Among the problems noticed by the CVC in handling/approval of loans is same officers are made members of different finance/sanctioning committees.“Another glaring issue noticed by CVC is the considerable delay in declaration of frauds by various banks in cases of consortium/multiple financing, which not only enables the borrower to defraud the banking system to a large extent but also allows him considerable time to erase the money trail,” said the first official cited above.CVC has advised the banks “to give priority for the prevention of frauds at every level through the use of technology and discreet inquiries.It has asked them to continue loan recovery efforts even after lodging complaints with the Central Bureau of Investigation and other agencies.“It was also advised that the Internal Advisory Committee of the banks should consider the role and responsibility of each official while categorising the matter as vigilance and non-vigilance,” said the first official.CVC has asked the probe agencies to improve the quality of investigation by providing adequate training to the investigating officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-technology-to-prevent-diversion-of-funds-cvc-tells-banks-101637207761069.html

In a letter to the management, the pilots have demanded payment as per market standards, while the airline awaits handover to the Tata Group, its new owner.The Air India pilots listed a number of demands, including the release of 25% arrears along with interest, a statement of gratuity, an option of leave encashment, medical benefits for permanent employees, tax-related implications of withheld layover substance allowance, and the release of pending grades to first officers.Also Read: India, Singapore in talks to resume commercial flights soon: ReportThe pilots wrote they gave “more than enough” time to the Air India management to resolve the issues listed. “It is inexcusable that even now, when we are in the 11th and a half hour before the disinvestment process [is completed], there is not even a concrete roadmap, let alone a satisfactory resolution,” the pilots wrote in the letter dated November 17.“The shareholders’ agreement has been signed, the Tatas have to fully take over the company and start flying by January 22, 2022, and service conditions are already being adversely changed... Yet, the management’s silence on our service conditions and arrears is deafening,” said one of the protesting pilots. The pilots’ letter, addressed to Air India’s former chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal who is currently civil aviation secretary, read, “This state of affairs is no longer tenable. If we do not see the issues… addressed and communicated to us, we will have no choice but to seek justice through ‘industrial action’.” “Any disruption of operations and its fallout will be attributable to director personnel, who are directly responsible for the abysmal management of these HR issues,” the pilots warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-pilots-warn-of-industrial-action-if-payment-issues-aren-t-resolved-101637207099796.html

Since Army Chief MM Naravane is in Israel on an official visit, Vice Chief Mohanty attended the ceremony."The new memorial is like a place of worship and true homage to soldiers who gave excellent account of themselves, worth a visit," said a senior Army commander.The original war memorial - a column - was constructed by the 3, divisional headquarters of the Indian Army. This is the first major revamp, and was undertaken by the Modi government.The war memorial was inaugurated on the 59th anniversary of the Rezang La battle when Major Shaitan Singh and 98 of his men from the Charlie company of 13 Kumaon Battalion laid their lives in defence of the Chushul-Dungti-Leh axis in Ladakh sector.The Shaitan company inflicted so many losses on nearly 400 PLA troops that the Chinese took no prisoners of war at Rezang La on November 18, 1962. The Rezang La battle was fought in freezing temperatures way below zero. Temperatures in Chushul heights are known to touch minus 25 degrees Celsius and more.According to the official history of the 1962 war, the Chinese attack began at 4am on November 18 with the intention of blocking the road link between Leh and Chushul via Dungti so that the garrison at Chushul was isolated and starved of supplies. The last Indian guns sounded at 10pm on November 18 with only 14 out of 112 ranks surviving to tell the tale.Major Shaitan Singh and his company major first fought with three-inch mortars, then rifles, bayonets and bare hands without any artillery or air support against the marauding Chinese who attacked the post from two sides.The move to inaugurate the revamped war memorial in Rezang La is seen as India's show of strength in the area which is very close to the Chinese territory and is visible from the other side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1962-bravest-of-braves-honoured-at-new-rezang-la-memorial-101637203741972.html

The panel had issued summons to Facebook India to depose its views on the role of social media in preventing the spread of false and malicious messages that can cause disharmony and affect peace.Meta Inc., Facebook’s parent company, has long been accused of not doing enough to prevent misinformation on its social media platforms.

18-11-2021||India||Didn’t introduce ‘phase down’ in COP26 statement, clarifies India||India did not introduce the phrase “phase down” in the Glasgow Climate Pact text, senior officials aware of the negotiations at the COP26 said on Wednesday, rejecting criticism that Delhi was instrumental in watering down a tough stance on phasing out coal to fight the climate crisis.The controversy relates to the change of the phrase “phase out” to “phase down” in the context of using coal. Sources in the Indian delegation previously have said India opposed hard targets on phasing out coal as well as other fossil fuels like gas and oil, but was particularly opposed to the singling out of coal alone, which is still among the key sources of energy for developing nations.Officials aware of the mater on Wednesday said environment minister Bhupender Yadav, representing India, read out the reworded text because the COP26 Presidency requested the Indian side to do so, and it was required in the interest of achieving a consensus at COP26.COP26 president Alok Sharma, in an interview to Guardian recently, said India and China will “have to explain themselves to poor nations” for their stance on coal. He also said he was deeply frustrated with Delhi’s and Beijing’s attitude.Earlier during the formal plenary for Glasgow Climate Pact, Sharma said he was deeply sorry for the way negotiations ended, while holding back tears.“Phase out” was recommended by small island countries, Indian officials said on Tuesday. “The initial text had “phase out” for both coal and fossil fuel subsidies which we did not agree with. It’s our basic position in any case. But we did not introduce the phrase ‘phase down.’ We had problem with the language on coal and phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies. We did not agree to that language which they kept pushing till the end,” said one of the senior officials.India’s problem, they reiterated, was not with phase out or phase down but introducing equity and safeguards on fossil fuel subsidies for the poor. On the last day (November 13) phase out got modified to phase down because there was that language on the table that came out of the US-China joint statement.“It was evolved following discussions between Presidency which is the UK side, US, China, India and EU. The chair (Alok Sharma) has to steer these discussions. It’s the chair’s duty to steer it towards consensus. We agreed to the amendments. The reason why we read out the text is because we were asked to by the Presidency. When you look at the proceedings you will feel that this is India’s language, but we only read out the statement. We were trying to help achieve a consensus. We also wanted to introduce certain safeguards and had some concerns. We did not have a strong objection to the phrase ‘phase down’ either because we were trying to find a language to ensure an outcome for COP itself,” the first official said.India was pushing for consensus because, the official explained, “if we did not have the cover decision, then none of the other documents (including rulebook on carbon markets) would move ahead. Therefore, it was in our interest to achieve a consensus. Phasing out of coal and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies we do not have a problem as such, but it should be qualified,” he added.Another official pointed out that instead of the chair (Alok Sharma) presenting it, which is the norm to read out the text, the chair chose to request India to read out the compromise text. Yadav was clear during his intervention that it was not India’s position alone but in consultation with the presidency and other stakeholders.“We are dependent on coal, we probably have to enhance it and we are giving subsidies to poor people to help them have a basic subsistence level. To compare that with general utilisation, 20 times of the kind of energy (used) in some developed countries, is unfair,”the second official said.Officials also said India did not subscribe to picking and choosing one fossil fuel, that is coal, over the others. “They (developed countries) used coal as much as they could and now they have transitioned to gas and oil. EU for example is highly dependent on gas. But now they are singling out coal which the developing nations are dependent on,” said one of the officials.“The amendments to the text, such as targeted support to the poorest and the most vulnerable, in line with national circumstances, and recognising the need for support towards a just transition were India’s contribution. We wanted a constructive and positive approach which must have the principle of equity. Our delegation would have lived with ‘phase out.’ Our Ujjwala scheme is also fossil fuel subsidy meant for poor so we wanted to build in those safeguards,” said the second official.He also mentioned that many countries had a problem with any language on coal and fossil fuels: South Africa, Australia, Indonesia, Venezuela and China. The words “unabated” coal and “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies were introduced because other countries had problems with the first text. “There is no new unabated coal in India, they are coming with new technology checks. There are countries where fossil fuel subsidies are not targeted to the poor but in India the case is different,” he added.Overall officials said they were disappointed with the outcome at COP26 with respect to climate finance but the rulebook on carbon markets had been concluded and India’s concerns of pending credits from Kyoto era has been addressed. India also managed to introduce the phrase “deep regret” in the Glasgow Climate Pact. The text states that it “notes with deep regret that the goal of developed country parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been met.”“It’s very strong language. The text says that the amount will be delivered through 2025 and the text concludes that there will be a structured time bound process on evolving the new collective quantitative goal for post 2025,” the second official said.Overall COP26 has been a success for India, experts said. “The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) is enshrined in the UNFCCC. Even the Paris Agreement has reaffirmed CBDR which is the fundamental principle of UNFCCC. More importantly, ‘phase down’ is the same word used in the US-China agreement presented in Glasgow. India has huge development imperatives but we have also made huge commitments on renewables. India’s intervention was a directional statement and India is making efforts to achieve it. There is no vast difference between phase out and phase down,” said Manjeev Singh Puri, former negotiator and ambassador had said on Monday responding to India’s stand at COP26.The officials added that what PM, Narendra Modi presented at COP 26 were national goals for India but not a nationally determined contribution (NDC) yet. “PM did not mention NDCs, they are national goals. At some point we expect that we will send an NDC which will incorporate some or many of the goals that PM announced in Glasgow. Let’s not prejudge them as NDCs.”During his address to over 120 heads of countries in Glasgow on November 1, PM Modi said India will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030; fulfil 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030; reduce its total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. PM Modi said he expects developed countries to make $ 1 trillion available as climate finance to developing countries to make this transition to decarbonisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/didnt-introduce-phase-down-in-cop-26-statement-clarifies-india-101637196023549.html

On an average basis, this comes to 23% although the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels has come down in the last few days. From November 14 to November 17, its contribution was 12%, 10%, 8% and 6%.The farm fire analysis is based on a study of VIIRS-SNP satellite data by a NASA scientist, who said that while daily numbers have begun to reduce, it is unclear whether the 2016 record will remain unbroken – and if fires continue, the threat of bad air continues to loom over Delhi.An analysis of past air quality data and farm fires at the time published by HT on Tuesday showed that , stubble burning serves to push the AQI into the very poor (300-400) or severe (400-500) category, once winter conditions already make local pollution worse.For instance, between October 20 and November 14 this year, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) has been in the severe zone on seven days. On each of these days, the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 contribution was between 26% and 48%.Also read | Delhi’s model to tackle pollution unrealistic, claims Punjab BJPPawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association (USRA), who carried out the farm fire data analysis, said: “While the numbers have started to dip, the daily count is still over 1,000, which is still high. This is now the second-worst year ever, but we will have to see whether this trend continues in the next two weeks or not”.Till November 16, Punjab recorded 74,015 farm fire counts, compared to 72,373 in the same period last year. In 2016, the figure stood at 84,886.A similar analysis carried out by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) showed the farm fire count for the same period in Punjab, Haryana and UP has collectively touched 85,604 fires – more than 5,000 up in the same period last year. This total also is now the second-highest behind 2016, when 104,605 fires were recorded.Haryana too continues to record alarming figures, with CEEW data showing 8,663 fires spotted from satellites between October 1 and November 16, nearly double than last year’s figure of 4,831.“While the number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana combined was recorded at just 20,723 until the 31st of October, it has increased four times to 82,870 in the first half of November. With the season’s close approaching, fire counts are now expected to start dipping in the coming days,” said LS Kurinji, programme associate at CEEW.She said with Punjab’s figure now eclipsing last year’s count, there is also a need to carry out an ex-post policy analysis to identify why the figure continues to remain high.S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said a majority of the area under paddy cultivation in the state had already been harvested, with very little left still. “We are tracking each district, as per CAQM’s guidelines and using the ISRO satellite numbers. Our numbers show the fire count total is only around 6,000 fires. Very little area in Haryana is now left for harvest,” he said.K Garg, member secretary, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) also cited ISRO’s satellite figures, and claimed the fire count this year has been lower than last year.“The data shows last year, the fire numbers were around 79,000 till this time, whereas the count so far according to us is 69,000. The burnt area is also lesser this year,” said Garg, stating fire count had reduced considerably in Punjab. “It is only a matter of a few days now,” he added.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said Punjab has seen a late spike in numbers this year, making it difficult to predict when the numbers will reduce. “Generally, we see a sharp drop after November 15. We will see a clearer trend by next week,” she said.(with inputs from Abhishek Jha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stubble-fires-go-past-2020-tally-rise-four-fold-since-november-1-101637187045437.html
18-11-2021||India||Hyderpora encounter: ‘My son was killed under a conspiracy’||Family of Mohammad Aamir Magray, a local associate of the Pakistani terrorist killed during the Hyderpora encounter, on Wednesday demanded a thorough probe into his death and sought his burial at their ancestral graveyard in Gool area of Ramban district. His father Mohammad Lateef Magray said, “We are true Indians and my son can never think of becoming a militant.” “I appeal Jammu and Kashmir LG to give me justice. I am an Indian, who has been feted for my counter-insurgency work. I have taken bullets on my chest but my son was declared a militant, which is totally false. He was killed under a conspiracy…he was a patriot and a true nationalist like me,” he added. “We were given security for 15 years for our anti-terror work. My son had gone to do labour in Srinagar but some wrong source took money and labelled him a militant . Therefore, I want a thorough probe into it. I also appeal the authorities to hand over the body of my son,” Aamir’s father said. His elder sister Momina Begum said, “My younger brother worked in an office in Hyderpora where he prepared tea and tended to work. We used to live together. Had he been a militant, I would have never kept him with me.” Prohibitory orders imposed in GoolMeanwhile, additional district magistrate of Ramban, Harbans Lal Sharma on Wednesday imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in order to maintain law and order in Famrote, Sangaldan and Seripura areas of Gool subdivision till further orders. “The prohibitory orders have been imposed as a precautionary measure to pre-empt any possible law and order trouble,” he said. Two Kashmiri Pandit bodies lend support to kin of slain civiliansTwo Kashmiri Pandit bodies, one comprising migrant Pandits and another who did not migrate from Kashmir, have come forward in support of the families of two civilians.Reconciliation, Return and Rehabilitation of Migrants said the families of two of the four persons killed in Monday’s gunfight have categorically disputed the police version. The association’s chairperson, Satish Mahaldar, said that the ultimate aim of criminal law is protection of the right to personal liberty against invasion by others – protection of the weak against the lawless perpetrators.“In the case of the Hyderpora incident, it appears to be the case of utter selfishness, greed and intolerance that lead to the deprivation of life, liberty and property of other citizens requiring the state to step in for protection of the citizens’ rights,” he added. ‘Move beyond Twitter condemnations’“Time has come for those who have given the new slogan Hindustaniyat instead of Kashmiriyat to hand over bodies of the citizens who got killed recently in Srinagar,” said Sanjay Tickoo, president of Srinagar-based KPSS. He said it is easy to label people in Kashmir by “state and non-state actors” who are then endorsed by people from different camps. “You label him an OGW (over the ground worker of militants), a mukhbir (informer of security agencies) or an IB agent or a Jan Sanghi and we as citizens die. Makhan Lal Bindroo was also given a particular tag,” he said. Bindroo, a 68-year-old Kashmiri Pandit and prominent Srinagar chemist, was killed by suspected militants last month.Tickoo asked the mainstream leaders from the NC, the PDP, the Congress, the Peoples Conference and others to move beyond ‘Twitter condemnations’.

18-11-2021||India||Centre constitutes panel for promotion of Indian languages||The Centre has constituted a ‘high-powered’ committee to explore and recommend pathways for the promotion and growth of Indian languages as envisaged in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The committee will also suggest ways to improve studies of Indian languages in both schools and higher education institutions.The committee will be chaired by Chamu Krishna Shastry, an educationist and founding member of RSS-affiliated NGO Samskrita Bharati whose mission is to revive the Sanskrit language. Shastry had earlier worked as an advisor to the ministry of education. According to a communication sent by the ministry to Shastry on Sunday and shared on its official website on Wednesday, there will be three other members in the panel including the vice-chancellor of Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri National Sanskrit University, New Delhi, Ramesh Kumar Pandey.The panel has been tasked with a mandate to study the existing institutional set up and suggest “ways for improvement of study of Indian Languages” in both schools and higher education institutions in the country. It will also recommend ways to “revamp, consolidate and integrate” the existing set up to ensure best utilization of existing language teaching facilities in educational institutions for development of Indian Languages.It will also cover all categories of languages including scheduled, endangered, non-scheduled, minor, tribal, classical languages, among others. “(It will) recommend ways for making available technological tools and labs in various languages for the benefit of students and researchers...and ways to improve employability of language students as well as ways to improve employment opportunities by learning global languages as a skill,” the communication added. The committee will closely coordinate with various student centric initiatives of the Ministry like Innovation Cell, and Indian Knowledge System. It will have the authority to appoint sub-committees and assign them tasks. NEP 2020 advocates promotion of Indian languages and recommends that efforts should be taken to preserve and promote all Indian languages including classical, tribal and endangered languages will be taken on with new vigour. Earlier this month, the Centre had asked all universities in the country to translate their learning material and literature into all Indian languages as a part of the government’s Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav (AKAM) celebration to mark 75 years of India’s independence. The universities have been asked to chalk out plans with a timeline by November 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-constitutes-panel-for-promotion-of-indian-languages-101637178957499.html
18-11-2021||India||Parents of murdered Odisha school teacher move court to seek quicker probe||Bhubaneswar: The parents of Mamita Meher, the schoolteacher of Kalahandi district allegedly murdered and buried by the president of the school’s managing committee last month, have filed a petition in Orissa High Court seeking a quicker trial in the case.Meher. 26 was allegedly killed by Gobind Sahu, president of the managing committee of Sunshine English medium school in Mahaling grampanchayat of Kalahandi district on October 8 after she allegedly threatened to expose him. Sahu is alleged to have dismembered the body, burnt it and buried it an under-construction stadium near the school. He was arrested on October 19 and is now in judicial custody.Since then, the opposition BJP and Congress has been stridently demanding sacking of minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra from the Naveen Patnaik ministry because he was believed to be close to the Kalahandi school official Sahu.On Wednesday, Mishra rubbished allegations that he was linked to the case and accused Gobinda Sahu.Addressing a public meeting in Kalahandi, Mishra said his name was dragged into the case by weaving a fictional story.“I have served in the Indian Air Force as a fighter pilot. I am a law-abiding citizen. I am the president of the governing body of Mahaling College and the prime accused in Mamita Meher murder case, Gobinda Sahu, happened to be a member of that body. Just because I represent this assembly constituency, I cannot be held responsible for a murder in which I am in no way involved,” he said, underlining that chief minister Naveen Patnaik has never spared anyone found guilty and ultimately truth will triumph despite the ‘malicious campaign’ against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parents-of-murdered-odisha-school-teacher-move-court-to-seek-quicker-probe-101637178898481.html
18-11-2021||India||ED approaches Supreme Court for custodial interrogation of Chandra brothers||The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court for permission to take custody of former Unitech promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra since the top court, while shifting them to Mumbai jails, required them to be produced during trial through video conferencing facility.ED request was mentioned before a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah by additional solicitor general (ASG) Madhavi Divan. The court told ED to file an application and said it will take it up on Wednesday.ASG Divan read out the August 26 order of the top court shifting the Chandra brothers out of Tihar jail to Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail and Taloja Jail where it said, “The video conferencing facility at the jails to which the accused are being transferred shall be made available so as to enable them to record their presence in the court proceedings where their presence is required.”Divan said the federal anti-money laundering agency requires the custody of the Chandra brothers for interrogation. “After they are physically produced, we will be arresting them for custodial interrogation,” the government law officer said. She said Mumbai prison authorities are reluctant and are willing to do so virtually. On the virtual medium, confronting evidence is not possible.”Advocate Shradha Deshmukh, assisting the ASG, produced an order passed by a Delhi court on November 12 directing the physical production of the Chandra brothers for November 17. When they did not appear, ED decided to approach the top court for clarification.“You have to submit an application and tell us what you wish to do. We can then pass an order,” the bench told Divan. Till such time, the judges suggested ED to postpone the hearing before the Delhi court. The Chandra brothers, lodged earlier at Tihar Jail in Delhi were shifted to Mumbai after ED came to know about an illegal nexus between the accused and the jail authorities in dissipating proceeds of crime and influencing witnesses in the case. An investigation was ordered based on ED inputs and the then Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana submitted a confidential report to the Supreme Court that confirmed ED allegations and identified 32 jail officials who were allegedly involved.ED began its inquiry against Chandra brothers after a Supreme Court-mandated forensic audit of Unitech conducted in 2018 revealed that part of the ₹14,000 crore invested by nearly 30,000 homebuyers in 74 Unitech housing projects was laundered to offshore shell companies. ED has since managed to attach crime proceeds worth ₹7,638 crore and arrested Sanjay Chandra’s wife and his father in connection with the case as well.The top court is monitoring the probe against the former Unitech promoters being conducted by multiple agencies; ED, Delhi Police and Serious Fraud Investigation Office. The case was last heard on November 10 when the top court directed the agencies to submit a status report on probe in four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-approaches-supreme-court-for-custodial-interrogation-of-chandra-brothers-101637177458105.html
18-11-2021||India||Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra challenges CBI, ED Ordinances in top court||All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) parliamentarian Mahua Moitra has approached the Supreme Court challenging the twin Ordinances issued by the Centre allowing the heads of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Directorate of Enforcement (ED) to remain in office for up to five years.The petition by Moitra has attacked the two Ordinances -- Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance and Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance on four grounds – legislative incompetence, circumventing the Supreme Court order of September 8 directing extension of ED Director only in “rare and exceptional circumstances”, independence of investigation agencies, and malafide attached to government decision.The TMC MP, in her petition said that the CBI Director and Director, Enforcement have a fixed minimum tenure of two years protected by the 1997 Supreme Court decision in the Vineet Narain case.On September 8 the Supreme Court had upheld the Government’s decision to grant a one-year extension to the incumbent ED Director but with a rider stating that such “extension of tenure granted to officers who have attained the age of superannuation should be done only in rare and exceptional cases”.The petition said, “Executive cannot nullify a judgment of this Court through an executive act, like an Ordinance….The CVC (Amendment) thus suffers from legislative incompetence.” She further stated, “A one-year period cannot be termed as a short extension in view of the fact that the total tenure of both CBI and ED Directors is contemplated as two years in law.”By the present Ordinances under challenge, amendments have been made to Section 25 of the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 and Section 4B of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. The twin amendments allow the Centre to extend the original tenure of CBI, ED chiefs by one year at a time. The amendment to both the Acts suggests, “No such extension shall be granted after the completion of five years in total, including the period sanctioned in the initial appointment.”The Ordinances further require that the extension should be in “public interest”, backed by the recommendation of the respective appointment committees with reasons for such extension, to be recorded in writing. The ED Director is appointed on recommendation by a committee headed by the central vigilance commissioner (CVC) while a high-powered committee (HPC) headed by Prime Minister and comprising Chief Justice of India (or his nominee) and leader of largest opposition party in Lok Sabha, recommend the CBI Director.The petition states that the standard of “public interest” is very “vague and significantly broader” than the standard of “rare and exceptional” as prescribed by the top court in September. The SC had held, “Any extension of tenure granted to persons holding the post of Director of Enforcement after attaining the age of superannuation should be for a short period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-mp-mahua-moitra-challenges-cbi-ed-ordinances-in-top-court-101637176676785.html
18-11-2021||India||Bangalore Talkies: Do women in power make you uncomfortable?||In Bengaluru where many of the top IT companies thrive, DEI or diversity, equity and inclusion have become watchwords. How do women handle this?Some time ago, at the Bengaluru book launch of “Women of the records,” musician Ricky Kej made an interesting observation-- which in turn prompted fellow panelist Kiran Mazumdar Shaw to respond. Like many book launches, this too was a panel discussion held at the ever-popular Bangalore International Centre, and is available on YouTube.Co-produced by Vikram Sampath and Ricky Kej, Women of the Records, highlights 25 women musicians-- courtesans-- devadasis and tawaifs-- who were bold, broke the mould and led the way-- all the qualities that we want and encourage in today’s young women-- our daughters and nieces for instance. Bengaluru is full of such women. Kiran Mazumdar Shaw is of course, held up as the poster child but there are others. Entrepreneurs such as Meena Ganesh of Portea, Shubhra Chadda of Chumbak, Rashmi Daga of Freshmenu, Anisha Jain of Zivame, and Shradha Sharma of YourStory. Venture capitalists like Vani Kola, Ankita Vasishta and and NassComm president, Rekha Menon.Yet there is one quality that women struggle with to this day, and that is power. Simply put, women have trouble owning and wielding power-- perhaps not the ones in my list above, but many others. How to address this? How to make women learn to use and wield power? One method is to model it for your children by being equal parents, or at least the kind where Mom doesn’t defer to Dad. The other way is to change the system so that women get a chance to exercise power. This is what Kej was alluding to when he made his comment.The panel discussion veered to the music industry of today. Kej said that in today’s music world, there were many great women professionals but they were all in the “entertainment” side (singers, musicians) not the “production” side (sound engineers, editors). The production side had a male majority and men didn’t not want women to enter their field, because they like to hang out together late at night, smoke and drink together, he said. Women would only complicate this. This is true of most professions. Day traders in the stock exchange don’t want women because things get complicated with the other sex. The way to change it is not by inserting one single woman into the fold but having a great many women in every field in every level of power.“I think you need a quota system to ensure that women are equally represented,” said Kej. “Anyone who says we don’t need quotas is speaking from a place of male privilege.” The audience clapped. In response to Kej’s comment, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw talked about DEI being the buzzword in today’s corporate world: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. She said that in her firm, she quietly incentivizes men to hire and include more women. Hire women for their potential and men for their competence, she said. When I called him about male privilege, Kej added that women, typically from the previous generation, underplay the gender card. Look how far I’ve come, they will say. I am the CEO and I didn’t need a quota. But these women are the exception rather than the rule. Equally, they forget how many fires they had to jump through to get where they are.Privilege is a strange thing. Those who have it take it for granted, don’t even realize its aura because they are surrounded by this. It is only when you are stripped away of your privileges that you feel the pain of those who don’t have it.I want to end with something that nobody talks about but is essential for empowerment. Gender balance is a numbers game. Diversity is not about including one token minority but enough for them to feel included. Today’s corporate boards largely include women-- but it is usually just one or 2 among 12 men. This too doesn’t work to anyone’s advantage-- not for women certainly, but in reality, not the firm’s either. We all know from personal experience how differently we behave if we are the sole man in a room full of women. Most men go quiet. Their manner is tense and muted. The same applies to women. Put her in a board-room with all its inherent tensions and think of whether she is going to voice her opinions. And please don’t point at the token woman you know who is assertive in such a situation.So the next time someone asks you to be in a panel, check if there is some semblance of gender balance in it. If you are invited on a jury, ask yourself: is the ten-person jury going to be all men? Book awards or any award with all-male juries tend to pick books written by men as the winner. Heck, women authors don’t even make the shortlist. And that in a gloriously heterogenous country such as ours is just plain wrong. It isn’t sustainable. Simply punting the issue back to women will not help. Men need to question each other’s prejudices. They need to ask themselves this simple question: is this the milieu that I want my daughters or nieces to inhabit?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangalore-talkies-women-on-top-does-that-make-you-uncomfortable-101637176617250.html

18-11-2021||India||27.9% rural households bought smartphone for kids’ studies amid pandemic: Survey||Smartphone penetration doubled in rural households in the past three years but a quarter of the children with digital devices at home don't have access to them, said the latest Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey released on Wednesday.According to the survey, the availability of smartphones in rural India was 36.5% in 2018, which increased to 61.8% in 2020 and 67.6 % in 2021. And, at least 27.9 % households in rural India bought a new smartphone for their children’s education this year. This figure was 9.1% last year.But the report cautioned that smartphone availability didn’t necessarily translate into access to education. “Although over two-thirds of all enrolled children have a smartphone at home (67.6%), over a quarter of them have no access to it (26.1%). There is also a clear pattern by grade, with more children in higher classes having access to a smartphone as compared to children in lower grades,” the report said.Also read | Covid-19 impact: Financial stress pushed kids out of pvt schoolsAccess to smartphone became important for education after the Covid-19 pandemic hit India last year and forced schooling to shift online. For almost a year, teachers took classes virtually and distributed reading materials over smartphones. Schools have only started opening up across the country in recent months.Of the 67.6% of the surveyed children with a smartphone at home, 27% said they had complete access to the device, 47% said they got access occasionally and 26.1% said they had no access to the device.The survey covered 76,706 households, 75,234 children between 5 and 16, and teachers and staff from 7,300 government schools across 25 states and three Union Territories.The survey found an increase in access to smartphones among students irrespective of the type of school they were enrolled in. For instance, in 2018, 29.6% of children enrolled in government schools had at least one smartphone at home. This proportion increased to 56.4% in 2020 and grew further to 63.7% in 2021.“However, still more children in private schools have a smartphone at home (79%) as opposed to kids going to government schools (63.7%),” the report stated.Kerala recorded the highest number of enrolled students with smartphone availability at home, at 97.5%. It was followed by 95.6% in Himachal Pradesh, 92.9% in Manipur and Nagaland, both, and 89.9% in Punjab.In contrast, some states showed poor availability of smartphones. For instance, in Bihar 54.4% of the surveyed students had smartphones at home, in West Bengal the figure was 58.4% and in Uttar Pradesh it was 58.9%.Bihar (53.8 per cent) has the highest percentage of students who did not have access to a smartphone despite a device being available at home followed by West Bengal (46.5% ), Uttar Pradesh (34.3 %) and Rajasthan (33.4%).The report further stated that the likelihood of a household owning a smartphone rose with the parents’ educational level. “In 2021, over 80% of children with parents who had studied at least till Class 9 had a smartphone available at home, as compared to just over 50% of children whose parents had studied till Class 5 or less,” it stated.However, it also highlighted that many parents in the ‘low’ education category bought new smartphones for their children amid the pandemic.Rukmini Banerjee, chief executive officer Pratham foundation, said, “Families did everything to ensure that learning continues during the lockdown. Now, time to think about how we can continue to engage families not just in schooling but in learning as well. Based on the ASER 2021 report, I would like to make a big case for digital device libraries in schools, villages and communities where these devices can be shared by groups of children or adults in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/279-rural-households-bought-at-least-one-smartphone-for-kids-studies-amid-pandemic-aser-survey-101637175238326.html
18-11-2021||India||PM Modi urges lawmakers to work with a sense of duty||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday urged lawmakers to work with a sense of duty, encourage healthy value-added debates above political considerations, make room for people dedicated to service of the society in politics, and set a new standard of politics in India.Addressing the 100th legislative presiding officer’s conference, Modi described the next 25 years, till 2047, as the “Amir Kaal”that would come after the “azadi ka amrit mahotsav” (celebration of freedom) and said, “These 25 years is very important period. Can we use only one mantra with full strength, full dedication and full responsibility? From my point of view that mantra is duty, duty, duty only duty.”India will complete 100 years of Independence in 2047.Modi expressed confidence that when public representatives and legislatives bodies emphasise on public duties “it will have an impact on the entire nation. Our sense of duty will fulfil a pious resolve of moving our country forward.”The PM also pitched for more space in public life for people and elected representatives who work tirelessly for social welfare. “Some people create an image that political leaders must be engaged in political upheaval, some manipulation or tussle. But if you notice, in every political party, there are people’s representatives who, beyond politics, spend their life in the service of the society, in the upliftment of the people of the society,” he said.The PM, whose legislative career spans nearly two decades, proposed a slew of reforms, including “one nation, one legislative platform” to serve as a technological boost for Indian Parliament and provide resources to the assemblies.But while he asked assemblies to encourage healthy debates and value addition in discussions, he cautioned that “our assemblies have to be careful about any voice against the unity and integrity of the nation”.Modi suggested giving separate time or a full day to debates rising above politics that can add value to the public discourse. He suggested more time for legislators who are either young, women or coming from backward areas.He reiterated that democracy in India is not just a system but a way of life and a national instinct.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla took a cue from the PM’s speech, and announced that the upcoming all party meeting ahead of the winter session will discuss how to promote healthy, value added debate Maintaining that the focus remains on making discussions more “disciplined, substantive and dignified” and effective working of the parliamentary committees, Birla said that a model legislative rule will be prepared to ensure uniform rules and procedures in all legislative bodies in India. In a significant move, most presiding officers favoured automatic suspension of lawmakers if they storm to the Well of the House. Such a provision is available only in the Lok Sabha and Chhattisgarh assembly. Speaking before Birla, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh also spoke about discipline and decorum in the House. He cited the science committee of the British parliament and the Future Committee of the Finnish parliament to advocate that Indian Parliament and its committees too needs to focus on the future. But the assembly speakers couldn’t arrive at a consensus on the report of to amend the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution or the laws governing anti-defection. The report, prepared by a panel led by Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi, suggested vesting all powers on defection with political parties. ”There are some differences and some parts of the report would now be reviewed,” Birla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-urges-lawmakers-to-work-with-a-sense-of-duty-101637174876705.html
18-11-2021||India||4,000 cyber-attacks on India’s Botanical Survey website in 2 months||There were 4,000 cyber-attacks on the website of the government-funded Botanical Survey of India (BSI), the country’s premier plant taxonomic organisation, over the last two months, a huge spike from the less than 10 attacks that took place in a month before the organisation digitised its rich repository in September this year, a top BSI official said on Wednesday.To be sure, the cyber-attacks were blocked.BSI director AA Mao said most of the attacks appear to originate from China and some other Asian countries.“Earlier we hardly ever faced any attempts cyber-attacks. But since the time we digitized all valuable information available in our centuries-old repository such attacks have shot up several times. Most of the attacks originated from China,” the BSI director told HT..The BSI, the custodian of the largest repository of centuries-old textile designs, natural dyes and plant drawings, in the country completed the digital archival of all its collections preserved till date in September. India is the second Asian country after China to provide open access to its huge collections of type specimens (original specimens collected by scientists and stored in BSI).The largest proportion of the attacks - 3,300 out of 4,000 - to push malicious codes into the website were aimed at the archive of natural dyes and design. There were at least 550 more attacks on the section which contains detailed taxonomic information about 5,600 Indian plants and a checklist of more than 21,600 plants found in India. The virtual herbarium section encountered around 130 more attacks.Officials said a quick analysis of the cyber-attacks indicate that most of them were attempts to inject malicious codes and access the passwords. The attacks weren’t successful but in view of the barrage of attempts over the last two months, there is a clear recommendation to upgrade the firewalls to keep out hackers.In March this year, the government told Parliament about a 300% increase in cyber attacks in the country in 2020 over the previous year. There have been multiple intelligence reports and technical analysis that trace many cyber attacks in India to China.The BSI collection which appears to have drawn the attention of hackers includes the original set of 15 volumes of 19th-century British businessman Thomas Wardle’s specimens of Fabrics dyed with Indian Dyes. It has information on 4,100 samples of dye patterns, extracted from 64 plants, depicting Indian dying traditions, compiled by Wardle in the 19th century and is considered one of the most comprehensive and complete documentation” said the BSI official.The archive also contains 18 volumes of textile designs comprising 1,700 samples, starting with turbans, saree, dhoti, trouser, carpet, mosquito curtain, coat, shawl, tent cloth, gowns and even saddle cloths among others, compiled by John Forbes Watson between 1866 and 1874.The BSI has also digitised the original set of 2,532 plant drawings made by William Roxburgh, a Scottish botanist and physician who was known as ‘Father of Indian Botany’.“India is the second country after the United Kingdom which made Roxburgh’s drawing online for the public. The digitised materials of the archives are the most accurate means of recording natural specimens and are also easier to store and transport. There are 3,280 life-size botanical paintings other than Roxburgh paintings drawn by Indian artists,” said BSI director Mao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4000-cyber-attacks-on-india-s-botanical-survey-website-in-2-months-mostly-from-china-101637174816639.html
18-11-2021||India||Families of two civilians killed in J&K gunfight hold protest||The families of two civilians, who were killed in the Hyderpora encounter, staged a protest here on Wednesday, seeking justice for the victims and return of their bodies.Businessman Altaf Ahmad Bhat (48) and Mudasir Gul (43) were killed along with two terrorists during the gunbattle in Hyderpora area of Srinagar on Monday night. On Tuesday, a controversy erupted after police claimed they were over ground workers (OGWs) of terrorism and their families claimed they were used by security forces as human shields during the encounter.Staging a protest at Press Enclave on Residency Road, families of Bhat and Gul said that they were OGWs and demanded that their bodies be returned.“I knew how hardworking my husband was. The police are lying. Show me the proof that my husband was working with terrorists. Since yesterday, my one-year-old daughter has been searching for her father. Mudasir was neither an OGW nor a terrorist but a daughter,” Gul’s wife, Humaira, said.“Give me the body of my husband. I want to see his face for one last time. Give us justice. We want proper justice. If something happens to my family, this government will be responsible for it,” she added.Gul’s relatives also blamed police for his death.“This is great injustice. People are first used as a human shield and then they are killed. Families are then denied a decent burial,” a relative said, seeking anonymity.Bhat’s family also joined the protests, demanding the return of his body.“We only have one request, to hand over the body of Altaf Ahmad Bhat. We will continue our protests till the body is returned to the family,” the businessman’s elder brother, Abdul Majeed, who is a ‘numberdar’ (revenue official), said.Fearing trouble, police buried the two bodies in Handwara, around 70 km away from Hyderpora, without the participation of their families on Tuesday. “Due to law and order problems, the bodies were not handed over to the families and buried at Handwara,” Inspector general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/families-of-two-civilians-killed-in-j-k-gunfight-hold-protest-101637174698282.html
18-11-2021||India||Karnataka records dip in reading ability of govt school students||Bengaluru Reading ability among children studying in primary classes of government schools across Karnataka has dipped by almost half in the past two years, indicating not just the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic but the inequitable development of the southern state, a flagship nationwide survey said on Wednesday.The Annual Status of Education Report (Aser) for 2021 found that the proportion of children in the third grade, who could read grade one text, fell sharply from 41.8% in 2018 to 24.2% in 2020 in Karnataka. The report also revealed a steep drop in children’s foundational skills, particularly in lower primary grades.“In reading for example, the proportion of children in Standard 2 in government schools who were as yet unable to read even letters (beginners’ level) had increased by 13 percentage points over 2018 levels. The proportion of children in Std III who could read at least Std I level text had fallen sharply from 41.8% to 24.2% over the same period,” according to the findings of the report.In Karnataka, the percentage of children who can at least recognise double digit numbers has come down from 78.3% in 2018 to 60.7% in 2020, data showed.“Covering almost 20000 children age 5-16 across 24 of Karnataka’s 30 districts, the learning data shows a steep drop in children’s foundational skills, particularly in lower primary grades when these foundations are often still shaky” the report added.A statewide assessment was conducted in March this year in Karnataka. The study, done by the non-profit organisation Pratham, covered almost 20,000 children age 5-16 across 24 of Karnataka’s 30 districts.Karnataka was the only state where Pratham conducted a survey to gauge the learning levels of students and evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their education. In other states, Pratham said, it was unable to conduct the learning level survey, as schools were closed due to the pandemic.The report also highlighted how the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the challenges of the public education system in Karnataka.The state government had resumed physical classes for pre-primary students on November 8, but teachers are still struggling to bridge the digital gap.One of the main reasons for reopening physical classes in Karnataka, as explained by the technical advisory committee (TAC) in its recommendations, were not particularly centred around education.“Any further delay in school reopening may push children into malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, child trafficking, begging etc., making their condition further Worse,” according to the report, submitted to the BS Yediyurappa-led government on June 22.Data from the Karnataka government shows that around 9.3 million students, out of the total 10.05 million across private and public schools in Karnataka, have been accounted for in terms of access to devices, internet, TV, radio and even email.However, of these 9.3 million, only 5,859,907 have smartphones/tablets while around 3,127,524 have no access to such devices. The survey also revealed that 5,134,386 students have access to the internet while 3,779,965 students do not, rendering the exercise of online classes redundant, especially for those belonging to rural and backward regions of the state.Interestingly, Karnataka stands at 16th in the country when it comes to the number of enrolled children who have a smartphone available at home which has gone up from 43.1% in 2018 to 71.6% in 2020, ASER data shows.The all-India average has gone up from 36.5% in 2018 to 67.6% in 2020.Kerala has the highest number of enrolled children who have a smartphone available at home from 80.9% to 97.5%, data shows.In India’s IT capital, Bengaluru (rural, south and north), there are 178,612 students who have been accounted for out of the total 1,992,100. Of this, only 1,387,299 have a mobile number in which they can be contacted and just 1,452,207 have access to smartphones or tablets. Only 1,305,527 students have access to the internet and at least 401,269 have no access, data from the education department shows.Rishikesh.B.S who leads the Hub for Education, Law & Policy at Azim Premji University, said: “We see that children have not fallen just by the missed year but by two more grades. Similar to the summer loss where a holiday needs a bridge course just after two months. When that two month extends to 18 months, it is a very natural thing that there is not just a learning loss but a learning regression.”“It is basically adding to the problem which we anyways had pre-covid. The 18 months of closure has exacerbated the problems further.”Rishikesh said that this should warn us that the government cannot just reopen schools and continue as though its business as usual which could leave behind a third of the class. He added that one way to deal with this is to give more autonomy to the teachers and we had said that this bridge course should go on till March 2023 or 500 days to bring these children on par.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-records-dip-in-reading-ability-of-govt-school-students-101637174639814.html
18-11-2021||India||‘BJP will be wiped out’: Akhilesh Yadav holds rally on Purvanchal Expressway||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday held a ‘Vijay Rath Yatra’ on the Purvanchal Expressway, a day after it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and promised to “wipe out the BJP” in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections.Yadav has been claiming that the 341-km-long expressway was initiated by the SP when it was in power in the state.Alleging that the expressway was incomplete, he said: “This expressway, (which has been inaugurated), is incomplete. Samajwadis saw the dream of building this (Purvanchal) expressway in order that the travel time between Ghazipur in UP and Delhi reduces. But this expressway is not reducing the distance (travel time between Ghazipur in eastern UP and Delhi).It was to be an expressway of prosperity. They couldn’t make a better road than this road in the entire country.”Also read | Akhilesh Yadav promises to develop markets for farmers along Purvanchal Expressway“Through this expressway, work to strengthen the economy of rural areas will be done. Mandis were supposed to come up near this but they did not. After the SP comes to power, work will be done to set up mandis for farmers and create means of employment generation for the youths along it,” he added.The Purvanchal Expressway starts from village Chand Sarai in Lucknow district and ends at village Hydaria on National Highway number 31, 18 kilometres east of the Uttar Pradesh-Bihar border, in Ghazipur. The key feature of the expressway is the 3.2-kilometre-long airstrip to enable landing and take-off of Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter planes in case of emergency. The six-lane expressway can be expanded to eight lanes in the future.Attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he said, “There will be a change in UP in 2022, for sure. I am watching a wave of change. I am confident that from this Ghaizpur (UP) to that Ghazipur (near Delhi border), BJP will be wiped out.”“Ghazipur is the land of bravehearts and sacrifice. I salute all of you,” he said, addressing people from atop the rath (bus).He asked the people to “remove the bulls and the bulldozers” which are running in the state. This remark appeared to be an indirect jibe at the problem of stray cattle and the Yogi Adityanath government’s drive against criminals and demolition of their unauthorised properties.Appealing to the people, Akhilesh said, “In 2022, change the government which is changing names.”It was a reference to the Yogi government having changed the names of Faizabad to Ayodhya and Allahabad to Prayagraj, besides renaming the Faizabad railway station as Ayodhya Cantt. At a function in SP chief’s Lok Sabha constituency Azamgarh on November 13, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said laying the foundation stone of a state university will turn Azamgarh into Aryamgarh in the true sense.“There should be no doubt that this university will truly turn Azamgarh into Aryamgarh,” the chief minister had said. Union home minister Amit Shah had laid the foundation stone of the university.Akhilesh Yadav also targeted the BJP on petrol and diesel prices, besides “rising unemployment”.“These are the very people who had said that poor with slippers will travel by air. But the way the prices of diesel and petrol have gone up, riding a motorcycle has become difficult,” he said.“Unemployed youths waited for jobs for five years. Where are the jobs? Will the youth not bring a change? All sections of the society, be it farmers, labourers and youths, are ready to bring a change in the state,” he said.He also said the SP will hold a historic rally in Ghazipuri in future.In an ostensible reference to a video on social media where PM Modi is seen in a vehicle surrounded by his security personnel in Sultanpur and Adityanath walking, Yadav said, “It was for the people to bring them on the road, but they themselves have started trodding down that path.”The Samajwadi Party’s ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar said SBSP has shut the door through which BJP came to power in 2017. The SBSP-led Bhagidari Sanklap Morcha, in alliance with the SP, will make Akhilesh Yadav the chief minister of UP in 2022, he said.Earlier, Akhilesh Yadav, along with Rajbhar, met noted vocalist Pandit Chhannu Lal Mishra at Lal Bahadur Shastri international airport, Varanasi, said SBSP state unit vice president Shashipratap Singh. Padma Vibhushan was conferred on Mishra recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-be-wiped-out-sp-chief-akhilesh-yadav-holds-rally-on-purvanchal-expressway-101637174457875.html
18-11-2021||India||Centre approves continuation of rural road connectivity schemes||The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved a proposal of the ministry of rural development to continue Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana-I and II scheme, up to September next year, for completion of balance road and bridge works.Briefing reporters on the state, Union minister Anurag Thakur said the committee also approved the continuation of the Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) up to March 2023.“The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana which started during former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s time and got widened to cover thousands of villages during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tenure has been extended so that the remaining kilometres are met. With the RCPLWEA scheme, areas hit by left-wing extremism and tribal areas are also going to benefit from this. Roads will be built through dense forests, mountains and rivers,” he said. The Centre started PMGSY-I to provide connectivity to unconnected habitations that have a population of over 500 people in plain areas and over 250 people in the northeast and Himalayan states. In an official release, the government said that selected left wing extremism blocks, and habitations with a population of over 100 people will also be provided connectivity. “Only 2,432 habitations are left of about 184,444 habitations. About 20,950 km road length and 1,974 bridges are left for completion out of a total sanctioned 645,627 km road length and 7,523 bridges. These works will now get completed,” the release said. The release said that under PMGSY-II, upgradation of 50,000 km rural road network was envisaged. Total 49,885 km road length and 765 LSBs have been sanctioned, of which only 4,240 km road length and 254 bridges are remaining which will now get completed.“Majority of pending works under PMGSY-I and II are in the northeast and hill states due to factors such as Covid-19 lockdown, extended rains, winters, forest issues,” the release added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-approves-continuation-of-rural-road-connectivity-schemes-101637174456665.html
18-11-2021||India||Contemplating legal action against Kangana Ranaut over Gandhi remark: Patole||The Congress is contemplating legal action against actor Kangana Ranaut as her recent comments on India’s independence and Mahatma Gandhi were “anti-national” and amounted to sedition, the party’s Maharashtra unit chief Nana Patole, said on Wednesday.“Our leaders have filed criminal cases against the actress. We are taking legal opinion over it to see what steps can be taken. We will move court against her,” Patole told reporters here.“There are some Hindi film actors who are given some awards and are being used to distort the historical facts. We are seeking a legal opinion on the matter. Once we arrive at a decision, the party will take its next stand regarding such coordinated attacks,” he added. Ranaut was recently awarded the Padma Shri, India’s fourth highest civilian award by President Ram Nath Kovind. Days after her India’s independence in 1947 was “bheek” remarks triggered a row, Ranaut on Tuesday claimed Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh got no support from Mahatma Gandhi and went on to mock his mantra of ahimsa by saying that offering another cheek gets you “bheek” not freedom. Patole said that Congress leader and former minister Naseem Khan has already approached police to file a complaint against the actor. Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said: “BJP’s attempt to murder the ideology of Gandhiji through its puppets was neither successful in the past, nor will it succeed in the future. Gandhi is the past as well as the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contemplating-legal-action-against-kangana-ranaut-over-gandhi-remark-patole-101637174338668.html
18-11-2021||India||Chinese military has conducted major ops at border: CPC||The Chinese military has conducted “major operations related to border defence” and strengthened training under combat conditions to build a modern armed force, the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has said in a key resolution.The resolution, only the third such to be adopted in 100 years, on the CPC’s “achievements and historical experiences” also admitted that the party’s leadership over the military was “obviously lacking” for a period of time but has “made a fundamental turn for the better”.The strong support for the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) transformation in the key document comes in the backdrop of the ongoing standoff with the Indian military along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The resolution was passed at the end of a four-day, closed-door meeting of the CPC’s Central Committee held in Beijing last week.In what could be interpreted as a message to adversaries, the resolution said: “Devoting intense focus to combat effectiveness as the sole criterion that matters most and to their fundamental purpose of being able to fight and win, the people’s armed forces have strengthened their strategic forces and new-domain forces with new combat capabilities, and they have improved command systems and capacity for joint operations.”Defence mobilisation has been improved and “greater unity” has been cultivated between the military and the government and between the military and civilians, it said.The document didn’t mention India but gave an indication of the PLA’s preparation for wars along its land and maritime borders.“They (the military) have conducted major operations related to border defence, protecting China’s maritime rights, countering terrorism and maintaining stability, disaster rescue and relief, fighting Covid-19, peacekeeping and escort services, humanitarian assistance, and international military cooperation,” the document said.“They have worked hard to address ‘peacetime ills’, vigorously strengthened training under combat conditions, and built strong, well-structured, and modern border defence, coastal defence, and air defence systems,” it added.China currently has land border disputes with India and Bhutan, and maritime disputes with several neighbours over conflicting claims in the South China Sea and with Japan in the East China Sea.Troop training and battle preparedness have been bolstered across the board, the document said, adding that the military has accelerated efforts to modernise “…military theory, organisation, personnel, and weaponry and equipment and to integrate mechanisation with the application of information and smart technologies within the military”.The CPC, under the presidency of Xi Jinping, who is also chairperson of the Central Military Commission (CMC), has reversed the trend of the CPC’s weakening control of China’s vast armed forces, the resolution indicated.“For a period of time, the Party’s leadership over the military was obviously lacking. If this problem had not been completely solved, it would not only have diminished the military’s combat capacity, but also undermined the key political principle that the Party commands the gun.”The resolution named four top generals -- Guo Boxiong, Xu Caihou, Fang Fenghui, and Zhang Yang – who have been punished for corruption during Xi’s ongoing reign.They were “…thoroughly investigated and punished, and their negative influence was completely eliminated. With this, the political environment in the people’s armed forces has made a fundamental turn for the better.”“…the people’s military has been through an all-around revolutionary restructuring under the firm leadership of the Party in preparation for the next stage, while our defence capabilities have grown in step with our economic strength.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-military-has-conducted-major-ops-at-border-cpc-101637174337352.html
18-11-2021||India||Arvind Kejriwal reaches out to Goa’s taxi operators; promises corporation ahead of polls||Panaji Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday reached out to Goa’s taxi operators and promised to form a corporation to address their grievances if his party is voted to power in the state.“Seventy per cent of the credit for the formation of the AAP government in Delhi is due to taxi and auto drivers. I told auto and taxi drivers that I will take up your fight, you help me form a government... They stuck AAP posters on their auto and taxis for free. Autos travel across Delhi. There can be no better canvassing,” he said, addressing a gathering of taxi operators, in the vicinity of Goa’s Dabolim airport.“Seven years ago auto and taxi drivers were being called mafia. No politician wanted to associate themselves with taxi and auto operators in Delhi. I had called a similar meeting in Delhi with taxi and auto drivers where I had asked for their support,” he added. Kejriwal promised that the corporation, so formed, would be largely staffed by the taxi operators themselves allowing them to take decisions on when and whether they can come under the umbrella of an app, and when fares should be hiked. “We will form a corporation with one or two government officers, the rest of the members will be taxi and auto drivers. You will form the policy. You will decide whether you want to start an app-based service or hike fares,” he said. Taxi operators in Goa have long been protesting against the government-promoted GoaMiles taxi service that they alleged is eating into their business as well as have been protesting against the government’s decision to make it mandatory to install digital meters from a sole provider, which they say is a scam, as it benefits only one company. Around 25,000 taxis are registered with the Goa transport department and their support is considered crucial in certain coastal constituencies where their votes are considered crucial for the aspiring candidates. However, taxi operators have not voted in unison with a lack of unity among the operators ensuring that despite coming together on issues, differing political ideologies meant the taxi operators cannot be considered a ‘bloc’ that can be captured even if their leaders vow allegiance to political parties.“We are yet unsure of what his promises entail and as such it is too early to comment on the promises that have been made,” Ravindra Vengurlekar the vice president of the North Goa Tourist Taxi Operators Association, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-reaches-out-to-goa-s-taxi-operators-promises-corporation-ahead-of-polls-101637174279745.html

18-11-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: SC appoints retired HC judge to monitor probe||The Supreme Court on Wednesday appointed retired Punjab and Haryana high court judge Rakesh Kumar Jain to monitor the probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed on October 3. The court underscored that the appointment of a former judge from outside Uttar Pradesh to oversee the probe would “ensure transparency, fairness and absolute impartiality in the outcome of the investigation”. “This Court is equally concerned about guaranteeing an impartial, fair, just and thorough investigation into the incident which has resulted in such a tragic loss of lives of protesters as well as some other persons,” said a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, asking the former high court judge to monitor the probe and submit a report in the court after the charge sheet is filed in the case. The bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, further underlined that constitutional courts must ensure “the rule of law and constitutional guarantees of a fair and impartial investigation into alleged criminality” as it pointed out how it had previously disapproved of “slow pace, manner and outcome of the investigation conducted so far”. The court, thus, ordered a new special investigation team (SIT) to probe the violence and inducted three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers in the team, asking them to complete the investigation “expeditiously” and in a time-­bound manner, and by using latest forensic investigative methods “to reach the truth”.“While investigating such offences, justice must not only be done, but also be seen and perceived to be done. We thus deem it appropriate to reconstitute the SIT hereinafter to preserve the faith and trust of people in the criminal administration of the justice system,” said the bench.The court said that 1993-batch IPS officer SB Shiradkar will head the three member-SIT and will also include IPS officers Padmaja Chauhan and Preetinder Singh. All three officers are currently serving in Uttar Pradesh but are directly recruited IPS officers and belong to other states. It took note of the fact that at present, the SIT predominantly consisted of middle-level or subordinate-level police officers posted in Lakhimpur Kheri district. “It appears to us that in spite of their perceived commitment and sincerity in carrying out the investigation, there may still be a lurking suspicion in respect of the fairness and independence of such an investigation. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to direct re­constitution of the SIT infused with directly recruited IPS officers who do not hail from the State of Uttar Pradesh though are allocated to the UP Cadre,” recorded the court in its order.The bench passed its directive in the case registered by the top court on its own motion (suo motu) after the UP government on Monday said that it has no objection to the appointment of a former high court judge to oversee the probe into the incident.It had also asked senior counsel Harish Salve, who appeared for the state government, to give names of some high-ranking and senior police officers who could be inducted in the SIT since most of the current police officers were inspector-level and were posted in Lakhimpur. A day ago, the state government submitted names of some senior police officers, following which the court named the new members of the SIT. Over the last few hearings, the top court has been critical of the manner in which the state police have so far conducted the investigation in the case. On November 8, the bench pulled up the UP police, commenting that the investigation into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident appeared to be favouring the “main accused” in the case. The remarks continued the trend of the top court’s dissatisfaction with the probe in the case where a convoy, in which at least one vehicle belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, ran over farmers protesting three controversial agricultural laws, leading them to run amok and lynch some of the occupants of the vehicles. Four farmers, three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers, and a journalist were killed in the incident.Ashish Mishra, the son of the minister, is one of the accused in one of the two cases (the convoy running over farmers) being investigated. His arrest came only after the bench, on October 9, criticised the lenient treatment he seemed to be receiving from the police in the murder FIR.The other case being investigated by the police relates to the lynching of some of the occupants of vehicles in the convoy. In the last hearing, the court was perturbed that some of the evidence being collected in this case was aimed at protecting the “main accused”The state maintained that it has “clinching evidence” of Mishra’s presence at the scene (something he and his father have consistently denied), but that forensic reports on this are awaited.The bench had then underscored the need for appointing a retired high court judge from outside the state to monitor the probe after noticing that the investigation in the farmers’ murder case (FIR no. 219) could be adversely impacted by the manner in which the UP police were recording evidence in the case relating to the murder of three BJP workers (FIR no. 220).It added that the court does not have confidence in the judicial commission appointed by the UP government. On October 7, the UP government set up a judicial commission, headed by retired Allahabad high court judge PK Srivastava, to probe the incident||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-sc-appoints-retired-hc-judge-to-monitor-probe-101637174277050.html
18-11-2021||India||India, Russia maiden 2+2 dialogue likely to be held in December, say officials||New Delhi India and Russia are considering the possibility of holding their maiden 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers around the time of the annual summit in December because of scheduling issues, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. It was earlier expected that the 2+2 dialogue between defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and their Russian counterparts Sergey Shoygu and Sergey Lavrov would be held in Moscow in the last week of November. However, with the 25-day winter session of Parliament beginning on November 29 and a recent spike in Covid-19 cases in Russia, both sides are looking at the possibility of holding the 2+2 meeting in New Delhi around the time of the summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin on December 6, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The Parliament session will require the presence of the two senior ministers in New Delhi and make any foreign trips a difficult proposition, the people said. A final call is yet to be made and the two sides are engaged in consultations to lock down a date for the meeting. The Parliament session is also expected to affect the scheduling of the 2+2 dialogue with the US. The two Indian ministers were earlier expected to travel to Washington this month for the talks with defense secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken. The India-US 2+2 dialogue now faces the likelihood of being pushed to January, the people said. India currently has a 2+2 ministerial dialogue with Australia, Japan and the US, and Russia will only be the fourth country with which it will have such an engagement. India and Russia also recently agreed to have a permanent channel between their top security officials for consultations on Afghanistan. This year’s annual India-Russia summit is already facing intense scrutiny as top Russian officials have announced that Moscow has begun shipping the first batch of S-400 air defence systems under a $5.4-billion contract signed in 2018. India has signalled its intention to go ahead with the deal despite the US warning it could attract secondary sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). During the summit, India and Russia are expected to renew their military-technical cooperation for the next decade and sign several agreements in defence, trade and science and technology. One of the key pacts expected to be inked is the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), which will allow militaries of the two sides to access logistics and support facilities at each other’s bases and ports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-maiden-2-2-dialogue-likely-to-be-held-in-december-say-officials-101637174218431.html
18-11-2021||India||UAPA case: No coercive action, SC tells Tripura||The Supreme Court on Wednesday restrained the Tripura Police from arresting two lawyers and a journalist, who were booked under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), for their social media posts on the communal violence in the state. “We issue notice on this petition. No coercive steps to be taken against the petitioners till the next date of hearing,” directed a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana. The bench, which also included justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, sought a response from the Tripura government within four weeks, adding the petition will be heard along with the other bunch of cases where the constitutional validity of UAPA has been challenged. No date was set for the hearing.Advocate Prashant Bhushan appeared for the three petitioners, advocates Mukesh Gaur and Ansarul Haq Ansari, and journalist Shyam Meera Singh, requesting protection from arrest. On November 6, Tripura Police booked 102 social media users, including journalists and activists, under UAPA, besides criminal conspiracy and forgery charges, and served notices to the authorities at Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to freeze their accounts and inform it about their particulars. The charges relate to spreading communal hatred through their social media posts about the violent incidents in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state in the last week of October. Two women journalists, Samriddhi K Sakunia and Swarna Jha, employed with Delhi-based news channel HW News Network, were also arrested by Tripura Police in the early hours of Monday for alleged criminal conspiracy and spread of communal hatred while reporting on the October 26 violence in the state. They were granted bail on Tuesday.A case was also registered against four lawyers under the stringent anti-terror law and various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for allegedly promoting communal disharmony with their social media posts relating to the violence that followed a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) protest against the attacks in Bangladesh on Hindus during Durga Puja. In their petition before the top court, the petitioners highlighted the vagueness of the definition of “unlawful activity”; the “wide net” the law casts on freedom of speech and expression; its tendency to bring within its fold mere criticism of government policies or actions that have no effect on public order or the security, sovereignty and integrity of India; and its indiscriminate use against those critical of the government produces a “chilling effect” on the freedom of speech and expression.They also challenged the UAPA provision that bars anticipatory bail, besides contending that the law violates Articles 14 (equality before the law and equal protection of law), 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.The petitioners said they were seeking protection of their fundamental rights against the backdrop of “targeted political violence against the Muslim minorities in the state of Tripura during the second half of the month of October, 2021, and the subsequent efforts by the state of Tripura to monopolise the flow of information and facts emanating from the affected areas by invoking provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, against members of civil society, including advocates and journalists who have made the effort to bring facts in relation to the targeted violence in the public domain”.“If the quest for truth and reporting thereof itself is criminalised, then the victim in the process is the idea of justice. Such circumstances strike at the very foundations of a participative democratic society as it curbs the free flow of information and ideas and no inconvenient facts will be available in the public domain for the citizenry to demand corrective action from the State where there have been shortcomings and lapses on its part,” stated the petition.On October 29, the Tripura government had said that a vested interest group from outside hatched a conspiracy to create unrest in the state and malign its image by uploading a fake photograph of a burning mosque on social media. The police have investigated the case and found that no mosque was burnt in Panisagar sub-division in North Tripura district, information and culture minister Sushanta Chowdhury had said.The Supreme Court has been seized of a batch of cases, led by a Delhi resident, Sajal Awasthi, who challenged the legality of 2019 amendments to the UAPA allowing it to declare an individual a “terrorist” and also attach his or her properties even before trial, among other provisions.In September 2019, the top court admitted Awasthi’s petition, issuing a notice to the Union government. Similar other petitions were also filed in the top court, including one by the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR).These petitions said that the new amendments the amendments to UAPA were violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(a) and 21of the Constitution which guarantee the right to equality, the right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to life to all citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uapa-case-no-coercive-action-sc-tells-tripura-101637174217172.html
18-11-2021||India||Ex-Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh declared proclaimed offender in extortion case||A Mumbai court on Wednesday declared former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and two others proclaimed offenders in an extortion case filed by the city police.It is for the first time that a police commissioner in the city has been declared a proclaimed offender. Singh, 59, was the city’s 43rd police commissioner. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Sudhir Bhajipale also directed Singh and two others -- Vinay Ramnarayan Singh (46) and Riyaz Bhati (56) -- to appear before court in 30 days in connection with the case. If they fail to appear, police can initiate the process for attachment of their properties under section 83 of Code of Criminal Procedure. The court’s order came days after the crime branch of Mumbai Police, which is probing the extortion case registered in Goregaon in northwest Mumbai, sought the proclamation against the three accused, saying they could not be traced even after the issuance of a non-bailable warrant (NBW) on October 30. Appearing for the crime branch, special prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said that “pursuant to the warrant, crime branch officials visited Singh’s last known address in the city at Neelam Building in Malabar Hill” but a cook present there informed that the former Mumbai top cop and his family had not been staying at the residence for the past three months. Jagtap added that a crime branch team also visited Singh’s hometown in Chandigarh where his brother told police that he had not made any recent visits to the Union territory.Likewise, officials also visited Bhati’s residence in Kandivli in north Mumbai and Vinay Singh’s residence at Andheri in western Mumbai but could not trace them, Jagtap said. A short affidavit, filed by investigating officer Vishal Patil, in support of the plea sought the proclamation under section 82 of Code of Criminal Procedure, stating that Singh has been absconding since March this year. The affidavit added that in the last four months, five cases were registered against the senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer but he never appeared for probe in any of the cases. Singh also failed to appear before the Justice KU Chandiwal Commission, which is probing the former top cop’s allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, the affidavit said. The affidavit added that “despite best efforts by the crime branch”, none of the three accused could be traced and therefore, the “non-bailable warrants issued against them have remained unexecuted.” The crime branch claimed that the accused were “intentionally evading the law” and that officials had even urged the court to initiate a process for attachment of their properties. The case against Singh and others was registered on August 30 following a complaint by one Bimal Agarwal that the accused had extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register false cases against two of his restaurant outlets. The incidents occurred between January 2020 and March 2021, he had claimed.Former assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, who was arrested in connection with the Antilia bomb scare case, is also among six accused in the extortion case registered under sections 384 and 385 (both pertaining to extortion) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code. Mumbai-based advocate Aniket Nikam said a proclamation is meant for those accused persons who have been avoiding investigating agencies. “It seems despite several attempts the police have not been able to get hold of Param Bir Singh and for such situations, CrPC under section 82 contemplates the procedure of proclamation and section 83 provides for attachment if properties (movable/immovable) of the proclaimed offender.” “The Supreme Court has held that an absconder/proclaimed offender is not even entitled to relief of anticipatory bail,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exmumbai-police-chief-param-bir-singh-declared-proclaimed-offender-in-extortion-case-101637174216622.html
18-11-2021||India||Covid-19 impact: Financial stress pushed kids out of pvt schools||Thousands of children in rural India switched from private schools to government-run institutions during the Covid-19 pandemic largely due to economic distress and depressed incomes of parents in the past year, a flagship nationwide survey said on Wednesday.The Annual Status of Education Report (Aser) for 2021 also found that more children were dependent on paid private tuition classes across the country -- a consequence of schools being shut for months due to the virus -- and access to smartphones for education remained difficult for children even in households with such digital devices.“The major change in enrolment that is evident in Aser 2021 is a big jump in government school enrolment accompanied by a fall in private school enrolment. The increase in government school enrolment is across the board – all age-groups, grades and for both boys and girls,” said the report.Also read | 31 children died by suicide every day in 2020, reveals govt data; experts blame Covid-19The 16th edition of the report, issued by the non-profit organisation Pratham, was prepared on the basis of a household telephonic survey conducted in rural areas of 581 districts across 25 states and three Union territories between September and October this year.The survey -- which covered 76,706 households, 75,234 children between 5 and 16, and teachers and staff from 7,300 government schools -- aimed to capture the transition in the education system at a time when schools are reopening in a staggered manner after almost 18 months due to the pandemic.There was also some good news. The survey didn’t report any sharp spike in out-of-school children numbers, which hovered between 4% in 2018, 5.5% in 2020 and 4.9% in 2021. To be sure, a survey based on mobile phones could have left out the poorest families or those tied to economic migration patterns.The report found a steady decline in private school enrolment numbers, which shrank from 32. 5% in 2018 to 28.8% in 2020 and 24.4% this year. Correspondingly, public school enrolment numbers rose from 64.3% in 2018, 65.8% in 2020 and 70.3% this year.“Incidence of private schooling in India has been rising over time. From 2006 to 2014 there was a steady increase. After plateauing around 30% for a few years, there has been a significant decline in the pandemic years,” the report said.Why did this happen? 62% of the teachers and staff surveyed attributed the shift to financial distress and about 50% ascribed it to free facilities in government schools. Around 40% said no studies were happening in private schools and 15% cited migration as the main reason for the switch to government institutions.“The government-private split in enrolment in 2021 is close to the 2010 figures...Government school enrolment has been declining since 2006 till it stabilised at around 65% in 2018, jumping only in the last year to reach 70.3% in 2021,” said the report.The maximum increase in government school enrolment was seen in Uttar Pradesh and Kerala, by 13.2% and 11.9% respectively, between 2018 and 2021. Both states were among the worst hit during the pandemic.The national increase in government school enrolment is driven by large northern states like UP, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana and southern states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. All of these states had high private school enrolment (in excess of 40%) to start with. If the shift away from private schools is due to financial distress, then it is not surprising that it will be most evident in states where private school enrolment was high to begin with,” said the report.Other than Telangana, more than 8% increase in government school enrolment was witnessed in all the southern states [during the same period], the report said. In Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand, there was only a slight increase in enrolment in government schools during that period.The findings show government school enrolment went up across all age groups, but the maximum was reported among younger students. For classes 1 and 2, the enrolment of boys in government schools rose 10.9% while for girls, the rise was 7.4% between 2020 and 2021.“It has always been the case that more girls are enrolled in government schools as compared to boys. While this continues to be true in 2021, the proportion of boys enrolled in government schools has also increased from 63% in 2018 to 72% in 2021,narrowing the gender gap,” the report said.Changes in the pattern of enrolment will become clearer when schools across the country completely reopen, the surveyors added.“The enrolment in government schools over the last couple of years is reflective of the focus on education in the state. The steps taken by state government like easy enrolment of children of migrant workers who returned home during the first wave of pandemic, transfer of money in accounts of parents via Direct Benefit Transfer to purchase bags, shoes, sweater and uniform for children along with easy accessibility led to rise in enrolment,” UP basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi said.Earlier, several states, including Haryana and Delhi, had announced that their schools witnessed an influx from private schools amid the pandemic. For instance, according to the Delhi government, 270,000 students from private schools moved to their schools this year. In August, Haryana school education department released data saying around 200,000 students from private schools switched to government schools in the state.The survey flagged two other major findings.One, there was a 10 percentage point increase in the proportion of school children taking paid tuition classes since 2018. “At an all-India level, in 2018, less than 30 per cent children took private tuition classes. In 2021, this proportion has jumped to almost 40%. This proportion has increased across both sexes and all grades and school types,” the report stated.The survey said the phenomena was a “natural response” to prolonged closure of schools States like Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Nagaland saw the sharpest increase in tuition between 2018 and 2021. In Arunachal Pradesh, 26.6% of children took tuition in 2018; however in 2021 the number increased to 46.3%. When comparing state-wise data, Arunachal Pradesh topped the list. This was followed by Uttar Pradesh where the percentage rose from 19.6% in 2018 to 38.7% in 2021. Nagaland also reported a sharp increase from 27.9 % in 2018 to 47% in 2021.Kerala bucked the trend with the number of students opting for private tuitions dropping from 28.3% in 2018 to 18.8% in 2021.Two, access to digital devices remained fraught with challenges for children. Smartphones became important for education during the pandemic as teaching shifted online and teachers started taking classes virtually. But the survey found that even though smartphone penetration doubled in rural India (from 36.5% in 2018 to 67.6% in 2021) it did not necessarily translate into access to schooling.“26.1 % surveyed students said they do not have access to smartphones despite having one at home,” the survey stated, adding that younger children were more deprived when it came to accessing smartphones.It also highlighted that several states including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar, were still lagging in terms of availability of smartphones among students. In Bihar, 54.4% of the surveyed students had smartphones at home, in West Bengal the percentage was 58.4% and in Uttar Pradesh it was 58.9%.The report also expressed concern over the loss of learning levels among younger students and found that one in every three children enrolled in classes 1 and 2 had never attended in-person classes. The percentage of such children is 36.8% in government schools and 33.6% in private schools. “Entry to the world of formal education can be a difficult process at the best of times but the challenges these young children face as learners are therefore likely to be far more complex than would have been the case in pre-pandemic times,” said Suman Bhattacharjea, director of the Aser research centre.The report also pointed out that the learning support at home for children decreased from 74.9% last year to 66.6% this year. Although the ASER 2021 survey didn’t cover learning outcomes due to schools being closed or partially open in several regions of the country, a sample assessment done in Karnataka in March highlighted a “huge drop” in learning levels among students, particularly among those enrolled in primary classes.Experts attributed the shift from private to public institutions to pandemic-induced distress.“Many parents lost their jobs amid the pandemic and were forced to pull their kids out of private schools and enrol them into government schools. Rather than making the child sit at home, parents put them in public schools. I think once the pandemic is over, in 2024, there will again be an increase in private school enrolments,” said educationist Gouri Ishawaran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-impact-financial-stress-pushed-kids-out-of-pvt-schools-101637174156039.html
18-11-2021||India||‘Inertia, policy paralysis’: SC’s rebuke on air crisis||The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that the executive in the country is suffering from a “policy paralysis” and “inertia”, waiting for the top court to step in for bringing down the rising levels of air pollution in Delhi-NCR.Expressing dissatisfaction over the steps taken by the Centre and state governments of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab to address the air pollution in the Capital, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana added that it expected the authorities to do much more than calling upon the court to issue directions on issues such as work-from-home, carpooling, and the use of sprinklers.“What I have been observing as a judge that bureaucracy has developed an inertia... a policy paralysis where they want this court to do everything. As if we should give directions take a bucket, put out fire, use sprinkler and all. We have to do everything,” the CJI told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Union government.The bench, which also comprised justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, added: “This is an unfortunate situation to which the bureaucracy has come down to. They say ‘we won’t do anything. Let the court pass directions and we will simply put signatures saying the court has directed it’... This is the attitude developed by the executive.”

TRF was created by the Pakistan army and the ISI in response to nullification of Article 370 in 2019 by the central government.“Commander of proscribed terror outfit TRF Afaq Sikander killed in encounter,” said a police spokesman quoting Inspector General of Police Kashmir Range, Vijay Kumar.Both the operations were underway till the time of print.Separately, two CRPF personnel and a civilian were injured in a grenade attack by terrorists in Baramulla district on Wednesday, police said. “At about 11:15 am, terrorists hurled a grenade near Palhallan Chowk in Pattan area of the north Kashmir district,” a police official said.Two LeT terrorist aides heldTwo Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist associates in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama have been arrested during a joint Naka checking on Wednesday.The police have also recovered two ready-to-use IEDs were recovered from their possession.According to the police, the arrested terrorist associates have been identified as Amir Bashir and Mukhtar Bhat.“Major tragedy averted by Pulwama Police and security forces.

18-11-2021||India||Pandemic did not put a lot of children out of school, but education suffered||When India announced a 68-day long nation-wide lockdown on March 25, 2020 most activities came to a standstill. While economic activities have normalised with easing of restrictions, educational institutions have seen the slowest return to normalcy.How did the pandemic affect education in India? The latest Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) offers the first comprehensive answer to this question. The ASER survey was conducted in September and it has looked at the status of school education in rural areas. The survey was carried out through mobile phone interviews in 581 districts and it has been to gather responses from at least 76000 households. What does the report tell us about the pandemic’s impact on school education?Enrolment levels fell marginally with the pandemicFirst, the good news. The pandemic did not, as expected, lead to a sharp fall in enrolment levels. While the share of children – the ASER report looks at children in the 6-14 years age-group – out of school increased from 4% to 5.5% between the 2018 and 2020 ASER surveys, this number has come down slightly to 4.9% in the 2021 edition. To be sure, these numbers might not tell us the true picture of school enrolment in rural areas. Because the 2021 ASER survey only contacted families through mobile phones, the 2018 comparison given in the latest report has only looked at households which had a mobile phone. This limitation in data collection might have led to the exclusion of some of the poorest households in rural areas. But the pandemic has delayed schooling for many young childrenWhere the pandemic might have hurt the most is when it comes to putting young children in school. A note by Suman Bhattacharya, Director of Research as ASER, given in this year’s report highlights this.“Among 5-8-year-olds, the proportion of children not currently enrolled is 7.2%, much higher than the corresponding proportion among older children and almost the same as in 2020 (7.5%). This year too, the proportion of children not currently enrolled is highest among 5-year-olds, reaching more than 14% in both 2020 and 2021”, Bhattacharya says. “These data point to a critical task ahead – that of ensuring that young children enrol in pre-school and school. It may be that many 5- and 6- year-olds are simply awaiting admission, as is the case every year. But this year is not a normal year, and getting these young children into school is urgent: they have already missed many months of engagement during the critical period of maximum brain development, and once this period is over, the opportunity to help them build firm foundations during the vital early years will be lost”, the report adds.

A final call is yet to be made and the two sides are engaged in consultations to lock down a date for the meeting.The Parliament session is also expected to affect the scheduling of the 2+2 dialogue with the US. The two Indian ministers were earlier expected to travel to Washington this month for the talks with defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken.

Details here||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will be visiting two districts of Uttar Pradesh on Friday to inaugurate a bunch of developmental projects, will also formally hand over in Jhansi the indigenously developed defence equipment to the three chiefs of the Armed Forces.The move is being deemed as a major push to the “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” programme in the defence sector, as the entire set of equipment – including the light combat aircraft (LCA), drones, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were built part-by-part in the country by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) (in case of the LCA) or Indian startups.The Prime Minister will directly hand over to all the three service chiefs the latest defence gears, which also includes an advanced electronic warfare suite for naval ships, designed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured by Bharat Electronics Limited.The LCA incorporates advanced technologies and stealth features for effective combat roles, an official statement said, adding the deployment of Indian UAVs by armed forces is also proof of the growing maturity of the Indian drone industry ecosystem. Meanwhile, the advanced warfare suite – which will be received by the Naval chief on part of the Indian Navy – will be used in different ships including destroyers and frigates.Meanwhile, other developmental projects in Jhansi to be inaugurated by the Prime Minister include the 600 megawatts (MW) ultra-mega solar power park and the Atal Ekta Park.According to the PMO, the 600MW solar power park, proposed to be set up in Jhansi's Garautha area, is being constructed at a cost of more than ₹3,000 crore. The project will be inaugurated, as per the statement, by the Prime Minister when he participates in the foundation laying ceremony at 5:15pm on Friday. The solar power park is expected to help provide the dual benefits of cheaper electricity and grid stability for consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-hand-over-to-armed-forces-made-in-india-defence-equipment-details-here-101637157508090.html

18-11-2021||India||DRDO displays drone swarm in offensive role||New Delhi: The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Wednesday showcased an indigenous capability to carry out offensive missions in enemy territory with scores of drones working in assorted formations to identify, encircle and strike targets, with the loitering munitions being developed to meet a key military requirement and keep soldiers out of harm’s way, officials familiar with the development said.Surveillance and armed drone swarm figure on a new list of Make in India projects that the army plans to pursue in partnership with the industry. Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane released the list last week while rooting for self-reliance in the defence sector and stressing that indigenous technology was key to victory in wars. The Indian Air Force is also fully backing the indigenous development of swarm drone technologies.DRDO’s Young Scientist Laboratory for Asymmetric Technologies is working on swarm technologies to strengthen the country’s military capabilities, the DRDO said in a statement. “DRDO demonstrated a fully operational decentralised swarm of 25 drones flying with minimal human intervention,” it said.The capability demonstration came on the opening day of a three-day defence function in Jhansi linked to the ongoing countrywide celebrations to mark the 75th year of Independence.The event,which was inaugurated by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, seeks to highlight the government’s focus on achieving self-reliance in the defence sector, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to hand over locally produced military hardware, including the light combat helicopter, drones and electronic warfare systems, to the armed forces on November 19.Singh said India was facing several challenges, ranging from border threats to sub-conventional ones such as terror and extremism. “There is a need to create a strong, modern and well-equipped military, along with an equally capable and self-reliant defence industry, which can provide low-cost yet top-quality equipment to our forces in a time-bound manner,” the minister added.The drone swarm showcased capabilities related to distributive sensing, decision making, reconfigurable path planning and autonomous attack, DRDO officials said, adding that swarm algorithms have advanced features for niche and distinctive capabilities.Unmanned systems are best for “dull, dirty and dangerous missions” that a military may be required to carry out, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), who heads the Centre for Air Power Studies.“Reconnaissance for long hours can be dull, exposure to nuclear contaminated zones can be dirty and areas with heavy enemy defences are dangerous. Drone swarms allow you to overwhelm the enemy’s sensors and weapons and hit multiple targets,” Chopra added.The Indian Army carried out a drone swarm technology demonstration at the Army Day-2021 parade in Delhi on January 15, with 75 locally designed and developed drones buzzing in the skies and simulating a raft of missions including offensive operations.Drones within a swarm can carry out a wide range of missions including strikes against tanks, infantry combat vehicles, ammunition holding areas, fuel dumps and terror launch pads, officials have said.The technology demonstrated on January 15 is being developed by the army in partnership with a Bengaluru-based start-up New Space Research and Technologies, with the autonomous drones capable of sneaking 50km into enemy territory and striking targets with high-impact warheads. The drones can strike targets at a range of 100km in a self-destructive assault.India is investing heavily into artificial intelligence, autonomous weapon systems, quantum technologies and robotics for a convergence between its war-fighting philosophies and military attributes of these technologies, the army previously said.The government is encouraging self-reliance is the defence manufacturing sector through several policy decisions including increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) limit from 49% to 74%, notifying 209 defence items that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware.India has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹62,000 crore in the last two months to boost military capability with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons.India has set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-displays-drone-swarm-in-offensive-role-101637150019067.html
18-11-2021||India||Only fully vaccinated people to get ration from next year: Madhya Pradesh govt||The Madhya Pradesh food and civil supplies department has issued an order stating that beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act will not get subsidised ration without proof of Covid-19 vaccination, move aimed at ensuring that those reluctant to be vaccinated against the viral disease are persuaded to do so. The order, released on November 8 to all district civil supplies officers, was made public on Tuesday. According to the order, the beneficiaries will not get ration after December 31 if they fail to get both doses of the Covid -19 vaccine. “A public distribution system (PDS) shopkeeper should ensure the vaccination of all eligible members of 11.5 million families by December 31. PDS shopkeepers should paste the necessary information regarding vaccination at all their shops. The Patrata (eligibility) slips have the names of all the members of the family. The shopkeepers should ensure that all the eligible beneficiaries have been vaccinated,” said the order. “If they are not vaccinated, the shopkeeper has to ensure counselling sessions at nearby health facilities. The shopkeepers should also provide a list of non-vaccinated and those beneficiaries, who have taken only the first dose, to a nearby hospital every week,” said the order. According to the state health department, about 90.18 % residents of the state received the first dose while 50.1% are fully vaccinated till Tuesday. The total eligible population in the state for vaccination is 54 million.Food and civil supplies department principal secretary Faiz Ahmed Kidwai said: “We will review the situation on December 31. The basic objective of the no-vaccination-no-ration drive is to motivate people for vaccination against Covid-19,” Kidwai added. December 31 is the Indian government’s deadline for completely vaccinating all 940 million adults in the country. Thus far, vaccine coverage has crossed 80% (at least one dose), a level at which experts expect vaccne hesitancy to kick in. Measures such as linking Covid-vaccination certificates to government benefits will likely be needed to persuade more people to get vaccinated. A senior IAS officer, on condition of anonymity, said, “In a review meeting for vaccination of Covid 19 (held in the first week of November), it was decided to ensure vaccination of beneficiaries of all government schemes and government employees by December 31. The department has decided to release an order of no vaccination, no benefits. The order of the civil supplies department is a part of it.” The opposition Congress targeted the state government over the order and termed it as “threatening”.MP Congress committee spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “The MP government failed to win the trust of people to complete the vaccination so the department officers have been asked to threaten beneficiaries. How can they stop the benefits of the scheme for vaccination which is completely a personal choice?” This order only exposes the failure of the government to motivate people for vaccination, he addedHowever, state medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, “We have decided that all the departments of the state government will motivate people for 100% vaccination. The government’s objective is not to stop the benefits but to ensure vaccination for the safety of people.” The Madhya Pradesh government on Wednesday announced that it would achieve 100% vaccination against Covid-19 by December 25. Meanwhile, in a review meeting of Covid 19 on Wednesday held with health department officers, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced the end of all the restrictions invoked to contain the virus as the number of active cases are now less than 100 in MP, but he requested people to continue to use masks, said Sarang. On Wednesday, the state recorded five new Covid case and the number of total active Covid cases stood at 78.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-vaccination-no-ration-says-mp-govt-s-order-in-bid-to-achieve-inoculation-target-101637148098733.html

18-11-2021||Today's||The limits of the Gandhi-Khurshid strategy||In this age of social media outrage, prime time noise and WhatsApp forwards, every word spoken or written in the public domain travels across the universe in real time at supersonic speed. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s vast social media army, in particular, has mastered the art of latching onto even the slightest slip by its political opponents to create a storm in cyberspace and beyond. The latest example is the response to Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s book on the Ayodhya judgment, which has one sentence drawing a parallel between a “robust version” of political Hindutva and the jihadist Islam of terror groups such as Islamic State and Boko Haram.
