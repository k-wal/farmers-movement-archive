Many traders, middlemen, tempo drivers and worker associations have opposed the decision and given an ultimatum till November 19 to withdraw the new charges or will call for market closure strike from November 21. On Tuesday, a meeting was held by the APMC chairman Madhukant Garad with various Marketyard organisations and unions over parking fees for traders’ vehicles. In the meeting members from different organisations opposed to charge any fees for parking of vehicles. After the meeting, all the unions unanimously decided to go on an indefinite strike from November 21, if the parking fees decision is not withdrawn. “In the meeting it was decided to charge ₹50 for three wheelers and ₹100 for other commercial vehicles for two hours which bring various types of goods to the market. There were several unwanted vehicles roaming around the market regularly and also it was found that some people were illegally taking parking charges from vehicles. So, to stop the illegal practice, we have started parking charges through a contractor for the commercial vehicles. However, after the opposition from the organisations, we have decided to reduce the parking fees and increase its timing,” said Garad. Vilas Bhujbal, leader of the association of traders and commission agents at the Marketyard said, “The parking charges decided by the APMC are too high and not affordable to traders, middlemen, workers, tempo or any other commercial vehicle drivers. For two hours ₹50 and ₹100 are charged, which a tempo driver earns after one trip. Hence, to pay that as parking charge is unfair. So, we have decided to go on strike if this decision is not taken back till November 21.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/unions-oppose-parking-charges-for-commercial-vehicles-at-apmc-pune-101637173796598.html
17-11-2021||Lucknow||Ganga pollution case:HC seeks reply of Kashi Vishwanath Spl Area Development Authority||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has issued notices to Sri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Authority and asked it to file affidavit through its chief executive officer, giving details of the schemes and all constructions which are proposed or are underway in and around the river Ganga in Varanasi district. Expressing concern over non-co-operation among different departments of the state government on the issue of Ganga pollution, which is causing a lot of confusion before the court, a three-judge Bench of Allahabad high court has asked the chief secretary, UP to examine this aspect and issue required directions to obviate confusion and to have effective representation of the stand of the government before the court. Hearing a matter relating to Ganga pollution, the three-judge bench comprising justices Manoj Kumar Gupta, Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar said, “We notice that different departments, nodal and executing agencies are represented through different counsels among whom there is no coordination, resulting in a lot of confusion. If the additional advocate general is representing the state, we expect that he should have full instructions, at least in respect of all matters falling under the purview of state government or its instrumentalities.” Regarding purity of Ganga water, the court said that the report from IIT, Kanpur was still awaited and allowed some more time to enable it to complete the tests and submit the desired report. “We accept the request and permit submission of the report in sealed cover through registrar general of this court by the next date”, the court added, while fixing December 6, 2021 for further hearing of the matter. The court was not satisfied with the approach of the Prayagraj Nagar Nigam regarding cremation on the bank of river Ganga and said,” We do not appreciate the mindset with which the Nagar Nigam is handling the issue. No doubt, on account of religious beliefs, a few people avail the services of electric crematoriums, but we feel that if proper facilities are provided at the electric crematoriums and people are educated and made aware of the advantages and disadvantages of their use, more and more people will avail the facilities.” In this backdrop, the court in its order dated November 12 directed the additional chief secretary, Nagar Vikas, UP government, Lucknow to examine the matter and place before this court its plan in respect of improvement of the infrastructure of the two electric crematoriums and the time frame within which it would be implemented. On the question of ban on use of plastic, the commissioner, Prayagraj division has filed his affidavit annexing therewith order dated November 8, 2021, whereby a committee comprising of ADM city, Prayagraj, additional municipal commissioner, Nagar Nigam, Prayagraj and superintendent of police (City), Prayagraj has been formed to oversee the implementation of the ban on plastic carry bags in pursuance of government order (GO) dated July 15, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ganga-pollution-case-hc-seeks-reply-of-kashi-vishwanath-spl-area-development-authority-101637173256383.html
17-11-2021||Lucknow||UP clerics miffed over book authored by Wasim Rizvi||LUCKNOW Former Shia Waqf Board chairman Wasim Rizvi’s book titled ‘Muhammad’ has sparked a fresh controversy with UP clerics condemning its cover page that portrays a man with a semi-naked woman. They also accused Rizvi of making objectionable comments against Prophet Muhammad. Some of the religious organisations, including the All-India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB), served notices on him, while a few approached the UP government seeking an FIR in the matter. “He made many anti-Islamic statements in the past, but this time all limits have been crossed. We strongly oppose his book ‘Muhammad’, especially the cover page that portrays a man with a semi-naked woman and demand an FIR against him,” said senior Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad on Wednesday. The cleric said he submitted a ‘tehreer’ against Rizvi at the Chowk Kotwali, but the FIR was yet to be registered. On November 4, former chairman of Shia Waqf Board Wasim Rizvi released the book at Dasna Delvi temple at Ghaziabad in the presence of Hindutva leader Narsinghanand Saraswati. However, the issue snowballed on November 15, after Rizvi posted the cover page image and buy link of the book on his facebook wall with a note—‘You can easily download e-book Muhammad from here’. The AISMPLB was the first to register protest. “It’s a shameful act that is not at all expected, especially from the person who is a Shia. The act has hurt religious sentiments of the people here and in Iraq and other countries,” said Maulana Yasoob Abbas, general secretary, AISMPLB. The board served a notice to Wasim Rizvi and approached the UP Government, demanding action in the matter. “You are hereby directed to withdraw your statement with immediate effect and issue an unconditional public apology for the comment or else criminal proceedings under Section 153 A and 295 A of the IPC,” reads the AISMPLB notice. Apart from Shia Muslims, Sunni Muslims too opposed the book. “Ignoring it is the only solution. People generally read books of authors who are subject matter experts, but unfortunately he is no expert. It is just a publicity stunt, which should be ignored,” said Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, Imam Eidgah and member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (APMPL). Wasim Rizvi issued a statement, saying he was receiving life threats for writing the book titled ‘Muhammad’ and challenging 26 verses from the Quran. “I have also heard that the maulanas said that my remains would not be allowed to be buried at Muslim graveyards. In such a situation, I want my remains to be cremated as per Hindu rituals and not buried at the graveyard. I have also made changes in my will, a copy of which has been marked to the district administration, asking them that if anything happens to me, my body shall be handed over to my Hindu friends and my last rites would be performed by Narsinghanand Saraswati,” he stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-clerics-miffed-over-book-authored-by-wasim-rizvi-101637173016497.html

How can you hope for justice and protection from those who commit atrocities,” she said during her interaction with some 5000 women at Ram Ghat on the banks of the Mandakini river in Chitrakoot.The decision of giving 40% tickets to woman was a beginning, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said.“I want 50% women contesting the elections in 2024,” she said.She reiterated several promises to women. Apart from a separate manifesto that is being prepared, she once again promised smartphones for class 12 pass girls and electric scooties for girls who have completed graduation, free travel for women in government buses, an honorarium of ₹10,000 for anganwadi workers and old age pension of ₹1000.“The mobile will help in your safety and the scooty in your studies. All travels will be free for you in government buses,” she said.Hitting out at the BJP government, she said that the son of a Union minister crushed farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri and the government helped him. This was a reference to the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 when eight people, including four farmers, were killed. Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra is the key accused in the case. He was arrested on October 9 and is currently in jail. The district and sessions rejected his bail application on November 15. Ashish Mishra has repeatedly denied his involvement in the incident.The Congress general secretary also referred to her recent meeting with some ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers who were earlier allegedly beaten up by police while trying to raise their demands at a public meeting.“When you are being exploited and tortured on a routine basis, if you ask for your rights from those beating you, you will never get it. You have to fight for your rights,” she said.“If the government is not doing anything for you, then why should it continue?” she asked.The women present at the interaction included students, anganwadi workers, lawyers and members of self-help groups. They shared with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra the problems they faced at home and at the workplace.She promised them that the party would stand by them and help them in solving their problems in the best possible manner.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also offered prayers at the famous Matgajendra Shiv temple in Chitrakoot and performed jalabhishek there.

17-11-2021||Mumbai||After monsoon withdrawal, PM2.5 levels shot up by 320% in six weeks||The concentration of PM2.5 - Mumbai’s most widely prevalent air pollutant - shot up four times within six weeks, official data shows. In the week ending October 7, when sporadic showers were still occurring over the city, air quality monitors registered an average daily PM2.5 concentration of 27.5ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre of air), taken as an average of the preceding week.By November 1, this quantum had increased to 61ug/m3, rising further to 89.4ug/m3 on November 15. That is an increase of 320% from the first week of October. Most of the city’s PM2.5 load, as demonstrated by multiple studies, comes from anthropogenic sources including road dust, construction and demolition activities and vehicular emissions.The ‘safe’ threshold for PM2.5 concentration, as stipulated in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), is 60ug/m3 per day. As per the World Health Organisation, the daily safe limit is 15ug/m3. Experts attributed the pollution spike to an accumulation of particulate matter in the city’s air, which is a typical phenomenon at this point in its pollution cycle.PM2.5 refers to tiny, airborne particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter or about thirty times less than the width of a human hair. These particles can be inhaled by humans on exposure, leading to a range of adverse health impacts, from respiratory distress, cardiovascular disease and accelerated organ degeneration on prolonged exposure. HT examined daily PM2.5 data for a period of 120 days between August 1 and November 15 this year, and found a significant upward spike in the daily average quantum of these pollutants soon after October 7, as the influence of the southwest monsoon began to recede from the city. The official date of monsoon withdrawal this year was October 14.The data examined was obtained from a network of 20 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) operated across Mumbai by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), and is publicly available via a Central Pollution Control Board dashboard. Only one station, in Malad, did not provide actionable data and was not considered in HT’s analysis.“In the first week of October, PM pollution remained quite low because of post-monsoon showers, which were washing these particles out of the air. Wind speeds were also high which helped to disperse them,” said Gufran Beig, Project Director, SAFAR. As the withdrawal date of the southwest monsoon began to approach, not only did sporadic showers stop, but wind speeds also slowed down to less than 10kmph in most parts of the city. “Whereas during the monsoon, the winds can travel with speeds well over 20kmph,” Beig explained.“To add to this, the temperature also began to drop, because the air became less humid as the monsoon withdrew. Warm air rises, and with it, pollutants also settle higher in the atmosphere. But when air is cooled, it reduces the height of the ‘inversion layer’, which is the part of the atmosphere where temperature stops decreasing with height. This in turn reduces the ‘mixing height’ of airborne pollutants and settles them much closer to the earth’s surface, so much so that the air around us can start turning hazy,” Beig said. Several studies have highlighted the severe impact that exposure to PM2.5 can have on human beings. In September this year, an annually updated index known as the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute (EPIC), estimated that exposure to PM2.5 in Mumbai is reducing the average life expectancy in Mumbai by as much as 3.7 years.In a statement released at the time, researchers at EPIC noted, “Particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone... (and) has increased so much in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. For example, the average person in those states is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, relative to early 2000s,” it said.Dr Piyush Goel, a pulmonologist with a leading chain of private hospitals in Asia, explained that PM2.5 particles are minute enough to enter the alveoli in human lungs, where the exchange of respiratory gases takes place. “When this alien material, which comes from vehicles, construction and many other sources, enters the alveoli, the body begins to secrete mediating enzymes which cause destruction of lung tissue,” he said. These particles can even be tiny enough to pass through the alveoli and enter the bloodstream, from where they get deposited in other organs, making them degenerate.“On the whole, inhalation of PM2.5 leads to a gradual degeneration of various parts of the body, which results in accelerated ageing. This may be one reason why we’re seeing younger people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), heart attacks and similar ailments which were earlier majorly seen in older age groups,” Dr Goel said.Dr VM Motghare, Joint Director (air quality) at the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-monsoon-withdrawal-pm2-5-levels-shot-up-by-320-in-six-weeks-101637172476296.html

Albuquerque holds an annual hot air balloon festival, and this year, in October, 600 balloons were in the sky at one point.In the opening session of the show in Varanasi, five children from an orphanage, Covid-19 warriors, and locals took a free balloon ride, to experience the scenic views of Kashi from the sky, regional tourism officer, Kirtiman Srivastava said. Around 50 people took the balloon ride on the first day, he said.The tourism department has fixed a price of Rs500 per ticket for flying in a balloon. The enthusiasm and excitement for this event can be gauged from the fact that all tickets were sold out within three hours, Srivastav said.Some balloons have a capacity of five passengers, while others may carry eight passengers.All balloons will take off under instruction from the Air Traffic Control, Varanasi, Srivastava added. The balloon will take off with ‘passengers’ and will go up in the air and land after 45 minutes, he said.Four centres have been identified in the city for the balloons to take-off and land. These are Domri, CHS Sports Ground, BLW Sports Ground, and Sigra Stadium. The balloons will take off from one of these locations daily. From which location the balloons take off daily will depend upon the direction of the wind on that day.This effort of the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department will make the city’s tourism famous internationally. This will not only give a boost to the tourism industry but also will increase the employment of local people, said Srivastava.On the occasion of Dev Deepawali, devotees will get to see the beautiful ghats from the sky through tethered flights on the night of November 18 and 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-excitement-in-varanasi-as-3-day-hot-air-balloon-fest-begins-101637172416263.html
17-11-2021||Lucknow||Power load: 3 Noida engineers found guilty of giving fiscal benefits to builder||A departmental inquiry committee has found three Noida engineers guilty of illegally giving financial benefits to a colonizer while sanctioning the power load for the Gaur Saundaryam multi-storey residential complex in Greater Noida, besides committing various other irregularities in the same matter. People dealing with the issue said that the financial loss that the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) suffered due to the irregularities had been calculated to be more than ₹10 crore and the corporation, they said, had made up its mind to take stern action against the guilty. The new scam in Noida has come to the fore even as the UPPCL is still to act against a dozen engineers and clerks who were found guilty two months ago of illegally issuing temporary power connections of smaller loads for the construction of multi-storey apartments in Noida, causing huge revenue loss to the corporation. Directed by the UPPCL two weeks ago, the Meerut discom managing director set up a three-member committee to probe charges of irregularities in the development of the power infrastructure for the Gaur Saundaryam residential apartment comprising 2068 flats. As per the inquiry committee’s findings into the current case, the technical feasibility report (TFR) for the sanction of 5200 KVA load for the under-construction residential complex in Greater Noida was approved and signed by the executive engineer, distribution and transmission, against the rules that required approval by the chief engineer, transmission. The technical report also did not bear any date. The committee further found that the builder applied for the power load for 2068 flats but the accused did not calculate the required load of three towers comprising 208 flats which benefitted the builder in financial terms. The accused, it was found, also recovered lower supervision charges and cable charges from the builder. The committee said that then SDO, Greater Noida, then executive engineer, Greater Noida and then superintending engineer, Noida were primarily responsible for giving financial benefit to the builder by bungling in the calculation of the power load, showing lower cost f the estimate and recovering lower supervision charges. “Another confidential report prepared by the UPPCL has estimated the loss to the department to be more than ₹10 crore because of intentional irregularities committed by the then engineers,” a UPPCL official said. The UPPCL ordered inquiry into the matter after some local residents sent a complaint with documentary evidences to MD, Pankaj Kumar some time back. Chief engineer, Noida region, VN Singh, superintending engineer, Noida, Niranjan Kumar Singh and executive engineer, Greater Noida, Dheerendra Kumar who conducted the probe, submitted their findings on November 11. Kumar, when asked, said that action against the accused was in progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/power-load-3-noida-engineers-found-guilty-of-giving-fiscal-benefits-to-builder-101637172296315.html

This essentially means more than half of the housing societies in the city are fully vaccinated. BMC puts the approximate number of such societies in Mumbai at 25,000, although, many are yet to be registered. Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner of the BMC, said, “In the city, 14,207 housing societies were given the fully vaccinated tag till November 15.”The civic body will paste the tag with a QR code outside the societies with fully inoculated adult population. This will also help civic officials map areas with individuals partially vaccinated. On the basis of this data, the BMC will set up mobile vaccination centres in clusters to cover 15-20 societies.The exercise was launched in the first week of October. The BMC had issued request letters to housing societies, asking them details of the vaccination status of the eligible population, including daily visitors such as maids, gardeners, milkmen etc. By October end, around 10,000 housing societies got the fully-vaccinated status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-14-000-housing-societies-get-fully-vaccinated-tag-101637172118954.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||BMC vaccinates 8,678 bedridden patients at home||Since July, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has vaccinated 8,672 bedridden patients in the city, of whom 3,918 are fully inoculated till November 17. This means, nearly 45 per cent of the bedridden citizens have been given both doses of vaccine, while a majority of 54 per cent have taken the first jab. Following a high court order, BMC started a special door-to-door drive inoculating patients who are unable to reach vaccination centres due to medical reasons. Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner and Public Health In-charge in BMC, said that initially, 4,500 patients had enrolled themselves for the drive. Post this, the number of doses were administered as per demand at the ward level. “Unlike other categories, we didn’t have a set target as the service is strictly based on demand. The beneficiary is inoculated within three days after they make a call,” Kakani told HT on Tuesday. He further added that many beneficiaries took the first jab at the vaccination centre and requested the second one at their doorstep. “There are beneficiaries whose movements are confined due to old age or several co-morbidities. Many of them availed the doorstep vaccination because of the available service,” he stated. Shishir Joshi, Founder and CEO of Project Mumbai – a non-profit group that provided the BMC logistical support for this drive, said that a maximum number of patients were inoculated over the last two months. “When the drive was announced, there was still some sort of vaccine hesitancy among people. Some beneficiaries stayed in slum areas and congested localities, where our ambulances couldn’t reach. However, as time progressed, the drive gained momentum,” Joshi said. He added that each vial of vaccine is equipped to inoculate 15 beneficiaries at a time, so they had to ensure that the doses are not wasted. Prashant Gaikwad, Assistant Municipal Commissioner from D ward (Malabar Hill and Breach Candy), said that the war room played a key role in managing the door-to-door vaccination drive. “Our medical teams are coordinating with the war room directly. Whenever we get a call, we deploy a medical team,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-vaccinates-8-678-bedridden-patients-at-home-101637171936254.html
17-11-2021||Lucknow||Congress recruiting articulate youths to spread party’s message across Uttar Pradesh||Lucknow: Ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress proposes to recruit a new team of spokespersons to forcefully put across its point of view and take its message to every nook and corner of the state. A written examination is being conducted in different districts and some new faces aspiring to be spokesperson or media coordinator (one spokesperson and one media coordinator in every district) of the Congress are joining the party, hoping to be heard by the people amid the rising political din. Questions in the examinations focus on the Congress history, the freedom movement, the role of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the ideological battle, secularism and reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the other backward classes etc. “The last words that Mahatma Gandhi said following his assassination?” was one of the questions that expected examinees to express their views about what led to assassination of the Father of the Nation. “Who was the first woman president of Indian National Congress?” was another, expecting that they knew about the election of Annie Besant to the post. The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) that recently launched the “Banein UP Ki Awaz” (Be the voice of Uttar Pradesh) campaign, is conducting the examinations to induct youths into the Congress fold and identify those already within the party. Most of the examinees, who were seen speaking to electronic media soon after taking the examination, said they were inspired by the Congress ideology and its leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. “I have been aspiring to join a political party as spokesperson for the past few months. I used to take part in debates in college. When Covid-19 restrictions were imposed, I watched debates about deaths due to shortage of oxygen and realized how the opposition failed to put up a joint front to corner the state government. Then I came across the Congress campaign for appointment of spokespersons and consulted the Congress leaders of my area in Badaun district. I have taken the Congress membership and the examination at Lucknow on Tuesday,” said Jitin Kumar (19), a law student in Lucknow University. “I am inspired by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who has been raising issues of public concern. I have been working for women and hope to work with her to bring about an improvement in their condition,” said Ashiya Ali, who took the examination in Unnao on Monday. The UPCC proposes to complete the exercise of appointing spokespersons in the next few weeks. “The Congress is holding examination to appoint a spokesman and a media coordinator (two posts) in each district. We are conducting written examination to recruit the party’s spokespersons. About 23 applicants took the examination in Unnao on Monday while 16 candidates appeared for the test in Lucknow on Tuesday. We will cover Lucknow division by November 21 and rest of the state in coming weeks,” said Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) spokesperson Uma Shankar Pandey. “Rahul Gandhi recently said those willing to fight the RSS should be inducted while those scared should leave the Congress. This campaign has been launched by the UPCC at the behest of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to give a voice to the youths who can fight ideological battles,” said Pankaj Srivastava, vice president, UPCC media department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-recruiting-articulate-youths-to-spread-party-s-message-across-uttar-pradesh-101637171876615.html

17-11-2021||Lucknow||Post Purvanchal Expressway inauguration, work on three other expressways expedited||After the inauguration of Purvanchal Expressway by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, the state government has expedited the construction work on the Bundelkhand expressway and Gorakhpur Link expressway, as well as acquisition of land for the Ganga expressway. In view of the crucial assembly election likely to be held early next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hopes that rings of expressways across Uttar Pradesh will assist it playing the development card and neutralizing the non-performance tirade of the opposition parties. That the expressways are likely to emerge as a major poll plank can be gauged from the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath chose the inauguration programme of the Purvanchal expressway to launch an attack on the opposition. “Instead of developing infrastructure facilities, the opposition parties; governments reduced UP to poverty and mafia rule”, the Prime Minister said. To counter the BJP attack, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav organized the fourth leg of Samajwadi Vijay Yatra from Ghazipur to Lucknow via Purvanchal expressway on Wednesday. Lauding his government’s achievement in the infrastructure sector, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the double engine BJP government planned to make UP an expressway state with maximum network of expressways. The state government would give momentum to the construction of the Bundelkhand expressway, Gorakhpur Link expressway and Ganga expressway, he said. A meeting of the officers was held under the chairmanship of chief executive officer (CEO) Uttar Pradesh Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) Awanish Awasthi on Wednesday to review the construction of the Bundelkhand expressway through video conferencing. Awasthi said the construction of the 296.07 km Bundelkhand expressway that will pass through seven districts- Chitrakoot, Banda, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Auraiya and Etawah ---was going on at a fast pace. More than 76% physical work of the project had been completed. The construction of bridges on rivers Yamuna and Betwa had been expedited and work on the remaining structures- Railway overbridges, toll plazas, toilets blocks and fuel stations was also going on in full swing. The bituminous level work on 227 km of the expressway had been completed in record time. The plan was to inaugurate Bundelkhand expressway soon, he said. The acquisition of 94% land for 594 km long Ganga expressway that will pass through 12 districts- Meerut, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Amroha, Sambhal, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh and Prayagraj--- has been completed. The acquisition of the remaining land was continuing on aa war footing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was likely to lay the foundation of the ₹36,229.67-crore expressway next month, he said. As much as 99% clearing and grubbing work and 50% earth work on the 91.352 km long Gorakhpur Link expressway that will pass through - Gorakhpur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar and Azamgarh had been completed. The total physical progress of the project was more than 29%. Despite the delay caused by the Covid pandemic, the construction agencies were working to bring the construction rate to pre- pandemic period, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/post-purvanchal-expressway-inauguration-work-on-three-other-expressways-expedited-101637171577548.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai wakes up to second-warmest November morning in 10 years||Recording a minimum temperature of 26.5 degrees Celsius, the city woke up to its second-warmest November morning in 10 years on Wednesday. The only time the state capital woke up to a higher minimum temperature was on November 4, 2018, when the mercury rose to 27.4 degrees Celsius. Experts attributed the rise in temperature to the continued influence of a low-pressure system in the Arabian Sea, close to the Maharashtra coast, which scuttled wind patterns and led to an influx of moisture over the Konkan.“A weak low-pressure system is bringing moisture in from the sea. This is making the air warmer. Also, with the wind speeds remaining slow, there is no cooling effect. This increasing humidity is also a sign of a thunderstorm brewing around Mumbai,” said a meteorologist with the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. He added that parts of south Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra received rainfall on Tuesday evening.As per the IMD’s monitoring station in Santacruz, Mumbai’s relative humidity stood at 84% on Wednesday morning, significantly up from 64% the earlier day. Ratnagiri received 38mm of rain, Vengurla got 63mm over, Nanded 24mm, Satara 15.55mm, and Pune received 7.4mm of rainfall until 8:30 am on Wednesday.There was also an improvement in Mumbai’s air quality. The city’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 269 at 8:30 am on Wednesday and improved significantly to 201 by 12:30 pm. Colaba continued to register the city’s most polluted air with an AQI of 320 (down from 370 the day prior). As per the Central Pollution Control Board, this can cause ‘respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.’ Malad, which clocked an AQI of 327 on Tuesday, showed improved air quality with an index value of 290 later.A similar improvement was seen in Bandra-Kurla Complex, where the AQI dropped from 311 on Tuesday to 228 on Wednesday afternoon. Chembur (183), Borivali (133), Worli (93), Bhandup (99) and Navi Mumbai (113) also saw slight improvements.“If it continues to rain through the night, the pollution levels will drop further, as will the minimum and maximum temperature,” said the IMD official cited above.The city on Wednesday recorded a maximum temperature of 34.5 degrees Celsius, down from 35.7 degrees Celsius the previous day. As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast, maximum temperature will remain between 34 and 35 degrees Celsius over the next week, while the minimum temperature will remain between 24 and 25 degrees Celsius. Cloudy skies are expected to prevail till Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-wakes-up-to-second-warmest-november-morning-in-10-years-101637171576297.html

17-11-2021||Mumbai||Communal sentiments raked up for BJP’s benefit: Sharad Pawar||NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) referring to the recent communal unrest in Amravati. He said there was no need for a reaction over whatever happened in Tripura, however, there is also suspicion that communal sentiments were raked up to take their benefits in the assembly elections scheduled in a few states, which needs to be thoroughly investigated. The BJP had called for a bandh in Amravati on Saturday which led to large-scale violence and arson. The NCP supremo has started a four-day tour of Vidarbha region from Wednesday. He is expected to visit areas such as Nagpur, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Yavatmal and Wardha where he will be meeting party leaders and likely to hold party gatherings. “There was no need to react here in Maharashtra for whatever happened in Tripura. But unfortunately, some people took law and order into their hands. Some people also suspect that another section came out to rake up communal sentiments to take its benefits in the upcoming assembly polls (in a few states). All this needs to be thoroughly investigated,” Pawar said in his reaction to the violence that occurred in three cities including Amravati. He also slammed former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and said that the statements made by him are unbecoming of a leader who has ruled the state. “The statements made by Fadnavis in the last three-four days were unbecoming of a leader who has ruled the state. I was also the chief minister four times, but while speaking on a sensitive issue, I have never made a statement as an opposition leader. Instead, I always kept the interest of the state on the top. I would have understood if Chandrakant Patil (Maharashtra BJP chief) would have made such a statement but I am shocked to hear it from Fadnavis. The restlessness after losing power is understandable but it should go to an extreme level,” Pawar said responding to a Fadnavis statement on violence in the state. Fadnavis on Tuesday said that the violence in three cities in Maharashtra was an experiment to create anarchy in the country and to polarise minority communities against the ruling central government. When asked to comment on an intelligence report that had “found” that the BJP and Yuva Sena were behind the Amravati violence, Pawar said that he would take the details in this regard and react accordingly. “It’s a sensitive issue and I will react to it only after getting the details,” he added. He also said that it would be a far-fetched statement to make that the violence is a failure of the home department and state government as it was done by a section of the society for a specific purpose. Coming on leading an alternative against the BJP at the centre, he said the decision is likely to be taken during the upcoming winter session of the parliament. “We are ready to support whoever is ready to lead. We (opposition leaders) will get more opportunities to meet during the parliament session and will surely discuss this. We all have attended meetings called by (West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief) Mamata Banerjee, me and (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi in the past,” Pawar responded. Meanwhile, Pawar also advised people to neglect Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut who has made objectionable remarks against Mahatma Gandhi. “What to say about a person having a habit of making irresponsible statements. Mahatma Gandhi was accepted by the world, now if someone is making such comments against him that it is better, he or she should be neglected,” Pawar concluded. BOX BJP hits back In the heels of Pawar’s remarks on BJP, vice-president, state BJP unit Madhav Bhandari sharply responded, “There was no violence reported in Tripura as being claimed. There was also a campaign going on for five to six days on social media to incite riots in Maharashtra in the name of alleged Tripura violence. What did the state government or the home department do to stop it? It was their responsibility to control the situation. Moreover, NCP corporator has also been arrested in Malegaon for violence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/communal-sentiments-raked-up-for-bjp-s-benefit-sharad-pawar-101637170976190.html

The bank of the Ganga has turned into a tent city and youngsters can be seen playing kabaddi, volley-ball and other games. It also turns into a potential platform for political and social issues. There is a lot of enthusiasm among devotees this year because the Mela was not organised last year due to the pandemic. Similar melas are also organised on the banks of the Ganga in Tigri village of Amroha district and Anoopshahr of Bulandshahr district and lakhs of people also visit them and take a dip in the holy Ganga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/garhmukteshwar-kartik-fair-tight-security-for-deepdaan-today-101637170796161.html

17-11-2021||Patna||Covid effect on education: Smartphones increasing, but digital divide a concern||The Covid-19 pandemic made smartphones the most effective tool for education, which was mostly online during the period, though its availability across all sections raised concerns about the digital divide, according to the annual status of education report (ASER) – 2021 released on Wednesday.The report says that irrespective of financial constraints during the pandemic, people still went for smartphones for the education of their wards, with Bihar recording a significant jump in its availability. The availability was, however, higher among wards of comparatively well-off parents going to private schools, but the survey says even illiterate parents bought mobile phones for their wards’ education.The report is a household survey conducted via phone in the rural areas and sampling was done from the representative sample of households from the ASER 2018 survey – the last nationwide ASER survey that was carried out in the field. This is the sixteenth ASER report.Compared to 2018, when smartphone availability was just 36.5% in the country, it jumped to 67.6% in 2021 — 63.7% in the government schools and 79% in the private schools. In Bihar, the jump was from 27.2% in 2018 to 54.4% in 2021, though it is mostly useful for students in higher classes. However, more than half the children having smartphones (53.8%) nationwide are not able to use the device for educational purposes. The survey says that the digital divide could be apparent in schools once they open and the weak students would require greater attention to catch up.There has also been a shift in the gradual admission pattern over the last couple of years. This year, more students in the 6-14 age group got enrolled in the government schools. While 76.9% of students enrolled in the government schools in Bihar in 2020, it increased to 80.5% in 2021.However, dependence on private tuition has also increased, not only in Bihar, but across the country, except Kerala. The dependence increased especially during the pandemic period, though it may increase the void between those who can afford private tuition and those who cannot.While 64.3% students enrolled in schools took private tuition in 2020 in Bihar, the figure increased to 73.5% in 2021, which may be due to erratic schooling, engagement of teachers in on-academic work, poor quality and desire to prepare for competitive exams for engineering, medical and other technical or vocational streams. The survey says it is important to understand the impact of disruption in education in schools so that effective and timely steps could be taken. “With the enrolment in government schools increasing, schools and teachers need to be prepared for that. The involvement of parents in children’s education, as laid down in the new education policy, also needs to be affirmed,” it says.Dr Rukmini Banerji, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Pratham Educational Foundation, who was awarded the 2021 Yidan Prize for Education Development for her work in improving learning outcomes, said that in Bihar, 95% students whose parents had less than Class 5 education studied in the government schools, while it came down to 76.8% in case of wards of parents having above lass 9 education, indicating that higher the education level of parents, greater the preference for private schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pandemic-effect-on-education-aser-says-smartphones-increasing-but-digital-divide-a-concern-101637168518071.html

17-11-2021||Mumbai||Infectious aerosols can linger in washrooms: IIT-B study||Shared washrooms spaces in public areas such as restaurants, offices, trains and aircrafts are likely to have dead zones where aerosols carrying infectious agents like Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – can linger up to 10 times longer than the rest of the room, a new study by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) has revealed. Dead zones are corners where there is no circulation of fresh air. The study indicates that transmission of Covid-19 is, therefore, more likely in washrooms with dead zones, and that airflow should be well-engineered in order to mitigate the risk of the disease transmission. Researchers at IIT-B used a computer simulation model of a washroom that had a door, an exhaust fan on one wall, a washbasin console in the corner and a toilet seat in centre to study the airflow field and the distribution of aerosols. Their primary focus was on the regions of recirculating flow – which they called the dead zones –that can harbour infectious aerosol for much longer than the well-ventilated parts of the room. The study found two dead zones: the most prominent one was the washbasin console where particles that were injected kept recirculating and took much longer to be evacuated. Washbasins are typically crammed between walls, in a corner, which results in the air getting trapped and recirculating. This spot is more concerning in terms of disease transmission as one tends to spend more time near this area, said the authors. The second dead zone was at the height of two metres near the ceiling. This is a slightly less concerning spot as people using the washroom don’t come in contact with the aerosols at such a height. Dead zones could be right next to a window, door or even an air conditioner blowing air, and could be mistaken to be safe, ventilated spaces, the researchers pointed. They said that ventilation designs are often based on air changes per hour, but the air changes are not uniform in all corners of the room. In dead zones, these air changes could be 10 times lower. A way to tackle the infection hazard in such dead spaces is by studying the air circulation within the room before placing the ducts and fans, the study said. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who was not involved in the study, said that the IIT-B study is “extremely significant in the current scenario.” He said, “Countries such as Australia implemented a larger health measure by installing ultraviolet lights in public washrooms about two decades ago to deter intravenous drug users. They found that UV lights also played a role in reducing the bacteria and other pathogens in the washrooms. We should look at such technologies, not just for Covid-19 but for overall infection control in enclosed spaces.” DISRUPTING DEAD ZONES “The water used in the washroom for flushing or washing is a source of aerosols,” said Krishnendu Sinha, a professor of aerospace engineering at IIT Bombay and one of the authors of the study that was published in the journal Physics of Fluids this month. “When people using the washrooms cough, sneeze, spit or talk, they release droplets that are also likely to linger around in areas which are recirculation zones or dead zones,” he said. If a person using the washroom is infected with Covid-19, it immediately puts the other washroom users at the risk of contracting the infection. According to Sinha, disrupting the dead zones can play an important role in mitigating such risks. “Firstly, such dead zones should be identified in shared washrooms. Ways to disrupt or eliminate these zones include placing a fan to direct the airflow towards such corners, keeping the doors open between two consecutive usages or turning the angles of louvers towards the dead zones,” he said. The researchers said that the aim should be to replace the air in the washroom after every use, to let out any infectious aerosols generated by a user. “In addition to breaking the recirculation zone, there should also be a good exhaust system to suck out the air from the room to enable air changes,” said Janani Srree Murallidharan, an associate professor at IIT Bombay’s mechanical engineering department and a co-author of the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/infectious-aerosols-can-linger-in-washrooms-iit-b-study-101637166175753.html
17-11-2021||Lucknow||UP govt schools saw highest increase in enrolment during pandemic: ASER report||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh has shown a marked growth in enrollment of students in government schools during the Covid-19 pandemic.The state saw a 13.2% increase in the number of children (aged 6-14 years) in government schools between 2018 and 2021, as per the 16th ASER (Annual Status of Education Report) Report released on Wednesday.A total of 43.1% of the school-going children were admitted to government schools in Uttar Pradesh in 2018. This number rose to 49.7% in 2020 and 56.3% in 2021. While the percentage of school-going children admitted to government schools was less than the national average of 70.3%, the increase in enrollment was highest in the country in the period, stated the report.ASER-2021 was conducted in 25 states and 3 Union Territories. It reached 76,706 households and 75,234 children in the age group of 5-16 years, as well as teachers or head teachers from 7,299 government schools offering primary grades.Experts suggested different factors for the rise in enrolment but all said it was a positive sign for the state of education in UP. UP basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi said, “The enrolment in government schools over the last couple of years is reflective of the focus on education in the state. Steps taken by the state government like easy enrolment of children of migrant workers who returned home during the first wave of pandemic, transfer of money into accounts of parents via Direct Benefit Transfer to purchase bags, shoes, sweaters and uniforms for children along with easy accessibility led to the rise in enrolment.”As per education department data, around 175.8 lakh students sought admission to government primary schools across UP for the 2021-22 session, as compared to 166.3 lakh students in 2020-21 and 160.1 lakh students in 2019-20. To cater to the new students, the state government also increased the budgetary allocation for the basic education department in UP.The budgetary allocation for basic education department in 2018-19 was ₹55188 crore that went up to ₹59879.69 crore in 2019-20, ₹60358.49 crore in 2020-21 and currently stood at ₹63455.69 crore in the 2022-22 session. “Primary education has become the focus point for our government. We are trying to modernise amenities at our primary schools. During the last couple of years, the infrastructure of government schools has changed remarkably that has helped in increasing enrolment,” said Dwivedi.The minister said that a large chunk of the new students enrolled in government primary schools were children of migrant workers who returned home during the first phase of the pandemic. “Children of families financially affected during the pandemic have also shifted to government schools from private schools. We are trying to provide all facilities of private schools in government schools now,” he said.The basic education department had also started to change the existing culture at government schools. “Our government has introduced activities like parent teachers meet, annual day, sports day etc that attract students and also help in their all-around development,” informed the minister.During the period, the ASER report also found a rise in tuitions across the country. This reflected the lack of confidence in quality of education, according to experts. The number of students taking tuitions went up by 19.1% between 2018 and 2021, as per the report. This was the second highest in the country and more than the national average of 10.5%.“The closure of schools for physical classes during the pandemic is a reason for rise in tuitions. Parents enrolled their children in nearby tuition classes to utilise time. I believe that the trend of tuition will go down again once schools reopen completely,” said the minister. The report also found an increase in smartphone availability to children in UP but the rise was less than the national average. Though 58.9% of all enrolled children in Uttar Pradesh had a smartphone at home, about 34% of those children could not use it for studies, the ASER report found.IMPORTANT FINDINGS OF ASER REPORT • In Uttar Pradesh, less than 20% of children took private tuition classes in 2018. In 2021, this proportion increased to about 38.7%. At the national level, Uttar Pradesh and Nagaland are only second to Arunachal Pradesh, and have seen the second highest increase (19.1%).• Smartphone ownership in Uttar Pradesh almost doubled from 30.4% in 2018 to 58.9% in 2021.• Though 58.9% of all enrolled children in Uttar Pradesh have a smartphone at home, about 34% of those children cannot use it for studies.• 68.7% of enrolled children (government and private) in Uttar Pradesh received learning support at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-schools-saw-highest-increase-in-enrolment-during-pandemic-aser-report-101637166116159.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government must reduce VAT on petrol, diesel, Congress demands||Contrary to the stands taken by two other ruling parties, Congress has demanded that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government should reduce the value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel. It has also asked the Central government should bring the auto fuel under the goods and services tax (GST) regime.Patole pointed out that the Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Punjab had already reduced their taxes after the Central government’s decision to reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 a litre respectively. Patole said that on similar lines, the Maharashtra government too should bring down its taxes.Patole said that the Central government should also bring the auto fuel under the GST regime so that the petrol and diesel are sold at a reasonable price. “Instead of indulging in the allegations and counter-allegations, the Centre should include the petrol and diesel under GST. The step will automatically do away with the local taxes by the state governments,” he said.However, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has opposed bringing auto fuel under the GST regime. Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar had said that the move will put the state finances in the doldrums. Pawar also said that reducing VAT on fuel is difficult keeping the financial health of the state in mind. The ruling parties have blamed the Centre for the higher excise, cess on fuel and non-payment of the dues in GST compensation.Patole said on Wednesday that the Central government has earned the revenue of ₹30,000 crore from excise duty and cess between March 1 and October 31, 2021, from Maharashtra. The state government has right over it. The Centre still levies heavy excise and cess on petrol ( ₹27.90 a litre) and diesel ( ₹21.80 a litre) and has not transferred the state’s share. The Central government is trying to weaken the state financially,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-must-reduce-vat-on-petrol-diesel-congress-demands-101637165695600.html

17-11-2021||Pune||Active Covid cases in Pune division now lower than during first wave||PUNE All five districts of the Pune division have seen a drop in active Covid-19 cases. The current numbers are lower than the number of active cases during the first wave of Covid-19 in 2020. The five districts, including Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Solapur, had a deadly first wave and a deadlier second wave. All these districts now have less than a few hundred active cases, except Pune, which still reports 2,000 active cases, of which close to 900 are home isolations and 1,000 are admitted in hospitals.The five districts in the division are now seeing a drop in the number of active cases, new cases and also case fatalities as the spread of the infection is lowering. The active Covid-19 cases in these districts as of November 17 vis-a-vis the number of active cases before the first wave are: Pune at 2,882; which on May 21, 2020 was 2,491; Satara reports 193 active cases which is almost the same as June 23, 2020, when 195 patients were undergoing treatment; Sangli has reported 171 active cases, the same as it was in July, 2020 when 159 cases were reported; Kolhapur has reported 130 active cases and on July 2, 2020, 140 cases were reported; and Solapur has reported 228 active cases which was the same May 12, 2020, when 251 patients were undergoing treatment for Covid-19. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “All the districts and in fact even the state is witnessing a fall of the second wave which has now further fallen than what it was before the first wave. However, despite this we need to keep in mind that there are some western countries that are seeing a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. The overall Covid-19 situation looks promising right now, but if we want that to continue we must continue to wear masks, maintain social distance wherever possible and also maintain hand and respiratory hygiene even as more commercial activities are opening up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/active-covid-cases-in-pune-division-now-lower-than-during-first-wave-101637163535485.html
17-11-2021||Other||26 times this November, Punjab’s AQI slipped into ‘severe’ category||Bathinda The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Punjab has been of severe quality (401 upwards on the measuring scale) on 26 different occasions across eight air pollution audit spots over November to date. AQI above 401 means it was five times worse than the ‘satisfactory’ AQI value of 51-100. A severe AQI rating means the air affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. An analysis of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data says the average daily AQI was rated ‘poor’ (201-300) on up to 14 days in the state, since November 1. The daily AQI average did not touch the ‘severe’ level this month, but the daily average of ‘very poor’ scale of 301-400 was recorded on up to four days at four AQI assessment spots.The debate over air standards in Punjab, however, has failed to get due attention with the pollution levels in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) grabbing headlines.The CPCB audits air quality at eight places in six districts — three in Ludhiana (Khanna, Mandi Gobindgarh and Ludhiana City) and one each in Bathinda, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Patiala and Rupnagar.Data says, the maximum overall high-pollution days this month in Punjab was at Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) in Ludhiana. On 14 days, AQI was rated ‘poor’ in the city, and one day it was ‘very poor’. Jalandhar, the air quality indicator of Doaba region, faced average ‘poor’ air on 12 days this month and it was reported ‘very poor’ on one day.The daily average assessment in Amritsar, the sole pollution indicator of Majha, was ‘poor’ air on 11 days whereas it was moderate (101- 200) on four days. In Bathinda, average daily ‘poor’ air was recorded on eight days and ‘moderate’ for seven days this month. In the state, AQI on most days this month reached a much higher level than the average readings.‘No data on which activity adds how much to pollution’Vinod Kumar Garg, professor, School of Environmental Science and Technology at the Bathinda-based Central University of Punjab, “Burning of organic waste, vehicular emission, power generation plants, dust etc cause smog and the problem turns worse in winters due to climatic conditions. There is no scientific mechanism to confirm how much use of various resources contribute to pollution,” he said. CPCB data says on 78 occasions, air quality deteriorated and fell in ‘very poor’ category. Bathinda, the only centre of south Malwa to audit air quality, saw eight days in November where AQI scaled beyond 401. Of these, the AQI was at the highest scale of 500 on four occasions since November 11. Patiala and Rupnagar recorded a maximum scale of ‘severe’ levels on three days. Ludhiana recorded very poor air on 15 occasions in November when AQI was very poor. The only exception was the Shivalik foothill region near the Rupnagar sample collection site, where daily AQI was ‘poor’ only twice; but severe air pollution was recorded thrice over the past 16 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/26-times-this-november-punjab-s-aqi-slipped-into-severe-category-101637163295270.html
17-11-2021||Pune||SPPU, colleges primed to reopen offline classes after Diwali vacations||PUNE As the Diwali vacations are coming to an end the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and its affiliated colleges have geared up preparations for opening up of colleges after the Diwali vacations now. Most colleges and university departments are starting offline lectures from next week, for which safety arrangements have been going on. Also, the university and college hostels for students will start admissions. “Last month we received SPPU guidelines about colleges reopening. We have not yet started the college for students. It will most probably would start after the Diwali vacations and till then our all-other safety-related arrangements would be completed. We are going to start college lecturers in phase-wise manner and there should not be any crowding in the college campus, and we have informed students to complete their both doses of vaccination so that no one misses lectures,” said Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal - Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce (Shivajinagar). There are more than 1,200 colleges affiliated to SPPU in three districts and the admission process for the majority of the courses is complete. Till last month online classes were going on, after which the state government announced that the colleges were allowed to open from October 12. In the initial days only, a few students came to attend lectures, as the main criteria was two vaccination doses. On other hand SPPU is preparing to start admissions for hostels. The hostel cleaning and sanitising work is going on. “Soon the university classes at various departments would start and we have already started getting inquiries about hostel admissions. Both boys and girls’ hostels are ready to start, once we get clear guidelines from the state government to open up colleges it would be started,” said SPPU registrar Prafulla Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-colleges-primed-to-reopen-offline-classes-after-diwali-vacations-101637163055358.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Defamation case: Complaint lodged to further political aspirations, says Rahul Gandhi; moves HC||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has filed a petition in the Bombay high court (HC) seeking quashing of the order of the Girgaum magistrate court, which has asked him to appear in person in a defamation complaint filed by a local politician, who has loyalties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Gandhi has stated in his petition that the complainant is not directly affected by the alleged defamatory statement made by him (Gandhi) in 2018, and as he (complainant) is attempting to further his political aspirations by lodging the complaint, the order of magistrate should be set aside. The single-judge bench of justice Sandeep Shinde, on Wednesday, while hearing Gandhi’s petition against the initiation of criminal proceedings on August 28, 2019, on the orders of the Girgaum magistrate, based on the defamation complaint filed by Mahesh Shrishrimal, was informed by advocate Kushal Mor that the complaint was vexatious, baseless, unmeritorious and misconceived. The petition states that the complaint is nothing but a vehicle to drive the complainant’s own political agenda to tarnish the public image of the petitioner. According to the complaint, during a rally held in Rajasthan in September 2018, Gandhi had made a defamatory statement against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which had resulted in various news channels and social media platforms trolling the PM. The complaint also stated that Gandhi had purportedly posted a tweet and given a statement, wherein he referred to the PM as “commander in thief”, which was defamatory and made “direct allegation of theft against BJP members and Indian citizens connected to Modi.” The petition states that he (Gandhi) became aware of the magistrate order after receiving a summon on July 12, this year. Terming the magistrate’s order as mechanical in nature and without any minimum reasoning required for the issuing process against the petitioner, Gandhi states that the complainant lacked locus standi (standing) to file the complaint, as a defamation complaint can only be initiated by the person defamed. In light of the above, the petition states that the present case comes under the exceptions to section 499 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), hence the magistrate order should be quashed and till the current petition was heard, all further proceedings arising out of the order before the magistrate court be stayed. The court will hear the petition on November 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defamation-case-complaint-lodged-to-further-political-aspirations-says-rahul-gandhi-moves-hc-101637162335217.html

The order comes amid the ongoing controversy regarding their marriage after the actor-politician claimed that she was “wrongly portrayed” and that the marriage was invalid in India.“It is declared that the alleged marriage held on 19/06/2019 at Bodrum, Turkey in between the plaintiff and the defendant is not legally valid. The suit is, thus, disposed of on admission,” the Kolkata court ruled.The order was based on religious grounds as Nusrat Jahan is a Muslim by faith, while Nikhil Jain is a Hindu.The Trinamool Congress MP had earlier claimed that their marriage was not registered under the Special Marriage Act and hence it was not valid in India. She had also accused Nikhil Jain of misappropriating her funds, even after their separation. Jain denied the allegations calling them ‘baseless, derogatory and devoid of truth’. He had subsequently filed for annulment.Nusrat and Nikhil tied the knot in Turkey in June 2019. While the wedding in Turkey was an intimate ceremony, the couple later hosted a grand wedding reception in Kolkata where they also invited chief minister Mamata Banerjee and other celebrities from the Tollywood film industry.Currently, Nusrat is in a relationship with actor-politician Yash Dasgupta.

17-11-2021||Mumbai||Ex-Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh is a proclaimed offender, orders court||The city’s Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court on Wednesday declared former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh (56), the second most senior Indian Police Service (IPS) serving officer in Maharashtra, a proclaimed offender in connection with an extortion case. This is the first instance of a Mumbai police commissioner being declared a proclaimed offender. Singh was the city’s 43rd police commissioner. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Sudhir Bhajipale simultaneously issued a proclamation against his alleged accomplices Vinay Ramnarayan Singh (46) and Riyaz Bhati (56). All three have been ordered to appear before the court in 30 days. The order came following an application filed by Mumbai Police’s crime branch which is investigating an August 20 extortion case registered in Goregaon in northwest Mumbai. The FIR named Singh, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and civilians — Sumeet Singh, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Ramnarayan Singh aka Bablu and Riyaz Bhati — for extortion. The complainant, restaurateur Bimal Agarwal, alleged that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against two of his outlets – Boho Restaurant and BCB Bar. Once it took over the investigation, the crime branch arrested Vaze, Sumeet Singh and Alpesh Patel. Special prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap, who represented the crime branch, submitted that on October 30 a non-bailable warrant (NBW) was issued against remaining three accused – Param Bir Singh, Vinay Singh and Riyaz Bhati. Jagtap said that “pursuant to the warrant, crime branch officials visited Singh’s last known address in the city at Neelam Building in Malabar Hill,” but that a cook informed them that Singh and his family had not stayed there for three months. He said a crime branch team later visited Singh’s hometown of Chandigarh, where Singh’s brother reportedly informed the police that the former top cop had not visited Chandigarh recently. Similarly, he said, the crime branch officials visited Bhati’s house in Kandivli in north Mumbai and Vinay Singh’s residence at Andheri in western Mumbai, but could not either of them. A short affidavit filed by investigating officer Vishal Patil in support of the plea seeking the proclamation under section 82 of the Criminal Procedure Code, stated that Singh has been absconding since March 2021. It added that, in the last four months, five cases have been registered against the senior IPS officer and that he failed to appear in all the five cases. Besides, it added, he also did not appear before Justice KU Chandiwal Commission, which is enquiring into Singh’s allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The affidavit added that “despite best efforts by the crime branch”, none of the three accused were found and therefore, the “non-bailable warrants issued against them have remained unexecuted.” The crime branch claimed that the accused were “intentionally evading the law,” and that the crime branch had even urged the court to initiate process for attachment of their properties. This process, however, can be initiated under section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Code only if the trio fail to appear before the court in stipulated period of 30 days, pursuant to the proclamation issued on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-declares-param-bir-singh-a-proclaimed-offender-101637161194501.html
17-11-2021||Pune||Sassoon first government hospital in Maharashtra with separate ward for third gender||PUNE Pune’s Sassoon General hospital will soon by the first government hospital in the state to have a separate ward for what is being identified as the “third gender”. Medically the “third gender” covers all persons not identifying as female or male, due to physical attributes or even out of personal choice.The decision was made based on a suggestion made by the newly appointed chairperson of the state women commission, Rupali Chakankar. Sassoon hospital has ensured that the ward will be fully quipped with state- of-the-art facilities and work on the same will begin soon.Chakankar, during her visit to the new 11-storey building on Wednesday, dedicated for Covid-19 treatment and housing an oxygen plant, interacted with medical and nursing students, resident doctors, resident nurses and women patients. Chakankar also suggested that CCTV cameras be placed on the road between the police station and hospital, a matter she said she will take up with the local police. Dr Vinayak Kale, dean of the hospital said, “This will be the first third gender-dedicated ward in any hospital, be it private or government. She had requested for a 25 bedded ward, but we will start first with about 10-15 beds and then, as required, we will increase. As of now, any person who is a third gender is admitted as per their preference in either the men’s ward or the women’s ward. Next week we will have a meeting with the core committee with regards to the place where the ward would be. We are hopping it will be set up the coming few weeks. We will also have special psychiatric doctors for the wards as patients require counselling during treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sassoon-first-government-hospital-in-maharashtra-with-separate-ward-for-third-gender-101637159214811.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Petition by Maharashtra government an attempt to scuttle probe against Anil Deshmukh, CBI tells HC||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), while opposing the petition by the Maharashtra government seeking constitution of a special investigation team (SIT) headed by a retired judge, to probe the corruption allegations levelled by the former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, against former home minister Anil Deshmukh, has informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the petition was an attempt by the state to scuttle the central agency’s investigation. CBI submitted that the objection raised by the state government to the agency’s probe, on the ground of Subodh Jaiswal, director of CBI, being part of the police decision-making machinery when the alleged corrupt acts took place, was taken belatedly, as the objection was not raised in the rejected petitions filed in the HC and Supreme Court. Earlier, the state concluded its arguments by submitting that as chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey were state officers, it had filed the petition under parens patriae jurisdiction. Parens patriae is a doctrine that gives authority to the state to protect persons who are legally unable to act on their own behalf.The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the petition filed by the state was informed by senior counsel Darius Khambatta that the April 5 order of the HC had directed the central agency to conduct a preliminary probe into the allegations by Singh as the Mumbai Police could not conduct an impartial probe as Deshmukh was heading it. “Present director of CBI was the then DGP and is party signatory to all police establishment board (PEB) meetings. If CBI case is that it’s all meetings are irrelevant and decisions were taken by the home minister, he (Jaiswal) is important witness, as he signed on every minute, based on which, the decisions were taken,” said Khambatta. Hence, in light of the HC order for impartial probe urged constitution of SIT. While commencing arguments on behalf of CBI, additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi submitted that the current petition by the state and all previous petitions filed by it were intended to derail the investigation by the CBI. Lekhi submitted that if the state was intending to initiate proceedings and probe the allegations by Singh, it would have done so immediately. However, it neither took cognisance of Singh’s complaint to the chief minister nor did they do anything based on the complaint by Dr Jayshri Patil, which showed that the state had no intention to take action against the wrongdoers. Lekhi said that the April 5 order of HC had directed CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry. He further submitted that the apprehension cast by the state on the CBI probe as Jaiswal was the director of CBI was raised belatedly, which also goes to show that the state was trying to scuttle the investigation and shield the wrongdoers. “They did not take this plea because it is a make-believe plea. The state has a one-point agenda to derail probe and is now targeting the director,” said Lekhi, adding that none of the reports directly or indirectly implicated the former director-general. He added that the conduct of the state was incriminating and showed its reluctance to proceed in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petition-by-maharashtra-government-an-attempt-to-scuttle-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-cbi-tells-hc-101637158434677.html
17-11-2021||Pune||Amit Shah in Pune: Two statues to score two hits with one visit||PUNE Ahead of the civic elections next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has begun, what some political observers are referring to as a “social engineering” play to woo communities whose votes may be up for grabs.The municipal elections are likely to be held in February 2022, with the BJP trying to retain its control in Pune and Pimpri-Chicnhwad. BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah will visit Pune on November 26, and the party has planned two programmes which include the installation of a statue of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar at the PMC’s headquarters, and then, the laying of a foundation stone for a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, also at the PMC HQ.Two statues to woo the Dalit and Maratha communities, respectively. “It is a very happy moment for us as BJP leader and home minister Shah has agreed to visit PMC. As November 26 is also CConstitution Day, we have decided to unveil Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s statue near the new building . At the same time, in the old building premises, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s statue is will be installed,” said mayor Murlaidhar Mohol. Shah will be present at both ceremonies.The BJP currently rules PMC with 99 corporators, while the NCP has 42, the Congress 10, Shiv Sena 10 and MNS 02, in the house of 164 members. If the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance that rules the state contests thecivic election as an alliance, the BJP will have a tough fight on in its hands. BJP leader and leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar said, “It is a happy moment that Shah will be present for installation of Dr Ambedkar and Shivaji Maharaj’s statues. Whereever Shah visits, it results in a victory for the party. His visit to Pune is the first step towards BJP’s big victory in the PMC elections. His tour has generated enthusiasm within the party.” A senior BJP leader on the condition of anonymity said, “The party has already started the campaign for the polls by raking up the OBC reservation issue after the MVA government failed to retain it in the High Court. The recent HC ruling has taken away reservations for OBCs in the local body elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/amit-shah-in-pune-two-statues-to-score-two-hits-with-one-visit-101637157774715.html
17-11-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav promises to develop markets for farmers along Purvanchal Expressway||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said mandis (markets) for farmers and means of employment generation for the youths will be developed along the Purvanchal Expressway after his party comes to power in Uttar Pradesh. Akhilesh Yadav also said he sensed a “wave of change” in the state that will “wipe out” the BJP in the 2022 assembly polls.Akhilesh Yadav, who has often said it was his government that envisaged the project, described the Purvanchal Expressway as incomplete.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the 341-km Purvanchal Expressway on Tuesday.“This expressway, (which has been inaugurated), is incomplete. Samajwadis saw the dream of building this (Purvanchal) expressway in order that the travel time between Ghazipur in UP and Delhi reduces. But this expressway is not reducing the distance (travel time between Ghazipur in eastern UP and Delhi).It was to be an expressway of prosperity,” he said. He also said, “ Through this expressway, work to strengthen the economy of rural areas will be done. Mandis (markets) were supposed to come up near this but they did not. After the SP comes to power, work will be done to set up mandis for farmers and create means of employment generation for the youths along it.”Tell me if the country has a better road than this anywhere, Akhilesh Yadav asked.He also said the expressway will be extended to Ballia.“We have to take this expressway to Ballia and connect it with Bihar,” he said.The Purvanchal Expressway starts from village Chand Sarai in Lucknow district and ends at village Hydaria on National Highway number 31, 18 kilometres east of the Uttar Pradesh-Bihar border, in Ghazipur.The key feature of the expressway is the 3.2-kilometre-long airstrip to enable landing and take-off of Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter planes in case of emergency.The six-lane Purvanchal Expressway can be expanded to eight lanes in the future.In his attack on the BJP, he said, “There will be a change in UP in 2022, for sure. I am watching a wave of change. I am confident that from this Ghaizpur (UP) to that Ghazipur (near Delhi border), BJP will be wiped out.”“Ghazipur is the land of bravehearts and sacrifice. I salute all of you,” he said, addressing people from atop the rath (bus).He asked the people to “remove the bulls and the bulldozers” which are running in the state. This remark appeared to be an indirect jibe at the problem of stray cattle and the Yogi Adityanath government’s drive against criminals and demolition of their unauthorised properties.Appealing to the people, Akhilesh said, “In 2022, change the government which is changing names.”It was a reference to the Yogi government having changed the names of Faizabad to Ayodhya and Allahabad to Prayagraj, besides renaming the Faizabad railway station as Ayodhya Cantt. At a function in SP chief’s Lok Sabha constituency Azamgarh on November 13, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said laying the foundation stone of a state university will turn Azamgarh into Aryamgarh in the true sense. “There should be no doubt that this university will truly turn Azamgarh into Aryamgarh,” the chief minister had said. Union home minister Amit Shah had laid the foundation stone of the university. Akhilesh Yadav also targeted the BJP on petrol and diesel prices, besides “rising unemployment”. “These are the very people who had said that poor with slippers will travel by air. But the way the prices of diesel and petrol have gone up, riding a motorcycle has become difficult,” he said.“Unemployed youths waited for jobs for five years. Where are the jobs? Will the youth not bring a change? All sections of the society, be it farmers, labourers and youths, are ready to bring a change in the state,” he said.He also said the SP will hold a historic rally in Ghazipuri in future.The Samajwadi Party’s ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar said SBSP has shut the door through which BJP came to power in 2017. The SBSP-led Bhagidari Sanklap Morcha, in alliance with the SP, will make Akhilesh Yadav the chief minister of UP in 2022, he said.Earlier, Akhilesh Yadav, along with Rajbhar, met noted vocalist Pandit Chhannu Lal Mishra at Lal Bahadur Shastri international airport, Varanasi, said SBSP state unit vice president Shashipratap Singh. Padma Vibhushan was conferred on Mishra recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-yadav-promises-to-develop-markets-for-farmers-along-purvanchal-expressway-101637157534810.html

17-11-2021||Pune||Amit Shah in Pune on November 26: Visit to PMC to galvanise BJP cadre||PUNE Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s visit to Pune on November 26 has become crucial, not just for the co-operative sector, but for the municipal elections in Pune and rest of state as well. Shah, who is also Union minister for cooperatives, will visit the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and address party workers and booth heads in the city Earlier, it was decided that his visit would be primarily as co-operative minister, but the BJP’s state and city units decided to use his presence to campaign for municipal elections. The BJP’s state leadership - opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis and state unit president Chandrakant Patil - will also be present at these programmes,. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “We requested the home minister to visit the PMC and he has given his consent for it. It is important Shah is visiting the PMC before the municipal elections.” According to BJP leaders, Shah will lay the foundation stone for a proposed statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji on the premises of the PMC headquarters, after attending a cooperative sector-related function at the Vaikunthbhai Mehtra Institute.He will also be present at a function where a statue of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar wil be unveiled. Later, Shah will attend a party function at the Ganesh Kala Krida auditorium, where he will address workers and booth pramukhs (chiefs), said BJP leader Ganesh Bidkar. “Shah’s visit to Pune and PMC ahead of the civic elections is definitely important for party workers as it will boost our morale. The party is extremely enthusiastic about it,” said Bidkar. The PMC elections are likely to happen in February-March next year with BJP trying its best to retain control over the civic body. Through Shah’s visit, BJP plans to kickstart its campaign for election and galvanise its machinery. According to BJP city unit president Jagdish Mulik the party has organised the party meeting at the Ganesh Kala Krida Manch in Swargate. “We got confirmation for this. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis and other state leaders will be present. We have started meetings to prepare for this,” he said. The state co-operative department officials have also confirmed Shah’s tour.Maharashtra has a large number of co-operative institutes with politics centred around the co-operative sector, with several NCP and Congress leaders controlling institutions in western parts of the state. Though co-operatives has till recently been a state subject, it was for the first time that the central government started this ministry. Political observers see that by creating a separate cooperative ministry, headed by a senior minister like Amit Shah, the BJP is trying to establish its grip over the sector, while keeping a vigilance on activities of cooperative institutes run by the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders. Recently, NCP president Sharad Pawar invited Shah to visit the Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI) in Manjari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/amit-shah-in-pune-on-november-26-visit-to-pmc-to-galvanise-bjp-cadre-101637156574818.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Woman from upscale locality in Thane arrested for stealing from shops||A tenacious dump data analysis of more than 600 women who visited a popular electronic showroom on Ghodbunder Road during the Diwali week led the Kapurbawdi police in Thane to a woman from a well-to-do-family who stole electronic items from stores across this locality.The woman, with her sophisticated looks, did not attract suspicion, thus duping several stores by stealing laptops, mobile phones, cameras, Bluetooth devices, DVD players, headphones, vacuum cleaners, hard disks and watches and 11 CCTV cameras.The woman has two children. Her husband holds a managerial post in a private company while her in-laws are retired government officials.The accused (police withheld the name to protect the family identity), is in her 40s. She used to take advantage of the crowd in shops during the festive season which kept most of the salesmen occupied. She would roam around in the shops in a mask and flick gadgets when there was no salesman around. On November 3, the owner of Vijay Sales shop on Ghodbunder Road realised that one of the laptops worth ₹99,999 was missing from the stock. They registered a complaint on November 15, when they still failed to trace it. S Nimbalkar, police inspector of Kapurbawdi police station, said, “We checked the CCTV footage of the shop and found the accused talking on the phone while her movements were suspicious. We did a data dump analysis and found about 600 women talking on their phone in the premises. We checked each of these women on their social media profiles and shortlisted those who looked similar to the accused.”The police finally found the woman in the camera and located her resident in an upscale locality and arrested her. “We searched her house and found all the other gadgets worth ₹2.65 lakh.”DCP Vinay Rathod said, “We are investigating further whether the woman is attached to some more people in this crime and getting information from her about other devices that she has stolen from different shops in the malls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/woman-from-upscale-locality-in-thane-arrested-for-stealing-from-shops-101637155494927.html
17-11-2021||Lucknow||Retd Allahabad HC judge visits Lakhimpur violence site for probe||Retired Allahabad high court judge, Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava, who is heading a single-member inquiry commission probing into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, visited the violence site near Banbirpur village under Tikunia police station limits on Wednesday, said police officials.He examined the crime scene and received inputs from police officials over the entire sequence of events that has been established on the basis of statements of witnesses and crime scene recreation by forensic experts, they said. However, forensic experts accompanying Justice Srivastava carried out further investigations on his direction, they added.A police official said Justice Srivastava spent several hours at the site to understand the events that took place when a car of union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son, Ashish Mishra, allegedly mowed down four farmers and four others were killed during the violence that erupted over the death of farmers. He said media personnel and outsiders were not allowed anywhere near and the crime scene was barricaded.The judge had reached Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday evening.The single-member judicial commission of inquiry under Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava had been constituted by the UP government as part of the agreement between the agitating farmers and the authorities to ensure a thorough probe into the Tikunia violence, which left eight people, including four farmers, a local journalist, two BJP workers and a driver, dead.In a notification dated October 6, the state government said the judicial commission would be headquartered in Lakhimpur Kheri. It was stated that the commission shall complete the inquiry within a period of two months from the date of the issue of this notification.In the incident, four farmers were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers. The remaining deceased -- two BJP workers, a journalist and a driver -- were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by angry protesters.Two FIRs were lodged at the Tikunia police station in this connection.

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Beyond borders: Two lines, three nations, one culture||Radcliffe Line, which divides India and Pakistan, was, after all, drawn on a map lying on a table. So was Durand Line that defines the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The two lines, however, failed to divide the culture and heritage of the land. All they have given rise to is acrimony and trepidation, besides the millions of dollars spent to maintain the status quo by the three countries. People across the two lines share the same jokes, the same frustrations, the same worries and the same resilience, that is, if we decide to overlook the political rhetoric in the three countries. I had the good fortune of visiting Pakistan some years ago as a part of a delegation of mental health professionals. This was my first and only experience of actually stepping across the Radcliffe Line. From the moment we crossed over to Pakistan to the time we came back, not for a moment did we realise that we were not in our own country! We were welcomed with unprecedented warmth and unparalleled hospitality. What surprised all of us was that we have so much in common beneath the often bitter cacophony of Indo-Pak rivalry. The roads of Lahore reverberate with the lament of overflowing traffic and the lack of adherence to traffic rules, just the way we do, even when we ourselves might be doing the same thing. People of this big and vibrant city still love to bargain in the market, which often ends in a deal that makes both the shopkeeper and the customer happy, not forgetting to share a boisterous laugh and a memorable hug! People across the border still believe in extending their hospitality just because you come from the same city from which their grandparents migrated at the time of the most unfortunate Partition. We bid goodbye to our Pakistani friends at Wagah border with tears in our eyes and a lot of heart-warming memories to cherish. Each one of us was left wondering, at the end of our visit, as to the relevance of the Radcliffe Line that we stepped over to head back home. I happened to see a teacher from Afghanistan a few months ago at my clinic and my encounter with him made me think of the seeming irreverence of the Durand Line when it comes to our shared cultural heritage. This teacher belonged to the southern Afghan city of Herat. It was a pleasant surprise to see a citizen of a trouble-torn nation with so much of warmth and respect for an Indian doctor. He could speak only broken English and it was a challenge to treat him. However, his condition improved in a couple of weeks and he went back to his homeland. I was pleasantly surprised to see him in my clinic after a month with a basket of dry fruits and dates for me as a token of regards. He also presented me with an image of the Gurdwara Sahib at Kabul with utmost reverence. These two encounters set me thinking. Why can’t people living in these three countries meet more often? Don’t we have the same language of love? Do we deserve the acrimony that exists between our countries? Inshallah, the three nations will learn, sooner than later, to think beyond the borders drawn on the map. gulbaharsidhu@rediffmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based consultant psychiatrist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/beyond-borders-two-lines-three-nations-one-culture-101637153094223.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Insurance policy lapsed, pay and recover cannot be applied: Bombay high court||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday held that the “pay and recover” principle — which requires the insurance companies to first pay accident claims to families of the victims and then recover the amount from the owner of the offending vehicle — cannot be applied in cases where the insurance policy has lapsed and there is no subsisting insurance contract on the date of the incident.The court was hearing an appeal filed by the Oriental Insurance Company, challenging the March 28, 2014 order of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Nashik, holding the insurer jointly liable to pay compensation of ₹6.68 lakh to family members of Milind Gaikwad, who had died in a road accident.Justice NJ Jamadar said the principle can be legitimately resorted to where there exists a contract of insurance and the insurer is exonerated from the liability on account, some breach of conditions of insurance or causes of like nature, but not where there exists no such contract.The incident had taken place on February 4, 2009, when the deceased was riding a motorcycle on his way to Satpur industrial estate and another motorcyclist Uday Pathak, crashed into him. Twenty-seven-year-old Milind was severely injured and eventually succumbed to the injuries.Gaikwad’s family members instituted an accident claim under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 before the Tribunal, which held that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending motor-cycle and the vehicle owner and his insurer - Oriental Insurance Company were jointly liable to pay compensation.The insurer had questioned the tribunal order primarily contending that there was no subsisting insurance contract between the insurance company and owner of the offending vehicle on the date of the incident and the tribunal erred in holding the insurance company jointly liable to pay the compensation.HC accepted the contention, noticing that the insurance certificate specifically mentioned that the policy was valid from October 17, 2006, to October 16, 2007, and as such expired long before the accident of February 4, 2009. However, after the HC held that the insurance company cannot be held jointly liable for paying the compensation, the claimants urged the court to apply the principle of “pay and recover,” directing the insurance company to pay the compensation first and then recover it from the vehicle owner.It was argued on behalf of the claimants that they would be left in the lurch and the beneficial object of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 would be defeated if no such order based on the “pay and recover” principle was issued. The counsel for the insurer opposed the plea by submitting that the principle of “Pay and Recover” cannot be resorted to where there is no subsisting insurance contract.HC accepted the contentions of the insurance company. “Undoubtedly, the beneficial nature of the legislation must be kept in view. Yet, the principle of purposive construction cannot be stretched to such an extent as to fasten the liability on a party, who is not at all liable to satisfy the award, for the only reason that in the past there was a contract of insurance between the insurer and insured,” said justice Jamadar.“The jural relationship between erstwhile insurer and insured gets snapped with the term of insurance coming to an end,” the bench added and exonerated the insurance company from the liability to pay compensation to an accident victim, Milind Gaikwad, a Nashik resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/insurance-policy-lapsed-pay-and-recover-cannot-be-applied-bombay-high-court-101637152794071.html
17-11-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh lifts all Covid-19 related curbs with immediate effect||The Madhya Pradesh government on Wednesday removed all Covid-19 related restrictions from the state with immediate effect, with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan saying that this was being done as the pandemic situation in the state was under complete control. “All social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural and religious programmes can be organised normally. There is no ceiling on the number of people allowed at wedding ceremonies or last rites. The night curfew is also being done away with,” a rough translation of Chouhan's tweet, which was posted in Hindi, read. प्रदेश में अलग-अलग क्षेत्रों में मेलों का आयोजन हो सकेगा। चल समारोह निकल सकेंगे। शादी समारोह जितनी संख्या में लोगों की उपस्थिती में आयोजित करना चाहें कर सकते हैं। नाइट कर्फ़्यू भी आज रात से समाप्त होगा। अंतिम संस्कार में भी जितने लोग शामिल होकर अंतिम दर्शन करना चाहें कर सकेंगे।The chief minister added that establishments such as cinema halls, shopping malls, swimming pools, club, gyms, yoga centres, restaurants etc. can function at full capacity. Educational institutions such as schools, colleges, universities, coaching classes, too, can open with 100 per cent student strength, he further said.However, Chouhan also appealed to people to not let their guard down. “Please keep complying with all the necessary protocols such as wearing face masks, sanitising hands, getting tested even for minor symptoms etc. By 31 December, we have to ensure that the entire Madhya Pradesh is fully vaccinated. So, please take your second dose as well,” the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader posted. हमें #COVID19 को लेकर सतर्क भी रहना है। बचाव संबंधी दिशा-निर्देशों का पालन जारी रखें, जैसे मास्क लगाना, हाथ स्वच्छ रखना, मामूली लक्षण पर तत्काल जांच आदि। दूसरा टीका सभी अवश्य लगवा लें। 31 दिसंबर तक हम सभी को मिलकर मध्यप्रदेश के सम्पूर्ण टीकाकरण का लक्ष्य प्राप्त करना है।Therefore, shopkeepers can open stores only if they are fully inoculated, while, in hostels, all students above the age of 18, too, should have taken both doses, Chouhan said. Full vaccination is mandatory for employees in cinema halls as well, while audience members should have taken at least one dose.Giving out the latest Covid-19 numbers, the chief minister said that 5 more people tested positive for the viral illness, while active cases were down to 78. On the vaccination figures, he said that 91 per cent people were partially vaccinated while 47 per cent had taken both the doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-removes-all-covid-19-related-restrictions-with-immediate-effect-101637149344283.html

Mumbai lawyer is prime suspect||MUMBAI: The Anti-Narcotics Cell (ANC) of the Mumbai police has busted a mephedrone manufacturing unit allegedly running out of a Kolhapur farmhouse of a Mumbai-based lawyer, a senior police officer said on Tuesday. Two persons including a 35-year-old woman have been arrested in this connection.ANC claims to have seized mephedrone and raw material needed to manufacture drugs with a street value of Rs. 2.35 crore from the farmhouse.The two persons arrested by the team were identified by the police as Nikhil Lohar, 29, the caretaker of the farmhouse, and Cristina Maglin, alias Ayesha alias Simran, 35, a drug peddler from Sakinaka.ANC deputy commissioner of police Datta Nalawade said a police team first arrested Cristina Maglin from Bandra on Saturday on charges of possessing 50gm of mephedrone. She named a Mumbai lawyer who she claimed, sold her mephedrone - it is a synthetic stimulant drug that is known by many street names including meow-meow - for supply to her clients in the Bandra area.Nalawade said an ANC team tried to verify the information revealed by Cristina Maglin and traced the farmhouse mentioned by her to Dholgarwadi village in Chandgad taluka of Kolhapur district, 375km from Mumbai.“We have seized 38.7 kilograms of raw material, chemicals, 120 gram MD total worth Rs. 2.35 crore.

17-11-2021||Lucknow||BJP rolls out tractor rallies on UP’s poll pitch||LUCKNOW The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has begun rolling out tractor rallies in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh (UP). And over the next 15 days, over 30,000 roaring vehicles, with farmers and BJP leaders on board, would criss-cross the state with party flags, symbol and messages. Each tractor show would comprise 200 to 500 vehicles. The inaugural rally with 410 tractors was taken out from Mau in eastern UP (Purvanchal) on Tuesday. The BJP’s tractor rallies would continue till November 30 and conclude in Bijnor in western UP. The BJP initiative, timed amid the ongoing farmers’ stir, is aimed at connecting with farmers and the start of each tractor rally would see marketing of government schemes while the conclusion over ‘jal paan’ (snacking) in rural settings would also revolve around efforts to blunt the impression of the government being “anti-farmer”. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is spearheading the farmers’ agitation, too had taken out tractor rallies. WHY TRACTORS? “Tractors are a sign of rural prosperity. They symbolise satisfied farmers and also indicate their growth. So, these tractor rallies are meant to convey that the farmers have prospered under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” said Kameshwar Singh, UP farmers’ wing chief. RALLIES AREN’T JUST ABOUT FARMERS ALONE The launch destination - Mau Sadar assembly segment – for instance was chosen after much consideration. The BJP has never won this seat since 1956 while the current MLA Mukhtar Ansari has been winning it continuously since 1996, twice as an independent candidate. “Mau was previously known for various other reasons. But now, with mafias either behind bars or on the run, Mau is now scripting a development story,” said Singh. Mukhtar Ansari, for whom the UP government fielded a battery of lawyers to ensure that he was brought back to the state from Congress-ruled Punjab, is currently behind bars and BJP leaders have repeatedly flagged Yogi Adityanath government’s crackdown against criminals and mafias prominently in the run-up to the 2022 UP polls. Recently, union home minister Amit Shah credited the Adityanath government of helping free Purvanchal from “mafia aur macchar” (mafia and mosquitoes). Prime Minister Narendra Modi too has been mentioning the BJP government’s crackdown on criminals in UP prominently in his speeches during his visits to the state, which are increasing as elections draw closer. Since August, the BJP has constantly been holding farmer-connect campaigns. In August, the party held ‘kisan samvaad’ (dialogue with farmers) at 298 places in 95 such assembly segments with sizeable presence of sugarcane farmers. This was followed up with a meeting of farmers at the chief minister’s residence on August 25. In September, kisan sammelan (farmer meetings) were held across the state while in October gram kisan chaupals (rural farmer meets) were held in 40,000 villages. “In November, we are taking out tractor rallies and in December we will hold assembly-wise meetings. In January, we will launch a programme ‘chalo gaon ki ore’ (head towards villages) where we would connect with the countryside,” said the farmers’ wing chief. In a major pro-farmer outreach initiative in August, Adityanath had announced that cases against farmers for burning crop residue would be withdrawn and a decision was taken to reimburse monetary penalties levied on farmers. Orders were also issued to not disconnect power supply of farmers due to pending bills. “Of the 403 assembly segments in UP, nearly 399 are believed to be fully or partially rural in character. In the past too, the BJP had or for that matter other parties, had focused on rural UP. Now, the tractor rallies by the BJP are obviously aimed at connecting better with the countryside and that makes good political sense,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran political observer. “This celebratory rally is yet another brutal and brazen display of indifference showcased by the BJP government. This government is expert in marketing and so it is trying to cover up farmer distress through such antics. But, the people are watching. Rural UP will teach the BJP a lesson,” said Congress leader Zishan Haider.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-rolls-out-tractor-rallies-on-up-s-poll-pitch-101637151355209.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena blames ‘fake Hindutvawadis’ for Amravati violence||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena has blamed “fake Hindutvawadis” for the violence in Amravati, saying the communal tensions were stoked for political mileage ahead of next year’s Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.Mob violence erupted in Amravati on Saturday after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called for a bandh to protest against a violent bandh organised on Friday against communal violence in Tripura. Former minister and BJP leader Anil Bonde were among those arrested for the violence that broke out on Saturday and later released on bail.Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the country faces real danger from “fake Hindutvawadis”, who create Hindu-Muslim tensions and use Pakistan to win elections. “If you heard [chief minister] Uddhav [Thackery]’s speech on Dussehra, he said that the real danger that the country faces is from the fake Hindutvawadi. These people bring up Hindu-Muslim issues when elections are around the corner. They come up with India-Pakistan issues during elections. They intend communal tension so that they can win elections. Everyone knows who these people are,” Raut said.Also Read: Sena leader’s son dies by suicide in PuneIn an editorial published in its mouthpiece Saamana on the ninth death anniversary of the Sena founder Bal Thackeray on Wednesday, the party said the bandh called by Raza Academy in Amravati to protest against the violence in Tripura was unwarranted. It downplayed its role saying it did not have the organisational capability to indulge in stone pelting.“Violence was carried out. Raza Academy is an organisation that is limited to distributing pamphlets. They do not have the strength to indulge in violence and stone pelting. Even then, it was not correct to give a bandh call in Maharashtra owing to the incident in Tripura. Fake Hindutvawadis burnt Amravati taking advantage of the bandh,” the editorial said.The Saamana said Bal Thackeray brought Hindus together and added that had he been alive, the “fringe outfit” would not have dared to call a bandh and the masks of “fake Hindutvawadis” would have come off. “There is an attempt to instigate Hindu-Muslim riots to win the Uttar Pradesh election. Keep your politics to your state. Why did you burn Maharashtra for this? The Shiv Sena founder would have asked this question,” the editorial added.The Sena mouthpiece said Bal Thackeray gave a structure to the scattered values of Hindutva. “Some cowards entered this structure and are now giving lectures to us on Hindutva.” As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of the BJP does not respond to criticism or remarks in Saamana editorials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-blames-fake-hindutvawadis-for-amravati-violence-101637150259062.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court discharges DHFL from CBI’s case against Kapil Wadhawan||The Bombay high court on Wednesday discharged Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case against its erstwhile chairman and managing director (CMD) Kapil Wadhawan, director Rakesh Wadhawan and Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor.DHFL moved the high court after a special CBI court in August rejected its plea for discharging the non-banking finance company from the case. It argued the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in June approved a resolution plan for DHFL’s reverse merger with Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Limited.Senior advocate Ravi Kadam, who appeared for DHFL, submitted the special court did not take provisions contained in Section 32A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, into account while rejecting the discharge plea. He submitted DHFL would not be liable for any offence committed prior to commencement of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process. Kadam added the prosecution would not continue once the resolution plan was approved by the Adjudicating Authority - the NCLT.Also Read: CBI autonomous body, Centre not accountable for it, SC toldAdvocate Pranav Badheka, who represented Kapil Wadhawan, opposed the plea by pointing out that the former CMD of DHFL and 63 Moons Technologies Ltd have filed appeals challenging the approval for DHFL’s reverse merger. The outcome of the appeal would be a crucial consideration in deciding the discharge plea, he added.CBI’s lawyer, Hiten Venegaonkar, also opposed the plea. He submitted it would be inappropriate to discharge DHFL of the criminal liability until statutory appeals were decided. Venegaonkar added that cognisance of an offence cannot be taken twice and therefore it would be very difficult for the CBI to reverse the situation if, in appeals, the approval to the resolution plan was reversed.A single-judge bench of Justice Sandip Shinde took into consideration the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s refusal to stay the execution of the reverse merger. Subsequently, DHFL management has changed.Shinde noted that Kapil Wadhawan and Rakesh Wadhawan were ousted from the Board of Directors two years ago and had since no control over the management of the NBFC.The Wadhawans were booked in March 2020 along with Kapur and his family members. Between April and June 2018, Yes Bank allegedly invested ₹3,700 crore in short term non-convertible debenture of DHFL and Kapur received ₹600 crore as kickbacks from DHFL in terms of loan advanced to two firms his family members controlled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-discharges-dhfl-from-cbi-s-case-against-kapil-wadhawan-101637149058987.html

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Modi calls for one nation, one legislative platform||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday called for setting up one platform to connect all democratic institutions. Also read: First Sikh jatha crosses over to Pakistan after reopening of Kartarpur Corridor“I’ve been thinking of one nation, one legislative platform, a digital portal that not only provides a technical boost to our parliamentary system but also attaches all democratic institutions. All resources of our Houses should be on this platform,” Modi said while virtually addressing the inaugural session of the 82nd All India Presiding Officers’ Conference (AIPOC) that began in Shimla. The two-day conference coincides with the centennial year of the AIPOC. Congratulating the presiding officers, the Prime Minister said: “AIPOC is completing 100 years and this reflects the democratic expansion of India. The conference holds more importance because India is also celebrating 75 years of Independence. The coincidence increases our responsibilities manifold.” Stay united while celebrating diversity Citing the example of the Covid pandemic, Modi said the country fought this battle taking along all states and today India has crossed the 110-crore vaccine doses mark. “Our future dreams and resolutions will also be fulfilled with the united efforts of the Centre and the state. Our policies and laws should strengthen the spirit of India and our Ek Bharat-Shresht Bharat resolution and most importantly our conduct in the House should be according to Indian values. In today’s changing times, it is the responsibility of our legislative Houses that they stay alert even if there is one divisive voice so that we can continue to celebrate our diversity,” he said. Representatives for public welfare The PM said people make an image about public representatives that they always indulge in politics. “But, if you see, in every political party there are some public representatives who spend their lives in public welfare. These works strengthen people’s belief and trust in politics,” he said. Calling for qualitative debate, Modi said, “During this decorum must be followed and there should be no political remarks. It should be a healthy debate. The priority should be to increase the productivity of the House. Our laws will be comprehensive only when they are directly attached to public welfare for which positive debate is necessary. So, youth members, public representatives from aspirant areas and women need more and more opportunities in the House.” Modi stressed on speeding up digitisation of libraries of Parliament and assemblies and making them available online. First state to start paperless work Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla hoped that the conference would go a long way in strengthening the democratic setup. He said problems that arise on the floor of the House should be redressed effectively. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that the Himachal Pradesh assembly is known for its positive discussions and urged the Prime Minister to provide a Nation e-Academy for the state at Dharamshala. He said the hill state was the first in the country to start paperless work in its Vidhan Sabha, known as e-Vidhan. Recently, President Ram Nath Kovind addressed the House on the golden jubilee year of statehood of the state. Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh said that the conference was an opportunity to ponder over objectives for the next 100 years. He expressed concern over the delay in implementation of assurances given in the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/modi-calls-for-one-nation-one-legislative-platform-101637147559082.html
17-11-2021||Bangalore||Australia announces new consulate and centre to boost tech ties with India||Australia announced on Wednesday that it will establish a new consulate in Bengaluru and set up a centre of excellence for critical and emerging technology policy in India as part of efforts to drive the technology partnership between the two countries. Prime Minister Scott Morrison unveiled Australia’s plans during a virtual address to the Bengaluru Tech Summit, saying technology is at the forefront of the comprehensive strategic partnership he signed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. The new consulate will focus on deepening Australia’s ties with “India’s vibrant innovators, technologists and entrepreneurs” and support Australian businesses in “one of the world’s most important commercial centres”, foreign minister Marise Payne said in a statement. The new centre of excellence will elevate cooperation under an existing cyber and critical technology partnership and bring together Australian and Indian technologists, policy practitioners, academics, researchers and thought leaders, she said. Also Read: Rains to continue over Bengaluru, other parts of Karnataka“It is a multi-stakeholder initiative that will help guide the responsible development and use of critical technologies,” Payne said. Over the past year, India and Australia have stepped up cooperation on emerging and critical technologies both bilaterally and in partnership with Japan and the US, the other members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad. Much of this work is focused on lowering reliance on Chinese technologies and building secure and reliable supply chains. A group established by the Quad has been working to set standards and forge closer collaboration on critical and sensitive technologies such as AI and 5G. India and Australia are also collaborating on the use of rare earth elements. Noting that the consulate in Bengaluru will take the number of Australian missions in India to five, Morrison said the post will deepen ties with innovators and the government. “Bengaluru is the world’s fastest growing technology hub – of course, we want to be part of it. It is home to a third of India’s unicorn companies,” he said. The centre of excellence, he said, will help the two countries “shape technology governance so it aligns with our values and supports an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region”. The centre will also promote investment and innovation between Australia and India in technology and “amplify our policy influence globally”, he said. Morrison referred to the launch of the first Sydney Dialogue, which is a global summit on emerging and critical technologies, and said the event will witness the unveiling of Australia’s first “blueprint for critical technologies”. “This signals Australia’s firm commitment to shaping the development and adoption of critical technologies internationally, including by working with trusted partners like India,” he said. Morrison also referred to the work currently being done by Australia and India in the field of technology, and said technology-leading nations will have greater economic and political power and influence on global norms and values in the years ahead. The two sides are sharing expertise on cyber and critical technologies such as quantum computing and AI, and collaborating on the mining and processing of critical minerals such as cobalt, lithium and rare earth elements that are vital to clean energy technologies and have military applications. “We’re also cooperating on space science, technology, and research – and Australia is proud to be supporting India’s inspirational Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/australia-announces-new-consulate-and-centre-to-boost-tech-ties-with-india-101637146419012.html
17-11-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: A basil garden gives root to Pune’s first shopping plaza||The growing metropolis of Pune has engulfed most historical spaces, but the lively character of some places has survived, thrived and readapted to new demands and changing times in seamless manner. Tulshibaug in Budhwar peth is a perfect case in point. Tulshibaug doesn’t merely represent a garden or a roadside bazaar. It has, over centuries, evolved into an interesting mix of sacred precinct, cultural platform, shopping complexes and trade activities. It would be hard to believe that 250 years ago this space lay on the borders of the settlement of Pune and was known as kale vivar (black hole!). The area from present day Laxmi road towards the south was occupied by Kotwal chavadi, Chakle baug, Khajagiwale baug, Haripant Phadke’s baug and Ramshwar temple. Naro Appaji Khire (1700CE), who hailed from Padali village in Satara region worked as a small-time clerk under sardar Khajagiwale who handled the Peshwa families’ Pune affairs. His bright intellect was noticed by Nanasaheb Peshwa and he was quickly promoted to the post of Sar Subhedar in 1750s. Naro Appaji’s administration of Pune was appreciated by the next Peshwa, Madhavrao I, who was known to be strict, disciplined and an able administrator. Madhavrao was especially impressed by the fine diplomacy exhibited by Naro Appaji during the Nizam’s attack on Pune, as a result of which further damage was averted. Naro Appaji served four Peshwas, upto Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa. With the aim to raise a fine temple, Naro Appaji bought a corner of Khajagiwale’s garden measuring about an acre and started construction in the 1760s. The garden primarily consisted of basil plant beds which became its identity and was known as “Tulshi - baug”- basil garden. The association was so inseparable that Sarsubhedar Naro Appaji “Khire” came to be known as “Naro Appaji “Tulshibagwale” and the family surname continues to present times.The entire temple complex was well planned and reflected evolved choices of Maratha art and architectural design. The principal idols of Ram, Laxman and Sita in Rajasthan marble were sculpted by Uamajibuwa Pandharpurkar in 1765 and are probably the best in Pune. As per oral history quoted by Nanasaheb Tulshibaugwale, another set of idols of Ram and Sita were presented to Naro Appaji by an ascetic during his pilgrimage to Trambakeshwar and the original idols were replaced by these. Later, to complete the triad, famous Rajasthani sculptor Bakhatram was asked to make the Laxman idol. The present idols at the Ram temple in Tulshibaug are carved with weapons and old style costumes.The campus hosts temples of Trambakeshwar Mahadev, Siddhi Ganesha, Vitthal-Rukmini (also known as Anand Swami math due the presence of his samadhi) and shrines of Sheshshayin Vishnu, Das Maruti. The Trambakeshwar Mahadev temple consists of a shivlinga and baan (hygroscopic stone which captures and releases moisture from the air). Keeping with the Puneri tradition of eccentric names, the shrine behind the main temple housing Maruti is sarcastically known as “Kharkatya maruti” (leftover food), after the scraps left over by visiting pilgrims. The temple complex also houses smaller shrines of goddess Shitaladevi, Savatsa-Dhenu and minor deities. The shikhara of Tulshibaug is the tallest in Pune city measuring 140 feet in height. It has a square base topped by a narrow and sharp cone with horizontal layers of vaulted roof miniature shikaras or “maratha kutas”, giving an impression of a multi-storeyed divine abode. The construction is in brick and lime stucco and is white-washed with lime. The niches in miniature shikharas consist of sculptures of various deities and human figures dressed in pagdis (medieval headgear). The four corners of the square base of the shikhara are adorned with almost life-like monkeys. The temple has a magnificent wooden sabha-mandapa in front, with decorated ceiling and sloping aisles on both sides built in 1884 by Nandram Naik. The Ram temple at Tulshibaug acted as a social gathering platform and would host numerous devotional functions. The main festival of the temple is “Ram-navami” (birth of lord Ram). The main temple complex has entrances from three sides, one opening south towards Mahatma Phule Mandai, one on the east which is closed at present and one in the north, from the bustling lanes of Tulshibaug shopping area. The entrance from the north is the main entrance called “Sangit Darwaja” and consists of a nagarkhana (drum house). Madhavrao I started the tradition of “Naubati Chaughada”, drum beating, to mark festivals, auspicious occasions and the Maratha conquests. The construction of the temple complex continued in phases till 1795 and the total cost came to ₹1,36,667.In the olden days, area was occupied by sadhus, gosavis, ascetics, mendicants, ganpatyas, fakirs and so on. They would burn their dhunis (sacred fires), cover the body with ashes, perform penance, hang on trees and some even exploited naïve worshippers. Artisans from far places would display their art in form of terrcotta and utensils in the bazaar. The crowds of men and women would fill the campus of temple during the chhabina procession. Movement would difficult and the crowd had to be managed. Ladies would find it difficult to participate in the festivals due to lack of space.Bohri Ali was area was only market available for household items which orthodox Brahmins of the Peshwa period viewed as unsafe for women. Naro Appaji and his descendants encouraged development of Tulshibaug as a safe shopping experience by controlling the male crowds and promoting the retail market in the vicinity of the Ram temple. The “Tulshibaug sansthan” established by Naro Appaji managed the temple and annual festivals. Today, the temple is flocked to by women. It also serves a leisure spot to escape the hectic buying experience in the bylanes and offers great refreshment and peace. Over time, the maintenance and upkeep of the properties around temple became an overwhelming task and were leased out as residences and commercial spaces.Over the years, Tulshibaug evolved as a safe an affordable shopping space for women. It became well known for every small, minor household and fashion item. In fact, one of the early wig stores was opened in the precincts of Ram temple! It has been granted Grade A Heritage status in Pune’s heritage list and has been recently restored by conservation architect Kiran Kalamdani to its original glory.The Ram Temple complex retains its peaceful existence carrying on the legacy of Naro Appaji’s Tulshibaug in this dense commercial space in Pune’s heartland.Saili Palande-Datar is an indologist, environmentalist, history researcher and farmer.

Families of those who died of Covid-19 are eligible for a compensation of ₹50,000 in the state of Uttar Pradesh,provided cause of their deaths is verified through an audit process.

17-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai wakes up to 2nd warmest morning in 10 years, AQI remains ‘poor’||Mumbai recorded its second warmest November morning in 10 years with the minimum nighttime temperature on Wednesday touching 26.5 degrees Celsius, only about a degree less than the high of 27.4 degrees Celsius, recorded on November 4, 2018 . Experts attributed the rise to the continuing influence of a low-pressure system in the Arabian Sea, close to the Maharashtra coast, which has scuttled wind patterns and led to an influx of moisture over the Konkan region.“Humid air is able to hold heat. There is a weak low pressure system bringing moisture from the sea, and so it has become warmer. The wind speeds are also very slow, and so there is no cooling effect from the sea breeze. But the increasing humidity is also a sign that some thunderstorm development may happen around Mumbai soon.

Congress will register an official complaint against her with Mumbai police: Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole(file pic) pic.twitter.com/SwC6JGXPGKThe ‘bheek’ comment was in response to the massive criticism that she has been facing for previously describing India’s Independence as “bheek” and declaring that freedom came only in 2014 when the Narendra Modi-led government came to power.Also read | Rakhi Sawant is dubbed ‘national crush’ by fans after she calls 'didi' Kangana Ranaut 'nation's traitor'In a series of posts on Instagram, Ranaut, whose Twitter account has been suspended, this time targeted Mahatma Gandhi and urged her fans to “choose your heroes wisely”.The “Manikarnika” actor, still in the eye of the proverbial storm for her comments, shared an old news clipping headlined "Gandhi, others had agreed to hand over Netaji". The report claimed that Gandhi, along with Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohammed Ali Jinnah, came to an agreement with a British judge that they would hand Bose over if he were to enter the country. "Either you are a Gandhi fan or Nataji supporter You can't be both... Choose and decide," Ranaut captioned the news clipping.In another post, Ranaut, who has courted many a controversy with her provocative statements, then wrote, "Those who fought for the freedom were 'handed over' to their masters by those who had no courage burning/ boiling hot blood to fight their oppressors but they were power hungry and cunning.”She then went on to target Gandhi, even claiming that there was evidence suggesting he wanted Bhagat Singh to be hanged."Those are the ones who taught us, 'If someone slaps you offer another cheek for one more slap' and that is how you will get Aazadi. That's not how one gets Aazadi, one can only get bheekh like that. Choose your heros wisely(sic)," the 34-year-old actor said. The actor said it's about time people know their history and their heroes. "... Because just placing them all in one box of your memory and every year wishing them all birth anniversaries is not enough in fact it's not just dumb but highly irresponsible and superficial…," she added.Ranaut’s “azaadi” statement at an event organised by a news channel last week came two days after she was presented the Padma Shri by President Ram Nath Kovind.She has been under attack ever since with politicians from across the spectrum, historians, academics, fellow actors and others lashing out at her for views and many saying she should return her award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-congress-to-register-complaint-with-cops-against-kangana-ranaut-101637137396574.html

It explored the Apex Court's landmark judgment on the Ayodhya dispute.

While Dulari Devi, another candidate, secured 1,695 votes and came second.However, according to the Election Commission's website, Aditi Riswati was declared the winner, the ABP report said. And some newspapers printed wrong information about Asha Devi winning the Dinapatti constituency and this is the reason her supporters created ruckus at the collectorate in Supaul, the ABP report added.Before the stone-pelting happened, supporters of Devi arrived at the collectorate in Supaul to meet the district magistrate (DM) Mahendra Kumar. However, Kumar along with other officials was busy in a video call with chief minister Nitish Kumar.Moments later, the district magistrate's convoy left the collectorate, according to a report by Hindustan Times' sister publication Live Hindustan. This angered the supporters of Asha Devi as they started demanding a certificate of victory for their candidate and further pelted stones near the collectorate, the Live Hindustan report added.Apart from the lathicharge, police also fired rubber bullets in the air to disperse Devi's supporters. As many as 18 people have been arrested. After the incident, the area around the collectorate was under tight security for two hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-panchayat-polls-supporters-of-defeated-candidate-create-ruckus-in-supaul-101637126074398.html

No one was given a job. The Punjab government is doing nothing except giving false slogans and promises."He also took a dig at the infighting in the Punjab Congress unit, saying state party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has been targeting his own government recently over different issues."For the first time, we have seen that the chief minister says something and the party chief says something else and terms the chief minister's decisions as a lollipop. It shows how Congress is failing," he added."I do not understand why chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has announced ₹2 lakh to the culprits of January 26 violence in Delhi. There are cases of sedition and the Punjab government gives them two lakhs. This is very unfortunate. Democracy is being murdered," he added.Earlier, Sidhu had attacked the Channi government for not being able to fill up job vacancies in the state. He had questioned the government why it had failed to fill up one lakh job vacancies in the state.Earlier, Sidhu had slammed the state government and had urged them to not shy away from actual issues that Punjab people want to get resolved. He had also pointed out in his tweets that Punjab is the most indebted state of the country with debt accounting for 50 per cent of the state's GDP.Taking to Twitter, Sidhu said, "Today, Punjab is the most indebted state in India. Debt accounts for 50 per cent of State GDP. Half of our expenditure is funded by expensive debt. Let's not derail from real issues to which every Punjabi and party worker demands a solution because there is #PunjabBeyond2022 #HaqiqatPunjabDi."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-doing-nothing-except-making-false-promises-union-minister-som-prakash-101637125408166.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||New liquor regime kicks in with some opening hiccups as vends get into gear||Delhi will move to a new excise regime from Wednesday which promises to improve user experience, increase government revenue, and clean up malpractices in the city’s liquor business. But on day one of the new regime, only a handful of the shops will open as most either could not place orders for liquor stocks until Tuesday evening or did not have their premises ready for business.HT on Tuesday visited at least 14 new liquor shops in east, central and south Delhi and found none of them was ready. Also, the five new super-premium liquor shops for high-value products will take longer to open as the revenue department is yet to call for applications.Also Read| ‘Won’t act against pvt vendors for not paying license fee’: Delhi govt to HCAt MGF Metropolitan and Select City Walk malls alone, about five vends are coming up and none of them was ready as on Tuesday evening. The interiors of one of the shops are being planned with a mix of French and modern architecture with shades of black, white, and brown. “Our shop will be bigger with roughly 1,700 square feet area. Earlier it used to be a small space of about 700 square feet. The interiors are being done in such a way that we will have a separate side for whiskey and scotch, another side with fridges for beer, and a separate corner for wine. It will take us a day or two more to get the place ready. Now we are giving it an artistic look with multiple arches and exposed brick textures,” said the manager of the place who did not wish to be named.When asked why the shops aren’t ready, the retailers cited a host of reasons like the excise department not issuing provisional licences for individual vends on time, difficulty in finding a location to open a store, protests by resident welfare associations and locals of areas where the shops are coming up, difficulty in getting approvals from malls or the district centres, and problems in placing orders with wholesalers.“We have not received our licence ID from the department till now without which we cannot place orders with wholesale companies. We hope to get the ID by tomorrow morning and then we will place orders for all the four shops here. The deliveries will come only by Thursday,” said Monu Bansal, manager of the four shops that will come up at Mayur Vihar Phase-I’s Star City and Galleria malls. These two malls together housed at least 17 liquor shops in the old regime.Excise department officials said more and more shops will be ready in the coming days. “We are issuing provisional licenses on a war footing. It often gets delayed because each licence is issued only after our officials inspect the premises. Most of them turn out to be unfit and we reject them. That is why only about 350 provisional licences have been issued so far,” said an official on condition of anonymity.Another official said they are also helping licensees to resolve issues with the locals. “There have been protests by locals and RWAs against the opening of liquor shops in Kalkaji, Shahdara, Burari and so on. The government is helping retailers in convincing people as well,” said the official.Also Read| Delhi govt all set to exit liquor biz, pave way for reformsThe new excise policy aims at providing a more equitable distribution of stores by dividing the Capital into 32 zones for the retail sale of liquor. Each zone will have at least 27 liquor vends — all of which will go to one successful bidder. It also ends the system of collecting licence fees separately from each store. Instead, the licence fee and excise duty are charged upfront, and retailers are free to decide the selling prices and offer discounts in a competitive environment rather than a maximum retail price mandated by the government.Work was in full swing at the liquor shop located near Savitri Cinema in Greater Kailash 2 as well. “We will take at least a week to open the store fully. Until then, we have made a small enclosure from where we will start selling liquor from tomorrow. The experience will be like buying liquor from a mall,” said Rajeev Malhotra, in-charge of the shop.On Tuesday, none of the retailers was aware of what brands will be available from day one as they said there is no clarity about what the wholesalers will send. “They (wholesale companies) said they will deliver whatever they have. We placed orders for everything, they will send only what is available,” said a store manager of a new store that will open in South Delhi’s Kotla area.Meanwhile, the Delhi government’s liquor store at Connaught Place wore a deserted look with all the empty shelves. The store had at least four employees. “We have not yet been told whether we will be sacked or deployed in some other government department. There are approximately 3,000 of us who handle the government’s liquor shops in Delhi,” said an employee who did not wish to be named.After decades of operating around 60% of the city’s nearly 850 retail liquor shops, the Delhi administration formally exited from the business permanently from Tuesday night.A third senior excise official said a file on this has been sent to the services department, which handles transfers and postings of government employees. “Nobody will be sacked. They will be accommodated in other government departments,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-liquor-regime-kicks-in-with-some-opening-hiccups-as-vends-get-into-gear-101637127495717.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||Liquor shortage, chaos on cards as Delhi’s new excise policy comes into effect. Here's what changes||Delhi is preparing to have about 850 swanky liquor stores across the national capital as the new excise policy comes into effect today. The government quit the retail liquor business with nearly 600 government-run liquor vends operating across the national capital shutting shop on Tuesday. Under the new excise regime, the liquor business will be handled completely by private players and people will now be able to walk in swanky liquor vends.The new excise policy is aimed at revolutionising the consumer experience as stylish liquor stores are set to replace the existing government-run shops. The policy was put in the public domain in July under which spacious, well lit and air-conditioned liquor vends will be set up in 32 zones across the city. Some liquor outlets will also have tasting facilities to enhance users’ experience.The new private licence holders can start the retail sale of liquor in Delhi starting today, with one retail licensee to have 27 liquor shops per zone. The shops will remain open from 10am to 10pm.The L-17 licensees, which include independent restaurants and gastro-bars, will be able to serve liquor in the balcony, terrace, and lower area of the restaurant given the area is screened off from public view.But the transition may initially cause a shortage of liquor and chaos as shops in many areas are still preparing for operations."Not more than 250-300 shops will be able to function on the first day. There maybe some shortage in the initial few days due to lesser number of shops, however, it will end as new vends come up," Delhi Liquor Trade Association President Naresh Goyal said, as quoted by news agency PTI.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/liquor-shortage-chaos-on-cards-as-delhi-s-new-excise-policy-comes-into-effect-here-s-what-changes-101637123603601.html

I don't know if it is true... Is the money paid?" Ashok Gehlot asked at a state-level function to honour teachers on Tuesday."Yes” was the collective response from the teachers present at the event."It is very painful that teachers are eager to get transfers done by paying money,” said a surprised Gehlot. “If there is a policy on transfers, everyone will come to know when they are to be transferred. Then there will be no circulation of money and need of an MLA to give his recommendation,” he said.The Rajasthan chief minister added that the issue of transfer policy is serious and it should be made in such a way so that there is no heartburn.State school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra later said any minor malpractice should be reported to him, adding Gehlot wanted to indicate that people should not be forced to pay money."This will be totally ended with the implementation of a policy for the transfer of teachers under my and chief minister's leadership," Dotasra said on Tuesday.However, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reacted sharply to bribes being paid by government teachers in Rajasthan by saying that educators have shown the corrupt face of the Ashok Gehlot government to everyone."Teachers are the mirror of society, who can never lie," deputy leader of opposition in the assembly Rajendra Rathore tweeted.In recent months, the Congress-led government in Rajasthan has faced flak over a cheating scandal right before the Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET) in September.The exam was held amid tight security and mobile internet services were suspended in some districts including Jaipur to avoid cheating.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-asks-govt-teachers-about-bribes-gets-this-answer-101637118523713.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra urges Centre to reduce gap between two shots of Covishield vaccine||Maharashtra on Tuesday urged the Centre to provide booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine for its healthcare and frontline workers, and also sought a reduction in the gap between two Covishield doses from the existing 84 days to 28, which is the case with Covaxin jabs.At a meeting between Maharashtra’s health minister Rajesh Tope and union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya in New Delhi, the western state also sought to know when the anti-Covid vaccination drive for children aged 12-18 would begin. Tope had made the request to cut down on the time gap between two Covishield doses last week during a virtual meeting between Mandaviya and health ministers of all states and union territories.The Maharashtra minister argued that there was a need to speed up the administering of second doses across the state. Until Tuesday evening, Maharashtra had 34,292,903 fully vaccinated people, which is about 37% of the state’s eligible beneficiaries for vaccination against Covid-19. Of the 91.44 million targeted beneficiaries in the state, 69,789,048 people, which is 76.3%, have taken the first dose. Also Read: Salman Khan to help Maha tackle vaccine hesitancy in Muslim areas: MinisterMaharashtra administered a total 104,094,458 doses of a Covid vaccine until Tuesday evening, according to the Centre’s CoWin vaccine-tracking dashboard.The state government has set a target of inoculating 100% of its eligible population against the coronavirus disease with at least one dose by November 30. While the Centre has no such official target for the country, the union health ministry has asked state governments to ensure that the entire adult population is covered with at least the first dose while the “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign continues.Tope said the 20-minute meeting with the union health minister “was positive”. He said, “We want to increase the percentage of fully vaccinated people. Therefore, we have sought a reduction in the gap between two Covishield doses from 84 days to 28 days.”Besides Maharashtra, Kerala, too, has demanded a reduction in the gap between Covishield doses, and it has also asked for booster doses for healthcare and frontline workers.In a column for HT last week, virologist and retired professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Dr T Jacob John wrote why booster doses may become an important tool in containing the virus. “Dampening the tempo of virus circulation will lead to fewer infections and deaths. For that, breakthrough infections must be prevented by giving booster doses to all who come forward,” he wrote. “There is apprehension, amplified by the World Health Organization (WHO), that a booster dose deprives someone waiting for second dose. If vaccines were in short supply, that is reasonable. However, India has unused vaccine stocks in several states and institutions - thus, a policy shift allowing boosters will be a wise and ethical decision.”The state health minister said it has been nearly a year since healthcare and frontline workers were vaccinated, so booster doses were required. Maharashtra also sought National Health Mission funds to recruit personnel, as was done during the first two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, for the sixth straight day, Maharashtra recorded fewer than 1,000 Covid-19 cases. On Tuesday, it reported 886 fresh cases, pushing the tally to 6,625,872. The state added 34 fatalities due to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking the death toll to 140,636. Mumbai added 213 fresh cases, taking its tally to 760,724.

People should follow the COVID safety protocol and get vaccinated, he added.On Tuesday, Maharashtra reported 886 Covid-19 cases and 34 related fatalities, taking the tally in the state to 66,25,872 and the death toll to 140,636, the health department said.

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Day after carpeting, road in Ludhiana scrapes off||The tall claims made by authorities regarding the quality of development works have fallen flat after the hotmix material started scraping off from the surface of the Model Town-Jawaddi road, a day after the road was carpeted by the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT).Shopkeepers in the area complained that the material started scraping off after the surface on Tuesday morning. Soon after the complaint was submitted, LIT officials reached the spot for inspection.Submitting a complaint with the authorities, RTI activist Arvind Sharma said the half portion of the road was carpeted on Monday evening, while the other half is being constructed on Tuesday. The project is being taken up at the cost of around ₹2 crore.“The area falls under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation (MC), but the road is being constructed by LIT due to the shortage of funds faced by the MC. No official of the MC or LIT was present on the spot when the road was carpeted and the material scraped off when scratched with shoes on Tuesday morning. It is a sheer wastage of public funds and action should be taken against the contractor and officials. I have submitted a complaint with MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and will file a complaint with the local bodies department in the coming days,” he said.Meanwhile, LIT executive engineer Jagdev Singh claimed that they had checked the road and it was being carpeted properly. “Only around 4*6 inches of road portion was damaged that too due to the leakage of diesel at the spot. The diesel might have leaked from the machinery being used by the contractor to construct the road. Other spots were also checked, but everything was fine. The damaged portion has also been repaired,” he said.Previously too, residents had complained against alleged inferior quality road construction works done in Kitchlu Nagar, Haibowal, SBS Nagar among other areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-after-carpeting-road-in-ludhiana-scrapes-off-101637097690833.html
17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Quota for Punjabis proposal: Move may be last nail in dying industry’s coffin, say traders||With the state government proposing a reservation for Punjabis in government and private sector jobs, a section of industry has opposed the move, appealing to the state government to keep the industry away from quota.Stating that the Punjab industry is largely dependent on migrant labour, members of All Industries and Trade Forum (AITF) rued that fixing quota for locals in private industries may be the last nail in the coffin of the state’s sinking manufacturing sector. The forum has written to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, expressing their concerns with regard to the proposal.The members said there are around 30 lakh migrant workers in the state and around 6 lakh have settled permanently in Punjab.President of the forum, Badish Jindal said according to a study carried out by the Centre for Development Economics and Innovation Studies (CDEIS) of Punjabi University, 70% of the people coming to the cities are from outside the state and only 30% belong to rural Punjab. The MSME industries in Punjab have 70% to 90% workforce from outside the state and the large and medium industries employ between 30% and 60% non-Punjabi workers, the study says, adding 90% of unskilled workers in industries are migrants.Jindal said, “The industry is already reeling under recession due to locational disadvantages, the ongoing pandemic and many other factors and this proposal, if implemented, will result in closure of a large number of industrial units. This may also affect the proposed investment in the state by different companies and corporate houses. The proposed law is not only against the constitutional provisions, but is also against the basic principle of meritocracy that acts as the foundation for businesses to grow and remain competitive. If at all the proposal has to be implemented, it should be implemented in the government sector only.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/quota-for-punjabis-proposal-move-may-be-last-nail-in-dying-industry-s-coffin-say-traders-101637097210899.html

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Election commission rejects Punjab govt’s proposal to transfer Ludhiana DC||Putting an end to the ongoing controversy, the Election Commission of India (ECI) rejected the state government’s proposal to transfer Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma ahead of assembly elections.It has been learnt that the ECI sent a formal document to the state government on Tuesday, stating that the proposal was considered and rejected. Row had erupted over the government’s proposal to transfer Sharma, amid his alleged tussle with a cabinet minister. The matter got murkier as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) submitted a complaint with the ECI alleging that Sharma was being “targeted” for working against the land mafia which, they claimed, enjoys the support of senior Congress leaders, MLAs and cabinet ministers.Submitting a complaint with the ECI in Chandigarh on Tuesday, AAP leaders including Ludhiana Lok Sabha constituency in-charge Amandeep Mohi, spokesperson Ahbaab Grewal and joint secretary, Kisan wing, Gurjit Singh Gill demanded that the ECI should reject the proposal. In the complaint, the AAP leaders alleged that Sharma had “angered Congress leaders” by not allowing the sale of a prime land in Model Town Extension at throwaway prices in the past. He had also reportedly marked an inquiry into the wrongdoings of a Congress MLA. Due to this, the senior Congress leaders in the city came at loggerheads with the DC, AAP had claimed.As per the guidelines of ECI, prior approval of the commission is mandatory for transfer of any officer engaged in revision of electoral rolls during an election year due to extraordinary reasons. Due to this, the state government had sent a proposal to the Election Commission to transfer Sharma from the city. AAP leaders claimed that Dr Amarpal Singh, who they termed as a controversial officer, was being considered for the post of Ludhiana DC. AAP alleged that Singh is a “blue-eyed” boy of former chief ministers Captain Amarinder Singh and Parkash Singh Badal. His name had also come up in the multi-crore iron ore scam in 2017, which had led to losses worth crores to the public exchequer. But Singh was pardoned by the former CM, the AAP claimed.Claiming to have been instrumental in stopping the transfer of DC Sharma, AAP leaders, including Grewal and Gill, appreciated the actions of the ECI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/election-commission-rejects-punjab-govt-s-proposal-to-transfer-ludhiana-dc-101637094390380.html

The 46-year-old MLA, who is into real estate business, owns a large chunk of ancestral land at Ayali village. Sources said the department team had made preparations in advance. Area residents said that the officials began gathering near the MLA’s premises in the wee hours of Tuesday. Mani Sharma, the officer on special duty to the MLA, said that a team of 70 persons, including I-T officials and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, simultaneously raided the Akali leader’s properties, including a farmhouse, agricultural land, party office at Mullapur Dakha and an office in Golf Link Apartments that Ayali developed.

He (Ayali) had come clean in the past and the same will happen this time too,” mani Sharma said. “The government is using central agencies to harass the opposition leaders. The MLA led the agitations on several occasions to oppose the three farm laws. It was him who pressed upon his party leadership to break the longstanding alliance with the BJP,” said Sharma.In his 2019 by-elections affidavit, Ayali, a college dropout, had declared agricultural land, commercial and residential properties at different locations. He was a partner in PPR Associates II, PPR Construction, Nirmaan Builders and Developers and director in Ayali Developers and Colonisers Private Ltd, according to the affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/it-raids-at-akali-mla-manpreet-ayali-s-house-offices-in-ludhiana-101637093972131.html
17-11-2021||Pune||‘Pune needs dedicated chess stadium for yearly tournaments’||PUNE Setting up a date with a chess board in 1985, Abhijit Kunte began his journey as a chess maestro, the crowing glory in terms of achievements coming on November 13 when Kunte received the Dhyan Chand award in Delhi from the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind.The Dhyan Chand award is given to sports personalities by the ministry of youth affairs and sport, as an honour for active contributions to sports both during active careers and after retirement.Abhijit Kunte is now chief coach and chairman of the selection committee of the All India Chess Federation. He also runs a “chess in school” programme that has been adopted by many states. From becoming a Grandmaster in 2000 to now chief coach and chairman of the selection committee, Kunte, in light of his award sheds some light on how chess has progressed in the country, and what still needs to be done.What does Pune need to develop chess?Pune needs one dedicated chess stadium where international tournaments are conducted every year. In Maharashtra we have 10 Grandmasters of which five are from Pune. This is apart from the four woman grandmasters and apart eight international masters. In Maharashtra, Pune is one of the strong centres for chess. Because of the pandemic there was a bit of a set back, but it will definitely come up. How has the sport changed from 1985 to 2021?Everything has changed. When I started in 1985, there were only three age group categories: under-16, under 19 and the Open. There were only four open tournaments in India and there was no grandmaster. When I played my first tournament it was under-16 and I was eight-years old. I got the youngest player’s prize. Now at the age of 8 children are playing national championships. At the state level there are 10,000 children playing chess. Such a revolution has happened. Around 100-118 tournaments happen in a year. In all, we have 72 grandmasters in the country.Are you enjoying your role as a coach?Coaching is a different. Many things are basically not in your hand. Coaching for the long run is different because you have a lot of time to work with players and discuss and form long-term plans. A team needs to have a different strategy and when you are actually coaching a player for more than three years, then you can have a completely different bond. There are various different dimensions of coaching which are different from playing and it is much tougher, but also rewarding.Online or offline chess formats. What’s your move? I am not a big fan of online chess, because I could not play it well. Online chess is a reality and it is the future. It is easy to watch. Now there are many online channels as well which has helped chess reach many new audiences. People used to say that chess is not spectator friendly, but online chess has broken that jinx. When I was with the women’s team in Spain, on the first day we realised players were having problems calculating moves and we thought it is because they have played a lot of online chess. I feel both are important and people need to manage both, as online chess is not going away as tournaments are happening.How is your ‘chess in school’ doing?What we see as chess should be part of the curriculum and it should be taught to every student as a life game. Chess should be taught for introducing four concepts - concentration, decision making, patience, taking responsibility for failures and accepting decisions. All these are very important in life and will help to learn management. It is very important to introduce it at a very young age as it will identify a lot of talent. There is no problem for space, so for schools it is a much easier task to accommodate chess. Government of Arunachal Pradesh has started chess in their curriculum, and Chhattisgarh has agreed to start a pilot project. Many schools are coming forward.Check the knight -Abhijit Kunte was vice-captain coach of the Indian team, along with Srinath Narayanan that won bronze at the Online Olympiad in 2021.- He was also coach of the Indian team that won silver medal at the FIDE World Women’s Team Championships 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-needs-dedicated-chess-stadium-for-yearly-tournaments-101637093670839.html

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Bus fare hike on cards in Ludhiana||The deadlock between the municipal corporation (MC) and city bus contractor over running the service to its full capacity is likely to end as civic body officials have decided to move forward with the proposal to revise the bus fares, which has been a long-pending demand of the contractor. MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal conducted a meeting with the contractor at the civic body’s Zone-A office on Tuesday and stated that a proposal to hike the fare will be tabled in front of MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and mayor Balkar Sandhu, but the final decision has to be taken by senior officials only.Service currently available only on 2 routesCurrently, the contractor charges ₹5 for the first five kilometres , ₹10 till 10 kms, ₹15 till 15 kms and ₹20 till 20 kms. The only public transport facility of the city, the bus service has been running into choppy waters as out of the total 83 buses handed over to the contractor in 2015, only 25 are running. The service is available only on two routes as the contractor has been complaining of losses on other routes. The contractor stated that he is ready to extend the service to at least seven routes and run all 83 buses, if the MC increases fare. In all, 120 buses were purchased under the project and the remaining 37 buses, worth around ₹17 crore, are gathering dust at the Tajpur road depot since its purchase.The MC has been at the loggerheads with the contractor, demanding the payment of pending dues that run into around ₹3 crore while the contractor has been seeking a fare hike. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the Congress is keen on resolving the issue, at the earliest, as assembly elections are round the corner. There is also a clause in the agreement that the fare has to be increased if there is a hike in diesel prices. The MC had served a termination notice to the company in 2019, following which the company moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The matter is sub-judice.Recently, the contractor had served a legal notice to transport minister, local bodies minister, municipal and transport authorities for their failure to take action against illegal buses plying on city roads, which affects the business of the city bus service.Dachalwal said, “The proposal on fare hike will be taken up with senior officials. The rates can be revised by the municipal corporation itself and there is no need to take the consent of the state transport department. Final decision over the same will be taken soon. If revised, the fare will be increased after taking into account the hike in diesel prices.” Will surrender service contract if fare not revised: ContractorJaskirat Singh, one of the directors of the company which is running the city bus service, said the fare of buses was fixed in 2015 when the diesel rate was around ₹48/l. Now, the diesel rate has doubled, but the fare is not being revised, even though there is clause regarding this in the agreement. “We are running into losses and will be forced to surrender the contract if the MC fails to revise the fare,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bus-fare-hike-on-cards-in-ludhiana-101637093370389.html

He said the Punjab government should do its best to facilitate the visit of maximum devotees who had been waiting for the reopening for more than a year.The former deputy chief minister also urged the masses not to fall into the trap of anti-Panthic forces that were using the Sikh garb to weaken the community from inside. He said there was a deep-rooted conspiracy to render Sikhs leaderless by discrediting their religious institutions as well as their representative party – the Shiromani Akali Dal.On the income tax survey of SAD MLA Manpreet Singh Ayali, Badal said he (Ayali) was being victimised. “Ayali’s sole fault is that he has supported the Kisan Andolan from the very beginning. He will continue to do so even now and such intimidatory tactics will not stop the SAD and its workers from raising their voice in solidarity with the farmers.”The SAD chief held various public meetings across Nawanshahr constituency, where he listened to public grievances and assured to redress them permanently after forming the government.Sukhbir also spoke with farmer union members who posed questions to him related to Akali Dal’s stand over the three farm laws and other issues. Sukhbir said that SAD had always supported the farmers and even broke the alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party over three farm laws and his wife, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, quit the Union cabinet.“We also demand justice in the Guru Granth Sahib sacrilege cases as the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party are politicising the issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-badal-welcomes-corridor-reopening-urges-govt-to-facilitate-common-pilgrims-101637092233325.html
17-11-2021||Pune||NBCL-accredited PMC lab lying idle for 2 yrs||PUNE: The laboratory started by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in 2011 to test food and water samples for the public and government authorities was the first to get a National Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NBCL) accreditation in 2015, however it has been lying idle for the last more than two years due to the lackadaisical approach of the civic administration.An inquiry under the Right to Information (RTI) has found that the laboratory was run by a private agency for five years till 2018 while the renewed proposal for renting out the laboratory to private players so that the PMC would get revenue was approved by the standing committee in 2019 but has been awaiting the general body’s approval ever since. Owing to apathy on the part of the administration and ruling party, the PMC has been losing out on revenue ever since.Earlier, the PMC was paying the private agency around Rs53 lakh per annum to run the laboratory. Till 2018, the PMC paid the agency Rs3.56 crore for running the laboratory. The corporation also spent around Rs60 lakh on chemicals, electricity bills and other expenses during this period.Vivek Velankar, founder of the city-based Sajag Nagrik Manch, said, “The PMC started a laboratory and provided a facility to test food and water samples for the public and government authorities. It was run by a private player till 2018. Objecting to the wastage of public money, the PMC tabled a proposal in the standing committee to rent out the laboratory to private players so that it would get Rs30 lakh per annum in revenue. The proposal was sanctioned in July 2019 in the standing committee. But, it is pending approval of the general body and the PMC is losing out on revenue since 2019. It is a waste of taxpayers’ money that was used to set up a laboratory to provide facilities to common citizens.”“On the one hand, the corporation is trying to find other sources to boost revenue while on the other, they are not bothered about running existing facilities to earn revenue,” Velankar said.Being the second government laboratory in Pune district and only the first to get NBCL accreditation, the laboratory (while it was active) issued quality certificates under the Food Safety Act to the public and government authorities. To begin with, the laboratory tested meat from the PMC-owned abattoir in Salunke Vihar, Kondhwa. Later, it began testing food (milk, butter, ghee, edible oil, cooked food and vegetable- and meat- products); water; and sewage water.A PMC health officer said, “The corporation was testing around 1,000 samples every year, including food and water. The corporation’s in-house samples of water and meat (PMC runs slaughter houses) were also tested in the laboratory. Now, the PMC will have to follow all procedures to get NBCL certification. The new contractor will have to pay around Rs3 crore to the NBCL as deposit and will have to follow all procedures to get NBCL certification due to the laboratory being inactive.”Meanwhile, Dr Ashish Bharati, chief medical officer of the corporation, maintained, “The proposal has been tabled in the general body meeting. After approval, the laboratory will resume as early as possible.”Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house of the PMC, claimed, “Due to Covid-19, the general body meeting could not be conducted physically. We will now take up the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nbclaccredited-pmc-lab-lying-idle-for-2-yrs-101637092230192.html

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Cricket: Two Chandigarh lads make it to India U-19 team||It was natural for Harnoor Singh Pannu to pick up a bat than playing with toys while growing up. His father, Birinder Singh, had represented Punjab U-19 team while his grandfather Rajinder Singh was involved with the game in Punjab; so the talk at home always revolved around cricket. Harnoor toiled hard to chase his dream of donning the India colours and the dream has indeed come true. The Chandigarh lad scored the highest 412 runs, including three centuries, during the U-19 Challenger Trophy, and the result was his selection in the India A for the upcoming Triangular one-day series starting in Kolkata from November 28 involving two teams from India and one from Bangladesh. “Since we did not have any tournament in the U-19 category due to the pandemic, it was great to get a domestic tournament this season and also the Challenger Trophy. My aim would be to make use of the chances and make a mark,” said Singh, an opener who idolises Shubman Gill and like his idol believes in playing aggressive strokes. He hammered scores of 22, 130, 137, 129 in the Challengers Trophy and also hit the maximum 54 fours during the tournament. He impressed the national selectors with his ability to score at a stunning strike-rate. After the triangular series, the India U-19 team would be selected for Asia Cup in Dubai followed by U-19 World Cup in West Indies in February 2022. “I am focused on giving my best in the Triangular series and see how things go after that for future tournaments,” said the 18-year-old Harnoor, who is a student of PML SD School, Sector 32, Chandigarh. Along with Harnoor, Chandigarh all-rounder Raj Angad Bawa has also made it to India A team for the Triangular series. Playing for Team B, Raj Angad scored a total of 154 runs including a century (119) and eight wickets in three innings with the best bowling figures of 3/45. A lanky fast bowler and attacking left-handed batsman, Raj Angad is son of renowned cricket coach Sukhwinder Bawa and grandson of hockey Olympian Tarlochan Bawa, who was member of the team that won the Gold at London in 1948. “My grandfather is an inspiration for me. And what I am today is because of my father. He has been a tremendous coach and a guide. Knowing that the U-19 World Cup is around the corner, I trained hard this season and gave my best while playing for Chandigarh in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. And then the Challenger Trophy happened. It gave a right platform to showcase my all-rounder skills,” said Raj Angad, who is also a student of PML SD School, Sector 32, Chandigarh, and looks up to former cricketer Yuvraj Singh. With this, they are the first cricketers from UT Cricket Association to make it to the India U-19 team since it came into being in 2019. Earlier, both played for Punjab at the U-16 level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cricket-two-chandigarh-lads-make-it-to-india-u-19-team-101637091935385.html

PEC completed its hundred years of existence on November 9.The President said that in the early 1960s, when it was felt that our country needed the services of aeronautical engineers, the Indian Air Force had approached PEC. “It was through the joint efforts with IISc that PEC created history as being the first engineering college to give India its first batch of 17 graduate aeronautical engineers in 1964,” he said.The President unveiled a special postage stamp containing images of PEC’s campus in 1921, originally Mughalpura Technical College in Lahore, and PEC’s present campus, marking the completion of 100 years of the institute.Kovind said that when the foundations of an institute have such a glorious and inspiring past, its students are bound to have higher ambitions in mind. Such ambitions were personified in Dr Kalpana Chawla, an astronaut-engineer and the first woman of Indian origin to travel in space.“I was pleasantly surprised to know that during the challenging times of the Covid-19 pandemic, PEC students built robots that could go into isolation wards and deliver food, medicine and other supplies to patients,” he said.The President also said that he would expect institutes like the PEC and its competent alumni to act as mentors and collaborate with other universities of the country.Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit said: “Over the years, PEC has always provided future generations with extraordinary facilities and resources. It has been a guiding light for many young intellectuals and has produced some of the most refined talents this world has ever seen.”The President also inaugurated a newly constructed centenary hall to mark the milestone besides a new semiconductor research centre.

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh property dealer’s story of rags to riches to disgrace||After the arrest of property dealer and financier Ram Lal Chaudhary in a cheating case, Chandigarh Police have unearthed property worth ₹135 crore owned by him and his family. Chaudhary was arrested on November 12 for allegedly duping a Gurgoan resident of ₹5 crore on the pretext of real estate investment about five years back. He is presently in seven-day police custody. The 64-year-old, who started off a labourer, used to stay in a shanty at Karsan Colony in Ram Darbar when he first came to Chandigarh in 1976 at the age of 19 from Rajasthan for “better future”.Entry into real estate changed everything. Presently, he is the director of Orvis Developers in Mohali. “He used to sell sand and bricks on a rehri. At that time, a rehri of sand would earn him ₹25,” said a police official privy to investigations. “Over the years, he cultivated contacts with politicians, bureaucrats and cops that helped him sail through. As per the complaints, he had taken money from people to get relief in criminal cases and even helped many policemen get posted in different wings,” said another senior cop, who didn’t wish to be named. After two unsuccessful attempts in MC elections from Mauli Jagran and Ram Darbar, Chaudhary diverted all his time to real estate and financier business.Multiple propertiesThe investigations have revealed that the family now owns a house in Sector 46, Chandigarh, besides more than 40 flats, agricultural land, commercial sites and booths in Chandigarh and Mohali. The family also owns a fleet of luxury vehicles, including BMW 7 series, Mercedes, Audi Q7, Range Rover and Porsche.“Chaudhary used to give loans at high rates of interest and took signed blank affidavits as security that were later used to transfer property in his name,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh.Chahal said that investigations are in progress and documents related to properties worth more than ₹135 crore have been recovered. “The enforcement directorate has also sought details of his properties and bank accounts from us,” he said. Chequered past Over the years, Chaudhary has also been embroiled in a number of criminal cases. He was one of the accused in the infamous rape-on-wheels case registered in 2002. He was also arrested for the murder of his son’s live-in partner, who was a model. He was acquitted in both cases. In 2005, he was booked in a drugs case in Panchkula. Later in 2008, he was convicted and fined in a case of negligent driving in Manimajra, and was also booked for cheating in Mohali. A case of theft was also registered against him at the Rohini police station in Delhi. Alleges extortionAn additional sessions court has issued a notice to the UT administration for Wednesday, seeking reply after Chaudhary filed a petition against his seven-day remand. The petitioner sought that the order passed by the judicial magistrate first class be kept aside and he be sent to judicial custody immediately.Chaudhary’s counsel alleged that the property dealer was picked up by the police “illegally” and that he was being harassed by a senior police official and a station house officer, who were trying to extort money from him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-property-dealer-s-story-of-rags-to-riches-to-disgrace-101637091931673.html

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Sippy Sidhu murder case: 6 years on, family awaits justice||Six years after city-based lawyer Sippy Sidhu’s murder, his family still awaits justice. On Tuesday, the mother and brother of the deceased held a press conference, where they requested the investigating agency to hand over the copy of the documents.The application was moved by the family during the last date of hearing, and the case is now listed for November 18.“While the investigating agency has filed the untraced report, we want to file a protest petition. The case is now listed on November 18 for protest petition, which is only possible if the investigating agency hands over the copy of all documents,” Sippy Sidhu’s mother Deepinder Kaur Sidhu said.She said, “The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has given us the copy of an untraced report which has the statement of witnesses, but it has no article on which the agency had relied. The articles are primarily information in the form of discs, seizure memos and CCTV footage which contain material evidence.”“We are seeking a copy of these articles, which are part of the final report but not supplied to us,” she said.Lawyer Sukhmanpreet ‘Sippy’ Singh Sidhu, 36, was shot dead in a Sector 27 park in Chandigarh on September 20, 2015. The case was transferred to the CBI in 2016 after allegations by his family about the involvement of a judge’s daughter.The woman, reportedly a friend of Sippy Sidhu, was summoned and questioned twice by the Chandigarh police during the initial probe. Sidhu’s family had held protests alleging that she was being shielded by the police. The UT administration had on January 22, 2016, recommended a CBI probe in the case.In December 2020 the CBI had informed the CBI court that it has no evidence of the involvement of a former Punjab and Haryana high court judge’s daughter in the crime. The federal agency, however, has said it will like to keep investigations open as it has “strong suspicions about the role of (woman’s name hidden) to eliminate Sippy Sidhu.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sippy-sidhu-murder-case-6-years-on-family-awaits-justice-101637091877827.html

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Poor upkeep sends Ward 9 residents up the wall||Poor sanitation and dilapidated streets are among the key issues being faced by residents of ward number 9 under the Chandigarh municipal corporation.The ward comprises Daria village, Mauli Jagran-2 and the Industrial Area, Phase I, besides its surrounding habitations of Sanjay Colony, Kabari Colony and Colony Number 4. While residents of Daria will participate in the MC elections for the first time, The Industrial Area, Phase 1, was earlier part of ward number 22.In Daria, the most common problems are broken streets, open garbage heaps and poor sanitation. The residents say nothing much has changed in the past few years even as the MC has taken over the village. Nirmala Devi, a 50-year-old resident of Daria, says: “We have been waiting for our street to get revamped but nothing has been done so far. Cleanliness has been an issue and even sewerage line gets blocked during monsoons.”Residents have been also facing the problem of irregular water supply, due to which they have to hire water tankers for daily use. Also, there is no place for recreational activities in the locality.“Dangling electricity wires on the narrow streets pose threat to public and there is no cleanliness here. During the rainy season, water gets accumulated on the streets and sometimes enters our houses. These issues need to be resolved,” says Mohammad Shahid, 40, who resides in Raja Bagh, Daria.In Mauli Jagran-2, residents are irked by stray cattle and poor maintenance of parks. They also complain that water meters have not been installed in the houses and sewerage lines remain choked.Ved Prakash, 42, a local, says: “The maintenance of roads and parks is poor in our locality and stray cattle menace is a concern. Sometimes street lights do not work properly here.”The list of issues at Sanjay Colony in Industrial Area, Phase 1, is long. Residents say they have to suffer from unhygienic surroundings and narrow and broken streets inundated by water, which sometimes even enters their homes. “As there is no draining system in our colony, the rainwater sometimes enters the houses. There are only a few taps for water supply and even toilets here are in a bad state,” says 21-year-old Akash, a resident of Sanjay Colony.Sunil Rai, a 40-year-old vegetable seller who lives in the colony, says: “We have been residing here for decades, but the state of the colony has not improved. Poor sanitation is the main problem.”Residents in Kabari Colony and Colony Number 4, also in the Industrial Area, face similar issues. The colonies are in a poor state, with garbage dumped in the open. At Colony Number 4, many were allotted houses in Maloya after a survey in 2006. However, those who were left out are still waiting to get rehabilitated, says a local.KNOW YOUR WARDLocalities: Daria; Mauli Jagran-2; Industrial Area, Phase 1, along with Sanjay Colony Kabari Colony and Colony No. 4Reserved for women (general)Voters: 20,000 Key issuesPoor sanitation and open garbage dumpsDilapidated streets and choked sewersInadequate water supply and dangling electricity wiresLocal voicesWe have been waiting for the streets to get revamped but nothing has been done so far.

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali MC begins registration of pet dogs||Four months after the Punjab local bodies department notified pet-dog bylaws for Mohali, the municipal corporation on Tuesday began their registration. The one-time registration fee for pet dogs is ₹100 and the annual renewal fee is also ₹100. On Tuesday, city mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu handed over the first token of registration to councillor Kamalpreet Singh Bunny by registering his pet dog. Senior deputy mayor Amrik Singh Somal, deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi and municipal commissioner Kamal Garg were also present. A resident is allowed to keep only two pets dogs at home. Sidhu said that people who do not register their pet dogs will have to pay ₹100 for a one-month delay, ₹200 for two-month delay and if they still fail to do so, they will have to cough up five times the renewal fee. If a pet dog is found loitering, it will be impounded. The owner will have pay up ₹5,000 penalty and daily feed charges of ₹500. If the dog is repeatedly impounded, the penalty will be ₹10,000. Failure to control dangerous pet dogs can result in a fine of up to ₹50 per day and a maximum of ₹2,000. Online processRegistration can be done online at http://petlicense.gov.in/pet-license/citizen-form. Before registering a pet dog, it must be vaccinated and a fitness certificate must be obtained from a doctor which must be submitted online, said the mayor. Failure to provide information about a rabid dog will lead to a fine of ₹2,000.As per a rough estimate, there are around 20,000 pet dogs in the city but none of them are registered, and thus kept without rules and regulations. Pet registration not just helps ensure the safety and well-being of a domesticated animal but also regulates how it interacts with the society and vice-versa. In November 2019, a Mohali court had awarded six-month jail to a woman found guilty of negligence after her pet dog bit a neighbour. Every year, around 2,000 dog bite cases are reported at the civil hospital in Phase 6, Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-begins-registration-of-pet-dogs-101637091871818.html
17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: Jobless ETT teachers marching to CM’s house cane-charged||Members of unemployed ETT teachers, who are protesting for the past one month over long-pending demands, on Tuesday tried to enter Chandigarh from the YPS roundabout in Mohali, to gherao chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s residence. However, they were stopped by the Chandigarh police at the Mohali-Chandigarh border on Tuesday. A heavy police force was present at the border and there was a mild lathi-charge on the protesters. Holding a state-level protest, the unemployed ETT teachers gathered at the Dussehra ground near Amb Sahib Gurdwara, Phase-8, Mohali. The teachers had been protesting for the past 27 days at Desumajra village in Kharar where five teachers, including a girl, were holding fast unto death at the overhead water tank. Senior vice-president of the Unemployed ETT Teachers Union Sandeep Saama said the protesting youth were hoping that after becoming the chief minister, Channi would solve their problems on a priority basis. He rued that Channi and others did not take out time to listen to their demands. He said the recruitment of 2364 ETT teachers could be done by sending the file in this regard to the AG, Punjab, but no initiative had been taken. He claimed that the issue was being deliberately delayed and no concrete steps were being taken by the AG, Punjab, to get the stay removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-jobless-ett-teachers-marching-to-cm-s-house-canecharged-101637091870385.html
17-11-2021||Pune||PMC raises commission for capture, slaughter of stray bovines||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to increase its revenue by imposing a 25% commission on the contractor/agency for pig capture and slaughter - up from the current Rs150 to Rs365 per animal captured and slaughtered. The move will help the civic exchequer get 2.5 times what it got earlier in revenue. So, while the civic body earned Rs60 lakh in commission on pig capture and slaughter in the past three years, it will now earn an estimated Rs80 lakh in the next three years. Pigs are seen as a nuisance which is why the civic body has taken such a decision.Dr Abhijeet Mane from the PMC veterinary department, said, “We have increased the PMC’s commission on pig capture and slaughter as these animals breed uncontrollably, leading to unhygienic conditions. The PMC has now increased its commission for every pig from the current Rs150 to Rs365 (25%) as the corporation has set a maximum limit of Rs1,425 for every pig that can be auctioned at a slaughterhouse. We have also mandated that every contractor must have at least 10 workers under him and a vehicle, and must also arrange for police protection if the need arises. The civic body will charge 25% commission and thereby, the civic body’s income is also likely to multiply. As the commission was set at Rs150 per animal, the civic body earned Rs60 lakh in the last three years which we now estimate will go up to Rs80 lakh in the next three years.”The Pollution Control Board (PCB) mandates that only 30 pigs can be slaughtered every day which is why the contractor would be required to supply at least 30 to 35 pigs per day. Dr Mane said that each of the pigs captured would be tagged like all other stray animals so that the same animal is not registered twice. In addition to increased revenue for the civic body, the PMC also aims to create a more hygienic city through various such initiatives. Dr Mane said that while this may not seem like a major problem in city areas, it is a huge problem for those living in rural areas as uncontrolled breeding leads to pigs frequenting garbage collection spots and spreading unhygienic conditions in turn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-raises-commission-for-capture-slaughter-of-stray-bovines-101637091810351.html

But there are some limits as people want to disturb the peace and harmony in state,” the minister said, in a statement after his virtual address from Panipat on launch of crushing operations at a cooperative sugarmill in Shahbad.He said the government is committed to the welfare of farmers and steps are being taken to assist cane-growers of Haryana.He urged farmers to write to him directly if they face any difficulties and assured that their issues will be addressed immediately.“Besides having highest sugarcane advisory prices of ₹362 per quintal and the per day crushing capacity of all 11 cooperative sugarmills being increased to 29,650 from 27,300,” he said, adding, “Loans of ₹3,511 crore and subsidies of ₹371 crore have been given to the mills for since 2014.”High drama was witnessed at the Shahbad sugarmill as a group of farmers associated with the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) threatened to protest any politician or cooperation minister from coming to attend the programme. The farmers objected even virtual inauguration of the crushing by the cooperation minister.They said, in the invitation cards, the administration has announced that deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar will inaugurate crushing operations physically and there was no mention that the minister will also attend the programme, virtually.BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains said late night, they had received invitation cards but there was no mention that the minister will also attend the programme. They decided to protest the virtual inauguration by the minister.He said on call of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, farmers of Haryana do not want leaders of the ruling parties to attend the programmes as they did not take any steps to accept the farmers’ demand or end the agitation.Vijender Chaudhary, managing director of the sugarmill, refuted the allegations that the administration did not disclose that the minister will join the inauguration virtually and said it was decided that the minister will inaugurate the crushing via video conferencing.The MD said the invitation being circulated by farmers was not finalised. In the final invitation, it was mentioned that the minister will inaugurate the crushing. In the card, there is no mention on whether the inauguration will be virtual or physical.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/some-people-misleading-farmers-to-fulfil-their-political-motives-banwari-lal-101637091630039.html
17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Congress candidate was never in bypoll contest: Hooda||Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Tuesday said the Congress candidate for Ellenabad assembly bypoll, Pawan Beniwal did not make enough efforts to stay in the contest.Hooda, who chaired a meeting of the Congress legislature party (CLP), said Beniwal was never in the fray.“Ummidwar chunav hi nahin lada (The candidate didn’t fight the bypoll). This is my estimation,” Hooda said, terming it one of the factors among others for the loss.Beniwal had finished a poor third polling about 20,900 votes in the bypoll and lost his security deposit. The Congress vote share declined by 9.7% in the bypoll as compared to the 2019 general elections; while the BJP candidate got 9.1% more votes than in the 2019 polls.Hooda said winning and losing is a part of the game. “We won the Baroda assembly bypoll handsomely. The party, however, needs to look into the causes of drubbing in Ellenabad,” he said.Responding to a query regarding a show-cause notice issued by state Congress chief Kumari Selja to his loyalist, Bharat Singh Beniwal for “indulging in anti-party activities” during the bypoll and predicting that the Congress candidate will finish third in the bypoll, the former chief minister said Bharat had only made an estimation.Addressing the media, Hooda asked the BJP-JJP government in state to revoke its order pertaining to handing over recruitments in universities to the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) and the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC).“The coalition government is playing with the autonomy of universities by interfering in their recruitments. And by doing this, the government is violating the guidelines of the UGC and also the Centre’s new education policy.Referring to the UGC rules and the guidelines of the new education policy, Hooda said every university already has suitable rules and committees for recruitment.“Even in the last assembly session, CM Manohar Lal Khattar had assured the House that the recruitment of government universities will not be done through HSSC and HPSC. Despite this, the government is interfering in functioning of autonomous institutions. This will adversely affect their work and the level of education. Already the ranking of universities in Haryana is continuously falling. Only one university of Haryana is included in the top 100 universities,” he said.Hooda said posts of about 34,000 teachers are lying vacant in government schools in state and headmasters are not appointed in 50% schools. Instead of paying attention to this, the government is engaged in demolishing the education structure, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-candidate-was-never-in-bypoll-contest-hooda-101637091270698.html

The order comes after Pune-based non-profit Parivartan, civic activist Maruti Bhapkar, and others filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay high court, challenging the decision of the state government and state election commission to allow multi-member wards in the upcoming civic elections. The PIL was admitted after which the court asked the state government to clarify its decision.Parivartan and other organisations are of the view that there should only be single-member wards as citizens can then hold these members responsible for development works. In case of multi-member wards, the elected members tend to pass the buck instead of taking responsibility and addressing the problems. Besides, there is a lack of unity among these members, according to civic activists||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hc-directs-state-to-clarify-decision-on-multi-member-wards-for-civic-polls-101637091151229.html

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Dera Baba Nanak erupts in joy over reopening of Kartarpur corridor||The people of Dera Baba Nanak town in Gurdaspur are jubilant with the Centre announcing reopening of Kartarpur corridor after 20 months, on the occasion of Parkash Purb of Guru Nanak.The corridor, which connects the historic town of Dera Baba Nanak to Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara which falls in Narowal district of Pakistan, was inaugurated on November 9, 2019, to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. The corridor was closed in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak.The residents of Dera Baba Nanak said with the reopening of the corridor not only the Sikh sangat’s devotional aspirations will be fulfilled, the decision will also boost the economy of the border town. They have also demanded from the Centre a relaxation in the process of applying for visiting Guru Nanak’s final resting place in the neighbouring country.In a series of tweets, Union home minister Amit Shah said reopening the Kartarpur Corridor will benefit a large number of Sikh pilgrims. “This decision reflects the immense reverence of the Modi government towards Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji and our Sikh community. The nation is all set to celebrate the Prakash Utsav of Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji on November 19, and I am sure PM Narendra Modi government’s decision to reopen the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor will further boost the joy and happiness across the country,” the home minister tweeted.The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) leaders in Punjab met President Ram Nath Kovind and Amit Shah on Monday, requesting that the corridor be reopened.“We can’t express our happiness. It’s like we have got everything. The Center’s decision, though late, but is at a right time,” said Baba Sukhdeep Singh, who claims to be the 17thdescendant of Guru Nanak.He said, “There has been a marriage-like atmosphere in Dera Baba Nanak since the Centre’s announcement. The decision has also brought jubilation among the small and medium traders of the town. When the corridor was opened last year, the pilgrims used to purchase various items, including fresh vegetables and fruits, from the town market for Langar at Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib. The market of the town will flourish and the economy will flourish.”He said, “As per media reports, only 250 pilgrims will be allowed in a jatha that will leave for Kartarpur Gurdwara to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on November 18 and 19. The number of pilgrims should be increased to 5,000, so that everyone can pay obeisance. The government should also ease the steps for applying for the pilgrimage. Only 62,000 people had visited the Gurdwara Kartarpur when the corridor was opened. Many people don’t know how to apply.”Dera Baba Nanak municipal council president Parmeet Singh Bedi said, “There have been the same feelings of happiness among the people which were there when the corridor was inaugurated nearly two years ago. The decision will also bring new avenues for the traders. The town’s people have demanded that the corridor should never be closed.”Gurkirpal Singh, a resident of the town, said, “Our joy knows no bounds. Around 3,000-5,000 people have been visiting Dera Baba Nanak daily to have a glimpse of the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara using a binocular. We have one more demand. The Land Port Authority of India (LPAI) had promised to construct Darshan Asthal (a raised platform to have a glimpse of the Kartapur Sahib gurudwara with the use of binoculars) at the border. The platform should be constructed immediately for all those who don’t have their passports and can’t cross the corridor.”Dera Baba Nanak sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Harpreet Singh said the administration was ready to successfully implement all the decisions of the government.Preparations on for first jatha’s visit tomorrowThe district administration of Gurdaspur has been on toes for making preparations for the visit of first jatha to Kartarpur Sahib.Punjab chief minister (CM) Charanjit Singh Channi and other members of his cabinet will be the part of the first jatha on November 18.Gurdaspur deputy commissioner (DC) Mohammad Ishfaq said the Chief Minister’s Office has sent a list of likely pilgrims to government of India for approval. “The number of pilgrims can be anywhere between 30 and 200. This will be a special delegation and it will be sent with the prior approval of the government of both the countries.”Normally, it takes nearly 15 days for a pilgrim to get approval from governments of India and Pakistan to visit the final resting place of Guru Nanak via the corridor.Sources said the CM wants the leaders of some other parties to be part of the delegation, but there was no official confirmation.Meanwhile, the officials of the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI) and the Border Security Force (BSF) held a meeting at the integrated check post (ICP) at Dera Baba Nanak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dera-baba-nanak-erupts-in-joy-over-reopening-of-kartarpur-corridor-ahead-of-gurpurb-101637090853424.html

If the state government and general body have given permission, why is the ruling party failing to execute the decision,” president of the Sena city unit, Sanjay More, said.Recently, ex-servicemen barged into the PMC office and criticised it for not executing the waiver despite having the permission of the state government and general body of the corporation. Instead of implementing the waiver, the PMC is asking ex-servicemen to first share photographs, bank details, identity proofs and other documents. There are around 20,000 ex-servicemen in the city awaiting benefits under the scheme. According to ex-soldiers, while they have received cards from the district Sainik Welfare office, the PMC is refusing to accept these cards and instead asking for various documents as proof.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shiv-sena-agitates-says-bjp-delaying-property-tax-waiver-for-exservicemen-101637090790481.html
17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu resumes charge as Punjab Congress chief||Chandigarh Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, who on Tuesday resumed charge 10 days after withdrawing his resignation, said that winnability will be the only criteria for ticket allotment in the upcoming 2022 state polls. Talking to the mediapersons, he said that a roadmap was ready and party’s organisational setup in state will be out within 10 days. “The list of district presidents and party spokespersons will be announced soon,” he said. Party’s state affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi accompanied Sidhu to the party office. Sidhu had resigned from the party’s top post on September 28, opposing appointment of APS Deol as advocate general, after Charanjit Singh Channi took over as the state CM, for the reasons that he had secured blanket bail for Punjab’s ex-DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, an accused in the sacrilege case. He had also opposed appointment of IPS Sahota as DGP, for giving clean chit to some key accused in the sacrilege case when he was heading a special investigation team (SIT) in 2015. After assurance by the state government for replacement of both the officers. Sidhu, on November 5 had announced to withdraw his resignation with the condition that both Deol and Sahota would be replaced. The appointment of new AG was discussed in Tuesday’s meeting and the all the ministers gave powers to the CM for choosing new incumbent. A panel for a new DGP has been sent to the Union home ministry for approval. Answering a query from the media, sate Congress head reiterated that the best option to regulate sand trade was to constitute a state-owned corporation, quoting the example of Telangana. Recently Channi had announced to sell sand at rate of ₹5.5 per cubic feet. In reply to another question from media, Sidhu said the party’s organisation and the government were united and the special session of Vidhan Sabha last week was the evidence. Sidhu reiterated that there was need to increase tax recovery and fill the state’s coffers because welfare schemes can’t be run by taking debts. He again pitched for raising the state’s income for spending on development works rather than depending upon the debt. “Punjab is the most indebted state in the country. Today, Goa’s capital expenditure per person is ₹14,000 while Haryana’s is ₹6,000 and the national average is ₹3,500. But Punjab spends only ₹870,” he said. On being questioned as to who would contest from Patiala assembly segment, Sidhu said the candidate will be chosen as it will be done for the rest of the constituencies. Former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, whom Channi replaced on September 20, represents the constituency as MLA. ‘Opening of Kartarpur corridor a welcome step’ Welcoming opening of Kartarpur corridor for which an announcement was made by the Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday, Sidhu said it’s a priceless gift to the humanity and especially the Sikhs. “I praise the government who opened it, because some things are above politics,” he said. Referring to state government’s proposal to construct a ‘Darshan Sthal’ — a 60-metre raised platform — Sidhu said the work should be completed soon. Every citizen is a CM face: Chaudhary To a question on party’s chief ministerial face, party’s state in-charge Harish Chaudhary said that every citizen of the state is the CM face. Chaudhary said the party’s state unit under the leadership of Navjot Sidhu and the state government under chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi will take Punjab forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-joins-punjab-cong-chief-office-says-winnability-will-decide-tickets-for-2022-polls-101637090550498.html
17-11-2021||Chandigarh||HC notice to Punjab on CBI probe plea into death of dera follower||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought response from the Punjab government and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the plea from wife of Dera Sacha Sauda follower Mohinder Pal Singh Bittu, who was murdered in the Nabha jail. The high court bench of justice Raj Mohan Singh has sought response by December 2 and also asked to bring on record probe report. The plea by Santosh Kumari alleges that senior Punjab Police officers were involved in the conspiracy that was not probed by the investigation agencies. The plea seeks a CBI investigation into the case. Bittu, who was booked in the 2015 sacrilege cases and arrested three years later, was killed by two inmates, Maninder Singh and Gursewak Singh, both serving life terms for murder, on June 22, 2019, with iron rods. On September 5 that year, the police had filed a chargesheet against four persons, including the attackers. Thereafter, a Patiala court framed charges against them and the trial is underway. The plea also seeks stay on the trial proceedings. The plea claims Bittu was brutally killed in a larger conspiracy using judicial tools when he was lodged in the Nabha jail and the murder was committed in collusion with the police and politicians who were named by Bittu in the note. “Police officers mentioned in the note subjected my husband to third-degree torture to pressurise him to confess to his complicity in the sacrilege episode. He was falsely implicated in a case of the theft of bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib as part of a deep-rooted conspiracy due to political pressure,” the plea says, adding that since many senior police officers of the state are “involved”, it would be in the interest of justice that further investigation be conducted by the CBI, the plea demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-sacrilege-hc-notice-to-punjab-on-cbi-probe-plea-into-death-of-dera-follower-101637090490084.html

He said both India and Japan have developed systems of sustainable production instead of bulk production of food grains.“The United Nations has also set sustainable development goals (SDGs) which were to be achieved by 2030. HP has institutionalised SDGs through budgetary support and we look forward to meeting these goals in a record time,” he added.Agriculture minister Virender Kanwar said due to the hilly topography, the area suitable for cultivation was less, thus greater stress must be laid on crop diversification to increase farmers income.He said the new phase of the HPCDP would have the JICA loan component of ₹ 807.3 crore while the state’s share would be ₹203.3 crore.Chief representative of JICA-India Saito Mitsunori said the project is aimed at sustainable and climate resilient agriculture development and it also has a component of technical solution.Secretary agriculture Ajay Kumar Sharma said the targeted rise in gross income per hectare is expected to be ₹2.5 lakh at the end of the project from the existing ₹55,000 per hectare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jai-ram-launches-phase-2-of-crop-diversification-project-in-himachal-101637090371675.html

In 2020, total deaths recorded in Haryana rose to 2,12,214 (23,304 more deaths in 2020 than 2019).In 2020, the number of registered deaths in comparison to 2019 rose in every district, but in Rohtak, 15,940 deaths were recorded in 2019 and 15,061 in 2020.Till September this year, the number of deaths (due to any cause, including Covid-19) registered in Haryana has already reached 1,97,962 (1,01,456 in rural areas and 96,506 in urban). And, of the total deaths till September this year, 1,21,056 are males and 76,906 females.The data received under the RTI Act doesn’t reveal the cause of death and the cause of these deaths are multiple, including Covid-19.According to deputy director (health services) Dr PK Singh, a higher number of deaths have been registered in rural areas so far this year in Haryana. “The death is registered at the place where it took place and the cause of death is not disclosed on the death registration portal,” Dr Singh said.As per the health bulletin data, almost 50% of the total deaths in Haryana due to coronavirus had taken place in May, the deadliest month ever since the Wuhan virus was detected in Haryana last year in February.In April, Haryana had recorded the second highest 1,061 fatalities due to Covid-19. On the other hand, till May 31, 2020, the death toll in Haryana due to Covid-19 was 20 and it began increasing in following months with the virus claiming 16 lives in June, 639 in November and 477 in December.Rural vs urbanA health department functionary said more deaths registered during the second year of the pandemic in rural areas points towards people not going to urban health institutions due to Covid.“Such patients of rural areas who needed regular treatment/healthcare succumbed to the diseases (other than Covid) in their homes or in health institutions in their vicinity,” the official said.In January this year, 17,929 deaths were registered across state, which included 9,397 in rural areas and 8,532 in urban. February saw 16,985 deaths (8,929 rural and 8056 urban), March recorded 15,563 deaths (7,560 rural and 8,003 urban), and the number rose to 19,157 (9,130 rural and 10,027 urban) in April.In May, when the pandemic was causing havoc, Haryana registered total 45,587 deaths (21,683 rural and 23,904 urban), the number of deaths recorded came down to 30,750 (17,231 rural and 13,519 urban) in June.In July, August and September, more deaths were recorded in rural areas even as during these three months 26% of the total deaths in nine months were registered.In an indication of Covid-19 increasing the number of deaths, in May, Ambala recorded 1,669 deaths, Bhiwani (1,988), Faridabad (3,891), Gurugram (3,562), Hisar (4,180), Jhajjar (2,682), Jind (2,158), Rohtak (2,664), Sirsa (2,080), Sonepat ( 2,927), and Karnal (1,969).“The health institutions were unable to admit/treat patients suffering from ailments other than Covid-19. One thing is clear that rural area patients could not come to the urban health institutions due to the pandemic. This appears to be one of the reasons behind rural areas recording deaths higher than urban belts this year,” a health official said, refusing to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/this-year-till-september-rural-haryana-witnessed-more-deaths-than-urban-areas-101637090071346.html

17-11-2021||Chandigarh||SC dismisses plea challenging Dinkar Gupta’s appointment as Punjab DGP||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the petitions filed by DGPs Sidharth Chattopadhyaya and Mohd Mustafa (now retired) challenging the appointment of 1987-batch Indian Police Service officer Dinkar Gupta as the Punjab Police chief by the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government in 2019. The development is seen as a setback for Chattopadhaya, considered a frontrunner for the post of Punjab DGP, the appointment of which is expected in the next few days. The camp led by Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has been strongly backing Chattopadhyaya’s candidature for the post. It was under the Sidhu faction’s pressure that Chattopadhaya was appointed chief director, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, Punjab, last month. The judgment pronounced by Justice L Nageswara Rao dismissed the appeals filed by Chattopadhyay and Mustafa. “The appeals are dismissed in terms of the signed reportable judgment. Pending application(s) if any shall stand disposed of,” reads the three -member bench also comprising Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice BR Gavai. The court had reserved judgment in the case on September 15. Gupta had superseded five officers Dinkar Gupta was appointed the Punjab director general of police (DGP) in 2019. Both Mustafa, a 1985-batch IPS officer, and Chattopadhyaya, 1986-batch IPS officer, had challenged Gupta’s appointment with claims that the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) ignored seniority while sending the panel of officers to the state government and made tailor-made rules to include Gupta in the panel sent to it by it to the Punjab government. Gupta had superseded five senior officers, including Mustafa and Chattopadhyaya. After both the officers challenged the appointment in the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), this court had quashed Gupta’a appointment. However, the Punjab and Haryana high court in January 2020 stayed the CAT orders. The UPSC is said to have taken a strong stand while including Gupta’s name, citing two factors, the length and range of service in the previous 10 years of service at the time of the names were considered for the post. Gupta was removed as DGP after change in dispensation in the Congress government with Charanjit Singh Channi replacing Amarinder as the chief minister. A 1988-batch IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota is holding the additional charge of the DGP every since Gupta was posted chairman of the Punjab Police Housing Corporation. Even as the detailed judgment in the case has still not been uploaded on the website of the apex court, it is bound to have bearing on the selection of the new DGP. The Channi-led state government has already sent panel of nine officers to the UPSC for the appointment of the new DGP on September 30 with Chattopadhyaya the senior-most in the panel. “As in the pleas police officers also opposed the contention of the empanelment committee, which had sent a report to the UPSC, saying the officers lacked experience in core policing areas, it would be interesting to see what stand the UPSC takes to successfully defend Chattopadhaya’s pleas,” a senior home department functionary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-dismisses-plea-challenging-dinkar-gupta-s-appointment-as-punjab-dgp-101637089831276.html
17-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin man jailed for life for stabbing wife to death in UK||An Indian-origin man has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a UK court after being convicted of murder by a unanimous jury for stabbing his wife to death in Milton Keynes area of south-east England.Anil Gill, 47, was arrested on suspicion of the murder of 43-year-old Ranjit Gill by Thames Valley Police after being called to the couple’s home in January this year by the suspect.Officers discovered Ranjit lying wrapped in a duvet and bin bags in the garage of the property with significant injuries and it was soon obvious that she had been deceased for some time. A post-mortem examination determined that Ranjit had died as a result of multiple stab wounds.In February, Anil was charged with one count of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment at Luton Crown Court on Friday. He must serve a minimum of 22 years behind bars before being eligible for parole.“The only sentence for murder is life imprisonment,” said detective inspector Nicola Douglas of Thames Valley Police’s Major Crime Unit – the senior investigation officer in the case, who described the murder as “ruthless and cold-blooded”.“I am satisfied the minimum term to be served of 22 years reflects the severity of this awful crime. I would like to again pay tribute and thank the family of Ranjit who have shown such dignity in the most terrible of circumstances,” she said.According to Thames Valley Police, throughout the trial Anil claimed that he was not guilty of murder, but admitted to manslaughter, accepting he had unlawfully killed Ranjit. Anil denied he had intended to cause her serious harm and also put forward the partial defence of loss of control because of things he said Ranjit had said and done to him.The court heard that Anil stabbed his wife at least 18 times. He then spent several hours cleaning up the scene, wrapping Ranjit’s body in bin bags and moving her to the garage, before showering and going to bed. Later that day is when he called the police to say what he had done, while making excuses and blaming his dead wife for his actions.“No one should have to suffer domestic abuse and we would encourage anyone who is being abused to please report it.” Ranjit’s brother Raj Sagoo spoke of the void left behind in the family’s life since the death of his sister.Ranjit’s sisters Kamel Aujla, Tejinder McCann, Harminder Sahni and niece Monica Aujla also paid tribute to a “beautiful, amazing” person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjaborigin-man-jailed-for-life-for-stabbing-wife-to-death-in-uk-101637089651179.html

According to Khan, he closed the showroom at 11pm and returned home -- around 100 meters away from the showroom.“There is a gym in the building where my showroom is. Next morning, the gym instructor reached there at 5am and informed me that the showroom’s shutter was damaged. I reached there immediately and found that all the cellphones in my showroom had been stolen,” Khan said.Thieves had also damaged the CCTV cameras there, and taken away the DVR.Haris Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that a case was registered against the suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 380 (burglary) and 457 (house-trespass) at the local police station on November 5.“A police team identified the suspects’ car after scanning multiple CCTV footage in the neighbourhood where the incident took place. They were also seen in camera footage at a toll plaza on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, as they were travelling to Haryana,” Chander said.Police received a tip about the movement of the suspects near Tilapta roundabout in Greater Noida, Chander said on Tuesday. “A police team reached the spot and made the suspects stop their car. During a search, the police team recovered 177 stolen smart cellphones worth ₹30 lakh, ₹6,000 cash, a car, three fake registration number plates; two each iron rods, screw drivers and live cartridges; and one each LCD, DVR, fake insurance certificate, pollution under control (PUC) certificate, countrymade gun and master key to break locks from their possession,” he said.The suspects -- identified as Rashid (goes by first name), 25, Irfan Mohammad, 26, Sohail, 24, Shabir alias Gidad, 24, Hakimuddin alias Hakku, 23 -- all residents of Nuh, Mewat in Haryana.During investigation, the suspects revealed that they had targeted to steal valuables from the showroom randomly.Initially, the shop owner had informed the police that nearly 600 smartphones worth ₹2 crore were stolen from the showroom, however, following an audit later, he said that 364 phones worth ₹60 lakh were stolen there. “These smartphones were from authorised distributors and we have all the documents with us. We also had some cellphones from local dealers, and we do not have the exact count of those... We welcome the police investigation and swift arrest. We got to know that the cellphones recovered during the search are in the low-price range. Some costly cellphones stolen from the showroom have not been recovered yet,” Khan said.The suspects revealed during interrogation that they had stolen 308 cellphones in total. “They have sold some cellphones... Two more persons are also involved in the gang, and police are conducting searches to arrest them and recover the remaining smartphones at the earliest,” Chander said, adding that the suspects were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/5-held-for-stealing-over-300-cellphones-worth-60l-from-greater-noida-showroom-101637089595786.html

The NHAI officials said the agency for building the connecting highway has been selected and a letter of acceptance has also been issued for the work, which is estimated to cost about ₹309 crore. The road is expected to be ready in two years, the NHAI said.The 60km DME connects Delhi to Meerut, while the 62km NH-235, which was made operational last year, connects Meerut with Hapur and Bulandshahr. The NHAI officials said the link road will start about eight kilometres before the Kashi toll plaza (under phase 4 of the DME) in Meerut and this will connect further to NH-235 near the Meerut-Hapur Road. The agency for the work has been selected and, after completion of some document formalities, it is likely that the work will start from December or January 2022,” said Arvind Kumar, deputy general manager, NHAI. “Both sides of the 14.6km link road will be joined by loops which will help ease the flow of traffic between the DME and NH-235,” he further said. Officials also said the new link will be four-laned and is likely to be ready in two years. “Commuters will further benefit as there is a plan to link DME to the proposed Ganga Expressway, six-lane access-controlled expressway that has been proposed to connect Meerut and Prayagraj. In this regard, we have written to the state government to build another 3km link road — the 14.6km link will connect the DME to NH-235 and the 3km extension branch of the road will further connect to the Ganga Expressway. Essentially, this will link the two expressways,” said another officer from NHAI, asking not to be named. The officials said once the plans are finalised, commuters of DME and NH-235 will be able to get expressway connectivity to areas such as Kanpur and Prayagraj over a distance of about 1,020km and will considerably improve connectivity between western and eastern Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-work-on-road-to-link-delhi-meerut-expressway-and-nh-235-to-start-soon-101637089594730.html

In fact, the cases have almost halved in the second week of November, compared to the first week. Between November 1 and 8, 83 fresh cases of dengue were reported, while only 44 fresh cases were reported between November 9 and 15.” Sharma, however, added that the health department in Gautam Budh Nagar is still on the alert, and has been conducting intensive fogging drives in all dengue hotspot areas.Following the death of a 44-year-old dengue patient, the toll from the disease in the district became two on November 13. The first death was reported on October 19 — a 14-year-old boy died of the vector-borne illness.Medical experts, meanwhile, said the total number of critical dengue patients has also increased in the district this year, as compared to previous years.“This time, more dengue patients are suffering from high-grade fever. There are also more cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, than in previous years. In such critical cases, the platelet count of a patient deteriorates rapidly and the infection also starts diminishing red blood cells of the person,” said Dr Yatendra Singh, medical superintendent of Bhangel community health centre (CHC), Gautam Budh Nagar.At present, dengue tests are being conducted at District Hospital, Post Graduate Institute of Child Health, and Government Institute of Medical Sciences in Greater Noida, said the officials.The district health department has been testing at least 300 samples of suspected dengue cases daily, at the sentinel lab in the district hospital in Sector 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dengue-tally-reaches-587-in-gautam-budh-nagar-but-cases-dipping-say-officials-101637089591296.html

17-11-2021||Noida||Pollution woes: UPSRTC may get more CNG buses for Ghaziabad’s Kaushambi ISBT||The Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) is working on a proposal to purchase 130 new CNG buses and officials said anything between 50 and 100 are likely to be given to the interstate bus terminal (ISBT) in Kaushambi, Ghaziabad. The Kaushambi township has already been identified as a pollution hot spot by the UPPCB and residents are pursuing court cases against agencies for their failure to tackle different local sources of pollution affecting their area. Of the 500-odd buses operating from the ISBT, only 125 are CNG-based currently, while the others are running on diesel. Officials of UPSRTC said a proposal to purchase 130 new CNG buses is under consideration at the headquarters and it is likely that the ISBT may get a major share of these buses. “Earlier (in October), we demanded 200 CNG buses, but there is already a proposal to purchase 130 CNG buses which is being considered by the UPSRTC headquarters. So, we will try to procure anything between 50 to 100 of these buses for our ISBT. They will help reduce pollution in Kaushambi. There is another proposal for purchase of 1,000 diesel buses which will be BSVI compliant (more fuel efficient and less polluting) — at present, we are operating BSIV compliant buses,” said AK Singh, regional manager, UPSRTC. “Of these diesel buses, it is likely that the ISBT may get about 100-150 buses. They will be compliant to standards and have much better technology. We are focussing on reducing pollution and congestion in the area and we have also scaled down operations of buses to about 500 at present as against 750 earlier. During the Covid period we operated 1,700 buses on a daily basis,” Singh said. The Kaushambi township is located opposite the ISBT with barely a distance of about 50 metres between them. The presence of the ISBT and the resultant congestion lead to frequent pollution spikes in the locality. The Kaushambi Apartments RWA (Karwa) had challenged the operations of diesel buses in a petition filed in 2015 before the National Green Tribunal. “There have been directions from the tribunal to deploy CNG buses in Kaushambi as diesel buses emanate pollutants which affect our township. We also moved the Supreme Court last year against the different pollution sources affecting our township. We want diesel buses operating from the ISBT removed and we will continue our fight against pollution,” said VK Mittal, president, Karwa. The township comprises 22 high-rises and is also surrounded by Delhi’s Anand Vihar ISBT, the Ghazipur landfill site and the Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area — all these entities together making Kaushambi a pollution hot spot. In their winter action plan chalked out in October, the UP Pollution Control Board had identified Kaushambi as one of the ten hot spots in Ghaziabad city while the other nine were Sahibabad, Raj Nagar Extension, Delhi-Meerut Road, Loni, Bhopra-Delhi border, south side of GT Road, Sanjay Nagar, Vasundhara, and Siddharth Vihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pollution-woes-upsrtc-may-get-more-cng-buses-for-ghaziabad-s-kaushambi-isbt-101637089534547.html
17-11-2021||Noida||2 construction workers die after basement wall of a building collapses in Noida||Two labourers died after the basement wall of a four-storey building in Noida Sector 2 collapsed on Monday evening.The victims -- identified as Atul Das, 45, and Anil Mukhiya, 30, -- who were natives of Durgapur in West Bengal and Darbhanga in Bihar, respectively, lived in Barola village in Noida. The duo was engaged in some construction work to prevent dampness in the building, when the incident took place.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said that the incident took place at Block A in Sector 2 -- under the jurisdiction of Sector 20 police station -- at 8pm on Monday. “There is a four-storey building in which three workers were engaged in construction work in the basement. The basement wall suddenly collapsed, in which two workers were injured,” Singh said.Security guards of the building raised an alarm, and informed the police about the incident. The two injured workers were taken to the district hospital where doctors declared them dead.Das is survived by his 40-year-old wife Jatotsna (goes by first name), and two sons -- Anant Das, 19, and Sushant Das, 17. They live in a rented accommodation in Noida.Anant said that his mother had spoken to his father over the cellphone at 6pm on Monday. “My father had said that he was at the construction site, and the contractor had made him stay back for some overtime construction work, and that he would be late to return home,” he said.Police called Anant at 8:30pm on Monday and asked him to reach the district hospital. “I found my father dead at the hospital. He had suffered injuries in his head and abdomen after the wall collapsed on him,” Anant added.Mukhiya’s cousin Ravindra Kumar, 32, said that the victim and his 28-year-old wife, Dropadi, lived in a rented accommodation in Noida. “Mukhiya’s wife is pregnant... She is inconsolable after the incident took place. We demand that the police take strict action against the accused,” he said.The four-storey building titled ‘Landmark’ houses some Information Technology (IT) firms and an event management company.Rakesh Verma, caretaker of the building, said that the property owner was in the United States at the time of the incident. “We wanted to fix the damp in the building wall, and so, we hired a contractor -- Rajan -- who engaged some workers to fix the damp. The workers have been working here for nearly a month,” Verma said, adding that the management is in talks with the kin of the victims to provide them a due compensation.Singh, meanwhile, said that the contractor and a third worker, yet to be identified, had fled the spot after the wall collapsed, instead of helping the victims. “We will register a case of death due to negligence against the duo and arrest them,” he said, adding that the victims’ family has not filed a written complaint against anyone yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/2-construction-workers-die-after-basement-wall-of-a-building-collapses-in-noida-101637089532360.html
17-11-2021||Noida||UPPCB’s survey to identify bad roads in Ghaziabad; to penalise erring agencies||With the extended deadline for completing road repair works ending on November 15, the officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said on Tuesday that they have started a survey to identify the stretches where work is pending and to levy an environment compensation cost (ECC) from the errant agencies. The Ghaziabad city has been reeling under severe air pollution with the daily air quality index (AQI), recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), oscillating between “very poor” and “severe” categories since October 31. The city on Tuesday recorded an AQI of 356 while neighbouring Greater Noida and Noida recorded an AQI of 361 and 397, respectively, all figures falling in the “very poor” category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The officials of the UPPCB said bad roads also contribute to pollution and were to be repaired by November 15. “As the extended deadline — the original one was October 31 — has also expired, we have started a survey to identify the bad roads that are left to be repaired and levy an ECC from the errant agencies. The sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management has also directed us to identify dusty roads,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB. When Hindustan Times made a cursory tour of the city, the team found bad stretches in Govindpuram, Patel Nagar 2, GT Road, Vijay Nagar link road, and BS Road industrial area, among others. The roads in all these parts are maintained by different agencies. The sub-committee, in its latest directions, issued on November 13, has reiterated that states and agencies must increase the frequency of mechanised road cleaning and sprinkling of water, besides identification of road stretches having high dust generation. “Bad road patches are a common feature in Ghaziabad and they cause high levels of dust emission, besides leading to snarls and posing a risk to commuters. Such patches lead to an increase in PM10 pollutant and also indirectly cause an increase in PM2.5 level — they cause snarls which lead to more vehicular emissions. The repair work should have been taken up on war footing before the start of the winter,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less and is inhalable into the lungs. PM2.5 is finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream.The officials of agencies such as the Ghaziabad municipal corporation and public works department (PWD) said they have completed a majority of the work, but some portions remain. “We have completed 98.2% of repair work but the work of resurfacing roads is left and it is estimated that about 20 to 22 roads are yet to be resurfaced. Since there is a ban on the operation of hot mix plants at present, we are unable to complete the work. Further, the extended monsoon and festival season also hampered the work progress,” said NK Chaudhary, chief engineer, Ghaziabad municipal corporation. The sub-committee in their latest directions had also called for the closure of all hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR. The officials of the PWD also said they have completed about 80% of the work on the roads maintained by them and the remaining work is being held up by the ban on hot mix plants. “We need some more days to complete the work as there is a ban on hot mix plants and these works can be taken up only when the ban is lifted. We have also come to know that the deadline of November 15 is likely to be extended by another 15 days. But we are waiting for the written orders from the state officials. There were a lot of factors which affected the works and the UPPCB should consider these before levying any fine from us,” said Vimal Kumar, executive engineer, PWD. On November 9, the pollution control board had taken cognisance of the under-construction CISF Road in Indirapuram and levied a cost of ₹25 lakh on UP Jal Nigam for not completing the work, while giving the agency the liberty to recover the cost from its contractor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/uppcbs-survey-to-identify-bad-roads-in-ghaziabad-to-penalise-erring-agencies-101637089529923.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||Pollution: Delhi govt to hire 1,000 buses to augment DTC fleet||The Delhi government will hire 1,000 private buses to augment the public transport fleet and curtail the use of private vehicles so as to reduce vehicular pollution and improve the city’s air quality, which has remained “very poor” or “hazardous” since Diwali (November 4).Transport minister Kailash Gahlot held a meeting on Tuesday with private transporters to get them on board with the plan. “In order to curb vehicular pollution, the people of Delhi are requested to shift from personal vehicles to public transport. With a view to augment public transport, the Delhi government is in the process of hiring around 1,000 private buses for a period of one month,” he said after the meeting. The air quality in Delhi went back to the severe zone after remaining in the very poor zone for two days. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings, the average air quality index of Delhi on Tuesday was 403, in the severe zone. On Monday, the AQI was 353, categorised as very poor. According to the affidavit submitted by the Centre before the Supreme Court on Monday, 28% of the city’s PM2.5 levels during winters is contributed by the transport sector in Delhi. The contribution of vehicles to the PM10 level is around 24%, the affidavit said. Delhi has more than 10 million registered vehicles and thousands more enter or pass through the national capital every day. Compared to that, the city has only about 6,700 buses (Delhi Transport Corporation-run buses and privately operated orange cluster buses). PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less and is inhalable into the lungs. PM2.5 is finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream, according to health experts.Gahlot also announced that owing to the improved Covid-19 situation and to control pollution from private vehicles, the government has moved a proposal before the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to allow standing passengers on buses and the Delhi Metro. “We have requested the DDMA to modify the current order prohibiting the same. I request all Delhi residents to cooperate and shift to public transport,” he said. When allowed to operate at full capacity, including standing passengers, the DTC and cluster buses together carry about 4.2 million people every day, while the Delhi Metro carries about 2.3 million passengers, government officials in the know of the matter said.The Delhi government has hired private buses in the past as well, to augment public transport during the odd-even car rationing scheme in November 2019 to combat pollution. That time, the government set a target of hiring 2,000 such buses which were a mix of school buses and all-india permit tourist buses. However, even then, it could hire only about 1,000 buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollutiondelhi-govt-to-hire-1-000-buses-to-augment-dtcfleet-101637089471769.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Two snatchers arrested after brief encounter with police||Two men who allegedly committed a string of snatchings and robberies in the national capital were arrested after a brief encounter with the police early Tuesday.Police identified the suspects as Manish Poddar (25) and Nirala (24). Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Rohini, Pranav Tayal said a team from the KN Katju Marg police station was formed to nab the two men. The team was deployed near KNK Marg when they came that way on a motorcycle that had no rear number plate, he said.“On Monday, around 7.30pm, a trap was laid and finally around 1am, Poddar and Nirala came riding that way.

17-11-2021||Delhi||Govt aims to bring Delhi’s per capita income on par with Singapore’s: Sisodia||The Delhi government’s aim is to raise the per capita income of Delhi to be on a par with that of Singapore by the year 2047, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday, while taking part in a virtual meeting chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. He said Delhi’s growth rate has reached 11-12% in the last six years and the per capita income is three times the national average. Tuesday’s meeting was aimed at improving the country’s economy and accelerating the pace of development in states, officials in the know of the matter said.“Delhi’s contribution to the country’s GDP is 4.4% despite having only 1.49% of the country’s population. The service sector accounts for 85% of Delhi’s gross domestic product (GDP). The Kejriwal government’s special focus is on health, education and environment. But, the lack of land with the Delhi government is the biggest challenge in the all-round development of the city. We expect cooperation from the central government on this,” Sisodia said.On the infrastructure front, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government said it is redesigning 540km of roads in Delhi, at a cost of ₹11,000 crore. “The Delhi government is currently funding this project with its own funds, but it expects the Centre to contribute as well. People from all over the world visit Delhi, India’s capital, and they should have a positive impression of the country after seeing the roads here,” he said.Sisodia also apprised the Union finance minister of the slew of measures his government has taken, including implementation of the Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy, to tackle rising pollution. He observed that e-vehicles are adopted in such large numbers in developed countries because these countries also invest in setting up a large number of charging stations and necessary infrastructure. He said his government also intends to make Delhi the country’s e-vehicle capital.“The Delhi government requires the Centre and Delhi development Authority (DDA)’s cooperation in this direction because the DDA owns the majority of land in Delhi. The Delhi government has purchased 1,000 e-buses in order to reduce pollution. In the coming days, the Delhi government intends to purchase 4,000-5,000 more e-buses, for which the central government will be required to cooperate,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-aims-to-bring-delhi-s-per-capita-income-on-par-with-singaporessisodia-101637089170481.html

Following the noble work being by the Robinhood Army for the past two years, the district administration has decided to come forward and further strengthen the bond between the ‘army for the poor’ and the restaurants of the district. The eateries have agreed to part with the remaining amount of food that goes waste at their respective establishment and the same would be distributed to homeless and downtrodden by the volunteers of the Robinhood Army, said officials. The FSDA officials had arranged a meeting of the Robinhood Army representatives and the office bearers of the hotel and restaurant association of the city. “Although, we were in contact with some of the prominent hotel and restaurants of the city but due to Covid-19 in 2020 and 2021, the businesses of hotels and restaurants were adversely affected and impacted collections too,” said Narendra Tiwari, a senior member of the Robinhood Army. He said that there are around 250 active volunteers of the ‘army’ and presently the sticker drive is being carried out by the team of these volunteers who visits the guest houses of the city on every Sunday and paste the stickers at prominent and noticeable places of the guest houses. “Through the stickers we try to communicate the numbers that the people using these guest houses for hosting marriage and birthday functions can contact us if they have leftover food. The food, which the donor wants to give us, should be minimum for 25 people with no maximum limit,” said Tiwari. He added that the sticker drive has already covered around 90 guest houses of the prominent localities of the city including Daraganj, Kydganj, Allahapur, Sobatiyabagh, Talierganj etc while 90 odd more guest houses marriage halls would be contacted soon. “We attend the calls till around 11pm also and after that, we request callers to preserve the food that is picked up early next morning. We taste the food and if it is fit to be consumed, then we distribute it to the needy living in the vicinity of the food collection site,” Tripathi said. Prayagraj’s Chief Food Safety Officer, Department of Food Safety and drug administration, KK Tripathi said, “The department is trying to play the role of a bridge between the hotels, restaurants and this noble NGO from time to time. Such meetings are held to spread awareness about the noble work of this ‘army’ and how hotels and restaurants can play an important role in the same”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/local-eateries-team-up-with-robinhood-army-to-feed-hungry-101637089051515.html

17-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: FB officials to depose before Assembly panel on November 18||Facebook India is set to depose before the Delhi assembly’s committee on peace and harmony on November 18, the panel’s chairperson and AAP Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha said in a statement on Tuesday. The panel is conducting an inquiry into the communal riots that hit Delhi in February last year, killing 53 people and injuring over 400 others. The committee initially asked Facebook to send a senior representative to depose before it on November 2, but the social media firm sought two weeks’ time, noting that it is selecting an appropriate executive to represent it.“The summons were issued by the committee to Facebook India to depose its views on the critical role of social media in preventing the spread of false, provocative, and malicious messages that can incite violence and disharmony,” Chadha said.The statement said that Chadha will convene the committe’s meeting in Delhi Vidhan Sabha at 12.30pm on Thursday. “The proceedings of the committee will be streamed live in view of transparency,” said the statement.Facebook India’s public policy director Shivnath Thukral and director (legal) GV Anand Bhushan will appear before Delhi assembly’s committee.Thukral, in an official letter, wrote, “We again thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee on Peace and Harmony to provide our views to assist the committee in its aims to recommend preventative and remedial measures concerning issues of governance, social cohesion, unity, brotherhood and peace and to strengthen overall social and economic development through communal harmony. Facebook shares the committee’s aim to improve harmony among religious communities, linguistic communities, and social groups.”In October 2020, the Delhi legislative assembly panel told the Supreme Court that it had summoned Facebook India vice-president and managing director as a witness to ascertain the social media platform’s views on whether it contributed in any way to the build-up of the February, 2020 communal violence.On July 8, the Supreme Court order upheld the powers of the panel to summon both members and non-members, including representatives of Facebook.“Facebook cannot excuse themselves from appearing pursuant to the new summons issued to them on February 3, 2021... Facebook is a platform where political differences are reflected. They cannot wash their hands off the issue as this is their very business,” said the top court’s July 8 order.At the same time, the court clarified that the panel cannot become a “prosecuting agency” which can hold people guilty and order filing of charge sheets in the riot cases. The Facebook executive will be at liberty not to answer questions relating to law and order and police, while such a refusal cannot lead to any coercive step by the assembly, the Supreme Court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-fb-officials-to-depose-before-assembly-panel-on-november-18-101637088931619.html

Till now details of 9500 criminals have been uploaded, said officials. The step will be helpful in tightening the noose around trouble makers before the upcoming elections, they said. On the instructions of election commission, police have started identification of persons who may create trouble during polls, may disrupt polling process or may cause disturbance and harm peace.

17-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: CCTV footage captured suspects behind Jangpura double murder||The Delhi Police probing the murder of two women, who were found dead inside their employer’s house in K Block Jangpura Extension, have found a 45-second CCTV footage that captured the five alleged suspects outside the house. While police officially did not comment on the investigation details, a police officer, aware of the case, said they are exploring several angles because of the unusual aspects of the case. Asking not to be named, the officer explained -- firstly the entry inside the house was friendly -- neither the doors nor the locks were broken. Even if the women knew one or two suspects, it was surprising why she or both of them would allow all five of them inside the house at around 2 am. He added that the only item that appears to be missing is a cell phone of one of the dead women. Other peculiar details include all five men were carrying heavy bags, which is unusual if they had come to murder the two women; the women were found dead on two different floors with their mouth taped and limbs tied; the security guards supposedly admitted to the police they had seen five masked men but assumed they were residents, and did not bother to check, and also the fact that nobody heard a thing. Police suspect the two women were smothered at different times during the early hours of Monday. On Tuesday, doctors at AIIMS conducted the post-mortem after which the bodies were handed to their husbands. The two women, who were from Darjeeling in West Bengal, had been working in the house for the last 5-6 months. Mina Rai,35, worked as domestic help, while the other victim Sujata Gurung,40, was a nursing attendant, police said. The twin murders inside the house came to light when a local dog trainer rang the doorbell at around 9.30 am on Monday and got no response. The man then called the building owner, after which she went to check on the two women and found them dead on the ground and the first floor. “We are looking at the call data records of both phones. Only Mina Rai’s phone was taken. We found Sujata’s phone on the floor next to her body. This will help us get more details,” a police officer said on Tuesday. HT contacted Esha Pandey, the southeast district’s deputy commissioner of police (DCP) for an update on the investigation but despite phone calls and text messages, the DCP did not comment. A second police officer, who too asked not to be named, said that the two women lived in the house but visited their husbands once or twice a month in Gurugram. Mina’s husband works as a housekeeping employee while Sujata’s husband works with a physiotherapist. “We are speaking to their husbands to get more details. Separately, we are trying to identify the five men. All of them are wearing masks. The video is blurred. The backpacks they are carrying seem to be heavy. They are seen talking outside the house and scaled the building wall to enter the house,” the officer said. While police are working to crack the twin murders, the video of the five men has been widely circulated among the residents. The colony resident welfare association president, Kapil Kakkar, said a message has already been circulated among residents to stay vigilant. Kakkar said they have in the past met the local police personnel at the Jangpura police post and asked for night patrolling in the colony. “For the past several years, the police have repeatedly said that they are short-staffed. We will try to employ more security guards and are requesting all residents to contribute to pay for the guards.” DWARKA MURDER Meanwhile, another police team in Delhi is working to identify the woman, seemingly in her mid-20’s, whose body was found in a drain behind a fuel pump in Dabri sector 2. The body was spotted by a passerby at around 6pm on Monday. Doctors had told police that there were burn marks on the woman’s forehead and her private parts, suggesting she may have been raped before being murdered. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary was not available for comments on the investigation update. But officials, aware of the probe details said they are matching the woman’s description --- 157 cms, wheatish complexion, oval face, long hair – with description of other missing women. Police said the photograph of the woman’s face may not be of much help because her murderer had assaulted her causing several injuries and burned her face. “We have sent the details of the woman to every police station across the city. We are focusing more on the nearby areas. The details and photos have been shared on WhatsApp groups. Once we identify the women, we will be able to proceed further. We are checking CCTV footage of the case,” said an officer, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cctv-footage-captured-suspects-behind-jangpura-double-murder-101637088689990.html
17-11-2021||Gurugram||Construction ban in NCR: DTCP forms 5 teams for enforcement in Gurugram||The department of town and country planning (DTCP), to strengthen the construction ban imposed by the state government in view of the high levels of pollution, on Tuesday issued directions to developers to stop construction in private licensed colonies as well as ongoing projects till Wednesday. On Sunday, the Haryana government directed the closure of all schools, banned construction activities and advised government staff to work from home till November 17 in the four districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar.According to officials of DTCP, the department formed five teams to enforce the construction ban and also ensure that norms imposed by National Green Tribunal to check pollution are not violated. DTCP officials said that while an extension of the construction ban would depend on directions from the state government, it was likely to be extended due to high levels of pollution. On Tuesday, Gurugram’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reading was recorded at 378, an increase from Monday’s reading of 342. An AQI reading between 301 and 400 is considered “very poor”.RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement said that the five teams will randomly visit private colonies in their respective jurisdictions and enforce the ban. “We have already been issuing notices and imposing penalties and this will be enforced more strictly. Construction activities will not be allowed till further directions from the government,” he said. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, said that if local residents spot any violation, they should lodge a complaint and action will be taken at the earliest. Responding to the construction ban, developers said that they were ready to halt work if it helped but there was a need to find out whether such a ban will make any difference in the longterm. Pankaj Bajaj, president, CREDAI, NCR, said, “Public health comes first. The developer community is happy to halt work for as long as it is required, if it is going to help. Studies say construction contributes less than 5% of the ambient dust in the NCR. Experts say there is a need to check pollution caused by farm fires and vehicular emissions. The period for stoppage of work plus a reasonable re-mobilisation period should be allowed as force majeure for delivery commitments to home buyers.”In another development, the enforcement team of Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran cleared three acres of prime land in sector 57 of illegal encroachments. Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP said that an enforcement team demolished 150 hutments, five shops selling building material, six scrap shops and two eateries. “All these structures were illegal and were removed with the help of local police. This plot is reserved for a group housing project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/construction-ban-in-ncr-dtcp-forms-5-teams-for-enforcement-in-gurugram-101637088631153.html

As per the contract, either the PMC or the consultant can quit work by giving 30 days’ notice.”“SGI was the former consultant who prepared the project report and DPR. The firm cited Covid-19 and the financial situation due to the pandemic as reasons for leaving the work. However, the PMC has received all the data and drawings. The corporation issued bills only for the work carried out by SGI. According to the firm, there are some dues pending but the department will put the proposal before the municipal commissioner and senior officials will take the call on the matter,” Jagtap said.PMC officials claim that the new contractor will be appointed within a period of two months and that work on the project will not stop in the interim. According to sources however, work on the project has been very slow due to which both the former consultant and the contractor have been widely criticised. Even the ruling party (BJP) is not happy as they were expecting to have something to show ahead of the civic elections. Besides, several roads in the city have been damaged due to the 24x7 water project and the PMC has not reinstated them properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-appoint-new-consultant-for-24x7-water-project-101637088629853.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Air quality may deteriorate further||New Delhi: India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said air pollution levels in Delhi could get worse, as they predicted a drop in wind speed and temperatures. The air quality in Delhi went back to the severe zone after remaining in the very poor zone for two days. Health experts, however, say that under both conditions high pollution levels continue to pose a critical risk even to healthy individuals. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings the average air quality index of Delhi on Tuesday was 403, in the severe zone. On Monday, the AQI was 353, categorised as very poor. IMD scientists said that wind is likely to remain calm till November 18, and temperatures may drop too making it difficult for the pollutants to disperse easily. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded the season’s coldest day with a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius. IMD’s Ayanagar station recorded the minimum temperature at 9 degrees -- the first sub-10 degrees of the season. Since November 5, a day after Diwali, Delhi’s air quality has remained in the severe zone for seven days, with the AQI only showing minor improvements. Environmental experts said that while the initial spike in pollution levels were caused by large scale cracker bursting in the Capital on Diwali night, the situation was aggravated by a peak in stubble burning incidents in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. Union ministry of earth science’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research’s (Safar) air quality analysis for Delhi showed that the number of stubble fires in these agrarian states have started declining. On Tuesday, 1,820 fires were reported from Punjab and Haryana, which contributed to 8% of the Capital’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels. “It appears that the stubble fires have already peaked and the fire count is now declining,” the Safar analysis said. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) also warned of more polluted air in the coming days. “Delhi’s air quality slipped again to the severe category last evening owing to a dip in wind speeds. Almost two-thirds of regulatory monitors in Delhi reported PM 2.5 levels higher than 250ug/m3, breaching the national standards of 60ug/m3. The city’s average PM 2.5 levels reached a maximum of 340ug/m3 at 10 am this morning.” She added, “However, the PM2.5 levels started falling slightly given a marginal increase in wind speeds in the afternoon. But meteorology will continue to have a crucial impact on Delhi’s air quality in the coming days. Given the drop in temperatures, contribution from local biomass burning for warming needs might see an uptick.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-air-quality-may-deteriorate-further-101637088570034.html
17-11-2021||Gurugram||Covid vaccination picks up pace in Nuh with door-to-door campaign||The pace of Covid-19 vaccination in Nuh has improved this week with over 5,500 people being vaccinated daily in the district, said officials on Tuesday.According to official data, Nuh has one of the lowest vaccination coverage rates in Haryana with the first dose coverage at 38% and second dose coverage at 8.9%. Officials attributed the change in pace to the door-to-door campaign that started earlier this month and the incentives, such as extra funds for villages, announced by the district administration.In Nuh, door-to-door vaccination started on November 10. Officials said that before the door-to-door campaign, 2,500-2,800 people were vaccinated daily, but in the last two days, over 11,000 people were vaccinated every day in the district. On Monday, 11,090 people were vaccinated while on Tuesday, 11,631 people were vaccinated in Nuh.Dr Surender Kumar Yadav, chief medical officer of Nuh district, said, “In the last three days, the pace of vaccination increased rapidly, especially by involving all departments in the district. The deputy commissioner formed committees at the village level and announced several incentives. Awareness campaigns are also being carried out by different departments that are encouraging residents to get vaccinated. Health staff like ASHA and ANM workers have prepared lists of all residents who are yet to take the vaccine and if anyone is not able to go then they are also being taken to the centres.”The department has hired 47 cars to help ASHA and ANM workers reach vaccination sites and take people to the centres. In the first week of November, health workers surveyed every village in the district and prepared lists of those who were yet to take doses of vaccination.Officials said that every ASHA worker (there are 1160 workers in the district) personally interacted with residents in 450 villages while preparing the list, and are now ensuring that all those who are eligible for the vaccine either go to the vaccination centre themselves or are taken there in vehicles hired by the health department. Each ASHA worker is assigned a population of 1,000-1,200.The district administration has also started giving incentives to people and has declared that the first five villages in every block to achieve 100% vaccination will be given ₹10 lakh in extra funds for infrastructure development projects. The district administration has also tied up with the chemist associations and said that residents who have taken their first dose will get a 5% discount on medicines and those fully vaccinated will get a 10% discount. Vaccinated residents will also be given a 0.5 paisa discount per litre on petrol, said the chief medical officer.“If this pace continues (over 10,000 people are vaccinated daily), then by next week we hope to leave the list of 45 districts in the country that have a lower than 50% rate of first-dose vaccination,” added the Yadav.Capt Shakti Singh, deputy commissioner of Nuh, said, “We first identified the problem areas and found that availability of public transport was a major problem and both residents and vaccinators would go back early as they would not find vehicles after 3-4pm. So, we hired vehicles that ferry four teams of vaccinators around 7am so that vaccination can start from 8am.”He also said that initially, the pace of vaccination was slow because of rumours such as the vaccine adversely affecting people’s health.“Since the door-to-door campaign has started, the vaccination pace has definitely increased and we will make sure it stays the same. On Tuesday, over 13,400 people were vaccinated, which exceeds the total number of people vaccinated in June and July. Our target is to vaccinate 20,000 people daily by end of this week,” added Singh.He also said that the administration has noted that due to the sowing season, many individuals leave for fields early in the morning and miss the vaccination process. The administration will send special teams to agricultural fields from next week for their vaccination.Last Thursday, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar set a target for the state to achieve 100% vaccination in two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid-vaccination-picks-up-pace-in-nuh-with-door-to-door-campaign-101637088330021.html
17-11-2021||Pune||Pune doctors sound “viral infection” alarm with change-of-season forecast in play||PUNE As temperatures across Pune city fluctuate with a difference of at least 10 degrees Centigrade between maximum and minimum, doctors have sounded the change of season “viral infection” alarm.On Tuesday, the maximum temperature reported by the weather department for Pune city was 31.6 degrees Celsius, with the minimum temperature at 20.6 degrees Celsius. Earlier in the month, minimum temperatures in parts of the city were as low as 10.9 degrees Celsius.Cloudy weather along with light rainfall is also likely in parts of the city for the next few days said, weathers department officials.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a cloudy climate in the city till November 19.Dr Mahendra Dadke of Jupiter Hospital said patients with diabetes, hypertension and asthma need to be careful.“This weather is ideal for viral infections to spread. In the morning, the breeze is cooler and afternoons are relatively warmer which is favourable for pathogens to breed leading to more infections. Patients with complaints of pulmonary functions may get viral infections during this time. As the season changes, there is a rise in viral infection cases. High-risk patients should wear warm clothes while taking a morning walk, and should take steam inhalations to keep infections at bay,” said Dr Dadke.He added that young children are also at risk of infections during this time.“However, as schools are shut as of now, the number of paediatric patients are fewer. They still are at risk. Parents should take special care of children during this time,” said Dr Dadke.Dr Kapil Lendal, a city-based paediatric practitioner said that children should be given immunity boosters to safeguard them from infections.“If the child has a cold and a cough, s/he should be given steam. However, the child should be taken to a medical practitioner. If the child has fever, they should be immediately taken to the doctor for antibiotics treatment,” said Dr Lendal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-doctors-sound-viral-infection-alarm-with-change-of-season-forecast-in-play-101637088271222.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: CBSE Term 1 exams begin||New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) Term 1 board exams for students of Class 12 started on Tuesday, with school authorities saying that the examinations -- in Beauty and Wellness, and Entrepreneurship subjects -- went on smoothly in Delhi. In view of the pandemic, CBSE had earlier announced two-term board exam this year, with the Term 1 featuring a 90-minute test in the multiple choice questions (MCQ) format.Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said there weren’t many glitches in the process, other than minor delay in uploading the answer keys after revaluation. Acharya said that the school had trained students well with the help of mock OMR sheets before the exam. “The paper came on time. Students were also familiar since the board had shared an explainer video earlier. We also gave them practice tests on mock OMR sheets. Since the paper was minor and only around 10 students appeared in our school, everything took place smoothly,” said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka.Laksh Vir Sehgal, principal of Bal Bharati Public School on Ganga Ram Hospital Marg, said the exam went smoothly. “It was the first paper under a new system, so there were a few hiccups initially but everything was solved well within the time since we had the mock test yesterday. Today, we had a minor paper so the number of students taking the test was also less,” said Sehgal. Noting that printing question papers on campus for minor papers is not hard, he, however, added that it could be a challenge for some other minor subjects where the number of students is high. “Printing of papers can be especially challenging and schools will need to arrange for high-speed printers,” said Sehgal, who is also the city coordinator for the exam. The Vice- and Principals’ Association of Delhi on Tuesday also wrote to the CBSE chairperson and sought a supply of printed question papers for the Class 10 Sanskrit exam, scheduled on November 22, noting that the number of students appearing for the test is high.Dr Sanyam Bhardwaj, controller of examinations, CBSE, said that the board will provide printed question paper for the Sanskrit exam for both classes 10 and 12. “Since the matter is confidential, it’s possible that the schools are not aware of the same. However, we are already providing printed papers for the Sanskrit exam,” said Bhardwaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cbse-term-1-exams-begin-101637088269816.html
17-11-2021||Noida||Over ₹1 crore fine levied on polluting establishments in Ghaziabad||Penalties are being levied as part of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) measures to curb pollution levels in Ghaziabad, officials said on Tuesday.The district administration has been following the orders of a committee constituted by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and its adjoining areas, District Information Officer Rakesh Chauhan said.District Magistrate R K Singh has imposed a pecuniary fine of ₹1.03 crore so far, the official said.Keeping in view the adverse meteorological conditions prevailing in NCR and worsening air quality index (AQI), fines are being slapped on Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam, including 17 polluting establishments like builders, shopping malls and hospitals.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has passed an order after a writ petition filed by environmental protection committees. The polluting establishments were identified by Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) during its surprise raids.Following the orders of the district magistrate and the report of UPPCB, Sub-Divisional Magistrate (Sadar) Vinay Singh has issued recovery orders.The revenue department would recover the fine from the errant institutions which are responsible for the deteriorating pollution levels, DIO Chauhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-rs-1-crore-fine-levied-on-polluting-establishments-in-ghaziabad-101637085633584.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||Uphaar case: Ansals undermined rule of law, Delhi police tell court||The Delhi Police on Tuesday told a local court that real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal have committed a crime which is “gravest of its kind” that has shattered the faith of the common man in the justice delivery system.The Ansals have sought to suspend the sentence and the fine imposed on them last week after the magistrate found them guilty of tampering with evidence in the Uphaar tragedy case. The trial court sentenced the Ansal brothers to seven years imprisonment and imposed a fine of ₹2.25 crore each on them. Opposing the plea, additional public prosecutor AT Ansari argued that the convicts, including the Ansals, have not only potentially eroded the institutional integrity of the “Delhi judiciary”, but also seriously impugned the administration of the criminal justice system.“The offences proved against the convicts are gravest of its kind and have ultimately shattered the faith of the common man in the justice delivery system. By tampering with crucial evidence forming part of judicial records, convicts sought to hamper and scuttle the process of law. They have not only polluted the stream of justice but they have also potentially undermined the majesty of ‘rule of law’,” the public prosecutor told additional sessions judge Anil Antil. “It would not be an exaggeration to submit that it is a targeted assault by the convicts on the institutional integrity of Delhi judiciary. The possibility of reform cannot be expected from the convicts namely Sushil Ansal and Gopal Ansal. They are previous convicts,” he added.Ansari argued that this case has led to a formation of a perception that rich, mighty and influential people can do any thing and get away with it and that they even can manipulate the judicial system in their favour and the court needs to break this perception.The matter will be heard next on November 18.The Ansal brothers were sentenced to two years by the Supreme Court in August 2015 in the main fire case that stunned the Capital 24 years ago and led to major changes in fire safety norms. But they avoided further imprisonment after spending about five months in prison when the apex court, in August 2015, ruled that a penalty of ₹30 crore each and time already served was adequate punishment for their criminal negligence given their age.Sentencing the Ansals on November 8, chief metropolitan magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma said, “It is important to note that in a sentencing process, it is not only the crime that is important but the criminal and his/her circumstances are also equally important. The circumstances during which the instant crime was committed show the deep disrespect which the convicts had for the law and the judicial process and for the victims.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uphaar-case-ansals-undermined-rule-of-law-delhi-police-tell-court-101637088209840.html
17-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram braces for below 10°C dip in temperature||Gurugram residents could be in for a further drop in temperature as the meteorological centre in Chandigarh on Tuesday evening issued a cold wave warning for the next 24 hours at isolated places in the districts of south Haryana, including Gurugram and Faridabad. This is the first such warning for the district, with winter barely setting in, weather analysts said.The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.7 degrees Celsius (°C) on Tuesday, one degree below normal. The maximum temperature also dipped four degrees below normal, to settle at 25°C on Tuesday. Officials said cold wave conditions set in when the minimum temperature is either 10 degrees or below or when the difference between the normal range of minimum temperature and the actual recorded temperature is four degrees Celsius or more. Manmohan Singh, director of MeT Chandigarh said, “Cold wave conditions are declared when the minimum temperature in plains is 10 degrees or less or the departure is more than four degrees. For the past two days, the minimum temperature being recorded in south Haryana districts is fulfilling this criterion and the cold wave condition is likely to stay for the next 24 hours. A western disturbance is also predicted over the state around November 18, after which temperatures will rise for a day or two; after that, it will reduce gradually.” A western disturbance means an area of “disturbed” or reduced air pressure, moving from the west to the east, carrying with it moisture associated with rainfall, snowfall and fog in northern India. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services, said, “Districts such as Hisar recorded a minimum temperature seven degrees below normal. This is a severe cold wave and unusual for mid-November. Some other districts as well as Delhi have also recorded temperatures four degrees below normal.”Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 9 degrees Celsius at Aya Nagar station of the India Meteorological Department on Tuesday -- this season’s first sub-10 degrees temperature. The Safdarjung station that gives the representative data for the national capital, meanwhile recorded the season’s lowest minimum of 10 degrees Celsius, India Meteorological Department data shows.Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist, said, “Cold wave conditions are being reported in several districts of south Haryana already. We have not witnessed a western disturbance in over two weeks, due to which dry weather is continuing. Western disturbances lead to the weather becoming slightly humid, which balances the temperature. Otherwise also, districts of south Haryana report more dry weather compared to other parts of Delhi-NCR.”Meanwhile, Gurugram recorded “ very poor” air quality index for the second consecutive day on Tuesday with a reading of 369, according to the Central Pollution Control Board bulletin. This is a climb from the AQI of 332 on Monday. According to bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR, the air quality in the region is likely remain in the “very poor” category for the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-braces-for-below-10-c-dip-in-temperature-101637088150165.html
17-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra pushes for booster doses, reduction in Covishield gap||Maharashtra on Tuesday asked for booster doses for its healthcare workers and frontline workers, a reduction in the gap between two Covishield doses from 84 days to 28, and sought to know when vaccination for children between ages 12 and 18 would begin. These demands were made by Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope in a meeting with Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya in New Delhi. Tope sought a reduction in the period between two doses of Covidshield from 84 days to 28, at par with the Covaxin doses of Bharat Biotech. Last week, Tope had made the request in a virtual meeting between Mandaviya and health ministers of all states and union territories. The demand, he said, is to boost the speed of administering second doses in the state. As of 9pm on Tuesday, November 16, Maharashtra had 34,292,903 fully vaccinated people or approximately 37% of the state’s eligible beneficiaries. Of the 91.44 million targetted beneficiaries in the state, 69,789,048 people or 76.3% have taken the first dose. Maharashtra had administered 104,094,458 doses till 9pm on Tuesday, according to the Central government’s CoWin vaccine tracking dashboard. The state government has set a target of inoculating 100% of its eligible population with at least one dose by November 30. While the Centre has no target for India as such, the Union health ministry has asked state governments to ensure that all the adult population is covered with the first doses during the ongoing ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign. Tope remarked that the 20-minute meeting with the Union health minister “was “positive.” He said, “We want to increase the percentage of fully vaccinated people. Therefore, we have sought a reduction in the gap between two Covishield doses from 84 days to 28 days.” Besides Maharashtra, Kerala, too, has demanded a reduction in the gap for Covishield doses and also asked for booster doses for healthcare workers and frontline workers. In a column for HT last week, renowned virologist and retired professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Dr T Jacob John wrote why booster doses may become an important tool in containing the virus. “Dampening the tempo of virus circulation will lead to fewer infections and deaths. For that, breakthrough infections must be prevented by giving booster doses to all who come forward,” he wrote. He added, “There is apprehension, amplified by the World Health Organisation (WHO), that a booster dose deprives someone waiting for second dose. If vaccines were in short supply, that is reasonable. However, India has unused vaccine stocks in several states and institutions — thus, a policy shift allowing boosters will be a wise and ethical decision.” The state health minister added that it has been nearly a year that HCWs and FLWs have taken their vaccines, so booster doses were sought for these categories. This is similar to what was done in some countries such the United States, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. “It was a positive discussion. He (Mandaviya) said that they will study our demands,” Tope said. The state also sought National Health Mission funds to recruit personnel, as was done during the first two waves of the coronavirus. “Owing to the threat of a probable third Covid-19 wave, [we] requested budget allocations for human resources in supplementary PIP [programme implementation plan] under the national health mission,” Tope said. He added that the state had asked for a revision in the proposal to set up catheterisation or cath labs under the NHM’s supplementary project implementation plan. This was previously disapproved under PIP. “We want to set up more cath labs in Maharashtra to scan patients for their heart ailments, angioplasty, angiography, etc, but NHM funds don’t cover it (setting up labs). We made a representation to the ministry and they have asked us to send a separate letter for cath labs. We are hopeful that it will be considered,” said Tope. Meanwhile, for the sixth day straight, Maharashtra recorded fewer than 1000 Covid-19 cases. On Tuesday, Maharashtra added 886 fresh cases, pushing the tally to 6,625,872. The state added 34 fatalities due to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking the death toll to 140,636. Mumbai, meanwhile, added 213 fresh cases, taking its tally to 760,724. Mumbai recorded one fatality. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 102,888 samples, giving a positivity rate of 0.86%. The overall positivity rate of Maharashtra stood at 10.33%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-pushes-for-booster-doses-reduction-in-covishield-gap-101637088031093.html
17-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram civic body to curb waste disposal in vacant plots||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will now closely monitor waste disposal in residential, commercial, and industrial establishments that hire private contractors for garbage collection. MCG has realised that a lot of them dump waste in vacant plots which is a practice the civic body now plans to curb, officials said on Tuesday.“Bulk waste generators (BWGs) that are not covered by Ecogreen (MCG’s concessionaire) will have to declare the ways waste is transported and subsequently processed after it is collected by the respective private garbage collectors. Post-declaration, nine teams from MCG’s sanitation wing will visit such establishments across the city and verify whether the waste is being collected, disposed, and processed properly and issue penalties if not,” said a senior MCG official who attended Monday’s meeting.The matter was brought up during an internal MCG meeting held at the civic body’s Sector 34 office on Monday evening, following which officials were asked to closely monitor BWGs.Any establishment, such as a condominium, society, township, mall, school, college, bank, hospital, industry, banquet hall, hotel, restaurant, religious area, factory, and mill that produces over 50 kilograms of waste per day is considered a bulk waste generator.According to MCG officials, there are over 1,800 BWGs in the city, of which 1,200 are covered by Ecogreen.MCG officials also said that there are around 600 BWGs that employ private garbage collectors to lift garbage from their premises, the disposal and processing of which is largely unaccounted for, and results in piles of garbage being dumped illegally in vacant areas.To overcome this, close monitoring will be done to fine violators and ensure waste collection, disposal, and processing system are adhered to, as per norms, said officials.If a BWG flouts norms, it can be penalised for an amount upto ₹25,000.The MCG official quoted above also said that teams from the sanitation wing will also be responsible for encouraging BWGs to get their waste collected from the MCG’s concessionaire for a nominal fee instead of paying high sums to private garbage collectors.According to the norms, in a BWG, wet waste needs to be processed into compost on-site or transported to a nearby site for the purpose, while segregated dry waste needs to be handed over to authorised waste collectors, said officials.“According to the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, it is mandatory for the bulk waste generators located within MCG limits to dispose of the waste they generate at their own level. If anyone disobeys these rules, then action will be taken against them according to guidelines, in which there is a provision of heavy fine,” said Dr Vaishali Sharma, additional municipal commissioner, MCG.Sharma who chaired Monday’s meeting on sanitation also directed officials to seize vehicles of private garbage collectors found to be dumping waste illegally, lodge FIRs against them, as well as serve a notice to the BWG concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-civic-body-to-curb-waste-disposal-in-vacant-plots-101637087909917.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: EDMC to send teachers abroad for higher education||NEW DELHI: To improve the quality of education in civic schools, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to send its teachers to foreign universities for higher studies, with the corporation promising to bear the cost of their education, including tuition, accommodation and living expenses, officials said. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said that the idea is to improve the quality of education in its schools. “At present, there are over 5,000 teachers in EDMC schools. While all efforts are being made to keep the quality of educational institutions high there, we are also giving an opportunity to our teachers to gain international exposure. We are sending our teachers to foreign universities to study in different programmes related to teacher training. The teachers applying for these courses will have to inform the training section of the education department at the time of application. Once a teacher is selected by these universities, he/she can apply for sponsorship under the EDMC’s funding of foreign training (FFT) scheme. Under this scheme, the EDMC will sponsor two teachers for training in a reputed foreign university in the first year,” he said. Anand further said that the scheme can be availed by a teacher once in their career. “The applicants must be below 42 years of age and must have impeccable profession record with at least ‘very good’ grading in their last five years’ service book record. This scheme is applicable to the teachers who get admission in top 100 universities and institutions. These teachers can choose subjects like public education, special education, development of education and use of digital technology in education in these international universities. The maximum amount of financial assistance permissible for each candidate is ₹75 lakh. This financial aid will cover tuition fees, accommodation, books and living costs of the selected candidates,” he said. Echoing similar views, Rajiv Kumar, the chairman of the EDMC’s education committee, said that if a teacher fails to complete the foreign diploma/degree/doctorate programme, the person will have to refund the entire amount to the corporation. “The teachers, who have excellent record in the field of teaching, are eligible for this scheme. The minimum service length to avail this higher education programme is 10 years as a regular teacher. The selected candidates will have to sign an undertaking that they will not avail other financial assistance during their foreign training course from any other institution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-edmc-to-send-teachers-abroad-for-higher-education-101637087852119.html
17-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Bad air causing asthma-like symptoms in healthy children||The hazardous levels of air pollution in Delhi is leading to healthy children developing asthma-like symptoms and the prolonging of upper respiratory tract infection that need to be treated with inhalers, according to doctors in the national capital. At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), there has been a 20% increase in the number of patients visiting out-patient clinics as well as the emergency with exacerbations of existing conditions such as asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in the past one week. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday was 403, in the severe category. The hazardous air quality has been persisting in the capital since Diwali and also prompted the government to close schools till November 20 and order all government employees to work from home till Wednesday. Construction activities are also banned till November 17.“There has been an increase of around 20% in the number of patients visiting our OPD and the emergency department with exacerbations of existing diseases. In otherwise healthy people, the high levels of pollution are prolonging symptoms of normal viral infections or the common cold,” said Dr Karan Madan, associate professor, department of pulmonary medicine, AIIMS. He further said, “In many healthy people who get a viral infection or cold, a cough that would otherwise get better in two or three days is lasting for over 10 days to two weeks now. It is almost like an asthmatic episode and to get better, many end up having to use steroid inhalers like asthma patients.” And, the impact is being seen across all age groups, doctors said. Dr Puneet Khanna, head of the department, respiratory medicine, Manipal Hospital, Dwarka, said he has seen several cases of seasonal asthma-like symptoms in children. “In addition to headache, congested nose, loss of concentration, and irritability, we see seasonal intermittent wheezing and asthma-like symptoms in children every year when the pollution levels spike. They are fine the rest of the year. And many of them go on to develop asthma as well,” said Dr Khanna. Research has shown that high levels of pollution not only exacerbates existing asthma, but long term exposure also increases the risk of developing the disease. According to the World Health Organization, the lungs of a child, who is living in a region where air pollution is quite severe, may not function properly by the time (s)he attains adulthood. Due to weak lungs, such children, are likely to develop asthma in their later years.He said he has also seen a 10% to 15% increase in admissions due to pneumonia – an infection of the lungs that inflame the air sacs – especially in the elderly. High levels of pollution are linked with an increase in respiratory infections, possibly because it reduces the body’s ability to fight off infections. The only way to protect oneself from the bad air effects is to stay indoors, said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor, department of pulmonology, Safdarjung hospital. “However, staying indoors all the time is not a practical solution. People should try to avoid the outdoors for prolonged periods. And, when outside they must wear a mask; the acceptability of masks has increased since Covid-19. However, the normal surgical masks do not really protect against pollution. N-95 masks are needed for that,” he said. He also urged people to wear masks properly, with it covering their mouth and nose, and with a good fit around the chin; they should especially try not to fiddle with it, he said. Dr Madan said people must avoid strenuous exercise or outdoor activities when the pollution levels are high. “Air purifiers serve only a limited area. People who want to do intense exercises, but are prone to pollution-related symptoms, may do so in a closed room with an air purifier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-bad-air-causing-asthma-like-symptoms-in-healthy-children-101637087851053.html

He was diagnosed with a case of ruptured sinus of valsalva into right ventricular outflow tract with severe aortic regurgitation. It’s a rare heart disease which if not treated timely may result in death, doctors said.Manish Yadav (22) from Azamgarh was admitted to CTVS department at BHU with severe difficulty in breathing and swelling in whole body over a fortnight ago, said Dr Siddharth Lakhotia, professor at the department. “His oxygen saturations were very low on room temperature and he was coughing continuously. His Covid-19 report was negative and he underwent few urgent investigations. The diagnosis was done with the help of 2D echocardiography,” Dr Lakhotia said.He was kept in the CTVS ICU on ventilator support initially and was given medications to manage his heart failure. “During surgery the abnormal communication of aorta with right ventricle was closed with help of an artificial material graft and the aortic valve was replaced by a metallic artificial valve. The surgery was very challenging. However, the patient is now fine and was discharged on Tuesday, Dr Lakhotia added.The surgery was performed by a team of doctors, including Prof Siddharth Lakhotia and Dr Narendra Nath Das while anaesthesia was given by Prof SK Mathur and Dr Reena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rare-heart-surgery-performed-at-bhu-101637087790461.html

On Tuesday, at least 20 drivers who were participating in the ongoing strike, rejoined work. In all, a total of 430 MSRTC staffers have gone back to work. “Over the last few days since drivers and conductors were on strike, buses were at a standstill. Now some of the drivers have come back and we will be starting regular ST bus operations from Swargate and Wakdewadi ST stands from Thursday onwards,” said MSRTC’s Pune divisional controller, Ramakant Gaikwad. “Initially, buses will run on major routes like Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Solapur and already Shivneri and Shivshashi buses are operating on the Pune-Mumbai route. If more drivers rejoin work, then the number of buses and routes will increase,” added Gaikwad. Tuesday was day 18 of the strike. As of now, 500 workers from the Pune division have been suspended by the department. Currently, contractor-owned Shivshahi and Shivneri buses are operating on various routes from the Swargate, Wakdewadi and Pune railway station ST stands.

Garad is a corporator from ward 5 of Kharghar.Garad, who had been denied the post of the Mayor, has been raising a number of issues against the ruling party in Panvel. Also, along with the opposition, she has been targeting the Thakur family that controls the party in the region.Prakash Binedar, BJP spokesperson, said, “Despite being elected on the BJP ticket, she had been colluding with the opposition and targeting the party in the house and also outside besides making baseless allegations.

17-11-2021||World||Pakistan passes bill to help Kulbhushan Jadhav appeal against death sentence||The Pakistan government on Wednesday pushed through a bill to help Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court during a joint session of Parliament that was marred by protests by the opposition. The International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Act of 2021 is on the same lines as an ordinance issued last year by the Pakistan government to facilitate Jadhav’s right to appeal against the death sentence given to him for alleged involvement in espionage and subversive activities. Experts said the law would not make a material difference to the case of Jadhav and was more about meeting legal requirements so that he could mount a proper appeal in Pakistani courts. The law allows a foreign national to file a petition in a Pakistani high court for review and reconsideration of a conviction or sentence given by a military court. It was one of several bills passed during a joint session of Parliament in Islamabad that saw a walk-out by opposition lawmakers. The opposition was particularly angered by amendments to the Election Act of 2017 to allow the use of electronic voting machines and to give voting rights to overseas Pakistanis. The opposition MPs tore up official papers and shouted slogans against Prime Minister Imran Khan and his government. Pakistan’s law minister Farogh Naseem moved the bill to give effect to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)’s 2019 judgement seeking a review and reconsideration of the death sentence given to Jadhav. The government decided to introduce the bill at the joint session of Parliament as it was passed by the National Assembly or lower house in June this year, but was not passed by the Senate or upper house within the mandatory period of 90 days. After India approached the ICJ, the court said in its judgement that “Pakistan is under an obligation to provide, by means of its own choosing, effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr Jadhav” in view of the violation of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of spying and sentenced to death the following year. India rejected the charges levelled against the former navy officer and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018. India also asked Pakistan in June to remove shortcomings in International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Act, saying it does not create a machinery to facilitate effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case as mandated by the ICJ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-passes-bill-to-help-kulbhushan-jadhav-appeal-against-death-sentence-101637162336675.html

A Taliban official said security forces were still gathering information.Images posted on social media showed a car destroyed by flames as well as twisted wreckage.The explosions added to a series of blasts to hit Kabul in recent days, with Shi'ite areas in the west of the city targeted several times.There was no claim of responsibility but Islamic State militants have claimed several attacks on Shi'ite targets including mosques.Mohammad Nabi, a resident of Dashti Barchi, said it appeared that the second explosion had also caused casualties but there were no immediate details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-6-injured-as-two-blasts-hit-afghan-capital-kabul-officials-101637153920756.html

If this problem had not been completely solved, it would not only have diminished the military’s combat capacity, but also undermined the key political principle that the party commands the gun.”The resolution named four top generals - Guo Boxiong, Xu Caihou, Fang Fenghui, and Zhang Yang - who have been punished for corruption during Xi’s ongoing reign.They were “…thoroughly investigated and punished, and their negative influence was completely eliminated. With this, the political environment in the people’s armed forces has made a fundamental turn for the better”.“…the people’s military has been through an all-around revolutionary restructuring under the firm leadership of the party in preparation for the next stage, while our defence capabilities have grown in step with our economic strength.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-border-row-with-india-china-says-military-preparing-for-next-stage-101637147798613.html
17-11-2021||World||Taliban asks US to release Afghan assets; says economic turmoil brewing at home||The Taliban called Wednesday on US Congress members to release Afghan assets frozen after their takeover of the country, warning economic turmoil at home could lead to trouble abroad.In an open letter, Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said the biggest challenge facing Afghanistan was financial insecurity, "and the roots of this concern lead back to the freezing of assets of our people by the American government".Washington has seized nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank, and the aid-dependent economy has effectively collapsed -- with civil servants unpaid for months and the treasury unable to pay for imports.Concerned nations have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, but are reluctant to commit funds unless the Taliban agree to a more inclusive government and to guarantee the rights of women and minorities."I present to you our compliments and would like to share a few thoughts on our bilateral relations," Muttaqi wrote, noting that 2021 was the centenary of Washington recognising Afghanistan's sovereignty.In measured understatement, he added: "Akin to other world countries, our bilateral relations have also experienced ups and downs."'Mass migration' threatMuttaqi said Afghanistan was enjoying stable government for the first time in over 40 years -- a period that started with an invasion by the Soviet Union in 1979 and ended with the withdrawal of the last US troops on August 31.From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist, brutally violating human rights in the name of Islamic law, sparking fears of a return of their abuses.The Taliban have since returning to power gone to great lengths to convince the international community that they intend to do things differently this time -- though no female ministers have been named, and girls are still barred from returning to secondary school."Practical steps have been taken towards good governance, security and transparency," Muttaqi wrote."No threat is posed to the region or world from Afghanistan and a pathway has been paved for positive cooperation."Muttaqi said Afghans "understand the concerns of the international community", but that it was necessary for all sides to take positive steps to build trust.He warned, however, that the economic situation could spark a mass exodus."If the current situation prevails, the Afghan government and people will face problems and will become a cause for mass migration in the region and world which will consequently create further humanitarian and economic issues," he said.Muttaqi said the United States risked further damaging its reputation in the country "and this will serve as the worst memory ingrained in Afghans at the hands of America"."We hope that the members of the American Congress will think thoroughly in this regard," he added."I request... so that doors for future relations are opened, assets of Afghanistan's Central Bank are unfrozen and sanctions on our banks are lifted."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-asks-us-to-release-afghan-assets-says-economic-turmoil-brewing-at-home-101637145730344.html
17-11-2021||World||Coronavirus digest: Unvaccinated banned from some German Christmas markets||Hamburg has introduced tougher restrictions and Munich's Christkindlmarkt has been ditched altogether. Meanwhile, Germany has recorded its highest ever daily caseload. For the first time in two years, Germans will hit the Christmas markets on Wednesday, but millions will have to sit this one out due to a number of cities demanding proof of vaccination if people want to enjoy the festivities to the full.With Germany recording its highest ever daily caseload on Wednesday, the markets, suspended last year due to the pandemic, must now comply with strict safety rules that vary from state to state, with some not accepting a negative COVID test for entrance.Hamburg is among the most prominent to demand visitors demonstrate proof of vaccination against COVID-19, or provide evidence they have recently recovered from the virus, if they wish to enjoy a mulled wine, a hot chocolate or some gingerbread under festive lights in the city's main square.Unvaccinated revelers will still be able to peruse the bottle-green stalls selling handicrafts or jewelry, listen to carols, ride on the merry-go-round or admire the nativity scenes.Germany has one of the lowest vaccination rates in western Europe, with just 67% of the population fully vaccinated, and is currently reporting record caseloads as Europe's largest economy battles a fourth wave of infections.Some are even questioning the wisdom of having any markets at all as intensive care units fill up once more with COVID patients. Munich's Christkindlmarkt has become the biggest market to be canceled so far."The dramatic situation in our clinics and the exponentially rising infection numbers leave me no choice," Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter (SDP) told Bavarian radio.German football is following a similar path to Hamburg's Christmas market, with this weekend's Berlin derby between Union and Hertha set to take place with only those recently recovered from or vaccinated against, COVID-19, in attendance, the German capital's department for sport has declared.Also on Wednesday, Germany recorded its highest caseload since the onset of the pandemic.The Robert Koch Institute of infectious diseases (RKI) registered 52,826 positive tests in its daily update, while 294 people died in connection with the virus.The seven-day incidence rate in Germany now stands at 319.5 cases per 100,000 people, according to the RKI statistics, which is also the highest it has been since the pandemic began.Here are the latest major developments on coronavirus from around the world:EuropeAs of Thursday, Ireland will require bars and nightclubs to close early while ramping its booster vaccine program in a bid to combat a resurgence cases.The Irish government is also asking people to work from home again, as case numbers rise and ICUs fill up nationwide.In a televised broadcast, Prime Minister Micheal Martin said it was increasingly clear the country was experiencing "another surge" of infections and that he had "to act now.""Our advice is that everyone should work from home unless it is absolutely necessary that they attend in person," he said.Asia-PacificNew restrictions come into force in Beijing on Wednesday with visitors to the city requiring negative tests. In addition, the number of domestic flights to the capital has been reduced.With less than 100 days to before the Winter Olympics gets underway, China is bracing itself for a challenge to its zero-COVID strategy when thousands of international athletes descend on the Chinese capital after months of strict border controls.All visitors to Beijing must now show a negative coronavirus test result from the past 48 hours, while flights from higher risk areas within the country of 1.3 billion people will be canceled or limited to one a day at reduced capacity.Domestic borders of New Zealand's largest city Auckland will reopen from December 15 for those who are fully vaccinated and for people with negative test results, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday."Aucklanders have faced restrictions for an extended period of time to keep the rest of New Zealand safe. But with increased rates of vaccination it's time to open up the ability to travel again," Ardern said.Auckland was cut off from the rest of the country after the outbreak of the Delta variant in August.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-digest-unvaccinated-banned-from-some-german-christmas-markets-101637132441367.html
17-11-2021||World||Xi Jinping era: China now blames foreign politics for Tiananmen massacre||A rare document updating and revising China’s history released by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has come down hard on corruption, “money worship” and extreme individualism, adding that under President Xi Jinping stronger party discipline is needed.The resolution on the party’s “achievements and historical experiences” reiterates that the Tiananmen massacre of 1989 - in which an unknown number of Chinese citizens demanding political freedom were killed by the armed forces - was caused... by “hostile anti-Communist forces”.The release of the resolution, and, separately, an explanation of the resolution by President Xi himself, has cemented his position as one of China’s most powerful leaders ever.The release of the documents - such a resolution published only for the third time in CPC’s 100-year history - strengthens President Xi Jinping’s dominance in the run-up to what is likely to be a precedent-breaking third term to begin late 2022 while enshrining his vision “Xi Jinping Thought” in China’s and CPC’s history.On the Tiananmen massacre, the resolution said: “In the late spring and early summer of 1989, a severe political disturbance took place in China as a result of the international and domestic climates at the time, and was egged on by hostile anti-communist and anti-socialist forces abroad.”“With the people’s backing, the party and the government took a clear stand against the turmoil, defending China’s socialist state power and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people,” the resolution said.It singled out corruption as a major problem.“The (CPC) central committee has stressed that corruption is the greatest threat to the party’s long-term governance. The fight against corruption is a major political struggle that the party cannot and must not lose. If we let a few hundred corrupt officials slip through the cracks, we would let down all 1.4 billion Chinese people,” the resolution said.The resolution traces a historical overview of China from the “humiliations” of the late Qing empire to the present day, and hopes of a future “great rejuvenation”, emphasising repeatedly that the Communist party is the driver of progress.“Deng launched reforms in 1978 that transformed China from an impoverished backwater into the world’s second-largest economy. His own resolution emphasised the importance of “collective leadership” after the Maoist excesses of the cultural revolution,” a Reuters report on the resolution said.While the new document pledges to continue with “reform and opening” policies, it noted that since their launch, “erroneous trends of thought such as money worship, hedonism and extreme individualism” have emerged.But it is Xi and his influence on China and the CPC, which cuts through the clutter of some 36,000 words, as per Bloomberg, of the resolution.The CPC also saw a weakening of its leadership and corrupt practices in the reform era, it said.Stricter governance, stronger ideological work and more cultural “self-confidence” can help solve these problems, it said, noting that the Xi era had seen many long-term issues resolved.“Party members and officials should be educated and guided to have firm belief in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and to practice it faithfully, and they should keep in mind that empty talk harms the country while solid work makes it flourish.”“The central committee calls upon the entire party, the military, and all Chinese people to rally more closely around the central committee with comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to fully implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and to champion the great founding spirit of the Party,” the resolution said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-era-china-now-blames-foreign-politics-for-tiananmen-massacre-101637124936477.html

It said Syria’s defense systems intercepted one of the incoming missiles. The attack caused no losses, the agency said.Israel carries out raids on Syria mostly during nighttime. Wednesday’s raid occurred shortly after midnight, SANA said.Israel has staged hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled Syria over the years but rarely acknowledges or discusses such operations.Israel has acknowledged, however, that it is targeting bases of Iran-allied militias, such as the powerful Lebanese militant Hezbollah group. It says it is going after posts and arms shipments believed to be bound for the groups. Hezbollah is fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces in the decade-old civil war.Israel says Iranian presence on its northern frontier is a red line, justifying its strikes on facilities and weapons inside Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syria-says-israel-attack-south-of-damascus-no-casualties-reported-101637117447596.html

US, Britain and Nato had said that the debris field in low-Earth orbit generated by the anti-missile test was dangerous for orbiting spacecraft and would pose a hazard to space activities for years."The fragments that formed do not pose any threat to space activities," Shoigu said, as quoted by Russian news agencies.The anti-satellite missile test destroyed Russian spacecraft ‘Tselina-D’ which had been in the orbit since 1982, according to the Russian defence ministry. Shoigu said that the test used a “promising” system that “accurately” hit its target. Russia cited Washington’s move to establish a space force in 2020 as a reason to beef up its defence capabilities in space."The Russian Ministry of Defence successfully conducted a test on Nov. 15 that hit the non-operational Russian spacecraft Tselina-D, which had been in orbit since 1982," the defence ministry said in a statement.Debris from Russian space missile test puts ISS crew in dangerThe test drew ire from the West, with Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg calling it a “reckless” and “concerning” act. At a meeting with EU defence ministers, Stoltenberg said the anti-satellite missile test “demonstrates that Russia is now developing new weapon systems that can shoot down satellites.”France labelled Russia as “space vandals” for producing dangerous amounts of debris.US secretary of state Antony Blinken said that the debris would continue to threaten satellites and activities on the International Space Station which currently has seven crew members on board.The space station has faced frequent issues in recent times, including the smoke alarm incident in the Russian module of the ISS in September. Russia has indicated to leave the space station after 2025 and launch its own orbital station given the frequent issues with the ISS.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-west-criticism-russia-says-anti-satellite-missile-test-poses-no-threat-101637110085510.html

In the meantime, we recommend staying logged in," Snapchat support said earlier in a tweet.Fastly, the cloud company behind a major global internet outage in June, said it was seeing increased errors with origins in a "common cloud provider, unrelated to Fastly's edge cloud platform."Tuesday's brief disruption follows a six-hour widespread outage last month that crippled Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook, after faulty configuration changes on the company's routers.Downdetector only tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources, including user-submitted errors on its platform.

17-11-2021||World||US imposes entry ban on Nicaraguan president, officials||The United States on Tuesday imposed an entry ban on Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, his vice-president wife and his government, after elections that were internationally dismissed as illegitimate.Before the November 7 vote, Nicaraguan authorities detained nearly 40 opposition figures, including seven would-be presidential challengers, assuring victory for long-time ruler Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo."The repressive and abusive acts of the Ortega government and those who support it compel the United States to act," President Joe Biden said in a proclamation."The Ortega government's undemocratic, authoritarian actions have crippled the electoral process and stripped away the right of Nicaraguan citizens to choose their leaders in free and fair elections."On Monday, the United States announced separate financial sanctions against Nicaraguan officials, describing the recent election as a "sham."Britain and Canada also announced new sanctions against prominent Nicaraguans."The physical and psychological abuse of political prisoners at the hands of police and prison authorities is intolerable and cannot stand," Biden said, accusing Ortega of overseeing corrupt courts, police and security services.A firebrand Marxist in his youth, Ortega ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, after leading a guerrilla army that ousted US-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza.Returning to power in 2007, he has won re-election four times, becoming increasingly dictatorial and quashing presidential term limits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-entry-ban-on-nicaraguan-president-officials-101637094924600.html
17-11-2021||India||Centre extends ED director SK Mishra tenure a day before retirement||New Delhi: The Centre on Wednesday extended the tenure for a year of Enforcement Directorate (ED) chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra, a day before he was set to retire, and three days after the government brought an ordinance that allowed such a move.An order, issued by the department of revenue, said: “The President of India is pleased to extend the tenure of Sanjay Kumar Mishra (Indian Revenue Service officer of 1984 batch) as Director of Enforcement in the ED for a period of one year beyond November 18, 2021, i.e. November 18, 2022 or until further orders, whichever is earlier.” On Sunday, a government ordinance amended the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) Act, allowing for ED chiefs up to be given annual extensions that could extend their fixed two-year terms to a total of five years. Another ordinance was brought on the same day to change the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) act to give CBI directors similar service and tenure terms.Several opposition parties have targeted the government over taking the ordinance route just before the start of a Parliament session, and accused the government of using federal agencies to harass political leaders and civil society members.SK Mishra joined the ED chief on November 19, 2018 for two year fixed tenure. Then, in November last year, he got first extension for one year.The SC, while hearing a petition by NGO Common Cause challenging Mishra’s one year extension in November 2020, cleared the government decision but said that he should not be granted any further extension. The SC order came while interpreting the old Section 25 of the CVC Act, which has now been amended by way of an ordinanceThe ordinance, brought in on Sunday, amending the section 25 of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) act, which governs the appointment and tenure of ED Director, states that the ED chief, including his initial appointment (fixed tenure of two years), can get extension up to five years but every extension will be given for a year at a time. The ordinance tweaked the rules to make the extension possible.The government, on Tuesday, also notified its Fundamental Rules (FR) -- overarching guidelines that apply to all civilian government servants -- to bring the rulebook in line with the two ordinances. However, the tweaked FR -- which already provided for a maximum two-year extensions to the home, foreign and defence secretaries, and the CBI, R&AW and IB chiefs -- excluded the post of foreign secretary from the ambit of the exceptions to the superannuation rule, which otherwise says all officers must retire at the age of 60. The government clarified on Wednesday that this was an oversight, and reintroduced the term “foreign secretary” into the relevant paragraph, which now reads: “Provided also that the Central Government may, if it considers necessary in the public interest so to do, give extension in service to the Defence Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, Director of Intelligence Bureau, Secretary of Research and Analysis Wing and Director of Central Bureau of Investigation appointed under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946) and Director of Enforcement in the Directorate of Enforcement appointed under the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 (45 of 2003) in the Central Government for such period or periods as it may deem proper on a case-to-case basis for reasons to be recorded in writing, subject to the condition that the total term of such Secretaries or Directors, as the case may be, who are given such extension in service under this rule, does not exceed two years or the period provided in the respective Act or rules made thereunder, under which their appointments are made.”Mishra’s three-year tenure as ED chief has seen the arrest of several high-profile people accused of money laundering, including former Yes Bank managing director and chief executive officer Rana Kapoor; former ICICI Bank former MD-CEO Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar; British middleman Christian Michel James in AgustaWestland scam; alleged middleman Sushen Mohan Gupta; former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath’s nephew Ratul Puri; and former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The government’s argument was that Mishra’s extension was required to ensure continuity in these high-profile and sensitive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-extends-ed-director-sk-mishra-tenure-a-day-before-retirement-101637173677653.html
17-11-2021||India||India displays logistics capabilities to support forces in Ladakh||NEW DELHI: After carrying out airborne combat manoeuvres in Ladakh to showcase its rapid response capabilities, India displayed its prowess to provide logistics support to military deployments in the sensitive sector in the midst of the ongoing border standoff with China in an airlift exercise codenamed Operation Hercules, officials familiar with the development said. The joint drill by the Indian Air Force and the army was conducted on November 15, the defence ministry announced on Wednesday, two weeks after airborne drills in eastern Ladakh showcased capabilities such as swift inter-theatre movement of troops and weapons, precision stand-off drops and speedy capture of designated targets. “The aim of this high intensity airlift was to strengthen the logistics supply in the northern sector and to augment winter stocking in operational areas,” the ministry said in a statement. The IAF’s C-17 Globemaster III heavy lifter, IL-76 aircraft and An-32s were involved in the exercise. India has deployed 50,000 to 60,000 troops and advanced weaponry in the Ladakh theatre to counter Chinese military buildup and the possibility of any misadventure by the neighbour whose belligerent actions triggered the border standoff more than 18 months ago. Op Hercules was a real-time demonstration of the IAF’s heavy-lift capability, the ministry said adding that the air force played a significant role “in ensuring the ability to quickly respond to any contingency” during the standoff. “IAF has demonstrated its surge logistics capability at short notice in the operational sector. There’s a heavy deployment of Indian forces in Ladakh, with logistics requirements going up in winter,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), who heads the Centre for Air Power Studies. An airborne brigade, consisting of the army’s finest paratroopers, was the centrepiece of the three-day high-altitude combat manoeuvres conducted in Ladakh in early November. The exercise saw soldiers being inserted into a drop zone at an altitude of more than 14,000 feet, with specialist vehicles and missile detachments transported to the exercise area via US-origin C-130J special operations aircraft and Soviet-origin An-32 medium transport planes from five different mounting bases. India and China have hardened their positions on the border row in eastern Ladakh, and also Arunachal Pradesh, going by increased military activities on both sides of the boundary, infrastructure development, surveillance and combat manoeuvres by their armies. Op Hercules came five weeks after military talks with China to cool tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) reached an impasse on October 10. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) did not agree to suggestions made by the Indian Army at the 13th round of talks on October 10. The Indian Army said it made constructive suggestions for resolving the outstanding problems on LAC but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals, while China accused India of unreasonable and unrealistic demands in an unusually aggressive statement. Military talks are unlikely to result in a breakthrough and only higher intervention can show the way to resolving the 18-month-old border crisis, experts have said. In a report submitted to the Congress on November 3, the US department of defence said Beijing was taking “incremental and tactical actions to press its claims” at LAC, despite participating in talks to resolve the crisis. There is no end in sight to the standoff, with army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane stating on October 9 that if PLA is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre so is the Indian Army. PLA has also intensified its activities in sensitive areas across LAC in Arunachal Pradesh after the lingering standoff with India began last year in the Ladakh sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-displays-logistics-capabilities-to-support-forces-in-ladakh-101637173197781.html
17-11-2021||India||‘Nothing to share with media’: Singh Deo after meeting Sonia Gandhi||Hours after meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi, on Wednesday, reportedly over the power sharing agreement between him and Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, state health minister TS Singh Deo said that he had “nothing to share with media” about the meeting. On returning to Raipur from New Delhi, Singh Deo said, “If any developments take place I will surely share with the media …But till now I have nothing to share with you.” This is the first time that Singh Deo met Sonia Gandhi after the tussle between him and Baghel started in mid- August over a power sharing agreement. On August 28, emerging after a lengthy meeting with the Congress high command on suggestions that Baghel should move aside because of a reported two-and-a-half-year power sharing agreement with Singh Deo, the CM seemed to have bought some time. Baghel had said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi would visit the state, especially Bastar. The Congress leader is yet to visit Chhattisgarh.The following day, when Singh Deo returned, he said that he had spoken to the leadership too and they had taken a “decision”. In December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance when the party won 68 of 90 seats, even as the party’s Delhi leadership sought to put out leadership fires in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh emerged as a problem area too. Four state leaders, Baghel, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, speaker Charan Das Mahant and Singh Deo flew to Delhi, all eyeing the chief minister’s post. As Mahant settled for speaker, friction between Baghel and Singh Deo meant that Sahu emerged as the frontrunner, but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-to-share-with-media-singh-deo-after-meeting-sonia-gandhi-101637173136366.html

Taking to Twitter to make the appeal, Poonawall also wrote "The vaccine industry has worked tirelessly to provide enough stocks for the nation."The vaccine industry has worked tirelessly to provide enough stocks for the nation. Today there are over 200 million doses available with states. I urge all adults to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Vaccine hesitancy is now the greatest threat in overcoming this pandemic.The tweet comes as Poonawalla's family-owned company prepares to resume exports to the COVAX international vaccine sharing program for the first time since April. A version of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced by SII -- Covisheild -- accounts for nearly 90% of the 1.24 billion doses administered in India.Earlier in the day, Union minister for health Mansukh Mandaviya also appealed to all eligible citizens to get vaccinated against the viral disease.The government this month launched a door-to-door vaccination campaign to cover all adults with at least the first dose by next month and ensure people also take their second shots.India has reported about 34.5 million infections, the most after the United States, and more than 464,000 deaths.The country has in total administered over 113.68 crore doses, according to the provisional report at 7 am. This has been achieved through 1,16,73,459 sessions. Out of which, 75,57,24,081 doses were administered as the first dose and 38,11,55,604 doses were administered as second dose.

17-11-2021||India||Catch big fish: Top court tells ED as it protects former Manipur CM from arrest||The Supreme Court on Wednesday told the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to catch the “big fish” as it spared former Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh from arrest in an alleged money laundering case. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana said, “You catch the big fish. He is just a small opposition member of legislative assembly (MLA) in a state,” referring to Singh, who is presently the Leader of Opposition in the Manipur assembly. The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli, dismissed the appeal filed by ED challenging an order of the Manipur high court on December 16, 2020 granting anticipatory bail to Singh. The ED, represented by additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju said, “The high court has relied on mere newspaper reports to grant anticipatory bail to the respondent (Singh). He is a former chief minister and is facing a probe in an alleged corruption case investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).” The bench said, “He is not going to run away. The high court has noted that in the CBI case he has already got anticipatory bail. All this has weighed with the high court. We will not interfere.” The top court, while dismissing the petition, kept open the question of law raised by ED. The case against O Ibobi Singh pertained to a complaint made in 2016 in connection with a multi-crore Manipur Development Society (MDS) scam. The CBI began its probe in 2019 into alleged embezzlement of government funds to the tune of ₹332 crore against Singh and four other government officers. In this matter, Singh got anticipatory bail in February 2020. In connection with the case, CBI made cash seizures from the properties of Singh leading to a news report in November 2020 that suggested the ED would soon launch money laundering proceedings against the opposition leader over the cash seized. A total of ₹36.49 lakh cash was recovered, besides an amount of ₹15.47 lakh in demonetized currency notes. Singh approached the high court alleging political witch hunt and agreed to cooperate with the probe. The objection of the ED that anticipatory bail provision cannot apply to cases under prevention of money laundering act (PMLA) was rejected by the high court. It said, “The PML Act is very silent for granting anticipatory bail, however, when a person’s personal liberty is violated, anticipatory bail can be granted.” This finding by the high court was questioned by ED in its appeal before the top court. Singh was directed to cooperate with the probe and was not allowed to leave the country without permission of the ED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/catch-big-fish-top-court-tells-ed-as-it-protects-former-manipur-cm-from-arrest-101637168875899.html

This comes as the Punjab chief minister chaired a high-level meeting with the representatives of 32 farm unions of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) led by President BKU Balbir Singh Rajewal at Punjab Bhawan, earlier in the day.Calling the meeting "successful," Channi informed that "18 points were discussed," and both parties have reached a consensus. "Their demand for a debt waiver will be discussed," he also said.The Punjab government has also asked for a list of people who died during the agitation to award compensation and job for the next of their kin. Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting against the three legislation that sailed through the Parliament and were enacted in September last year. The agitation is set to complete a year this month as the impasse between the protesting farmers and the government remains.Though the laws have been stayed by the Supreme Court, the farmers are still protesting, demanding the government to repeal them.The decision comes as the state is set to hold an assembly election next year and the Congress is seeking re-election while battling major infighting.The Punjab chief minister also reportedly cancelled all FIRs filed against farmers for burning stubble or agricultural waste, while appealing against it. "Channi appealed to farmers to refrain from stubble burning in future as it was hazardous both for the environment as well as human health besides hampering the fertility of the land to an enormous degree," according to the official statement issued by the state chief minister's office.Meanwhile, Channi also announced to enhance the compensation amount from ₹12,000 to ₹17,000 per acre besides 10% of the relief to the farm labourers involved in the picking of cotton, the Punjab government also informed in the statement.The decision has been taken in a major reprieve to the cotton growers and farm labourers who suffered huge losses due to the pink bollworm pest attack on cotton crops.The enhanced compensation amount would involve nearly ₹200 crore in addition to the already approved ₹416.18 crore on account of compensation of ₹12,000 per acre.Agreeing to another demand of SKM to fill vacancies in the agriculture department, senior Congress leader apprised that 141 posts of Agriculture development officers have already been appointed and an equal number of posts would be filled soon to provide efficient extension services to the farmers which would go a long way in supplementing their income, it added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-police-to-cancel-all-cases-against-farmers-related-to-stubble-burning-agitation-cm-channi-101637167402704.html
17-11-2021||India||Senior IPS officer Param Bir Singh is proclaimed offender. What it really means||Param Bir Singh, the former police commissioner of Mumbai, was on Wednesday declared a “proclaimed offender” by a city court in connection with an extortion case. Singh's is the first-ever case of a former Mumbai police commissioner being declared a proclaimed offender, and he was also the second-most senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer serving in Maharashtra.Who is a proclaimed offender?If any court has reason to believe that a person against whom an arrest warrant has been issued by it has absconded or is concealing himself so that the warrant cannot be executed, the court may pronounce him a ‘proclaimed offender’ and make a declaration to that effect.What are the offences for which the court may declare an absconder to be a proclaimed offender?The court may pronounce an absconder as a proclaimed offender if he is accused of any of the following offences:• Murder; culpable homicide not amounting to murder• Kidnapping or abducting in order to murder; Kidnapping or abducting in order to subject a person to grievous hurt, slavery etc.• Committing theft after making preparation for death, hurt or restraint in order to commit the theft; committing robbery or attempting to do so; causing hurt in committing robbery; committing dacoity/dacoity with murder; committing robbery/dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt; attempting to commit robbery/dacoity when armed with a deadly weapon; preparing to commit or assembling to commit dacoity; belonging to a gang of dacoits.• Causing mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy a house, etc.• Committing house-trespass in order to commit an offence punishable with death; causing grievous hurt/death while committing lurking house-trespass or house-breaking; being a member of a group that causes grievous hurt/death while committing lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night.What are the charges against Param Bir Singh?The order came following an application filed by the Mumbai Police’s crime branch, which is investigating an August 20 extortion case registered in Goregaon in northwest Mumbai. The FIR named Param Bir Singh, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and civilians — Sumeet Singh, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Ramnarayan Singh aka Bablu and Riyaz Bhati — for extortion.The complainant, restaurateur Bimal Agarwal, alleged that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against two of his outlets – Boho Restaurant and BCB Bar.

17-11-2021||India||ED chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra gets one-year extension||A day before the Enforcement Directorate’s incumbent chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra was to complete his tenure; the Centre on Wednesday extended his tenure for a year, till November 18, 2022. The decision comes two days after the government brought in an ordinance to amend the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) Act to empower itself to give tenure to CBI and ED chiefs up to five years. Another ordinance was brought in on Monday to change the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act to give CBI directors tenure of five years as well. The government also tweaked the Union government’s Fundamental Rules on Tuesday to enable extensions given to ED and CBI chiefs using the powers granted by the two ordinances.An order issued by the department of revenue said that “The President of India is pleased to extend the tenure of Sanjay Kumar Mishra (Indian Revenue Service officer of 1984 batch) as Director of Enforcement in the ED for a period of one year beyond November 18, 2021, i.e. November 18, 2022 or until further orders, whichever is earlier”. Opposition parties have targeted the government over using the ordinance route before the Parliament session. Congress leader Manish Tewari said on Tuesday that political parties should approach the Supreme Court against the two ordinances, which he termed “illegal”. The Supreme Court had in September ordered that Mishra should not be given any further extension but the ordinance brought in on Monday is believed to primarily benefit Mishra, who has already completed three years as ED chief. Mishra is heading the agency since November 2018. During his tenure, arrest of several high profile persons accused of money laundering has taken place including former Yes Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer - Rana Kapoor, ICICI Bank former MD-CEO Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar, deportation and arrest of British middleman Christian Michel James in AgustaWestland scam, alleged middleman Sushen Mohan Gupta, Rajiv Saxena, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath’s nephew Ratul Puri and former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh among others. The agency has also jointly, along with the CBI, secured the extradition of former liquor baton Vijay Mallya from the UK but it is stuck due to “secret political proceedings” there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-chief-sanjay-kumar-mishra-gets-one-year-extension-101637165515598.html

17-11-2021||India||Meta global policy management head interview: Spending over $5 billion this year on user safety||Meta, previously known as Facebook, continues to be mired in controversy surrounding its allegedly partisan policies when it comes to moderating speech, combating inappropriate online behaviour, and addressing fake news. The company’s head of global policy management Monika Bickert, in written responses to queries from HT claimed that the company ensures users’ safety on its platforms and is on track to spend over $5 billion dollars this year on safety and security. She also argued that the premise of the allegations made by former company employees and whistleblowers, such as Frances Haugen and Sophie Zhang, are false as the firm doesn’t compromise user well-being for profits. Edited excerptsFacebook recently rebranded itself as Meta, what all are the changes that will follow the transformation? We’ve always believed that the ultimate promise of technology is to improve people’s lives, and bring people closer together. Now, we see the opportunity on the horizon to bring people together in ways never before possible. The Metaverse is the next frontier of virtual social connection. This is where we can make the greatest contribution -- in helping to develop the next generation of online social experiences. We’re already building the foundational technologies needed to help deliver this AR/VR future -- our work on communities, creators, commerce, and the next computing platform are the building blocks for a completely new generation of experiences. We are at the beginning of something very important in the history of communication, and we plan to be at the forefront, helping to lead the way. The last decade saw a shift from desktop web to mobile internet and the next decade will be about shifting into the metaverse. Because the metaverse will be inherently social and will connect people in ways never before thought possible, it is the fulfilment of our mission. How does Meta respond to the allegations made by several whistleblowers, such as Frances Haugen and Sophie Zhang, that its policies are detrimental to its users?At the heart of these allegations is a premise which is false. Yes, we’re a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people’s safety or well-being misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie. The truth is we’re on track to spend more than $5 billion this year alone on safety and security and have over 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on Facebook.Has Facebook affected any changes, especially in India, since the allegations and documents became public?Billions of people use our services because we build the best tools to stay connected to the people they care about, to find communities that matter to them, and to grow their small business. And the reason we’ve been able to succeed for almost two decades is because we keep evolving and building. Our vision has always been to foster an ecosystem of apps that create a richer and more interesting experience for people. At the same time, we have developed rules to make our apps work better for everyone and to protect the safety and privacy of people who use them. People, communities, and businesses in India continue to join our platforms every day as they see the value -- the positive ways in which we empower and touch their lives. We’ve made changes to our policies over time to deal with issues as they arose. We stand by those changes and will continue to evaluate our policies to address any new issues that arise. We’re committed to continuing our industry leading work around user safety. How exactly do you identify hate content and inauthentic accounts in a country as diverse as India, where several languages and dialects are used on the social media platform? Our aim has been to remove abuse from our platform. Over the years we have invested significantly in technology to find hate speech and tackle misinformation on our platform. Since 2016, we have invested more than $13 billion on our teams and technology that focuses on safety and security and this year we are on track to spend more than $5 billion in this area. Today, we have tripled the number of people working on safety and security issues to more than 40,000, including more than 15,000 dedicated content reviewers who review content in more than 70 languages. This team is based in over 20 sites globally, including India and covers every major time zone. For India, we have people reviewing potentially problematic content in 20 Indian languages including Assamese and we have hate-speech classifiers in four Indian languages -- Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Urdu. What is the role of the India policy team? How often does the company receive feedback from them?The India public policy team is responsible for engaging with policymakers, civil society and other policy stakeholders on policy development initiatives around a host of topics such as user safety, data protection and privacy and internet governance to shape the future of technology and represent the company’s position in these multi-stakeholder processes. Does the India team have any role in content moderation? Several allegations have been directed at a former public policy head of the Indian team for failing to moderate content because of political considerations? We make decisions on content if they violate our policies, not because of someone’s political position, party affiliation, or political point of view. Our Content Policy team that writes the policies on what is and isn’t allowed on our platforms, operates independently from our Public Policy team, who engage with policymakers. When updating our policies or when looking for input in escalating difficult decisions, Content Policy relies on input from many organizations across the company (including Operations, Engineering, Legal, Human Rights, Civil Rights, Safety, Comms and Public Policy).In these instances, Public Policy is just one of many groups consulted. And, while the perspective of Public Policy is key to understanding local context, no single team’s opinion has more influence than the other. We also have a separate team who enforces these policies.Facebook has often asserted that it remains free of political interference, but have there been instances wherein it has had to alter its stance for fear of political retaliation?Our Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content. We enforce these policies globally without regard to anyone’s political position, party affiliation or religious and cultural belief.What about language-based classifiers? Artificial intelligence, though increasingly used, remains ineffective to identify hate content in several languages, except for in Hindi and English, as demonstrated by the whistleblowers.For most of our history, the content review process has been very reactive and manual -- with people reporting content they have found problematic, and then our team reviewing that content. This approach has enabled us to remove a lot of harmful content, but it has major limits in that we can’t remove harmful content before people see it, or that people do not report.Over the last few years, we have significantly ramped up our efforts to proactively enforce our policies using a combination of artificial intelligence doing the most repetitive work, and a much larger team of people focused on the more nuanced cases. The single most important improvement in enforcing our policies is using artificial intelligence to proactively report potentially problematic content to our team of reviewers, and in some cases to take action on the content automatically as well. In 2016, the vast majority of our content removals were based on what users reported to us. We knew we needed to do better and so we began building technology to identify potentially violating content without anyone flagging it to us. When we began reporting our metrics on hate speech, only 23.6% of content we removed was detected proactively by our systems; the majority of what we removed was found by people. Now, that number is over 97%. We’ve invested significantly in technology to find hate speech in various languages, including 4 Indian languages - Hindi, Urdu, Tamil and Bengali. We will continue to build on this work and add more languages. A lot of the hate speech identified in India has been found to be anti-Muslim (Islamophobic) and anti-Dalit rhetoric, according to several reports. Is there any attempt to focus on clamping down on such content? We do not allow hate speech on Facebook and regularly work with experts, non-profits, and stakeholders to help make sure Facebook is a safe place for everyone, recognizing anti-Muslim and anti-Dalit rhetoric can take different forms. We’ve invested significantly in technology to find hate speech in various languages, including Hindi and Bengali. As a result, we’ve reduced the amount of hate speech that people see by half this year. Today, it’s down to 0.05 percent. Hate speech against marginalized groups, including Muslims, is on the rise globally. So, we are improving enforcement and are committed to updating our policies as hate speech evolves online.Could you please also elaborate on how your budget allocation has changed: is still aimed primarily towards the US, or has it been altered following the allegations?The allegations that we spend more towards curbing misinformation and hate speech in the US than the rest of the world is out of context and does not give a comprehensive view of our efforts. The majority of the resources we have in place to prevent misinformation on our platform focus on content originating outside the United States. For misinformation, one of the primary ways we combat it is through our third-party fact-checking program, which includes over 80 partners globally, reviewing content in over 60 languages. The majority of those partners review content originating from outside the United States.In India, we have invested in building a strong network of third-party fact checking partners. Today, we have as many fact-checking partners in India as in the US - 10 fact-checking partners with the ability to fact-check in 11 Indian languages. In addition, For India, we have people reviewing potentially problematic content in 20 Indian languages and we have hate speech classifiers (automated detection technology) in four Indian languages - Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Urdu. Our Community Standards are translated in 49 languages globally including Hindi, Bengali and Urdu. What does the company think is the future of communication and how does it plan to implement it?In the metaverse, the physical and the digital worlds would converge and it would be a more immersive and engaging experience, creating a shared sense of space with another person and another place. We believe that social experiences will be at the heart of the metaverse. As a social technology company - it is the natural next chapter for us as we help in building ‘bridges’ from our apps on 2D screens into more immersive virtual experiences in the metaverse. Are there any new initiatives the company is planning to undertake to achieve its vision? The next generation of online social experiences will feel immersive and new, this is the natural progression for the internet and of our own work today. It’s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies. If you look at the investments we’ve made over the years -- in communities, creators, commerce and the next computing platforms, like Oculus - you can see this vision starting to come into focus. We have always been about building social connections and with Metaverse we will follow a similar path, starting off with more basic bridges and glimpses in our 2D apps, and eventually becoming central to the way we connect online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meta-global-policy-management-head-interview-spending-over-5-billion-this-year-on-user-safety-101637163775487.html

17-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 18, 2012 — Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray dies; suffers cardiac arrest after a week in a coma||Mumbai: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, the fiery torchbearer of Hindutva politics and architect of sons-of-the-soil ideology, passed away after nearly four months of illness at his Matoshree residence in Bandra at 3.30pm Saturday (November 17) following a cardiac arrest. He was 86.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cancelled the dinner he was supposed to host for BJP leaders on Saturday night following a request from Sushma Swaraj, leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha.“For him, the interests of Maharashtra were particularly important and he always strived to inculcate a sense of pride in the people of the state. He was a consummate communicator whose stature in the politics of Maharashtra was unique,” he said.Thackeray’s general physician Dr Jalil Parkar, who had been treating him since 2009, announced his death outside Matoshree, where thousands of Shiv Sainiks had been keeping vigil.“With great grief and sadness, we wish to inform you that Balasaheb Thackeray breathed his last at 3.30pm following cardio-respiratory arrest. We could not revive him,” Parkar said at around 4.45pm.Thackeray’s son, Uddhav, was with him at the end. Thackeray was in ill health since July, when he was admitted to Lilavati Hospital for ailments related to the lungs and pancreas. His health deteriorated on November 10 and he remained critical for the past week, during which he had multiple-organ failure.Outside Matoshree, visibly emotional Sainiks shouted slogans, even as others burst into tears.Senior Sena leaders all spoke the language of loss and of a vacuum created by their leader’s death.But, one of his oldest colleagues and former chief minister Manohar Joshi told HT, “Thackeray’s death has certainly created a void in the political space but this is not the end.He had foresight and vision to prepare his son Uddhav well and the Sena legacy will be taken forward.’’Thackeray’s body will be kept at Shivaji Park grounds from 10am onwards for followers to pay their last respects on Sunday. The last rites will be held later in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-18-2012-shiv-sena-supremo-bal-thackeray-dies-suffers-cardiac-arrest-after-a-week-in-a-coma-101637161442182.html

17-11-2021||India||Maldives deplores attempts to spread ‘false information’ on ties with India||The Maldives government on Wednesday strongly rejected attempts to spread what it called “false information” using the ‘India Out’ slogan, which alleges that bilateral cooperation between the governments of Maldives and India undermines the national security and sovereignty of the country. In an official statement, the Maldives' ministry of foreign affairs said that the country reaffirms its longstanding ties with all international partners based on principles of mutual respect and understanding, and refuted “false allegations” regarding its ties with India, which the country called one of its key bilateral partners.Referring to bilateral ties with India, the Maldives government said, “…such interactions in the international sphere do not, and will not undermine the Maldives' independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity; in fact, they are designed to enhance the Maldives' national interests and deliver for the people of Maldives.”Notably, the Indian high commission in the Maldives had earlier this year sought government action and greater security following what it called “recurring articles and social media posts attacking the dignity of the High Commission”. The Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the ruling party in the country, had then issued an official statement expressing concern over the “ill-founded and disparaging remarks” against the Indian diplomats.In its official statement today, the Maldives government said it believes false allegations regarding ties with one of the country's key bilateral partners are misguided and unsubstantiated. “The government firmly believes that these views are not the sentiments of the general public, but rather that of a small group of individuals with the objective of tarnishing the country's long-standing cordial ties with India,” said the statement of the Government of Maldives.Talking about the strong bond that the two countries shared, the statement added, "The strong bilateral relationship between the Maldives and India is based on shared historical and cultural ties, matched by dynamic people to people contact. India has always been the Maldives' closest ally and trusted neighbour, extending constant and consistent support to the people of Maldives on all fronts."The statement also laid emphasis on maritime security that is aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership between the two countries and ensuring the safety and stability of the Indian Ocean region.“Support provided by India, on areas such as search and rescue capabilities, casualty evacuation, coastal surveillance, and maritime reconnaissance, directly benefit the Maldivian people. The Government of Maldives has also established partnerships with other countries in similar areas of cooperation, to enhance technical and strategic capacities,” said the statement.The Maldives also reiterated the gratitude of the Government and the people of the Maldives for the countless assistance provided by India over the years, particularly, on instances such as the 1988 mercenary attack on the country, the 2004 Asian Tsunami, the 2015 Male' water crisis, and during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.“India will always remain a true and a trusted friend of the people of the Maldives,” read the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maldives-deplores-attempts-to-spread-false-information-on-ties-with-india-101637150143600.html
17-11-2021||India||Bengal assembly moves privilege motion against CBI, ED officers in Narada case||In a rare move, the West Bengal legislative assembly on Wednesday initiated a motion against two senior officers of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), accusing them of breaching the privilege of the House by not seeking the consent of the speaker before filing a charge-sheet and arresting three Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislators in the Narada sting operation case in May. The privilege motion, moved by Tapas Roy, TMC’s deputy chief whip in the assembly, was accepted by the House and forwarded to the committee of privileges for further proceedings. The officers are CBI deputy superintendent of police Satyendra Singh and ED assistant director Rathin Biswas who signed the respective charge sheets. Both of them were summoned by speaker Biman Banerjee in September. The ED sent a letter to the speaker saying it does not need to seek his sanction, while the CBI wrote that the sanction was given by Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. The agencies later moved the Calcutta high court seeking relief from appearance before the speaker. Banerjee had sent separate summons to the CBI and ED in September, asking the agencies to explain how charges were framed against TMC ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim and legislator Madan Mitra in the 2014 Narada case without his sanction. The CBI arrested the three legislators and former TMC lawmaker Sovon Chatterjee on May 17, hours after filing its charge sheet. The ED submitted a charge sheet against them before a special court in Kolkata on September 1. Subrata Mukherjee, the most senior member among the accused, died in Kolkata on November 4. “I was surprised to see the agencies bypassing my office. It is mandatory to seek the speaker’s permission before filing a charge sheet against a sitting legislator,” Banerjee had said before sending the second summons to the ED, asking its officers to appear before him. On October 4, four junior CBI officers appeared before the speaker hours after a single-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court directed the agency to do so. Justice Rajasekhar Mantha, while hearing a petition from the CBI, said the agency has to respond to the summons as the speaker is a Constitutional authority but also directed that no harsh action should be taken against the officers. The judge asked the CBI to file a report on the discussions with the speaker during the next court hearing. The CBI and ED did not make any comment till Wednesday afternoon. Tapas Roy could not be contacted despite efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-assembly-moves-privilege-motion-against-cbi-ed-officers-in-narada-case-101637154354353.html

17-11-2021||India||Haryana takes a leaf from Delhi's book, starts odd-even rule to tackle pollution||In view of mounting levels of air pollution in Delhi and the adjoining national capital region (NCR), the Haryana government has now decided to impose from next week an odd-even rule in four districts – Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat, and Jhajjar. In addition to this, the state government has also decided to extend the work-from-home option till November 22 for employees in 14 districts, including Bhiwani, Charkhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Jhajjar, Jind, Karnal, Nuh, Mehendragarh, Sonipat, Rohtak, Rewari, and Palwal.The odd-even traffic rule, first instituted in India by the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi, is a modified version of the odd-even rationing system popularised in the US as part of a response to the second gasoline crisis in 1979. Under the odd-even scheme in India, alternate days are marked for vehicles with their number plates ending in odd and even numbers, respectively. Vehicles with registration numbers ending in odd numbers are allowed on the roads on odd days and even-numbered vehicles are allowed on even days.By implementing the scheme, the Haryana government hopes to see a drop in pollution levels and a reduction in road congestion. Moreover, keeping in view the toxic haze in the NCR air, an extension of the work-from-home option has also been deemed suitable.The worsening air quality in the national capital, Delhi, has, in the meanwhile, continued to rise to alarming levels. According to doctors, there has been a spike in chronic respiratory conditions – such as asthma among children. Moreover, prolonged exposure to deadly pollutants could seriously impair the cognitive development of children, health professionals added.Pollution has been hitting dangerous levels across New Delhi and other parts of northern India this month. On most days, the Air Quality Index (AQI) has stayed above 451 on a scale of 500, indicating “very poor” and “severe” conditions that affect even healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases, according to the federal pollution control board's guidance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-takes-a-leaf-from-delhi-s-book-starts-odd-even-rule-to-tackle-pollution-101637144766388.html
17-11-2021||India||Akhilesh says BJP will be wiped out in a ‘wave of change’||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be wiped out in a wave of change that he could “see” forming in the run up to the assembly elections to the country’s most populous and politically important state early next year. Yadav was addressing a gathering of at Ghazipur before setting out on Samajwadi Vijay Rath yatra to Lucknow.“There will be a change in UP in 2022.. for sure. I am watching a wave of change. In coming time, I am confident that from this Ghaizpur (in eastern UP) to that Ghazipur (near UP border in Delhi), BJP will be wiped out,” said Akhilesh.He said the newly constructed 340 km long expressway between Ghaizpur and Lucknow, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 16, was “incomplete”. “This expressway, which has been inaugurated, is incomplete. This is not fully ready. Samajwadis first dreamt of building this (Purvanchal) expressway so that the travelling time between Ghazipur and Delhi reduces, but this expressway is not reducing the journey hours.This expressway will be an expressway of well being [after the SP comes to power],” Akhilesh said.On Tuesday, his party had sought to take credit for “first launching” the highway during the regime of previous SP government led by Yadav and carried out parallel inauguration of the Purvanchal Expressway. On Wednesday, Yadav seemed to continue to take credit for the expressway by praising it.“They couldn’t make a better road than this road in the entire country...tell me if [the] country has a better road than this anywhere,” Akhilesh said.He said if the Samajwadi Party comes to power in UP, mandis for farmers and means of employment generations for the youth will be constructed along the expressway, which will be connected to Ballia.Also Read: Ayodhya yet again on BJP’s priority list as UP assembly elections nearHe asked the people to “remove the bull and the bulldozer” in what appeared to be an indirect jibe at the problem of stray cattle and Yogi Adityanath government’s drive against properties of criminals such as Mukhtar Ansari. The state government said in March this year that it had demolished illegally constructed properties worth ₹980 crore in the preceding 14 months.SP ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Omprakash Rajbhar said his party had shut the door through which the BJP came to power in 2017 in the state and it will now make Akhilesh Yadav the chief minister of UP in 2022. SBSP walked out of the BJP led government in the state in 2019 and is now leading a group of small regional political outfits under the Bhagidari Sanklap morcha which has allied with the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-says-bjp-will-be-wiped-out-in-a-wave-of-change-101637148938669.html

17-11-2021||India||Hyderpora encounter: Mehbooba says her stir against killing of innocents in name of militancy||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday staged a protest against the recent alleged civilian killings by the security forces and demanded that the bodies of the deceased be handed over to their families.Mufti said there had been no accountability for the killings of the innocents in the region ever since the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) had been in force.Four people, including two civilians, were killed in a controversial gunfight by security forces on Monday evening during an anti-terror operation.The PDP leader said she was protesting because the present regime killed civilians in the name of militancy. “Nobody knows if militants are being killed. Three civilians have been killed recently. The government refuses to hand over their bodies to the families despite the latter's demand,” she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.I am protesting because this govt kills civilians in the name of militancy. Nobody knows if militants are being killed; 3 civilians have been killed recently. Govt refuses to hand over their dead bodies to the families despite the latter's demand: PDF chief Mehbooba Mufti pic.twitter.com/nQStxVg5JbPolice said Haider, a Pakistani terrorist, and his local associate Mohammad Amir, were killed along with two civilians - Altaf Bhat and Mudassir Gul - in the encounter in Hyderpora locality, where an illegal call centre and a terror hideout were allegedly being run.Also read | Srinagar encounter: Family of businessman killed in Hyderpora op slams policeInspector general of police (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said Gul was an active associate of militants and was running the call centre on the premises owned by Bhat, who was killed in cross-firing with the terrorists.He expressed regret over Bhat’s death but said he would be counted among the "harbourers" of militants.Amir's father Latief Magray, a resident of Gool area of Ramban district, has refuted the official claim that his son was a militant.Holding a placard that read “Stop killing us, probe Hyderpora killings, end impunity and handover bodies to families”, Mehbooba, along with party activists and leaders, staged a protest against these killings outside the party’s Gandhi Nagar headquarters.A strong posse of policemen stopped the protesters from moving towards the main road.“This cruel government is not even handing over the bodies after killing people. They (BJP) want to convert this nation of Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar into a country of Godse. What else can I say?” the PDP leader said.Asked about the IGP’s claim of there being digital evidence against those killed, she said, “If they had prior evidence, why did police not arrest them, as they have been doing on a daily basis.”“Whenever anybody gets killed in their firing, they dub him an overground worker, and that is wrong. Since the AFSPA has been in force, there has been no accountability and no one’s been answerable,” she said.“They are innocent civilians and their families are being denied even the performing of their last rites,” she added.Referring to a previous incident of fake encounter in which three youths were killed, she said the security agencies made the claim of having digital evidence even then, but the reality is that they have no evidence.Three orchard labourers were killed in a staged encounter in Amshipora village of Shopian on July 18, 2020.In another incident this January, Athar Mushtaq, a class 11 student, was killed along with two other youths in Lawaypora, Srinagar. Mushtaq’s father disputed the claim that his son was a militant and demanded an investigation into the matter.Mehbooba is scheduled to return to Srinagar later in the day after completing her five-day tour of Jammu.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderpora-encounter-mehbooba-mufti-says-her-stir-against-killing-of-innocents-101637145590774.html
17-11-2021||India||Presiding officers favour suspension of lawmakers who storm into well of House||The presiding officers of various state assemblies have said that they favour an amendment in rules to automatically suspend lawmakers who charge towards the well of the House. They have, however, expressed divergent views on a proposal to curb the power of a speaker when it comes to anti-defection cases. At the all-India conference of presiding officers in Shimla on Wednesday, several speakers said a provision - to automatically suspend lawmakers who storm into the well of the House and disturb proceedings - already exists in the Chhattisgarh assembly, while the Lok Sabha also has a similar rule, although it is used sparingly. Any amendment to the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution - the anti-defection laws - will take a longer time as legislative presiding officers have expressed contrasting opinions on a report that suggests major changes.The report, prepared by Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi, suggests curtailing the speaker’s power to decide on anti-defection cases.

In the six-minute video, he refers to the most talked about issues facing India including the battle against Covid-19, incidents of rapes, the crackdown on comedians, and farmer protests.In a tweet, Das said his intention was to remind the country that despite its issues, it is great. “The video is a satire about the duality of two very separate India’s that do different things. Like any nation has light and dark, good and evil within it. None of this is a secret. The video appeals for us to never forget that we are great. To never stop focusing on what makes us great,” he said. “It ends in a gigantic patriotic round of applause for a country we all love, believe in, and are proud of. That there is more to our country than the headlines, a deep beauty. That’s the point of the video and the reason for the applause.”Vir Das clarifies after his ‘Two Indias’ monologue kicks up a storm | WatchDas wrote people cheer for the country with hope and not “hate” and asked his followers to not be misled by edited clips of his monologue.

I take pride in my country, and I carry that pride across the world.”He added to him, a room full of people anywhere in the world, giving India an ovation is pure love. “I ask of you, the same thing I asked of that audience...To focus on the light, remember our greatness, and spread the love.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpleader-files-police-complaint-against-actor-comedian-vir-das-for-insulting-india-101637144498211.html
17-11-2021||India||Number of students opting for private tuitions rose sharply in 2021: ASER||About 40% of school going students were found to be dependent on private tuition classes in 2021 against last year’s figure of 32.5%, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2021 released on Wednesday, said, calling the rise a “natural response” to prolonged closure of schools due to Covid pandemic since early 2020. The report also shows that the maximum number of such students were from less advantaged families.The 16th edition of the report by the Pratham foundation was based on a household telephonic survey conducted in rural areas across 581 districts in 25 states and three Union Territories, between September and October. As many as 76,706 households that included 75,234 children in the age group of 5-16 years apart from teachers and staff from 7,300 government schools were covered.According to the survey, more students were found dependent on paid tuition classes during the pandemic period with their percentage rising from 32.5% in 2020 to 39.2 % in 2021. This figure was 28.6% in 2018 in the pre-Covid times. The jump was seen across states, including in Bihar and West Bengal, where students were found to have greater dependence on tuitions even before the pandemic stuck. “In fact, the incidence of tuition has increased across almost all states- perhaps a natural response to prolonged school closure,” the report states.States like Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Nagaland saw the sharpest increase in tuitions between 2018 and 2021. In Arunachal Pradesh, the number of students opting for tuitions increased by 19.7% from 26.6% in 2018 to 46.3% in 2021, followed by UP and Nagaland where it rose by 19.1% each. In UP, the number went from 19.6% in 2018 to 38.7% in 2021 and in Nagaland, it increased from 27.9 % in 2018 to 47% in 2021. Kerala bucked the trend with the number of students opting for private tuitions dropping from 28.3% in 2018 to 18.8% in 2021. Dr Wilima Wadhwa, director of ASER centre suggests it could be because children may not have been able to attend even tuitions due to relatively higher number of infections in the state during the second wave, which persisted longer than most other states.Also Read | Enrollment in govt schools went up during Covid-19 pandemic: ASER surveyIn terms of gender, the report highlighted that the percentage of girls seeking tuitions remained less than the number of boys. However, from 2018 to 2021, there was a 10% increase in tuition-taking practices of both sexes, reflected in the jump from 30% to 40.3% in case of boys and 27.2% to 37.9% in case of girls.The highest dependency on tuition classes was reported among children from less advantaged families. “Taking parental education as a proxy for economic status, the proportion of children with parents in the ‘low’ education category who are taking tuition, increased by 12.6%.” said the report. This data was compared to the 7.3% increase in children whose parents were in the ‘high’ education category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-of-students-opting-for-private-tuitions-rose-sharply-in-2021aser-101637144198513.html

We represented to him that Rizvi has written a book which is full of lies and bad words for the Prophet. We urged that a case be filed him against under relevant sections of the IPC,” AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, who led the delegation, said. We met Hyderabad Police Commissioner.Ex-Chairman of UP Shia Waqf Board Wasim Rizvi wrote a book that has objectionable statements on Prophet Mohammed. We requested that he be booked.Commissioner assured us of a criminal case.We hope he'll be arrested: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi pic.twitter.com/iQPh6J6hGrThe Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad further said that the officer assured him that the force would register a criminal case against Rizvi. He added, “We hope that once the criminal case is registered, the Telangana government will arrest him as well. This man only wants to provoke Muslims, and is being used as a tool by the anti-Muslim forces. We appeal to peace-loving people and Muslims across the country to file a criminal case against him.”Taking to Twitter, the AIMIM said that Rizvi’s books and speeches were creating enmity against the Muslims, which, the party, said, is likely to cause a breach in peace. It has sought cases against the former UP Shia Waqf Board chief under sections 153A, 153B, 295A, 504 and 505(1)(c) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). His books and speeches are creating enmity against Muslims of India which is likely to result in a threat to the breach of peace. [2/2]The latest controversy surrounding Rizvi is over a book authored by him, which was released earlier this month. Titled ‘Muhammad,’ it has triggered protests in some cities of the country. Previously, he supported the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and, in November 2018, scripted and produced a film titled ‘Ram Janmabhoomi.’ When the Supreme Court, in November 2019, unanimously ruled in favour of  the temple, Rizvi hailed the verdict as being the ‘best-ever.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-leaders-meet-hyderabad-top-cop-seek-action-against-waseem-rizvi-over-book-101637141441108.html

17-11-2021||India||Enrollment in govt schools went up during Covid-19 pandemic: ASER survey||A significant number of schoolchildren in India have switched from private schools to government-run schools amid the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the latest Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey released on Wednesday.Financial distress precipitated by the pandemic, free facilities at government schools, inability of privately-run schools to conduct online classes, and migration caused by Covid-related lockdowns have been cited as the main reasons - in that order - by the respondents of the survey when asked about the reasons behind the switchover from private to public schools.The 16th edition of the report, issued by the non-profit Pratham, was prepared on the basis of a household telephonic survey conducted in rural areas of 581 districts across 25 states and three union territories between September and October. The survey covered 76,706 households, 75,234 children in the age group of 5-16, and teachers and staff from 7,300 government schools.The survey found a jump in enrollment in government schools between 2018 and 2020, going up from 64.3% to 65.8%. In 2021, it has leaped to 70.3%, the survey revealed, meaning there’s been a 4.5% increase in government school enrollment across the country over the last one year.It also means there has been approximately a 6% increase in government school enrollment between 2018 and 2021.On the other hand, enrollment in private schools decreased from 28.8% in 2020 to 24.4% this year, the survey said. In terms of state-wise break-up, the maximum increase in government school enrollment has taken place in Uttar Pradesh and Kerala, by 13.2% and 11.9% respectively, between 2018 and 2021. “Other than Telangana, more than 8% increase in government school enrollment was witnessed in all the southern states [during the same period],” the report said. In Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand, there has only been a slight increase in enrollment in government schools during that period. The survey findings show that government school enrollment has gone up across age groups, but the maximum rise was reported among younger students. For classes 1 and 2, the enrollment of boys in government schools rose 10.9% while for girls the rise was 7.4%, between 2020 and 2021. For classes 6 to 8, the enrollment of boys in government schools increased 5.1% and girls by 2.2% during that period. The overall proportion of girls enrolled in government schools continued to remain high like in pre-pandemic times, the report said.According to the survey, 52% of the respondents, including teachers and principals in government schools, cited financial distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as the reason behind the increase in government school enrollments; 50% said it was because of free facilities available at government schools; 40% said private schools’ failure to conduct online classes forced parents to move their children to public schools; and 15% cited migration during lockdowns as the main reason behind the switchover. The report says changes in the pattern of enrollment will become clearer when schools across the country will completely reopen. The report highlighted that 40% of school-going children have been taking tuitions while schools were shut due to the pandemic, with the trend of tuitions increasing across all the states except Kerala. “At an all-India level in 2018, less than 30% of the children took private tuition classes. In 2021, this proportion has jumped to almost 40%. This proportion has increased across both sexes and all grades and school types,” the survey says.The report says while the availability of smartphones increased from 36.5% in 2018 to 67.6% in 2021, more children in private schools have a smartphone at home (79%) as opposed to kids going to government schools (63.7%). The report cautioned that smartphone availability doesn’t necessarily translate into access to schooling, saying, “Although over two thirds of all enrolled children have a smartphone at home (67.6%), over a quarter of them have no access to it (26.1%). There is also a clear pattern by grade, with more children in higher classes having access to a smartphone as compared to children in lower grades.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enrollment-in-govt-schools-went-up-during-covid-19-pandemic-aser-survey-101637138737760.html
17-11-2021||India||Lack of discussion during passage of bills a concern: Om Birla||Less than two weeks before the winter session of Parliament begins, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that presiding officers’ focus remains on making discussions more “disciplined, substantive and dignified.” He also pitched for more effective working of the parliamentary committees and said lack of discussion during passage of bills is a “matter of concern.”“The decreasing number of meetings of the legislatures and the lack of discussion at the time of making laws are also a matter of concern for us. During Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, we should prepare such a model document that when the hundred years of our independence are completed, there should be uniformity in the rules and procedures of all the legislatures and legislative bodies work to fulfil the aspirations of the people,” Birla said.The Speaker’s comments at the 100th year of the legislative presiding officer’s conference on Wednesday assumes significance as both the treasury bench and the presiding officers are bracing for a stormy winter session of parliament starting from November 29. The Congress and other Opposition parties are likely to raise issues such as Pegasus, Rafale , price rise and extension of CBI and ED chiefs’ tenure through ordinance route. Possibilities are strong that this too would be a disruptive session after the monsoon session was a near washout. “Our focus has also been that the discussions in the legislatures should be more disciplined, substantive, dignified, clarity should be brought in parliamentary privileges, the working of parliamentary committees should be made more effective in the changing context,” Birla said at the inaugural event of the conference. Also Read: PM Modi to lay foundation stone of solar park in Jhansi on November 19Speaking before Birla, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh also spoke on importance of discipline and decorum in the House. He also cited examples of the science committee of the British parliament and the future committee of the Finnish parliament to advocate that Indian parliament and its committees too need to focus on the future. Birla, who faced repeated appeals for allowing online meetings of House panels during the pandemic, said, “there should be greater use of information technology so that the people’s representatives can properly discharge their parliamentary responsibilities.” However, any immediate switch over to digital meetings was ruled out by officials, who said IT will be used for better connectivity and making it easier for lawmakers to work as public representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lack-of-discussion-during-passage-of-bills-a-concern-om-birla-101637136517874.html

The SC, led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, also called out television debates that it said were more polluting than anybody else. The matter will be heard again next Wednesday.Following are the top quotes of the Supreme Court:- Bureaucracy has gone into inertia and they don't want to do anything. Like using sprinklers or water buckets we have to say, this is the attitude of the executive- You all say vehicles are the main cause, but gas guzzlers, hi-fi cars run on Delhi roads. Who'll encourage them to stop this? Delhi says no point in banning vehicles or introducing WFH (work-from-home) if not implemented in neighbouring states. We thought the Commission will give us steps to stop thisAlso read | Centre unwilling to ask Delhi staff to work from home, advocates for carpooling- There has to be some responsibility, not everything can be done through judicial order. What is the reason for the burning of firecrackers in Delhi in past 10 days after Diwali- What we see is the plight of farmers. People sitting in Delhi in five, seven-starred hotels criticise how they (stubble burning) contribute four, 30 or 40 per cent to pollution. Have you seen their (farmers) earning per landholding? We ignore the fact that firecrackers are burning despite the ban- Debates on TV are creating more pollution than everybody. They don’t understand, statements are taken out of context. Everyone has their own agenda- When solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court that nasty appearances were being made against him in the media that he misled the court on stubble burning, the court said it was not misled and such criticism is bound to happen in public offices. "We 're clear, our conscience is clear, forget about all this," said CJI Ramana.- The SC also asks Mehta about how many vehicles were there and how were Central government officials traveling to office. "You don't need all 100 officers in the office, you can instead call 50 officers. There are several government localities, can't they travel in public transport?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hifi-cars-polluting-tv-debates-inertia-as-delhi-chokes-sc-spares-none-101637135037674.html

17-11-2021||India||PM Modi proposes 'one nation, one legislative platform', separate timing for 'quality debate'||Ahead of the Winter Session of the Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday suggested separate timings for “quality debate” in the House as he proposed a slew of reforms. The Monsoon Session was virtually washed out as the Opposition parties disrupted the working over the Pegasus issue and the farm laws.Addressing the all India presiding officers conference, PM Modi suggested that no political mudslinging will be allowed and the debate will be conducted in complete seriousness during the separate timing set aside for quality debate."In a way, it should be the most healthy time and health day of the House," PM Modi said.The prime minister also suggested setting aside 3-4 days for those elected representatives who are doing “something special” for society, when they can share this aspect of their social life in the House. He said that sharing such experiences would be a learning curve for other representatives. “Can we keep 3-4 days in a year in which public representatives, who are doing something special for the society, tell the country about this aspect of their social life as well? With this, other public representatives will also get to learn a lot,” he said.The prime minister further proposed 'one nation, one legislative platform' as a technological boost to the parliamentary system which would also connect all state assemblies in the country.

The matter will be heard next Wednesday.He asked why were firecrackers burnt for 10 days after Diwali. Hitting out at those putting the blame on farmers for stubble burning that is being said to be a major contribution to the air pollution, the apex court said firecrackers were being burst despite a ban on the same.The CJI said debates on television channels were creating more pollution than anybody else. It said everybody had their own agenda and statements were taken out of context during such debates.The court said what it saw was the plight of farmers. “People sitting in Delhi in five/seven-starred hotels criticise how they contribute four, 30 or 40 per cent to pollution. Have you seen their (farmers) earnings per landholding? We ignore the fact that firecrackers are burning despite the ban?" Also read | Centre unwilling to ask Delhi staff to work from home, advocates for carpoolingThe court’s comments came after advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, said the figures on stubble burning would be much higher in November and should be ignored. However, he added that source-based breakup of contribution to pollution was yet to be done.Meanwhile, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said a meeting of the commission for air quality management for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas was held on Tuesday and mandatory directions were issued to all chief secretaries of NCR states."All governments in NCR have been directed to put a ban on construction activities except four exempted categories till November 21. The commission also directed use of smog towers, sprinklers, and dust suppressants in vulnerable hotspots at least three times a day," the SG was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Mehta further informed the court that the commission had directed the NCR states to strictly ban the use of diesel generator sets except for emergency services.Regarding vehicular pollution, the commission asked state authorities to ensure diesel vehicles that were over 10 years of age and 15-year-old petrol vehicles should not be allowed to ply. “Have asked Delhi government to put on road adequate number of CNG buses at the earliest,” he added.Also, industries using unapproved fuels should be closed with immediate effect and industries having gas connectivity should be immediately shifted to gas, the SG said. The Delhi government then informed the court that 90 per cent of what the Centre proposed had been done by it already and the suggestions were modelled on its measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tv-debates-creating-more-pollution-can-see-plight-of-farmers-supreme-court-101637129587748.html

Like any nation has light and dark, good and evil within it. None of this is a secret. The video appeals for us to never forget that we are great. To never stop focusing on what makes us great,” Das said in his statement.He added that the video "ends in a gigantic patriotic round of applause for a country we all love, believe in, and are proud of. That there is more to our country than the headlines, a deep beauty.

The Rezang La battle was fought in freezing temperatures way below zero. Temperatures in Chushul heights are known to touch minus 25 degrees Celsius and more. While the past governments took their time in recognising the 1962 war heroes and the first formal function was held in 2012 lest it upsets the Chinese, defence minister Rajnath Singh and Gen Rawat will not only inaugurate the revamped war memorial but an auditorium containing the photo gallery to commemorate the battle. Such was the humiliation heaped by the Chinese and their communist influencers that successive Indian governments under the advice of the army chose not to upgrade border infrastructure along the LAC lest the PLA used to it make inroads into Indian hinterland in the worst-case scenario.According to the official history of the 1962 war, the Chinese attack on the isolated post of 1800 feet Rezang La began at 4am on November 18 with the intention of blocking the road link between Leh and Chushul via Dungti so that the garrison at Chushul was isolated and starved of supplies. The last Indian guns sounded at 10pm on November 18 with only 14 out of 112 ranks surviving to tell the tale. Major Shaitan Singh and his company major first fought with three-inch mortars, then rifles, bayonets and bare hands without any artillery or air support against the marauding Chinese who attacked the post from two sides.“The fight at Rezang La was hard and bitter… In November 1963, nearly a year after the battle, the dead bodies were recovered by Indian Red Cross. The parties that visited Rezang La saw the place littered with field dressings and blood narks, giving an indication to the heavy losses suffered by the Chinese,” states the official history of war.After the May 2020 transgressions by the PLA on the north bank of Pangong Tso, the Indian troops again occupied Rezang La after a fierce riposte on the south banks of the icy saltwater lake on theAugust 29-31 offensive. It was this counter-offensive that forced the PLA to disengage from the north banks of Pangong Tso as the Indian troops were threatening the PLA garrison at Moldo. On Thursday, Rezang La and the much-decorated Charlie Company of 13 Kumaon under Param Vir Chakra winner Shaitan Singh will come alive again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-gen-rawat-to-honour-epic-rezang-la-heroes-with-new-memorial-101637126057216.html

17-11-2021||India||India, France seek concerted action against LeT, JeM, al-Qaeda||India and France on Wednesday sought concerted action against terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Hizbul Mujahideen and al-Qaeda, including bringing the perpetrators of terror attacks to justice speedily. In an apparent reference to Pakistan, a joint statement issued after a meeting in Paris of the India-France joint working group on counterterrorism said the two sides condemned all forms of terror activities, including cross-border terrorism. The two countries also “stressed the need for all countries to ensure that territories that are under their control cannot be used to plan [and] launch terrorist attacks against any other country, shelter or train terrorist fighters”. France has consistently backed India’s efforts at multilateral forums such as the UN Security Council and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to counter the activities of Pakistan-based terror groups and individuals. It also played a key role in the sanctioning of JeM founder Masood Azhar by the Security Council. Also Read: Day after encounter, 3 detained in Kashmir with around ₹30 lakhThe joint statement described counterterrorism cooperation as a cornerstone of the India-France strategic partnership, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. The joint statement also noted the joint working group’s meeting was held in a month that marks the 13th anniversary of the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai and the 6th anniversary of the November 2015 attacks in Paris, and allowed the two sides to express solidarity with victims of both terror attacks and to “share their resolve to stand together in the common fight against global terrorism”. The Indian and French delegations exchanged views on threats posed by UN-sanctioned terror entities and individuals and “emphasised the need for taking concerted action against all terrorist networks including al-Qaeda and ISIS/Daesh, as well as Lashkar e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen”. This action should include “making sure that perpetrators of terrorist attacks are systematically and expeditiously brought to justice”, the joint statement said. The two sides also exchanged views on banning terrorist individuals and entities and shared information on their priorities for pursuing sanctions and designations against terrorists. The delegations also shared their assessments of terrorist threats in their respective territories and regional environment, and underlined the need to ensure Afghanistan’s territory “does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, regionally or globally, and is never again used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter, recruit or train terrorists, or to plan or finance terrorist attacks in accordance with the UNSC Resolution 2593”. The two sides also discussed various areas of cooperation in counterterrorism and countering illegal narcotic drugs and arms smuggling, and decided to continue sharing information to curb radicalisation, violent extremism, the financing of terrorism, and misuse of the internet for terrorism, and to act against internationally designated entities and individuals. They also discussed counterterror cooperation at multilateral forums, including building on India’s non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council for 2021-22, and the FATF. They also agreed to coordinate for the preparations of the third edition of the “No Money for Terror” international conference to be hosted by India. The Indian side was led by Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary (counterterrorism) in the external affairs ministry, while Philippe Bertoux, director for strategic affairs, security and disarmament in the French foreign ministry, led the French delegation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tackling-terror-india-france-seek-concerted-action-against-let-jem-alqaeda-101637126856319.html

The maximum number of such cases has been reported from Alipurduar district in north Bengal where around 218,000 doses are overdue followed by 140,000 cases in Hooghly district. In Kolkata, around 108,451 people have not taken their second dose,” said a health department official. The prescribed gap between the first and second dose of the vaccine is 12 weeks for Covishield and four weeks for Covaxin. Two doses of any of the two vaccines are required for adequate protection against severe Covid infection and hospitalisation, especially those caused by mutant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In October, the Union health ministry wrote to several states including West Bengal, pointing out that the lag in administering the second dose, asking them to address the issue on priority. “We have stepped up the drive to administer the second dose. On November 16, while the number of first doses given was 241,568, the number of second doses given was 290,145. In October, the number of overdue cases was more than 3.2 million, which has come down now,” said the official quoted above. Also Read: Mamata Banerjee condoles death of Bangladeshi writer Hasan Azizul HaqueThe official suggested there could be plenty of reasons beyond the government’s control for a high number of second dose of Covid vaccines remaining overdue. Citing an example, he said several personnel of the Central security forces might have taken their first dose of vaccine in West Bengal during the assembly elections in April and May but had since left the state. He added that some recipients of the first dose might have died and many others might have been forced to delay their second dose after contracting Covid-19 in the interim. Lately, West Bengal is registering more than 800 new Covid cases daily, showing an increasing trend after the festive season. “Covid-19 safety protocols were rampantly flouted during the festive season. Many were not wearing masks, leave aside adherence to social distancing and sanitisation,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, member of the expert committee that was set up in 2020 to advice chief minister Mamata Banerjee on pandemic-related matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-8m-second-vaccine-dose-overdue-in-west-bengal-101637126496175.html

In an affidavit, the Centre told the apex court that the number of vehicles used by the Central government employees is a minuscule fraction of the total vehicles in Delhi, adding that the action would not make much impact towards improving the air quality.The government also pointed out the directives issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management late Tuesday for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas. The latest directive by CAQM has widened the curb across NCR cities, including the ban on entry of trucks in Delhi till November 21 except those carrying essential commodities.The air quality in Delhi continued to be in the 'very poor' category for the fourth consecutive day as the Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 379 on Wednesday.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta apprised the court about the direction issued by CAQM to Delhi and the other NCR States, asking them to ensure that all industries having gas connectivity run only on gas as fuel failing which the industry has to be close. Mehta said that industries using unapproved fuels should be closed with immediate effect and industries having gas connectivity should be immediately shifted to gas.In a series of instructions, the CAQM advised NCR state governments to allow at least 50% of staff to work from home. It has also extended the ban on construction and demolition activities to all cities in the NCR.For field level implementation of the directions issued by the CAQM, the commission has directed five states to submit a compliance report before November 22. The directions will be closely monitored by the chief secretary of NCR states, GNCTD on a regular basis, as per the official release.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-unwilling-to-ask-delhi-staff-to-work-from-home-advocates-for-carpooling-101637125543723.html

17-11-2021||India||Over 100 women lawyers request CJI to continue with virtual or hybrid hearings||Over 100 women lawyers, including young mothers and main caregivers, have requested Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana to continue with virtual or hybrid hearings on all days at the Supreme Court. They said that it will not only help them but other lawyers too who due to health or other responsibilities cannot attend physical court hearings. In a letter to CJI dated November 12, the lawyers stressed the importance of taking forward the “gains that have been made during the pandemic” due to the digital revolution in courts. The letter has been signed by 103 women including senior advocates Indira Jaising, Geeta Luthra, and Pinky Anand. “…the sudden digital revolution in the courts proved to be a blessing in disguise for a large cross-section of regular Bar, especially women lawyers, young lawyers, and elderly lawyers. Digitally equipped courts became more equal for women lawyers, more so, for women with care-giving responsibilities in the family, pregnant women and mothers having children of tender age as also those who have to tend to elderly parents,” the letter said.Also Read: Delhi HC likely to get first openly gay judge“Not only could they (women) avoid the risk of exposing themselves and their babies to the risk of the pandemic but also managed to continue their active practice from the safety of their homes.”Supreme Court advocate Ruchira Goel, who is standing counsel for the Uttar Pradesh government and a young mother, said that she was back to work within three weeks after giving birth to her firstborn in August this year.“I was working till the last day of my pregnancy. This was possible only because of the hybrid/virtual hearing option,” said Goel.She said that she is able to manage work, which is very demanding and takes care of her baby only because of the virtual hearing option.The Supreme Court resumed physical hearings, on a limited scale, after 19 months on October 21. Currently, virtual/hybrid hearings are scheduled on Tuesday.“We want the option of attending hearings virtually should be allowed on all days. This option (virtual hearing) will help not only women with kids but also other lawyers who have elderly parents or are not able to come to court due to other personal reasons,” said Goel.Advocate Priya Sharma, who has been practicing for eight years, said that this mode of hearing has made it easier for her to take care of her elderly parents and continue with her work. “We just want this to be an option available to lawyers. It is a lot more convenient,” said Sharma.Chitrangda Rastravara, another lawyer and mother of a one-year-old boy, started the discussion about this among women lawyers after the apex court resumed physical hearing.Rastravara, who has a one-year-old son, said that women lawyers have been facing problems while balancing between their professional and personal lives. But as such a set-up was not in place, women lawyers had to make a tough choice either to take a break from the profession for some time or continue with it. “Thinking about such a setup was a far-fetched dream then. But now, when we have invested huge amounts of resources in putting in place such a set-up, which is working efficiently, why do it away?” She said that it took her less than a week to get 100 plus women lawyers, including some senior lawyers, to sign the letter. “The court has been planning to have such a system in place for a long time, especially for criminal cases.”Luthra said virtual hearings will not only help women lawyers, especially those who have children and other family responsibilities but will also help all lawyers as they can attend matters, which do not necessarily need a physical presence, online. “Women lawyers who maybe would have been out of the workspace during the Covid period, as there were no creches and other supporting infrastructure, continued to work as the hearings were held virtually,” said Luthra.She added now infrastructure for virtual hearing is in place. “There are various challenges which have to be addressed, but we cannot get rid of the system when so much effort has gone into putting in place the infrastructure. It will help in reducing the footfall in courts. It will reduce vehicular traffic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-100-women-lawyers-request-cji-to-continue-with-virtual-or-hybrid-hearings-101637124456411.html

The city’s air quality was at the higher-end of the very poor category early morning. The minimum temperature is likely to be 9 degrees Celsius with the maximum predicted to reach 26 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. The minimum temperature on Tuesday was 10 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal and the maximum temperature was 27 degrees Celsius -- one degree below normal.As per the data from the Central Pollution Control Board, air quality index (AQI) at 7am stood at 392. On Tuesday, the average 24-hour AQI was in the severe category at 403. The prominent pollutants in Delhi’s air were PM2.5 and PM10. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.On Tuesday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said that air pollution levels in Delhi may grow worse due to drop in wind speed. “The AQI today indicates very poor category. AQI is likely to reach the higher end of very poor category by tonight and then slip to Lower end of Severe category by tomorrow. Surface Winds are likely to be very calm with a low ventilation index pushing AQI to severe by tomorrow and fluctuate between severe to upper end of very poor thereafter until 18th Nov,” a statement by SAFAR said.

The peak in fire count appears to have reached last week and fire counts are now starting to show a declining trend which is delayed by about 1 week from the previous year due to late withdrawal of the monsoon,” SAFAR statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-air-in-very-poor-category-projected-to-worsen-to-severe-101637121215772.html

17-11-2021||India||‘Pay and recover’ can’t be applied in cases of lapsed insurance policies: HC||The “pay and recover” principle requiring insurance firms to pay accident claims and then recovering them from vehicle owners cannot be applied in cases where the policies have lapsed, the Bombay high court has said.The court said on Tuesday the principle can be resorted to when the contract of insurance and the insurer is exonerated from the liability on account of some breach of conditions of insurance or causes like nature. It added it cannot be in cases where no such contract exists.The court made the observations while hearing an appeal filed by Oriental Insurance Company against a 2014 order of Nashik’s Motor Accident Claims Tribunal holding the insurer jointly liable to pay compensation of ₹6.68 lakh to family members of Milind Gaikwad, 27, who had died in a road accident in 2009. Gaikwad was riding a motorcycle when another motorcyclist Uday Pathak collided with him.Gaikwad’s family staked an accident claim before the tribunal, which held the accident occurred due to Pathak’s rash and negligent driving. The tribunal added Pathak and his insurer Oriental Insurance Company were jointly liable to pay the compensation.Also Read | Led by part-time CM, MVA most corrupt government: Devendra FadnavisThe insurer questioned the tribunal’s order primarily saying there was no subsisting insurance contract between the company and Pathak on the date of the incident. It added the tribunal erred in holding the company jointly liable.The high court accepted the contention, noticing that the insurance certificate specifically mentioned that the policy was valid from October 17, 2006, to October 16, 2007, and as such expired long before the accident.It held the insurance company cannot be held jointly liable for paying the compensation.The claimants urged the court to apply the principle of “pay and recover”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pay-and-recover-can-t-be-applied-in-cases-of-lapsed-insurance-policies-hc-101637119415678.html

Back then, even a wheelchair could not go inside because there was no ramp. However, now ramps are non-negotiable,” Dr. Kumar, who was awarded Padma Shri last week, said.Accessibility at the polling sites is an ongoing conversation at the election commission. During the general elections, lots of measures were taken regarding ramps, sensitisation of personnel and Braille markings on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs)… and now, with the upcoming elections, we continue to improve and rectify voter accessibility,” she told HT. Also Read: PM Modi to inaugurate first global summit on pharma sector tomorrowIn June 2020, EC invited Dr Kumar to partner with them to benefit from her expertise in diversity and inclusion to create a more pleasant voting experience for the marginalised sections. “Accessible voting has become a major agenda for the EC, so, I was able to contribute from three points of view. The first was from a diversity and inclusion consultant’s point of view. The second was from being differently-abled myself due to polio; and the third emanating from the principle of leaving no voter behind,” explained Dr. Kumar.Dr Niru Kumar began her gender inclusionary work 15 years ago when there were no formal conversations around gender diversity in the public and private spheres. She began by visiting several industrial plant locations in remote areas, like Renusagar in Uttar Pradesh, where she shared her knowledge about gender intelligence which enables understanding of gender differences instead of simply acknowledging them. “Initially, I was hesitant to go to these locations, but once I understood the value of the conversations and the transformation that took place amongst people, I found the process very fulfilling,” the Padma Shri awardee said.So far, EC’s National Icon has worked in the private sector with multinational companies like Pepsi Co., Vodafone and Walmart. However, she aspires to work in the public sector. “I want to bring diversity and inclusion in the government… Now with the Padma Shri, I have a voice which will not go unheard,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-who-helped-make-voting-accessible-for-differently-abled-says-change-is-happening-101637118575432.html

So they can say or offer anything. People of Goa are very smart and they won't take such things seriously,” Sawant said.In recent days, the AAP and the BJP have engaged in a war of words over the copying of welfare schemes for Goa.

The 4.7-kilometre long stretch allows devotees from India to pay a visit to the Gurudwara without a visa. Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev lived and died at this Gurdwara at the start of the 16th century.When was the idea proposed?In 1999, the Indian and the Pakistani governments proposed the idea of the Kartarpur corridor as a part of the New Delhi-Lahore bus diplomacy.In 2018, the foundation stone of the corridor was laid on the Indian side on November 26. And on November 28, the stone was laid on the Pakistani side.When was the corridor inaugurated?Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated the Kartarpur corridor in November 2019 as part of the commemoration of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak at a colourful ceremony, paving the way for Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit one of their religion’s holiest sites in Pakistan without a visa.Also Read| Captain thanks Modi for ‘timely opening’ of Kartarpur Sahib corridorHow many pilgrims have visited the corridor since inauguration?According to a report by Hindustan Times last year, more than 59,000 pilgrims visited the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur from its opening in 2019 up to March 8.The external affairs ministry said last week that it expects Pakistan to allow a visit this month by a group of 1,500 pilgrims on the occasion of Guruparab.How to register?The Centre has come up with an online portal (prakashpurb550.mha.gov.in) through which pilgrims can register themselves and choose their date of travel.They will receive an SMS and email confirmation of registration three or four days in advance of the date of travel.

17-11-2021||India||For 1st time, number of fully jabbed surpasses partially vaccinated||For the first time since the start of India’s vaccination programme, the number of people in the country who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 has surpassed those who are partially vaccinated, data shows.The development comes on the back of several weeks of the administration of second doses outstripping that of first doses, a trend that became very clear through October and November as the vaccine coverage reached 80% of the eligible population (at least one dose), a level at which experts expect it to hit a ceiling.As of Tuesday night, of the 755.4 million people who have received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine in India, 380.7 million people are fully vaccinated (have received both shots) and another 374.7 million have received only one shot, according to data from the CoWIN dashboard. When seen alongside India’s estimated population of 940 million adults, this means that 40.3% of the country’s adults have been fully vaccinated while another 40.2% have been given a single jab so far.The mathematical significance of this number is that, in combination with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masking and social distancing, 40% was the level of exposure (or vaccination) at which herd immunity was expected to set in according to a model created by researchers at the University of Nottingham and the University of Stockholm.On Tuesday, India recorded 10,351 new cases of Covid, pushing the case rate to the lowest in 274 days. Thus far, the country has reported nearly 34.5 million Covid-19 cases and 464,213 deaths from the viral disease.According to data maintained by the website Our World in Data, on average, 54.1% of India’s population (the entire population, not just those above 18 years) have received at least one shot of the vaccine, while 26.8% are fully vaccinated. The global average for these figures is 52.2% and 40.9%, respectively. This means that while India leads the global average in total coverage, it is considerably behind in the proportion of people fully vaccinated.The gap can be partly attributed to the revision of the prescribed gap between the two doses in the case of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield (a vaccine that accounts for nearly 90% of all doses administered in the country). On May 13, the Union health ministry announced the widening of the gap between the doses of Covishield from 4-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks. And due to the large proportion of those vaccinated having received Covishield, this change in policy has had a cascading effect on the number of people getting second doses. It has ended up having a plateauing effect on the total number of people completely vaccinated in the country (see chart) after mid-May, even as more people received first doses.The country, however, has been closing this gap since the start of October, when administration of second doses started outstripping that of first doses. The number of people who have been administered just one dose of the vaccine have been steadily dropping since the first week of October, data shows.Officials fear that a drop in first doses with nearly 20% of the country yet to be given even a single dose can dent the larger goal of fully vaccinating all of India’s adults by the end of the year -- holding on to their aim of universal vaccination, something no country has managed to achieve.On Tuesday, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya stressed that the completion of the Covid-19 vaccination drive with 100% administration of both the doses to India’s adults is an “immediate necessity.”“We have to all ensure that everybody is vaccinated,” he said. Mandaviya was interacting with stakeholders helping the government in furthering the reach and coverage of vaccination under the government’s ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive under which officials are conducting door-to-door vaccinations of people eligible for second dose as well as those who are yet to be administered their first jab.As part of this push earlier this month, the Union government directed all states to plan to achieve at least 90% first dose coverage by the end of the November, stressing on the need to accelerate the immunisation drive in several regions with relatively lower coverage rates.Experts said that a brief drop in vaccination rate for first dose administration was expected due to the festive season and may not immediately be a cause for concern. “People who are yet to receive even a single dose of the vaccine generally tend to be a little more wary of any side effects they may get from their first shot. I have a feeling that since there have been so many festivals in the country from October onwards, many people would have delayed getting their first jabs because they did not want to experience side-effects like fever that may hamper their celebrations... Hopefully should see the first dose administration pick up again soon,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.But at 80.5% coverage, India may have well hit saturation coverage of all those willing to take the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-1st-time-number-of-fully-jabbed-surpasses-partially-vaccinated-101637107123531.html
17-11-2021||India||Mehbooba Mufti: BJP govt creating rift between Hindus, Muslims||People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chief and former J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of polarising people ahead of the next year’s assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Addressing PDP workers at the party’s headquarters here on the penultimate day of her six-day visit to Jammu, Mehbooba said, “The biggest problem confronting the youth is unemployment, which the present government has failed to resolve. Farmers have been agitating for more than a year, but there is no one to listen to them. On the contrary, efforts are being made to polarise the people in the name of Hindu and Muslim.”“This government only knows about Hindu-Muslim politics, which started from Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. This is the plan of this government to get votes,” she added. “Similar attempts are being made here in Jammu to poison the society,” the PDP chief said. She recalled how she grew up in Jammu in the house of a Hindu, but never felt any difference between a Hindu and a Muslim. She advised the youth against falling prey to the BJP’s “machinations” in Jammu. “Instead, you should ask them (BJP) about how many locals have got jobs in power projects and factories set up here following the abrogation of Article 370,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mehbooba-mufti-bjp-govt-creating-rift-between-hindus-muslims-101637091390227.html
17-11-2021||India||Missing woman in Kasganj case not a minor, say police||A woman whose alleged abduction led to the police interrogating a 22-year-old man, who died in police custody in Uttar Pradesh’s Kasganj town last week, is 19 and not a minor as claimed by her father earlier, police said on Tuesday.The woman’s father had filed a First Information Report on November 9, alleging that his 16-year-old daughter was abducted by two men, one of whom was identified as 22-year-old Altaf. On November 9, police picked up Altaf from his home for interrogation in the case. He was found dead in police custody the next day with police claiming that he died by suicide and his family saying that policemen tortured him to death. Five policemen have been suspended since and an investigation is on.The Hindu woman was found by police on Friday and presented before a local court in Kasganj on Monday when she recorded her statement. She was allowed to go with her father on Tuesday. “It has now being learnt that the girl was born in month of March of year 2002 and was thus not a minor when she was allegedly kidnapped. It was her father who stated that his daughter was a minor,” said superintendent of police (SP) for Kasganj, Rohan Pramod Botre. He said police will remove section 363 of the Indian Penal Code (kidnapping) invoked in the “The matter will continue in investigation as case under section 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage) of the Indian Penal Code,” added the SP. Police also dropped the idea of adding relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, said the SP.Kasganj police is yet to arrest unidentified friend of Altaf mentioned in the FIR. Altaf, a resident of Ahroli village of Kasganj district, worked as a tile fixer and was accused on November 8 of abducting and eloping with the Hindu woman by her family. A case was registered at the Sadar Kotwali police station of Kasganj under Sections 363 and 366 against Altaf. Police said during the interrogation, he went to the washroom at the police station and he hanged himself to death from the tap. “The accused was wearing a jacket with a hood and used its string which he tied to the tap in the toilet and hanged himself,” said additional superintendent of police AK Singh. But the family pointed out that the tap was made of plastic, and fixed in the washroom just a couple of feet from the floor.His father, Chand Mian, wrote to a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday, threatening to go on a hunger strike if his demand for a CBI or judicial probe was not met with within a week. A murder case has been filed against unidentified policemen. An inquiry ordered by Kasganj district magistrate is on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/missing-woman-in-kasganj-case-not-a-minor-say-police-101637090189973.html
17-11-2021||India||NITI Aayog lists 11 measures to improve school education system||NITI Aayog, the Centre’s public policy think tank, has suggested 11 measures to improve the country’s school education system, especially learning outcomes, for effective implementation of National Education Policy, 2020. The recommendations, released as part of a report Systemic Transformation of School Education on Tuesday, are based on findings of NITI Aayog’s Sustainable Action for Transforming Human Capital (SATH-Education) initiative, which was launched in 2017 to identify and build three ‘role model’ states -- Jharkhand, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh -- for the school education sector. Officials familiar with the matter said the interventions undertaken by these states under the initiative resulted in an average 20% improvement in the education system in the past few years. The report referred to an instance in which the learning level of 15-25% children in Madhya Pradesh was found to have increased in the two months between baseline and midline (far more than what was seen in the same duration in previous years). The experiences of these states and learnings from measures taken by four other states, namely Rajasthan, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, has helped NITI Aayog chalk out 11 implementable measures to fix problems in their education system, a senior official said, seeking anonymity. “It is imperative that we make school education, especially, at the preschool level, more inclusive. In our school-level learning process, no one should be left behind or have disadvantage,” NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar said while addressing a webinar on SATH-E initiative. The report proposed interventions in five key areas, i.e, focus on academic reforms, strengthening human capacity, strengthening administrative systems, driving accountability and creating a shared vision for change.While the implementation of the Right to Education Act resulted in providing “near-universal access to education with over 96% enrolment of students in age group 6-10 years”, the report said that learning outcomes did not reflect the improved quality of education. The report suggested that states prepare a Learning Outcome Framework (LOF) to resolve this issue. For instance, Haryana has created a unified LOF called Saksham Taalika for classes I to 5 for English, Mathematics and Hindi. Similarly, In Jharkhand, the Learning Tracking Format has been developed to track student-wise learning levels on key competencies for classes 1-8, the report said. It also suggested the need to simplify the assessment process and the need for learning enhancement programmes.To bridge the learning gap, remedial measures are essential, but it is not a long-term solution, the report said. “States need to implement remediation in campaign mode for 4-5 years to bring all children to grade-level,” it added. “The problems in most states are almost similar. These implementation toolkits can be used by state governments to address specific problems. We have given in detail how these measures can be implemented. All the solutions suggested are based on the experience of these seven states (mainly three states part of SATH-E initiative),” an official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitiaayog-lists-11-measures-to-improve-school-education-system-101637090070184.html
17-11-2021||India||Gujarat riots: Wrong to attribute motive to SIT, says SC||Attributing motives to the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) in the Gujarat riots cases is not proper, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday, while hearing a petition filed by Zakia Jafri challenging the clean chit given to 64 people in the larger conspiracy probe behind the 2002 riots.One of the those given a clean chit is Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. Jafri is the wife of slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, who was killed during the communal riots in the state in which the toll was over 1,000, according to government data.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Zakia, accused the SIT of “collaborating” in the crime by either not acting on the evidence available before it, or refusing to probe deeper into the role of certain accused who were caught on tape confessing to their role in the brutal killings during the riots.The bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar took exception to these comments. “So far as your argument of collaboration of police and state officials is concerned, we can understand. But how can you say so about the SIT appointed by this court?” it asked.The bench, which also comprised justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, added: “How can you attribute motive to the SIT which investigated the FIRs as ordered by this court? If we start entertaining this argument, it is a reflection on the SIT appointed by us. When they investigated those nine cases, you made no grievance, instead you appreciated them. Now you are attacking the manner of their investigation.”In 2008, the SIT led by former Central Bureau of Investigation director RK Raghavan was formed by the Supreme Court to probe nine riot cases. In 2011, the top court directed the SIT to examine Jafri’s complaint made to the Gujarat police in June 2006, alleging a larger conspiracy. Finding no substance in the complaint, SIT filed a closure report before a Gujarat court in February 2012. Jafri appealed before the magistrate’s court and the Gujarat high court, and the matter finally reached the Supreme Court in 2018.Sibal read out portions from documents running into 23,000 pages to contend that the SIT “collaborated” in saving the accused, and pointed out instances that he argued, indicated a “farce trial” and a “mockery of investigation” in the riots cases. “We made our grievance even then and based on our complaint before the Gujarat High Court, a public prosecutor was removed from the handling of the riots case trial. But the SIT was happy with him,” he said.The bench responded that the term “collaboration” was pushing the issue too far. “We are attributing motive to the SIT that is appointed by this court. Instead, you can pitch your arguments by saying there was evidence which the SIT overlooked, or there was an error of judgment on its part. But don’t pitch it so high to attribute motives to it.”The bench indicated that it will seek the response of SIT on all points raised by Sibal. “You (Sibal) have made a point. If it is correct, it has to be accepted or rejected based on the explanation to be provided by SIT,” the bench said, posting the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.In an earlier hearing, SIT, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, told the court that all aspects of Jafri’s complaints were thoroughly investigated before coming to the conclusion that there was no reason to take the matter further and add to the existing number of accused facing trial in the riots cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-riots-wrong-to-attribute-motive-to-sit-says-sc-101637089829928.html
17-11-2021||India||Kerala high court: Swap transplant between non-relatives would be permissible||The Kerala High Court has ruled that swap transplant of organs will be permissible even if the donor and recipient are non-relatives, provided a special reason exists. The single-judge bench of Justice N Nagaresh, while passing the order on Monday, also recommended changes in the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994.“In a case where a citizen’s life can be protected and preserved only by transplant of human organ or tissue, the citizen has a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution to undergo organ transplantation, which right is subject only to the procedure established by law. Any law prescribing procedure for organ transplantation should therefore satisfy the test of reasonableness,” reported Bar and Bench, quoting the judgment. The court focused mainly on Section 9 of the Act. While Section 9(3) permits organ transplants between persons who are not near relatives but Section 9(3A) prohibits swap transplantation between not-near relatives. The court said this is illogical and unreasonable. “When Section 9(3) permits transplant of organs to persons not being a near relative, with the prior approval of the committee, there is no logic or rationale to say that swap transaction will not be allowed when members of each pair are not near relatives, even if the committee approves such transaction. Therefore, Section 9(3A) should be read down so as to give full effect to Section 9(3) under which non-near relative transplants are allowed with the approval of the authorisation committee,” it said. The ruling came on a petition filed by two patients and two donors filed through counsel T P Sajid. The wife of one of the patients was willing to donate her kidney to her ailing husband but the blood group was not matching. Similarly, another patient’s son was willing to donate his kidney to father but they also faced the blood group mismatch problem. They submitted an application for swap transplant before the transplant authorisation committee but after their pleas were rejected, they moved the high court.The government counsel justified the action of the committee saying transplant can be allowed among blood relatives or spouses as per the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994. But the court found rejection of their request lacked logic or reasoning.The court stated that it was clear that the act contemplates non-near relative organ transplantation and the condition is that the donor should have a special reason for giving authorisation for transplantation and prior approval should be obtained from the committee. The swap transplantation can also be permitted between non-near relatives and the court directed the authorisation committee to consider the applications of the petitioners afresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-swap-transplant-between-non-relatives-would-be-permissible-101637089710076.html
17-11-2021||India||Kerala BJP calls for NIA probe into RSS worker’s death||A day after a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker was hacked to death in Palakkad, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday demanded a central agency probe in the matter. Identified as A Sanjith, the 27-year-old was repeatedly stabbed to death allegedly by workers of the Social Democratic Front of India (SDPI), the political wing of the Popular Front of India, in Elapully in Palakkad, the police said.A party delegation, led by state president K Surendran, called on Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan and sought his intervention for a free and fair probe. Talking to reporters, Surendran said the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) government was soft towards fundamentalist forces, and he did not expect a fair probe from the state police.“We want the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe the cold-blooded murder. He is the second person to get killed by the SDPI in a month. Another party worker was similarly stabbed to death in Thrissur on Oct 31,” he said the SDPI was attacking leaders of the nationalist forces to create communal unrest. Surendran said that the BJP party workers will be forced to defend themselves if the police failed to take action against disruptive forces. He added that deceased Sanjith faced repeated threats from the SDPI and had approached police several times, but they failed to act. “The BJP is making wild allegations. We also lost some of our workers in SDPI/Popular Front attacks. SFI leader Abhimanyu was hacked to death in Maharaja’s College in Erankulam in 2018,” said CPI(M) youth wing DYFI leader S K Sajeesh.The incident took place on Monday morning when Sanjith was travelling with his wife on a two-wheeler. The assailants, who were in a car, first rammed the motorcycle, and when both fell on the road, they got out and repeatedly stabbed him in front of his wife. He died on the way to the hospital. His wife suffered minor injuries in the fall.The police recovered blood-stained daggers and swords from a roadside locality, at least three km away from the spot where Sanjith was hacked to death. Though police suspect that weapons were used for the murder they said a clear picture would emerge only after forensic examination. Police are yet to arrest in the case. “Our investigation is progressing. We are woking on some leads,” said Palakkad superintendent of police (SP) R Viswanadh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-bjp-calls-for-nia-probe-into-rss-worker-s-death-101637089652387.html
17-11-2021||India||Former collector among TRS candidates for MLC elections in Telangana||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) on Tuesday nominated former Siddipet collector P Venkat Rami Reddy, who a day before quit service to join the party, to the state legislative council under the MLAs’ quota.Apart from Reddy, the TRS finalised the names of five other candidates for the six vacant MLC seats under the quota.While outgoing MLCs Gutha Sukhender Reddy from Nalgonda and Kadiyam Srihari from Warangal were re-nominated for a second term, Padi Kaushik Reddy from Huzurabad in Karimnagar district, Banda Prakash from Warangal and Takkallapalli Ravinder Rao from Nalgonda will be the fresh faces to the council.Soon after receiving the B-forms (party nomination papers) from the TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) at his residence, all the six candidates filed their nominations in the state assembly secretariat. Tuesday was the last date for filing nominations under the MLAs’ quota.Though elections to these six seats are scheduled for November 30, all the TRS candidates are likely to get elected unopposed since the TRS has 103 MLAs in the 119-member state assembly and the opposition parties do not have enough numbers to field their candidates. It requires at least 12 MLAs to elect an MLC under the legislature quota. The Congress has only six MLAs, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has seven and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has three MLAs.Interestingly, Padi Kaushik Reddy, who defected from the Congress to the TRS before the recent by-elections to Huzurabad, was earlier nominated under the governor’s quota. But, governor Tamilisai Soundararajan did not accept his nomination because he did not fulfil the criterion for appointment under the social service category. As a result, the TRS president withdrew Reddy’s nomination from the quota and selected him under the MLAs’ quota.Another surprising choice was of Banda Prakash Mudiraj, who is currently a Rajya Sabha member. Though he still has three more years to complete his term in Rajya Sabha, the TRS leadership chose to nominate him to the legislative council. The move will result in the by-election to the Rajya Sabha seat shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-collector-among-trs-candidates-for-mlc-elections-in-telangana-101637089598322.html

Currently, only a 44-year-old man has tested positive for swine flu and is undergoing treatment at PSG Hospitals in Coimbatore. “But he is a native of Tiruppur,” an official in Coimbatore said. “All his contacts have been traced, their samples have been tested and we have given them a prophylactic Tamiflu.” The man had tested positive on November 12 and is stable. “We are keeping a strict vigil. So far there is only one confirmed case of swine flu.”As per reports earlier and local news, two patients were undergoing treatment at a private hospital for swine flu. However, after a team from the corporation visited the hospital, and checked all the records in the microbiology lab, they found that an error has been made and the lab reports showed negative for H1N1. The administration offered clarification and released a statement. A copy of the lab reports has been seen by HT. The report was passed on to another department, which made the typing error, officials said.

There is a tussle to take credit for the work of SP,” tweeted Yadav in Hindi.Also read | Purvanchal E-way will be lifeline of eastern UP’s growth: UP CMSince the morning, SP workers in red caps rode bicycles and did “floral inauguration” of the six-lane highway.They climbed onto the expressway from the fields on either side with cycles on their shoulders, and then showered flowers on the road.SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said Yadav will begin the fourth leg of the Vijay Yatra on Wednesday morning from Ghazipur and end it in Lucknow the same evening.Yadav said the ‘Samajwadi’ Expressway’s name was changed as part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s habit of renaming SP’s projects and re-inaugurating them.Yadav on Tuesday tweeted pictures and claimed that he laid the foundation of the project in December 2016. “How will BJP be able to wipe out from the pages of history that the foundation for the expressway was laid on December 16”, he said later in a statement.Yadav also said that fighter jets had landed on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway when the SP ruled the state from 2012 to 2017 and thatthe BJP government had copied the feat for the Purvanchal Expressway inauguration.After PM Modi’s address and the inauguration event in Sultanpur, Yadav released a statement. “Even as the (UP) assembly elections are getting closer, the BJP is frightened over rising public anger against it. That’s why the chief minister who sat idle for 4.5 years is on foundation-laying and inauguration spree and spinning false stories of development.”Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister Sidharth Nath Singh told ANI: “I suggest that instead of crying like a child now, he should have had focused on the development of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/purvanchal-expressway-bjp-staking-claim-to-project-started-by-sp-says-akhilesh-yadav-101637089593614.html
17-11-2021||India||IMD sounds heavy rain alert for Chennai, adjoining districts today||The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday issued an alert in Chennai and its adjoining districts and predicted very heavy rainfall on November 18 as the region is still picking up pieces to return to normalcy from two heavy spells of rains a week ago. The city has had a respite from the rains since Friday. However, rain has continuously poured in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu, such as Kanyakumari and Thoothukudi, since then. Low pressure from Monday over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining North Andaman Sea now lay over the southeast Bay of Bengal. The associated cyclonic circulation extends up to 5.8 km above mean sea level, according to a bulletin from the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). “It is likely to move westwards and reach west-central and adjoining south-west Bay of Bengal off south Andhra Pradesh­ and north Tamil Nadu coasts on November 18,” the bulletin read. For the next 24-hours, the RMC has predicted very heavy rainfall at isolated places in Chennai, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts and extremely heavy rainfall in these regions in the next 48-hours. State chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday announced ₹300 crore funds to repair damages caused to infrastructure by the downpour and subsequent flooding. Cooperative minister I Periyasamy also submitted a report to the chief minister on the damage to crops in the delta districts, following which Stalin announced a compensation of ₹20,000 per hectare to damaged crops. Life was thrown out of gear in Chennai and districts, which have been inundated for more than five days due to the downpour. The northeast monsoon season from October to December is when Tamil Nadu receives maximum rainfall. This year Chennai and the state have received excess rainfall. Overnight between November 6 and 7, Chennai recorded 210 mm of rain, and on November 12, the average rainfall was 60.6 mm. Kanyakumari district has reported 83.96 cm rainfall from October 1 to November 15, while 38.99 cm is the average it receives. Municipal administration minister K N Nehru blamed the previous AIADMK regime for not doing enough to mitigate flooding. “There is opposition against removing encroachments, and the previous government hasn’t done even basic work,” Nehru told reporters in Trichy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imdsounds-heavy-rain-alert-for-chennai-adjoining-distts-today-101637089592504.html
17-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu CM Stalin launches new cement brand||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday officially launched a new brand of cement named Valimai (strength) to be manufactured by the Tamil Nadu Cements Corporation (TANCEM) at a subsidised rate.Industries minister Thangam Thennarasu, while presenting the demand for grants of his department during the budget session earlier in August this year, had announced the launching of Valimai cement expected to compete with other popular brands in the market.Thennarasu told reporters that Valimai cement would be available in the market in two varieties – Portland Pozzolana and Ordinary Portland – at ₹350 and ₹365 respectively for each bag of 50 kg. “The cement is of high quality and comes with greater compression strength, and quick setting, and is heat resistant. The cement will be available in the open market and will also be used for government projects,” the minister said.“Cement produced by TANCEM has been used for construction work such as in the departments of public works, rural development and highways. This brand of cement was launched to make available quality cement at an affordable cost to all sections of society.”To begin with, the TANCEM will manufacture and sell about 30,000 tonnes of cement a month. Stalin launched the first sale in the presence of Thennarasu and additional chief secretary for industries, S Krishnan in the state secretariat.Valimai is the second brand from TANCEM, which has been selling cement under the name Arasu. The previous AIADMK regime launched Amma cement named after late chief minister J Jayalalithaa, addressed by her cadre as Amma. “Arasu cement was named as Amma cement, and it will be there,” Thennarasu clarified. TANCEM has three plants in Ariyalur and Alangulam in Tenkasi district with a combined capacity to produce 17 lakh metric tonnes of cement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-launches-new-cement-brand-101637089533408.html
17-11-2021||India||KCR plans statewide stir over Centre’s farm laws||Launching a broadside attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre, Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) on Tuesday extended solidarity with the farmers agitating on the Delhi borders against the controversial agriculture laws passed by Parliament last year and said his party would launch an agitation against the Centre on November 18 in Hyderabad.“We shall adopt a resolution in the state assembly in its next session demanding that the Centre withdraw the back legislations on agriculture,” KCR told reporters after a combined meeting of TRS legislature party and parliamentary party at Telangana Bhavan in the evening.He alleged that the Centre had been adopting anti-farmer policies all over the country. “When the farmers were protesting against the draconian farm laws at Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh, they were crushed to death under the car wheels of the BJP leaders. When the Telangana farmers were agitating for purchase of paddy by the Centre, the BJP leaders attacked them in Nalgonda,” he pointed out.He quizzed the Centre, which was purchasing the entire paddy produced in Punjab, on why it was not doing the same in Telangana. He demanded that the Centre disclose its stand on paddy purchases in various states. He also said he would write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi questioning the double standards of the Centre on paddy procurement.The chief minister announced that he, along with all the TRS functionaries, including MLAs, MPs, MLCs and other public representatives, would stage a dharna at Indira Park in Hyderabad on November 18 in protest against the Centre’s indifferent attitude towards paddy procurement.“We shall wait for two days after the dharna and then step up the agitation against the Centre in various forms. Simultaneously, we shall educate the farmers on taking up alternative cropping this Rabi season,” he said.It is for the first time in the last two and a half years that the TRS chief is putting up an aggressive front against the BJP and the Centre. After making a futile attempt to float the anti-BJP and anti-Congress federal front before the 2019 general elections, KCR had been maintaining cordial relations with the Centre after Modi returned to power for a second time.In Telangana, the saffron party, which had won just one seat in the 119-member state assembly, lost deposits in as many as 107 assembly seats in the 2018 December elections. It bounced back by winning four of 17 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections.Subsequently, it won the by-elections in Dubbak and Huzurabad assembly constituencies, and put up an impressive show in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation last year, thereby emerging as a strong political alternative to the TRS in the state.“As long as the BJP was an insignificant force, KCR ignored it. But now, with the BJP gradually gaining strength in the state, the TRS president started attacking the saffron party,” political analyst Prof K Nageshwar said. “It is a typical strategy adopted by any regional party leader. As long as he has no threat from a national party, he maintains a friendly relationship with it. But once it turns into a potential force, he starts attacking it,” he explained.KCR never adopted any confrontationist stand against the Centre in the last seven years. On the other hand, he extended full support to the Modi government on various issues, including GST, demonetisation, president and vice-president elections and policies related to Covid-19.Even regarding the controversial agriculture laws, the TRS maintained a neutral stand and did not join the other opposition parties in their agitations, including the national shutdown. KCR also agreed to implement central schemes like Ayushman Bharath, which he was reluctant to do initially.“But now with the BJP posing a big threat to his party, KCR started an attack on the BJP and the Centre,” Nageshwar added.Telangana BJP official spokesman K Krishnasagar Rao said the outburst of the chief minister against the BJP and the Narendra Modi government at the Centre was purely a political gimmick to hoodwink the people.“It appears he is preparing the ground for early elections to the state assembly sooner or later, to arrest the growing anti-incumbency among the people,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcrplans-statewide-stir-over-centre-s-farm-laws-101637089531293.html
17-11-2021||India||Caste based organizations drum up support for reservation-related demands||Influential members of the Vokkaliga community are assuring to fulfil reservation-related demands and to out pressure on the state government for releasing the findings of the caste census as part of their manifestos for the upcoming elections to the Rajya Vokkaligara Sangha.The polls to the association, founded in 1906, will be held on December 12 and has seen several leaders make reservations as its main poll plank to secure power in one of the more influential caste-based organisations in the state.Appaji Gowda, a former president of the association and contender for the top job this year, said that it was imperative to get these demands fulfilled.“I had proposed this (reservation change) thrice when I was president in the executive committee meetings,” Gowda told Hindustan Times on Tuesday.The association has 650,000 primary members in 11 districts of the state and 192,000 members in Bengaluru alone, Gowda added.“The caste census was not done properly. Our demand is that the caste census itself is wrong as it would divide the people. Instead a survey should be done to identify the poor in every community and give them help,” he said.Several prominent members of the Vokkaligas and Lingayats, believed to be the two largest caste groups in Karnataka, have opposed any move to release the findings of the socio-economic and educational survey, carried out by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2015.Both Vokkaligas and Lingayats are wary of any change to their dominant position in the state if the findings of the caste census do bring their exact population numbers down.Leaked findings of the caste census bring down the percentage of Vokkaligas from earlier believed 14-15% to around 8-9% and the Lingayats from around 16-17% to around 10%. Successive governments have refused to authenticate the numbers of the leaked findings.Members of the marginalized groups and extremely backward caste groups have approached the courts to release the findings of a survey for which the government spent ₹160 crore.The Panchamasali, the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats, have intensified their demands to be included in the 2A category of the state reservation list and have given the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government till the end of January to accede.Already nursing a feeling of betrayal after being overlooked for the post of chief minister to replace BS Yediyurappa, the sub-sect and its influential seers are reported to have some part to play in the BJP loss at Hanagal bypolls on October 30.Caste plays a huge role in Karnataka’s volatile political and social landscape.The BJP is believed to have the backing of the Lingayats which has forced them to replace Yediyurappa with Bommai who are both from the same community but different sub-sects, analysts said.“Any community will back those who are more likely to come to power,” said a senior BJP leader, requesting not to be named.The Janata Dal (Secular) is backed by the Vokkaligas, found in large numbers in southern Karnataka in state elections, but they support the BJP at the Centre.The Congress has depended on votes of the minorities, backward classes and Dalits among others.The Bommai government has asked for a report from the Backward Classes Commission before taking a decision on the reservation.Vokkaligas, Valmikis, Kurubas and several other dominant communities have piled pressure on the government for better reservation opportunities.The government is wary of the impact it may have on the upcoming zilla and taluk panchayat elections as well as the 2023 assembly elections.The Vokkaligara Sangha elections and their demands are also expected to have significant influence on the yet-to-be announced elections to the Bengaluru city corporation.Gowda said that the community accounts for around 4 million of the over 10.2 million population of India’s IT capital that would get some attention of the ruling and opposition parties in the state looking to gain control of one of India’s richest and biggest city corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caste-based-organizations-drum-up-support-for-reservation-related-demands-101637089473015.html
17-11-2021||India||New I-T rules focus on women, children safety: Centre to Delhi high court||The Union government has told the Delhi high court that the Information Technology (IT) Rules 2021 have a clear focus on enhancing the safety of women and children.In an affidavit filed before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, the Centre said that the new rules aim to remove content such as “revenge porn” and other posts that breach physical privacy. The operation of these rules have in part been stayed by different high courts after they were challenged on the grounds of overreach and for being a threat to fundamental rights.“That the rule protects the dignity of the person whose pictures on the computer resource negatively impact his/her dignity. The content removal within a 24 hours timeline does not result in over censorship and it has to be seen in light of the sensitivity, which is of utmost priority. Rule 3(2)(b) has been issued for the benefit and protection of victims whose sensitive pictures have been leaked online. It is a beneficial rule. Removal of a partially nude picture from its computer resource, on the basis of a complaint received from the victim of such picture, can in no way be said to affect the right of freedom of speech and expression of a user,” the Centre said in the document.The Union government also said that the IT Rules have provisions that intermediaries providing services in the nature of messaging shall cooperate with law enforcement agencies (LEA) to identify the first originator of information related to rape and child sexual abuse material (CSAM).“The significant social media intermediaries shall endeavour to deploy technology-based measures to identify any act or simulation of rape and children engaged in any sexually explicit act, in accordance with the safeguards in the Rules,” the government said.The fresh affidavit has been filed in response to a petition filed by petitioner Uday Bedi, a practising lawyer, who challenged the impugning Rules 3 and 4 of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 which were brought into force from February 25, 2021, as a user of social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Telegram etc.In response to the plea, the Centre said that the government is committed to freedom of speech and expression and privacy of its citizens as enshrined in the Constitution of India. It stated that the rules are meant to benefit a common user using any intermediary platforms, and provide a set of checks and balances for removal of unlawful content or information from social media platforms.According to the affidavit, other significant reasons for enacting the IT Rules 2021 include significant expansion of the online intermediary ecosystem in the last 10 years, exponential growth of social media users, availability of unregulated content on communication devices, growth of online social media platforms, and their influencing capabilities.Last month, the Centre defended the IT Rules saying that it was the legal obligation of social media intermediaries Facebook and WhatsApp to evolve a mechanism to identify the first originator of information without comprising end-to-end encryption or breaching the privacy of a user.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-i-t-rules-focus-on-women-children-safety-centre-to-delhi-high-court-101637089470572.html
17-11-2021||India||Karnataka promulgate ordinance to avoid refunding ₹2000 crore||The Karnataka government on Tuesday promulgated an ordinance to amend the state municipal corporations act to circumvent refunding of around ₹2000 crore collected from land owners, real estate developers and others in building and licence fee, security deposit and ground rent under the Bengaluru city corporations building bylaws.The state government notified the Karnataka Municipal corporations and Certain Other law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021 on Tuesday.“The State Government may, if in its opinion it is necessary in the public interest so to do, by notification and subject to such restrictions and conditions and for such period, as may be specified in the notification, exempt or reduce the fee payable under this Ordinance, for any Board or Corporation or Organization owned or controlled by the Central Government or the State Government,” one of the amendments in the ordinance reads.The ordinance comes days after the Karnataka High Court asked the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) to refund money collected under this premise as it is against the KMC Act of 1976.The court had said that the city corporation had no authority to impose any fees deposited or paid by several petitioners, land owners, real estate developers and others.The BBMP is one of the richest and biggest city corporations in India and has several streams of revenue to funds its yearly budgets of around ₹10,000 crores each year.JC Madhuswamy, Karnataka’s minister for law and parliamentary affairs, had earlier said that the government would come out with an ordinance to save the city corporation from refusing the money and avoid any serious financial impact on the BBMP and its budgets.“Notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment, decree or order of any Court, Tribunal or other authority to the contrary levy, assessment or collection of any amount as fee or penalty for sanctioning plan or commencement certificate or occupancy certificate made or purporting to have been made under section 299A and any action or thing taken or done, (including any notices or orders issued or assessment made) and all proceedings held and any levy and collection of fee or amount purported to have been collected by way of fee or penalty in relation to such levy, assessment or collection under the provisions of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 (Karnataka Act 14 of 1977) or any rules, notifications, order, guidelines or letters before the commencement of this Ordinance shall be and shall be deemed to be valid and effective for all purposes as if such levy, assessment or collection or action or thing had been made, taken or done under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 (Karnataka Act 14 of 1977) as amended by the Karnataka Municipal Corporations and Certain Other Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021,” according to the ordinance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-promulgate-ordinance-to-avoid-refunding-rs-2000-crore-101637089469303.html
17-11-2021||India||Rajasthan government slashes VAT on petrol, diesel||The Rajasthan government on Tuesday decided to slash VAT on fuels, making petrol cheaper by ₹4 per litre and diesel by ₹5 per litre.The new prices came in effect from Tuesday midnight.“In the cabinet meeting today, it was unanimously decided to reduce the rate of VAT on petrol/diesel. After this, the rates will be reduced by ₹4 per litre in petrol and ₹5 per litre in diesel from 12 o’clock tonight,” state chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted.Currently, the price of petrol in Rajasthan is ₹111.10 and diesel ₹95.71 per litre.Despite an estimated loss of ₹1,800 crore in the state’s revenue due to the reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel by the GoI, the cabinet has taken this decision keeping public interest paramount, the chief minister’s office said in a release.On November 3, the central government slashed excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 per litre, respectively. Following this, BJP-ruled states, Punjab and Odisha reduced VAT on fuel to further reduce the prices. Some Congress-ruled states, including Rajasthan, however, had not cut VAT and had demanded further reduction in central excise duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-government-slashes-vat-on-petrol-diesel-101637089171934.html
17-11-2021||India||Bengal moves resolution against Centre’s order on BSF jurisdiction extension||The West Bengal assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution against the Centre’s decision to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) from 15km to 50km of the international borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, becoming the second state to oppose the move through its state legislature.On November 12, the Punjab assembly passed a resolution asking the Centre to withdraw its October 11 order. The third state affected by the change in law is Assam, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power.The resolution was placed before the West Bengal House by parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee under Rule 169 of the conduct of business, and passed amid pandemonium in the House, with 112 Trinamool Congress (TMC) members voting in support and 63 BJP members opposing it.“We see the law as an effort to establish central rule in Bengal through the back door. This goes against the federal structure of the nation. Law and order is a state subject. The Supreme Court had earlier said in one of its verdicts that a state’s consent is necessary for extending the BSF’s jurisdictional area but no such consent was sought from Bengal,” Chatterjee later said.The West Bengal assembly witnessed noisy scenes as the BJP participated in a heated discussion on the issue, opposing the resolution of the grounds that the Centre’s decision was meant to tighten security in areas close to the Pakistan and Bangladesh borders.Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the Opposition in the assembly, alleged that during the debate some TMC legislators made statements that showed their support for illegal infiltrators from Bangladesh and their “anti-India” activities.“A resolution passed under Rule 169 of the assembly has no locus standi,” said Adhikari who demanded during the debate that the BSF’s jurisdiction should be increased to at least 80km in Bengal. He argued that Bengal has turned into a hub for terror groups such as the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), and referred to the recent arrests of suspected JMB members in Murshidabad and South 24 Parganas districts.Among Indian states that share borders with neighbouring nations, Bengal’s 2,216.7km border with Bangladesh is the longest, and covers 10 of the state’s 23 districts -- Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur and Malda in north Bengal and Nadia, Murshidabad, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas in south Bengal.If the BSF’s jurisdiction is geographically extended, then it will cover more than 30 % of Bengal’s territory and include several important cities.TMC leaders said a copy of the resolution will be sent to the Centre.Though they have no legislator in the assembly for the first time since Independence, the Congress and Left parties have stood beside Mamata Banerjee on this issue.Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also opposed the Centre’s move last week, saying it was interfering with powers of the state. On Monday, Left Front chairman and veteran CPI(M) leader Biman Bose wrote to the chief minister.“The Left Front partners will organise protests against the Centre’s decision. We request the Bengal government to immediately register its opposition to the move as it goes against the spirt of federalism enshrined by the Constitution of India,” Bose wrote in his letter.The Mamata Banerjee government decided to introduce a resolution in the legislative assembly on November 12, a day when Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla came to Kolkata for a meeting on border issues with state bureaucrats.On October 26, the chief minister set the tone for the action by declaring that she will not accept the extension of the BSF’s jurisdiction.“This is direct interference with our state’s sovereignty and India’s federal structure. Law and order is a state subject. We have high respect for the BSF but they cannot operate inside our districts. We will oppose this,” Banerjee said in the state secretariat at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-moves-resolution-against-centre-s-order-on-bsf-jurisdiction-extension-101637089110235.html
17-11-2021||India||6 booked for assaulting Muslim man travelling with Hindu woman||At least six people have been booked in Karnataka’s Mangaluru for threatening and assaulting two people from different faiths for being seen together amid a series of moral policing cases in the state.According to their complaint in the case, the two college students, who are around 20, were returning home when they were waylaid by around half-a-dozen people on two-wheelers. The mob then asked for their names and started to verbally abuse them for moving together despite being from different faiths. The complaint said the mob asked the woman among the two why was she with a Muslim and if she could not find any Hindu. The two were later assaulted and warned of consequences if they were seen together again.Police said further investigation was underway.There has been a spate of moral policing cases and hate crimes in the state. The Opposition has blamed Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s statements for emboldening such crimes.“There are several sentiments in the society. Those emotions should not be affected and such should be the behaviour. When such emotions are hurt there is likely to be an action and reaction,” Bommai said in Mangaluru on October 13. “Even youngsters should watch their actions to ensure it does not hurt sentiments of the society. Bommai said there should be morality in society. “We cannot live without it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-booked-for-assaulting-muslim-man-travelling-with-hindu-woman-101637088871084.html
17-11-2021||India||Welfare state must ensure nobody dies of hunger, says Supreme Court||A welfare state must ensure that nobody dies of hunger, the Supreme Court observed on Tuesday as it pressed for the framing of a pan-India scheme to run community kitchens across the states. Directing the Union government to formulate a scheme in consultation with the states, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana also pulled up the Centre for filing its affidavit in the court through a low-ranking officer. “You have to respect the institutions. You are undermining the Supreme Court. We will throw this affidavit. We won’t accept this affidavit,” said the bench, which also comprised justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli.The court was hearing a petition filed by a bunch of social activists led by Anun Dhawan, seeking directives to the Centre and all states for starting subsidised canteens and community kitchens in all states to ensure food security in the wake of the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.On October 27, the court had asked the Centre to come out with a policy decision about the implementation of a community kitchen scheme after taking into consideration similar programmes already in operation in different states.However, when the proceedings started on Tuesday, the bench noted that not much progress has been made since the last order of the court and that the Union government is still in the process of collecting information from the states. It was also noticed that no categorical statement had been made about a model scheme that could be implemented across the country. Apart from the slow progress, what irked the court was the fact that the Union government’s affidavit was filed by an under-secretary despite the court’s directive that only officers at the secretary level and above are competent to file affidavits in the Supreme Court.“How can an under-secretary file an affidavit? Despite the judgment of this court, you let an under-secretary file this. Tomorrow, some desk officer will file it. Is this how you want to treat the Supreme Court?” the bench asked additional solicitor general Madhvi Divan.“We are saying it for the last time. We will not let this continue,” added the bench, prompting Divan to tender an apology. She also informed the bench that the central government is in the process of framing a scheme.The bench responded: “There has to be some focus areas. Focus has to be on some areas in states like Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand where hunger is more.”At this point, attorney general KK Venugopal also appeared in the case on behalf of the central government, saying a meeting was held on September 9 but it did not lead to anything concrete. He further submitted that a scheme can be made in four weeks. To this, the bench replied: “If you want to take care of hunger and save people from dying, no state will say no. Responsibility of every welfare state is to look into this. It is the first and foremost duty of every welfare state to provide food to the hungry people.”It further remarked: “We are concerned about hunger. We are not on malnutrition right now. Food supplements, etc., can be taken up separately. We want all to take care of hunger first...the purpose of this matter is to ensure food to hungry people...for people who are dying of hunger.”In its order, the court recorded: “Finally, three weeks’ time from today is granted to the Union of India to come up with a model community kitchen scheme agreeable to the states/UTs...We direct all the state governments/UTs to attend the meeting to be organized by the Union of India and cooperate with them in coming up with the said scheme, which can be made uniformly applicable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/welfare-state-must-ensure-nobody-dies-of-hunger-says-supreme-court-101637088869854.html

The two walked into the police station to appear for questioning at about 2.30pm. “They have cooperated with us,” the officer said.Journalists Samriddhi K Sakunia and Swarna Jha, employed with Delhi-based news channel HW News Network, were arrested by Tripura police in the early hours of Monday for alleged criminal conspiracy and spread of communal hatred while reporting on the October 26 violence.The two journalists came to Tripura on November 11 for a ground report on the alleged vandalism of religious structures. Later on November 14, two cases were lodged against them at Kakraban police station in Gomati district and Fatikroy police station in Unakoti District.Soon after the two journalists were released on bail, Tripura information and cultural affairs minister Sushanta Chowdhury claimed the two journalists were “agents” of a political party who came to create a communal riot-like situation by instigating people through fake footage and to malign the state.“These two people, who identified themselves as journalists, actually came here as agents of a political party and tried to create communal riot-like situation in the state. They even tried to incite a section of people against our government. I doubt they are journalists,” he told reporters.Reacting to the statement, Trinamool Congress leader Sushmita Dev said, “ I don’t know who they ( BJP) indicated. The religious violence started here with the BJP coming to power. If they claim that there is no such incident, then they should invite some journalists here to see for themselves. And moreover, they adopted the Gujarat model in Tripura and not Bengal. It’s because the Bengal model means development".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-cops-start-questioning-2-women-journalists-after-court-gives-them-bail-101637088811467.html

The content removal within a 24 hours timeline does not result in over censorship and it has to be seen in light of the sensitivity, which is of utmost priority,” the Centre said in the document.“Rule 3(2)(b) has been issued for the benefit & protection of victims whose sensitive pictures have been leaked online.

Unlawful content spreads faster from one platform to another. Hence the intermediaries are required to swiftly ensure compliance action (removal of content) to prevent further loss of damage to individuals or the state,” the Centre said.The government also submitted the legislative intent behind the IT Rules that the internet should be open, safe and trusted and social media platforms to be accountable to the users.According to the affidavit, other significant reasons for enacting the IT Rules 2021 include significant expansion of the online intermediary ecosystem in the last ten years, the exponential growth of social media users and availability of unregulated content on all sorts of communication devices, growth of online social media platforms and their influencing capabilities.Last month, the Centre defended the IT Rules saying that it is the legal obligation of social media intermediaries Facebook and WhatsApp to evolve a mechanism for identifying the first originator of information without compromising end-to-end encryption or breaching the privacy of a user.Opposing the pleas by the social media intermediaries— (Facebook and WhatsApp) challenging the new Information Technology Rules, 2021 specifically the “traceability” provision, which allows the messaging app to “trace” chats and identify the first originator of the information, the Centre has said that these companies cannot assert the violation of their rights to privacy when WhatsApp shares information with Facebook or third party for commercial interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-new-it-rules-enhance-safety-of-women-children-101637088092059.html
17-11-2021||India||Curbs widen across NCR in scramble to fix bad air||The ban on construction work and offline classes in Delhi was extended to all cities falling in the National Capital Region (NCR) and trucks carrying non-essential supplies will not be allowed to enter the national capital, the Commission on Air Quality Management announced late on Tuesday, after officials scrambled for ways to battle the air pollution crisis nearly two weeks after hazardous conditions first set in over the region.The CAQM, states government officials and agencies held a meeting earlier in response to a 24-hour deadline set by the Supreme Court on Monday to meet and prepare a list of urgent action that can be taken, and came as weather forecasters predicted meteorological parameters to remain such that pollution may not naturally be blown away for at least 10 more days.Also read | Delhi asks Centre to clarify data in SC affidavit on stubble firesIn an order issued late in the night, CAQM cited predictions by the India Meteorological Department that show the air quality was likely to remain in very poor category till at least November 21 to issue a slew of new directions.The orders, in addition to the ones above, mention a strict enforcement of the ban on diesel-generator sets and the closing of schools and colleges for in-person classes indefinitely. Industries using fuel are only allowed to run if they use gas, or will need to close, and six of 11 thermal plants in 300km of radius of Delhi will have to stop functioning till November 30.Authorities in NCR “shall ensure that no vehicle of more than 10 years (diesel) and 15 years (petrol) are found plying on the road”, it added.Also read | ‘Pollution-related’: Pvt hospital in Delhi’s diagnosis for respiratory problemsChief secretaries of each NCR state have been asked to submit a compliance report of all these activities on November 22, the order reads.Air pollution in Delhi, meanwhile, rose back into the severe category with the AQI reaching 403 at 4pm on Tuesday. Since November 5, the day after Diwali, the air quality in the capital has been in the severe category for seven days, and very poor for the remaining four. This period has seen hospitals record a spurt in people coming in with respiratory diseases, with some now officially diagnosing it as pollution-related ailments in order to draw attention.The central ministry and the states of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as well as their pollution control boards, attended the meeting.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai later said that the state government suggested the curbs implemented in Delhi be extended to other NCR states.“In the meeting, on behalf of the people of Delhi, we proposed that work-from-home be implemented, all construction work and industries in the Delhi-NCR region be shut for the meantime. The other states presented their proposals too and the final decision and minutes of the meeting are still awaited,” said Rai.According to a person who asked not be named, the Delhi government also suggested a temporary ban on heavy vehicles not carrying essential supplies.A senior Haryana Pollution Control Board official that they have volunteered to temporarily shut down all industries that are not operating on Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and also suggested that in order to bring down pollution levels, two of the biggest thermal power plants of the state, located in Panipat, can also be temporarily shut down.“In the coming days we will also start a major crackdown against all aged diesel (over 10 years) and petrol (over 15 years) vehicles. We are also requesting corporate houses to encourage work from home, so that vehicular emissions can be controlled,” the Haryana official said, asking not to be named.According to the first official, the CAQM was also briefed by the India Meteorological Department, which said weather conditions are likely to remain unfavourable at least for the next 10 days, which meant stringent pollution control measures will have to be taken by all NCR states.The Supreme Court on Monday pulled up the Union and several state governments – Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh included – for the continuing crisis in NCR. The judges gave 24 hours for them to hold an emergency meeting and prepare a list of urgent steps that can be put in place immediately to bring down the levels of pollution in the “forseeable future”.But multiple experts believe steps such as lockdowns and post-facto measures in response to the crisis, will achieve little, causing major economic disruption, and triggering an emissions rebound once they are rolled back.“First and foremost there is no difference in air pollution levels even after the air quality commission is established. With so much fanfare, the Centre established an air quality commission (CAQM) but we don’t know what directions they have issued. They are not under the air or water act but the Commission is a law passed by parliament which has independent power to issue directions and take action against air pollution,” said Ritwick Dutta, environmental lawyer.“The commission has said no construction but we don’t know if even a single action has been taken. There is no will to police. They are not like the Pay Commission. They are a statutory body with power to police. The Grap (graded response action plan) is very clear on what interventions should be made when air pollution has crossed a particular threshold but now they are not even debating the odd-even scheme. Same drama continues every year,” Dutta added.On Monday, experts warned against steps like lockdowns, one of the steps suggested by the court. “It will set a terrible precedent, and show that we are not able to handle the spikes in pollution at this time of the year. We also cannot judge the meteorological factors that will be at play, even if a lockdown is imposed,” said Santosh Harish, fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), told HT on Monday.The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the matter on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-widen-across-ncr-in-scramble-to-fix-bad-air-101637088089311.html

As praises are pouring in from different quarters, Kuttiyamma’s family said she has already started preparing for the class 4 equivalent exam. Last week’s examination was a basic proficiency test in Malayalam for aged people. which is equivalent to primary education and includes basic mathematics. State organised volunteers approach people and conduct their teaching at home.Born in a poor family in Ayarkunnam village, Kuttiyamma never had an opportunity to go to school and married at the age of 15. Though she can read well, writing was quite alien to her all these years. When literacy mission volunteer M Rehna approached her two months, she grabbed the opportunity. “Her only condition was that the teacher should speak louder because she has a hearing issue. She attended classes at home in the morning and evening religiously,” said Rehna, adding that she was moved by the centenarian’s desire to learn more. “She keeps nagging me with her doubts,” said her great-granddaughter M Sheeja, a high school student in Kottayam. When invigilators came for the examination she flashed a toothless smile and repeated her plea to speak louder. Her family members said she was not tense on the examination day and kept the enthusiasm of a school toddler, and was studious enough about her books and pencil. “She made our panchayat famous. She is a role model for many. We salute her enthusiasm and spirit,” said Jiji Nagamattom, panchayat member and education standing committee chief. Interestingly Kottayam is known as a city of letters. It was declared the first 100 per cent literate city in the country in 1989. The Kerala State literacy mission has been conducting classes and equivalent examinations for those who missed their opportunities to learn for many years. Its education centres under the local self-government institutions have empowered many like Kuttiyamma. In 2018, a then 96-year-old woman, Karthiyayani Amma from Alappuzha district cleared the first formal examination under state’s literacy mission ‘Aksharalaksham’ with 98 out of 100 marks. She also got a special mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Maan ki Baat’ programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/104yearold-kerala-woman-scores-89-in-basic-literacy-exam-101637064148073.html
17-11-2021||India||Kartarpur corridor reopens for pilgrims||The Centre has decided to reopen from Wednesday, Kartarpur Corridor, which connects Dera Baba Nanak Sahib Gurudwara on the Indian side of the border with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, Union home minister Amit Shah announced on Tuesday.The visa-free 4.7km corridor was shut last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.In a series of tweets, Amit Shah said reopening the Kartarpur Corridor will benefit a large numbers of Sikh pilgrims.“This decision reflects the immense reverence of the Modi government towards Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji and our Sikh community. The nation is all set to celebrate the Prakash Utsav of Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji on November 19, and I am sure PM Narendra Modi government’s decision to reopen the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor will further boost the joy and happiness across the country,” the home minister tweeted on Tuesday.Also read | Dera Baba Nanak erupts in joy over reopening of Kartarpur corridorPunjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi welcomed the Centre’s decision of reopening the Kartarpur corridor and said the state cabinet will be part of the “Jatha”, which will visit the historic shrine in Pakistan on November 18.“The entire cabinet will be part of the first ‘Jatha’ (group) which will visit and pay obeisance on November 18,” Channi told reporters.”I warmly welcome the decision to reopen the Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor on the auspicious occasion of 552nd Parkash Purb of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji. This laudatory step has fulfilled aspirations of millions of devotees who’ve been deprived of ‘darshan didare’ due to the Covid pandemic,” Channi said later in a tweet.Also read | SGPC jatha to visit Kartarpur to celebrate parkash purbBesides Channi, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, former CM Amarinder Singh, BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh and Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal also hailed the Centre’s move.Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh thanked Modi and Shah for their decision to reopen the corridor. “It will provide a chance to thousands of devotees to pay obeisance at the holy shrine on the occasion of Guru Purab of Guru Nanak Dev ji,” Singh tweeted.The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) leaders in Punjab met President Ram Nath Kovind and Amit Shah on Monday, requesting that the corridor be reopened.A delegation from the BJP’s Punjab unit also met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, seeking his intervention over the reopening of the corridor, which has been closed since March 16, 2020 when the Indian government suspended all travel to and from Pakistan due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Channi, too, had written to Modi and Shah, requesting that the Kartarpur Corridor be reopened.The proposal for the special corridor was first pitched back in 1999 by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his then Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif.Sikh pilgrims from India earlier used to take a bus to Lahore to eventually get to Kartarpur, which made the journey almost 125km long.The Kartarpur Corridor was inaugurated on November 9, 2019 to mark the 550th “Parkash Guruparab (birth anniversary)” of Guru Nanak.The corridor has been touted by the BJP as one of the many accomplishments of the Modi government, and recently featured in the party’s national executive committee meeting held earlier this month.As reported by HT in March 2020, over 59,000 pilgrims visited the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan, since the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor in November 2019 until March 8 last year, according to data compiled at the integrated check post set up at Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur.The government said last Thursday that it expects Pakistan to allow a visit this month by a group of 1,500 pilgrims on the occasion of Guruparab, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.“In view of the significance of Guruparab and sentiments associated with it, it has been decided that a ‘jatha’ of around 1,500 pilgrims will visit Pakistan from November 17-26 via the Attari-Wagah integrated check post,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday.In June, Pakistan denied permission for visits -- on the occasion of the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev and on the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh -- even though both occasions were covered under the 1974 bilateral protocol on visits to religious shrines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-government-decides-to-reopen-kartarpur-corridor-from-tomorrow-101637059168057.html
