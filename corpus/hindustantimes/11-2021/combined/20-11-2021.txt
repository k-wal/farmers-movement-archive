20-11-2021||Mumbai||Swachh survey: Mumbai slips to 37th rank, Navi Mumbai 4th||Mumbai dropped two positions to rank 37th nationwide (out of 48 cities with a population of over 10 lakh) in the Central government’s Swachh Survekshan 2021 survey released on Thursday. Mumbai ranked second out of the thirteen cities that participated in the survey from the state. Navi Mumbai stood fourth in the list, a step down from last year’s third position. Mumbai topped the list of cities under the head of innovative ideas for waste management. In the population category of ‘less than one lakh’, Vita, Lonavala and Sasvad, all three places from Maharashtra, bagged the top three positions. The state has successfully bagged a total of 92 awards, the highest by any state in this year’s Survekshan, followed by Chhattisgarh with 67 awards, said the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in a statement. Among other cities in the state, Pune was in fifth place, followed by Thane at 14th, while Nashik and Pimpri Chinchwad were 17th and 19th on the list. Further down the list, Aurangabad ranked 22nd, Nagpur 23rd, Kalyan Dombivali 25th and Vasai-Virar 29th. For the fifth consecutive year, Indore was awarded the title of India’s Cleanest City under Swachh Survekshan. Surat and Vijayawada bagged the second and third spots respectively in the ‘more than 1 lakh population’ category. As per the final results, Mumbai scored 2,021 out of the total 6,000 marks. According to BMC officials, the overall rank may have slipped due to its poor representation as administrative priorities changed due to Covid-19 management. Sangeeta Hasnale, Deputy Municipal Commissioner of the BMC, said, “It is not like our rank has slipped, but when you look at Mumbai and its challenges with the number of population, you will understand. We think we could not properly represent ourselves as administrative priorities had changed drastically in the past few months due to Covid-19 management.” However, he added, “Our innovative ideas regarding waste management ranges from turning bio-waste into cooking gas, turning waste into energy for generating electricity etc. We have outperformed when it comes to coming up and implementing innovative ideas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/swachh-survey-mumbai-slips-to-37th-rank-navi-mumbai-4th-101637432848195.html
20-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Leopard attacks domestic help, forest guard in Dasna||A leopard, which was captured in a CCTV camera in Ghaziabad’s Raj Nagar locality on early Wednesday morning, reportedly injured two people in Dasna on Saturday afternoon, said officials of the forest department. According to officials, the leopard is a 7ft long adult. Officials of the divisional forest department said they have brought in cages to trap the animal, one of which has been placed near Adhyatmik Nagar on the outskirts of Ghaziabad. “We are suspecting that it is the same leopard, which was captured in the CCTV camera of a house in Raj Nagar, which injured the two people in Dasna. Our teams had launched a search for the leopard.It came out in the open in Dasna on Saturday. As locals rushed to see the animal, it panicked and injured one person and one of our forest guards before it went into hiding again. The victims have sustained injuries on their hands, face and other body parts,”said Ashok Gupta, forest ranger, Ghaziabad. “The distance between the two locations (Raj Nagar and Adhyatmik Nagar) is about 8-10kms. We have roped in teams from Meerut and Ghaziabad, who have tranquilizer guns. We will try to capture the leopard in our cages as soon as possible as it might change its location at night,” said Gupta on late Saturday evening. The two injured were identified as Chandan Kumar (28), who works as a domestic help. He was working at a house in Dasna when the leopard entered and attacked him. He was immediately rushed to the hospital after the attack. The injured forest guard was identified as Sunil Rathi, who is recuperating at Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital. “Rathi has been kept under observation and we have administered anti-rabies and immunoglobulins, besides providing other medication. He has sustained deep wounds on his forehead and shoulder,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the district hospital. Dasna, falling under the jurisdiction of Masuri police station area in Ghaziabad, is adjacent to national highway 9 and is surrounded by dense vegetation and open agricultural fields. Many people reside in Adhyatmik Nagar, Mayur Vihar, Akash Nagar and Dasna town among other neighbouring villages. The leopard sighting has sparked panic among the locals living in and around Dasna. “We were shocked to see the injured forest guard, who was bleeding and was rushed to the hospital. I saw the animal and how it attacked the forest guard. It then ran into a big house and attacked the domestic help there. Thereafter, it came out and went into hiding in the thick bushes,” said Jamuna Prasad, a local who was witness to the leopard attack. Charan Singh, another local, said he saw the animal entering a temple between 12 noon and 1pm. “All locals shut the doors of their house as we sounded an alert about the presence of the leopard. It was trying to find a safe hiding place and was shocked to see so many people. We have asked our neighbours to remain alert till the time the leopard is captured,” said Singh. Police said they have also advised residents to keep a watch and stay indoors especially at night. “The leopard injured two people and teams of the forest department were apprised about the development. Our teams will also help them as and when required,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). Last year, a leopard was sighted in the official residence of vice-chairperson in Raj Nagar. A year later, in the same month, another leopard has emerged in the same locality, barely 500 metres away from the vice-chairperson’s official residence. Teams of the forest department had launched a week-long search but failed to locate the leopard, though it had found its pug marks. Leopard sightings not uncommon in Ghaziabad In December 2014, the carcass of a leopard was discovered from the stretches of Yamuna river in Pychara village in Loni, Ghaziabad. In the same month, another leopard was found dead in the fields of Abupur in Modi Nagar, Ghaziabad and was suspected to have died of electrocution. In April 2017, a male leopard was captured from Krishna Vihar Kuti area, close to Hindon airbase, but only after it injured two persons and a cattle.Besides these, an animal from the cat family, possibly a leopard, was also spotted in Vaishali’s Sector-3 on August 1, 2019. Last year, on December 17, a three-and-half year old male leopard was captured from the Hindon airbase and released into Saharanpur range by the forest department. According to officials, leopard is listed under the Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and included in Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife Fauna and Flora). It is also listed as ‘near threatened’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-leopard-attacks-domestic-help-forest-guard-in-dasna-101637432667359.html

20-11-2021||Lucknow||Cleanliness survey 2021:Varanasi best Ganga town in country||VARANASI In the Union Ministry of Urban and Housing Development’s cleanliness survey 2021, Kashi has been ranked the best Ganga town in the country for excellent work in cleanliness at the ghats and along the river in the temple city and its surroundings.Varanasi had the first rank among 150 Ganga towns in the country, said public relation officer, Varanasi Nagar Nigam, Sandeep Srivastava. He said this was announced in a grand programme organized at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi on Saturday. President Ramnath Kovid honoured UP urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon, Varanasi mayor Mridula Jaiswal and municipal commissioner Pranay Singh with a citation and trophy, he added. Srivastava said that this survey was done in the Ganga towns with a population of more than one lakh, between November 2020 to February 2021. The survey took into account the following facts: garbage should not have been dumped anywhere near the ghats and on the banks of the river, it should not be floating anywhere in the river Ganga, ghats should be completely free of plastic and polybags and a message should be disseminated regarding keeping the ghats and surroundings clean. During the survey, keeping in view the above points, a team of the union ministry of urban development inspected the ghats and river Ganga to assess the status of cleanliness, said Srivastava and added that the Varanasi Nagar Nigam did excellent work on all the points. As a result, Varanasi got the first position in the Ganga Towns Survey 2021. Munger got second, Patna third, Kanpur fourth and Haridwar fifth position. Mayor Mridula Jaiswal said, “Receiving the award from the President is a matter of great pride for Kashi. I congratulate the people of Kashi and thank them for their cooperation in keeping the city and the ghats clean due to which Varanasi won this award. This award is a source of inspiration. Every effort will be made to provide better facilities to the citizens.” Municipal commissioner Pranay Singh said that Varanasi was a religious and mythological city and thousands of tourists and devotees visited it daily. They went to the ghats, watched Ganga aarti and enjoyed boat ride. He said that all 84 ghats were cleaned daily, four to five major ghats were washed twice daily and a separate sanitation team had been deployed for this work. ‘Arpan Kalash’ had been set up at every 50 metre at the ghats so that flowers and garlands which were offered by the devotees, could be collected and dropped in them. Proper lighting arrangement was also underway with installation of high mast lights on the ghats, he said. 4700 sanitation workers keep Varanasi clean City health officer of Varanasi Municipal Corporation NP Singh, said that 700 tonnes of garbage was generated in the city daily. It was disposed of by 4700 sanitation workers who went from door to door and collected it from houses and shops. The 20 garbage dumps built in the city were monitored by CCTV cameras.

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | Going to the movies is a thing of the past||The period between 2019 and 2021 will be etched in the history of the world for rapid transformation and experimentation as the pandemic hit many commercial ventures, small and big businesses and employability. Cinema, catering, tourism and hospitality were the worst hit. Due to a complete ban on gatherings, going to watch movies in theatres seems to be a thing of past. However, such is human nature that we effortlessly and imperceptibly settle into new paradigms, accepting, absorbing, and digesting change, transition and shifts. The pandemic accelerated the change that was already in motion, albeit at snail’s pace. For instance, in their quest for survival, many Bollywood actors, directors, producers have shifted to OTT platforms. Smart televisions with channels such as Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, Max Player, and Zee 5 have entered our mind’s space and time in a big way. Ensconced comfortably anywhere and everywhere, we watch numerous movies, serials, short movies and all kinds of entertainment, sometimes attentively,but most of the time half-heartedly like zombies. We have the option of leaving a film mid-way, to fast-forward the bits we find uninteresting, and to pause for a short break. Though, there are so many things around us, we are still lonely, floating in a vacuum. There is a kind of ennui that we are unable to escape as this unabetted entertainment does not touch us and does not match in any way the joy of watching movies in cinema halls. I still vividly recall the impact of Rajesh Khanna’s debut movie Akhri Khat (1966), which I saw in a cinema hall in Ludhiana. I was just five years old then, but the search of a 15-month-old child (that the director, Chetan Anand, let loose in the city, and followed him with his hand-held camera) for his dead mother made me cry so copiously that I refused to eat my favourite snack during the interval. The memory of the movie lingers strongly even after 55 years. Sadly, the incessant trickling of films, serials and entertainment has diffused the effect of movies for many. It is as if the excess of visuality that is making inroads in our lives circles around on the surface, giving short-lived sensations and effects. They do not make an everlasting impact. With a large number of movies releasing on OTT platforms, we forget the names of the film we saw the next day. There is no comparison to the joy we experience while watching a movie in theatres to the routine act of watching a movie at home or on smart TV. Going to see a movie with family and friends was so much more entertaining! Sitting cosily among strangers, and quietly observing all the norms of behaviour could also leave a much better impact. Covid has ruined one of the most favourite sources of entertainment and outing for many of us. Although, many actors, directors and producers have predicted that traditional cinema will revive and theatres and cinema halls will be buzzing with activity once again, I have my doubts. The joy of watching films in theatres may become history as most of us have gotten used to‘see from home’, and of course, it is economical too. I belong to that blessed generation of cinema-goers that fully cherish the nuances of a well-crafted movie and do justice to the art of filmmaking. In times to come, this phenomenon of going to the movies may well become extinct.sangeetahandadr@gmail.com(The writer is a Patiala-based retired principal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-going-to-the-movies-is-a-thing-of-the-past-101637432307179.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: Three Reliance stores charging for carry bags fined||Acting on the complaints of 27 people, the district consumer disputes and redressal forum has directed the managers/in-charges of three Reliance retail stores in Mohali to refund money charged from them for carry bags. The forum has also ordered them to compensate each complainant to the tune of ₹500 and deposit ₹5,000 per complaint to the legal-aid account of the commission. In 2019, 10 complaints were filed against Reliance Retail Store in Phase 5, Mohali, and four against the Reliance Fresh in Sector 70 for charging money for carry bags. In 2020, 13 plaints were filed against Reliance Store in Bestech Square Mall, Sector 66. Forum president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma said the complainants alleged that the store managers charged them for the carry bags in addition to the items purchased by them, which they had no right to do. However, they had no option, as it was difficult for them to carry the purchased items without a carry bag. In reply, the store managers termed the complaints as frivolous and false. They said that the complainants were charged only after taking their consent and that they were filed with mala fide intention and not maintainable. The forum president said that it is necessary for the stores to provide carry bag/paper bag free of charge to the complainants, as they are definitely a part and parcel of the sale from the money paid for the purchase of an article. The president directed the order be complied to within 30 days from the date of receipt of a certified copy of the order, failing which the complainants will be entitled to interest at 9% per annum on the compensation amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-three-reliance-stores-charging-for-carry-bags-fined-101637432127323.html
20-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad bags 18th position in Swachh Survekshan 2021||Ghaziabad bagged the 18th rank for cleanliness in the list of cleanest cities having a population between a million and 4,000,000 in the Swachh Suvekshan 2021, the results of which were announced on Saturday. During the previous Swachh Survekshan survey, the city ranked 19 while it secured the 13th rank in the cleanliness survey held in 2019. Officials said non-availability of land for setting up a landfill to process waste and lapses in solid waste management hampered the prospects of Ghaziabad in improving its rank in the cleanliness survey. On Saturday, President Ram Nath Kovind handed over awards to representatives of the cleanest cites of the country at the ‘Swachh Amrit Mahotsav’ hosted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs as part of the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi. Indore in Madhya Pradesh emerged as the winner in the list of cleanest cities having a population between a million and 4,000,000. Overall, 48 cities from across the country competed under this category. In the survey, total 6,000 points are awarded to participating cities based on multiple criteria. Under the category of cities having a population ranging between a million and 4,000,000, Ghaziabad city scored 4,220.9 points, which is the second highest in Uttar Pradesh. Lucknow secured the top spot in UP in the same category with an overall score of 4,586.17 points. “The city secured All India Rank of 18 and also received two more awards. We received a 3-star rating for ‘garbage-free city’ (GFC) from the previous 1-star. We will strive for a 5-star rating in the next cleanliness survey,”said municipal commissioner M S Tanwar. “The second award is a national award for ‘best big city in innovation and best practices.’ For this, we tried to eliminate all open solid waste dumping points across the city and also took the initiative of recycling plastic. We also took up initiatives for ‘dust-free’ Ghaziabad. We lost major points in the competition due to non-availability of landfill site. To achieve this, we are trying to decentralise our garbage processing facilities,” he added. In January, 2019, the Uttar Pradesh solid waste monitoring committee directed shutdown of the landfill site at Pratap Vihar, where garbage used to be processed. Since then, the city is facing a major issue in dumping and processing solid waste. According to official estimates, the city generates about 1,200 metric tonnes of waste every day, and there is a shortfall in processing about 700 metric tonnes of solid waste. “To overcome this, we are trying to initiate work at our waste to energy plant at Galand; the work is likely to start next year. We are also trying to plug the gap of a shortfall of about 300 vehicles, which are to be used for door-to-door collection of solid waste. Of this, 100 vehicles will arrive in the next 15 days. We have sent a proposal to the state administration to sanction ₹21 crore for procuring 224 more vehicles. Once these gaps are plugged, we hope our rank will improve,” said the civic chief. Currently, the city has 250 vehicles for door-to-door collection of solid waste collection, which operate in 100 residential wards. The first edition of the ‘Swachh Survekshan’ survey was launched in 2016, with 73 cities in the country participating in the event. This year, the number of participating countries went up to 4,320. A total of 6,000 points are awarded to participating cities on the basis of service level progress (segregated collection, processing and disposal and sustainable sanitation), certifications (GFC for star rating, ODF+/ODF++/Water+) and citizen’s voice (feedback engagement, experience, Swachhta App and innovation and best practices). Ghaziabad officials said the city already achieved an ODF++ ranking earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-bags-18th-position-in-swachh-survekshan-2021-101637431887121.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays| Enabling girls to soar high in life||The sight of a young girl on the street, impoverished by Fate but with a sparkle in her eye, never fails to move an empathetic onlooker. It is no fault of hers that she is compelled to beg and borrow her way through the initial years of life. Seldom has she entered the vaunted portals of an educational institution. Yet, with the internet-enabled flattening of the social curve, she dreams of the day when the world, or at least her township, will be at her feet.Many a disadvantaged girl aspires to be a fighter pilot, a police officer, a doctor or a badminton champion, but society and its ever-warped inequalities seldom allow her to give wings to her dreams. There are several insurmountable imponderables that she has to combat, scale and conquer before she can even come close to attaining her goals. The pandemic has further exacerbated the situation. Girl students across the world have been withdrawn from schools by parents from disadvantaged sections of society. The pandemic-induced feeling of despair has put paid to the ambitions of millions of youngsters and forced them to settle for lesser rungs on the ladder of success. Furthermore, even today, a very common practice across India is to get teenaged girls”married off” at the soonest possible. They then have to settle for pots and pans instead of pens and keyboards, as their lives roll on. Many other age-old customs still prevail as well, to the detriment of the levels at which women should be able to lead their lives.However, the Nehas, Bindiyas, Manpreets and Shalinis of India have the talent, determination and resolve within to bounce back and surge ahead in their careers. What they need is an eco-system which allows them to compete on merit and which does not stifle their aspirations in their nascent years. There are quite a few steps which need to be taken by our nation in order to facilitate their flight into the high skies. Am listing out some of them here. Am sure there are many more which thought-leaders can come up with. The key is to make them actually happen and to not allow them to remain topics of discussion alone.1.Educational upgrades: In order for girls (as well as boys) to truly learn what they need to in our schools and colleges, the levels of training of educators and basic infrastructure facilities, even washrooms, need a major upgrade. Easier said than done, but major prioritisation of budgets will ensure some headway at least.2.Entrepreneurial incentives: Women-led start-ups need a major boost since they find themselves clueless and penniless whenever they seek to commence operations. Mentorship workshops and subsidies will do the trick to some extent, provided they are meticulously monitored.3.Cottage Industries: Rural women folk are extremely adept at producing quality ethnic wear and food items which can be marketed across the land; if only concerned government agencies would diligently advise and assist them.4.Sports accelerators: Women sportspersons have displayed their prowess at international and even Olympic platforms in recent years. If the number of women sportspersons participating in competitions across formats, in all sports, were to be doubled or tripled, the ‘catchment’ of talented sportswomen would ensure that many more champions are produced.5.Societal fine tuning: Our top celebrities need to spend some more time and effort in promoting national causes like women empowerment instead of modelling for gizmos! A sustained awareness campaign through electronic and social media will enable true changes in mindsets that currently prevent girls from being educated to higher levels.Thousands of young Indian women have made a mark in the fields of defence, civil services, aviation, corporate careers, academics and sports over the past few decades. But to enable them to live fearlessly in order to pursue their passions freely, significantly more needs to be done.Why should a young girl have to hesitate while leaving her home for study or work because prying eyes won’t let her be herself? Once we allow our young women to simply be themselves and express themselves in every field of endeavour, even the sky will not be the limit for them!vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-enabling-girls-to-soar-high-in-life-101637431827226.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout | River of Letters: Punjabi poets footloose in Bodoland||Sufi poet Sultan Bahu had famously said ‘Dil dariya samundron doonge, Kaun dilan dian jaane’ (The heart’s river is deeper than the ocean, Who can grasp what lies embedded there). However, rivers too carry their own stories as they flow down from the mountains to the plains to finally immerse in the deep waters. The Gaurang River, which originates from Bhutan, passes by Kokrajhar Town and goes onto meet the Brahmaputra, has been witness to long years of suffering of the Bodos who live on its shores. These people of Sino-Tibetan origin, whose history goes back to 2500 BC, have been referred to as outsiders in myth and history as Malecha , Asura or Danava. Theirs’ was a long struggle against political and cultural aggression, until the Bodoland Territorial Regional Accord, was finally signed in January 2020. The Kokrajhar Literary Festival 2021, which was held from November 14 to 16 was dedicated to the poetry of peace and love. It celebrated around 100 languages of India with special emphasis on tribal speech, which still has no recognition.Journey from Punjab to KokrajharFor Punjabi poets, Paul Kaur and Jagdeep Sidhu, who went to this literary festival with a difference, it was a rare experience, which they shared with delight. Ambala’s own senior poet Paul, says “It came as a surprise in many ways. First of all, it was interesting that a political triumph was celebrated with poetry. One was not prepared to come face to face with tribal poets from languages that one had not even heard of. The spirit of the festival was amazing in its simplicity and sincerity.” Jagdeep, an ebullient younger poet of Mohali, says: “While the festival was organised by the Bodoland government, it was completely free of officialdom or the pomp and show that we are so used to in the North. The head of the now autonomous region, Pramod Boro, opened the festival in humility and camaraderie without the political pageantry that is found at most places.”The delight of diversityThe mood of this literary celebration was set by the invitation letter itself, which was penned to writers of so many languages, which have no official recognition along with some two dozen languages which have the constitutional recognition in India. It is a little known fact that over 600 languages are spoken in the country. Paul says, “It was indeed a journey of great learning for us as we came across poets who recited poems in languages we did not even know by name such as Nyishi, Sherdukpen, Tiwa, Magahi, Kodava, Jayantia, Toto and many others.” She adds that it was the diversity of cultures, languages and ethnicity that was so heartening as opposed to one-language, one-religion and one-way of living that we have been witness to in recent times.Academician Surath Nazrary, convener of the festival, spelled out that by celebrating the poetry of peace and love the Bodoland Territorial Council was sending a message of new Bodoland to the rest of the world. Boro, the son of a farmer who studied in his village school and went onto study economics in a Guwahati college, is now at the helm of affairs in the autonomous region in Assam. The slogan which Boro gave out at the festival spelled out the effort to heal a strife-torn people and land “It is time to change the weapon. Instead of taking AK-47 in hands, we should take up the arms of economic transformation.” Jagdeep says: “It was indeed a revelation to come face to face with the renowned professor Ganesh Devy who has been striving to save tribal languages from dying. He gave up his job to initiate work with Denotified and Nomadic Tribes and Adivasis and later conducted the largest-ever survey of languages in history with 3000 volunteers which was later published in 50 multilingual volumes”.Land made for you and meThe two Punjabi poets, who return charmed with the endeavour of language and literature from Kokrajhar, feel that the festival brought home the pride of the language a person is born to. Paul says, “Although translations of poems in English were a necessity to communicate across the vast array of languages that were represented at the festival yet in all the readings the poets first read out their poems in the original adding to the rich linguistic tapestry woven on the banks of the Gaurang”. She adds even the television crews chose that poems be recorded in the original and not in translation: “They said they would stream the original to do justice to the rhythms of poetry in diverse languages.” Truly it is this diversity of languages, cultures and religions in which lies the deliverance of the Indian sub-continent and what comes to the mind is an inclusive rearmament song sung in the school days of the 70s: “From Indian Ocean to the Kashmir Highland, From Brahmaputra to the Bombay Island, This land was made for you and me!”Caption: Kokrajhar Literary Festival: Punjabi poets Paul Kaur and Jagdeep Sidhu with Assamese poet Tulika Chetia Yein and Rajasthani tribal poet Hira Meena (L to R) and Gaurang River adorned by letters.

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||19-yr-old Gurdaspur body builder holds two world records||Setting an example for the youth of Punjab, a Gurdaspur teen has achieved the feat of becoming a body builder without setting foot in a gymnasium and has set two world records. Kuwar Amritbir Singh, who grew up in Umarwala, a village in Gurdaspur district, says he was always fascinated by the legendary body builders and wrestlers of the state. Amritbir, 19 already holds two world records and has two reality shows to his credit. As per the India book of records, he holds the record for being the youngest body builder to perform the highest number of knuckle pushups in a minute and the record of performing the most knuckle pushups in 30 seconds at the age of 17, and 18, respectively. “I have never gone to a gym or fitness centre. I started body building at the age of 15. Inspired by biographies of people like Bhagat Singh, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Udham Singh, and Dara Singh, I realised that none of these heroes had a gym or a trainer, they all worked hard and trained themselves, so I decided to hone my craft through home made equipment, desi workouts and diet,” says Amritbir, who uses bricks, cement, iron rods, plastic bottles, tires, and tubes to workout on his terrace. “Punjab has had many wrestling and body building heroes, sadly now people associate the state with drugs and gangs. I want to change this perception,” he says. Speaking about his journey, he said, “Family support was not that great in the beginning, but when they saw my passion and consistency, they began to support my dream. I did not have a trainer, so I created my own routine with the help of YouTube videos.”After facing a minor setback in Class 12 , Amritbir says he has learnt to balance fitness training and studies. “Initially, it was tough to find the right balance between the two. My family was also worried about my future. Now, it is going well. I am pursuing my bachelor’s degree and have also participated in two reality television shows,” he added.The teenager hopes become an inspiration for the youth of Punjab and also become the first Punjabi action hero.“I have always wanted to make my mother and father proud, but now I feel it is more about my motherland, Punjab, proud,” he says. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/19yrold-gurdaspur-body-builder-holds-two-world-records-101637431347246.html
20-11-2021||Noida||Air quality to improve in Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad after over a fortnight||The air quality index in the three cities of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Saturday, but on the basis of forecast, officials said that the conditions are likely to improve as strong winds may arrive by November 21, said officials.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida recorded the air quality index (AQI) on Saturday at 344, 322 and 356.“Forecasts indicate that the wind speed will pick up from November 21, which will help in speedy disposal of trapped pollutants. This will improve the AQI. As of now, the daytime AQI of monitoring stations is better than the night timings when the wind speed slows down further,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPCPCB).An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 ‘severe’.According to the forecast by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the situation is likely to improve as the percentage share of stubble burning incidents have reduced considerably and the north-westerly winds, resulting in the slowing down of the impact.“From November 21 to 23, surface winds are likely to be strong, resulting in effective dispersion which improves air quality. Transport level winds coming from northwest direction are likely to be strong from November 21 to 23, flushing out locally emitted pollutants from Delhi to the southeast region that is expected to improve the air quality further to the lower end of the ‘very poor’ or ‘poor’ category in Delhi. The contribution of farm fires (752) to Delhi’s PM2.5 is negligible,” the Safar forecast added.The three cities have been experiencing ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ pollution conditions since October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-to-improve-in-noida-greater-noida-ghaziabad-after-over-a-fortnight-101637430987193.html

Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the persons who have been arrested so far include shooters and those who had provided shelter to the prime suspect. Balram, son of former sarpanch Gopal, also died in the incident. A case was registered against 10 persons on November 5.“The juveniles had conducted a survey of the victim’s house and its surroundings. Rinku had created Snapchat IDs to communicate and plan for the shooting,” Sangwan said, adding that the shooting was executed to avenge a murder of 2007 when Balram’s family had allegedly killed Rinku’s brother on Holi.

Two of the juveniles are Rinku’s cousins, police said. Sangwan said that Abhishek Saroha, who was arrested on Friday, has two dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder and loot registered against him. Abhishek got in touch with Rinku around 10 months back. On October 30, Rinku called Abhishek through a Telegram application and told him that this is right time to avenge the murder of his brother, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-four-more-held-for-firing-at-former-sarpanch-s-house-101637430927124.html

20-11-2021||Noida||Noida climbs the ‘Swachhta’ ladder, ranks no 4 in cleanliness survey||Noida bagged the fourth spot in the list of cleanest cities having a population between a 100,000 and a million in the Swachh Survekshan 2021--the annual cleanliness survey conducted by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA), in coordination with the Quality Council of India, under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U). The results of the survey were announced on Saturday.This is a significant improvement from last year when the city bagged the 25th position. The city was adjudged 150 in 2019 and it secured the 324th rank in 2018. As many as 4,320 cities took part in the cleanliness survey, of which 342 cities were conferred with some star rating. In a statement issued earlier, MoHUA said the sixth edition of the Swachh Survekshan survey has become the “world’s largest urban cleanliness survey.”The city has received a 5-star in a survey on garbage free cities (GFC). Earlier, in June 2020, Noida got a 3-star rating in the same category. A 7-star is the highest rating conferred to a city with the best waste management practices. However, no city has achieved the 7-star rating so far, said officials. “It is a significant improvement for the city. We took multiple measures to improve the cleanliness of the city-- from door-to-door waste collection to segregation and then remediation of waste. We have taken care of the legacy waste and also developed the mechanism to handle the daily waste produced in the city,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO of the Noida authority. In the last three years, 300 new toilets have been constructed in the slums of the city. Pink restrooms for women and dedicated restrooms for transgenders have been put in place to discourage open defecation, said officials. The authority attributed the improvement in the Swachh survey index to the work it has done on all fronts, especially setting up treatment plants for treating construction and demolition waste. It has got at least 50 small and big drains, which get choked with filth and plastic waste.“We have a huge challenge in keeping Noida clean since there are many new industries here and there is a lot of activity happening in the real estate sector, which produces a lot of construction waste. We set up a plant in Sector 80 to collect the waste from source and recycle the same at the plant. We installed bamboo net in drains to trap the plastic waste and make sure the treated water flows into drains,” said Maheshwari.Noida has around 165 sectors and 65 villages, which produce 900 metric tonne of waste daily. From 2018, the Noida authority started collecting door-to-door waste with the help of 250 vehicles and 21 compact machines, which help crush waste for its easy transportation. Nearly 69 community toilets, 150 public toilets, 16 pink toilets and 119 urinals were built by the authority in the city in the last three years to discourage people from defecating in the open, said officials. It distributed 21,000 home composting kits, installed 3,000 dustbins at different sites, and focused on reducing, reusing, and recycling waste. A bio-remediation plant spread over 20,000 hectares was also set up at Mubarakpur in Sector 145 to treat waste. “We are happy that Noida received the top rank in this survey but it needs to work on many fronts such as water conservation, cleaning of drains and improve treatment of the waste water going into the drains,” said N P Singh, president of Gautam Budh Nagar district development RWAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-climbs-the-swachhta-ladder-ranks-no-4-in-cleanliness-survey-101637430387030.html

20-11-2021||Other||Gurugram achieves highest ever ranking in Swachh Survekshan||The city secured a ranking of 24 in the Swachh Survekshan 2021 -- its highest ever ranking since the central government’s survey commenced in 2015 -- in the category of cities with a population between 100,000 and a million. A total of 425 cities in the category were covered in the annual survey this year, the results of which were announced on Saturday.Gurugram scored 4201.19 points out of 6,000 in the 2021 survey. Its score was also the highest in Haryana. With a score of 3821.52, Rohtak has the second-highest rating in the state and finished with a rank of 49 in the same category of cities.Gurugram ranked 62 last year in the cleanliness survey, while the city’s last best performance was in 2016 when it got a ranking of 36.The cleanliness survey this year looked at three broad parameters – citizens’ feedback, service level progress in terms of provision of services to citizens, and certifications. Of the 6,000 points, 2,400 were reserved for the service level progress category, and 1,800 points each were for the citizens’ voice and certifications categories, respectively.In the citizens’ voice category, Gurugram had a score of 1410.51, while it got 1690.68 in service level progress and 1,100 in the certification categories.In an official release issued by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), mayor Madhu Azad and MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja jointly attributed the better performance in the survey to the cooperation and contribution of the citizens.“The mayor and commissioner said that Gurugram will perform even better in the Swachh Survekshan 2022. All citizens should keep giving their cooperation this way and always segregate their waste and not spread garbage. They should throw waste only in the garbage pickup vehicle, adopt home composting and follow the three principles of waste reduce, reuse and recycle,” said the release.The city also bagged a three-star rating in the ‘Garbage Free City’ (GFC) category. Under the GFC category, a city is ranked out of seven stars depending on the efficiency of its waste management system and its resources. There are 25 key parameters on which each city is assessed, such as door-to-door collection of waste, sweeping, storage bins, plastic ban, and C&D waste collection.Overall, nine cities in the country got a five-star rating in the GFC category, 143 received three-star, and 147 got one-star rating.However, Vaishali Rana, a Gurugram-based environmentalist, was critical of the city’s performance in the annual cleanliness survey. “Every sector and municipal ward has a mini landfill in Gurugram. The MCG is yet to find an alternative site for dumping the waste. Segregation is practically negligible. On ground, there has been little to no change compared to last year,” said Rana.On November 15 when it was confirmed that Gurugram will get a GFC rating in the 2021 survey, the MCG in its official release had attributed introduction of zero-waste days, special campaigns to prevent usage of polythene and plastic, and introduction of cloth bag banks as the factors for the city’s betterment in waste management.In December last year, the civic body had introduced zero-waste day where once a week only wet waste was lifted from households so that segregation of waste can be inculcated among residents of the city. Starting November 11 this year, the corporation has made it mandatory for residents to segregate garbage into dry and wet waste. The MCG also announced a penalty as high as ₹25,000 against the use of plastic or polythene in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-achieves-highest-ever-ranking-in-swachh-survekshan-101637429306976.html

The man had then approached the Tilak Marg police station in Delhi, after which police registered a case on November 5 and traced the details of the bank account where the money was moved to.Investigators checked the withdrawal from the bank account and found that a man in Bengaluru had been withdrawig the cash at an ATM. Before leaving for Bengaluru, the five-member team also got photographs of the possible suspect from the ATM camera.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said that this was the first case in which a Delhi police team laid a trap outside the Bengaluru ATM and caught the suspect red handed.“While investigating the case, we found out that as soon as any victim transferred the amount in the bank, the same was being withdrawn. On November 16, two teams of Delhi police laid a trap outside the Meenaat Federal Bank of Banaswadi bank in Bengaluru and spotted Paschal red handed. He was withdrawing ₹20,000 from the ATM,” said Paschal.DCP Yadav said that Paschal sensed police had spotted him and tried to flee. “While trying to flee, he collided with a scooter, which also fell down. The Delhi Police team arrested the accused from the spot. Seven other ATM cards, numerous SIM Cards, and four mobile phones were also recovered from his possession. We have brought him to Delhi on transit remand,” he added.A city court on Friday sent Paschal to police custody for eight days. Police said they are trying to identify the other members of Paschal’s gang.In the last few months, Delhi police have come across several cases of cyber criminals using malware to hack the phones of the victims. The Delhi police cyber cell regularly issues advisories urging citizens not to click on links from unknown people or groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-two-day-wait-nigerian-held-from-outside-bengaluru-atm-for-cyber-fraud-101637428586833.html

Besides, it is also arranging inoculation facility at ration distribution centres for its over six lakh ration cardholders in the district. “There is a need for some effective measures to revive interest in vaccination drive as Covid-19 is not over yet. Those holding ration cards will be required to get vaccinated and non vaccination of any of the family member will disqualify the card holder from getting ration,” said district magistrate of Aligarh Selva Kumari J. The DM said “Those reaching the ration shops will have facility for vaccination there itself. The idea is not to disallow ration to anyone but it is mainly for the safety and health of customers. Those coming for ration will be required to provide proper and satisfactory reply when asked to show the vaccination certificate.” There are 6 lakh ration card holders in district and it will enable the district administration to reach out to a large number of people who for some reasons are shying away from the mandatory vaccination drive, said Selva Kumari J. The administration has also planned to station an Anganwadi staff at each ration distribution centre in Aligarh for the vaccine drive. “Those who have not got vaccinated yet will be asked to carry their Aadhaar card and get vaccinated at the ration distribution centres,” said the DM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aligarh-admn-moots-no-vaccine-no-ration-to-speed-up-inoculation-drive-101637427330856.html

20-11-2021||Mumbai||Thane Zilla Parishad teachers from Bhiwandi persuade rural school drop outs to return to classes||Since July 2021, 40-year-old Thane Zilla Parishad (ZP) school teacher Shankar Patil has being travelling more than 40km each day from his house in Bhiwandi city to Thane’s remote rural areas for one reason alone: to convince students that had dropped out of school during the pandemic to return to the classroom.Most of the hamlets are on hillocks or in remote locations where buses or other public vehicles cannot travel. Most buses drop two to three kilometres away from the villages, thus Patil used his own two-wheeler to commute.Until the end of October, Patil found 100 children out of school and convinced them to enrol in the nearest ZP school with the help of fellow teachers. Despite Patil’s weak financial situation and ailing family members, he never faltered as his mission was only to ensure no child stays devoid of education.Like Patil, close to 100 other school teachers from ZP schools visited more than 150 brick kilns and thousands of families in the district’s tribal areas, construction sites and labour camps, and managed to enrol 319 children in three months. These students – children of migrant workers that had returned to their hometowns during the pandemic – had no access to school for over a year. Some also stay in the district’s hills, making it even tougher to access.With schools reopening on November 22, getting them back into the classrooms quickly was important. Anil Kurhade, district coordinator of inclusive education and acting district coordinator for ZP education, Thane, said, “As soon as we realised that schools are set to reopen, we told teachers to coordinate with them. We began looking for these 323 children four months ago. It was not easy, considering most teachers were also busy with the vaccination programmes and other Covid-related activities.”Patil added, “With schools closed, the teachers were helping the government to conduct door-to-door surveys to identify people with symptoms or check how many people are vaccinated. A few also went door-to-door in remote areas to create awareness to get vaccinated. They were busy for the entire day with these activities.”Thane district has a tribal population of over 1.5 million and there are 1,131 schools with 85,000 students in the ZP jurisdiction. As per ZP records, 323 students had dropped out of school during the pandemic from various rural belts. While the teachers have managed to trace 319 students, four are still to be found.Kurhade added, “There are still four more who are not yet traced and have migrated out of the district, as per our information. This is a continuous process as there will be more who will settle in the district in the future and we will ensure they do not remain devoid of education.”Out of those enrolled back in schools, 47 children are from Shahpur, 65 from Ambernath, 11 from Kalyan Rural, 154 from Bhiwandi and 46 from Murbad. They are between Grades 5 and 10.The state education board had permitted schools to adopt the online teaching mode. However, children from tribal or rural areas could not afford mobile phones. Most of the migrant working population had left town. Consequently, many children quit education and helped their parents to earn their livelihood. Most would sell vegetables, fruits or even help in farming. Besides, for most parents, education was never a priority.Sangita Jadhav, a social worker from Murbad, said, “It is a common phenomenon that students leave school midway depending where their parents’ livelihood takes them. The children remain uneducated as repeated breaks in their study patterns leave them without focus on studies. For parents, education is not the priority. Rather, feeding all mouths in their family is.”A few enthusiastic teachers like Patil suggested that they could get details of the students during their home visits for Covid surveys.Kurhade added, “As and when possible, our teachers started visiting families, labour camps, brick kilns and tribal settlements. They had to show the students some innovative projects, get them involved in some group activities to bring their interest back to studies.” It was during these visits that teachers realised that hundreds of children had migrated and were not traceable. “In some cases, we realised that there were a few children who continued to study regularly. We met an 11-year-old boy who regularly wrote his thoughts on a blackboard outside his school gate. He continued to do so diligently through the pandemic. When the blackboard stopped getting updated, we realised that the child had migrated along with his family. Some of our teachers managed to trace the boy and enrolled him back in school.”Patil said, “Bhiwandi teachers decided to spend money from their own pockets and look for children who are out of school. It was tough to convince those above 12 years. Some of them had been involved in anti-social activities, while many others had formed their own strong opinions. Some thought they would have to enrol in lower classes as they lost two academic years and were thus unwilling. We started conducting small sessions with these students to involve them in the learning process and we provided parents some financial help. Mid-day meals and access to computers and other devices at school were other attractions to get them back to school.”Patil said he came across a family with three children – two girls and a teenage boy. Of these, the girls were enthusiastic to return to school but the 14-year-old boy was disinterested. “As a result, the family discontinued the studies of the girls as well. Similarly, in another village, there was a girl who had to look after her toddler sibling while the parents were at the brick kilns. Hence, we suggested making provisions for a creche near the brick kiln itself. This is when they agreed to send their eldest child to school,” Patil added. Nilam Pisal, 33, a ZP block coordinator, visited up to 12 villages in Thane and Bhiwandi. When she reached Vadavli village in Bhiwandi, she saw many students aged barely seven working with their parents. No one would speak to her. She said, “There were 18 such children in Vadavli. The parents usually earned separate daily wages for the work done by these children, so they were not ready to talk. Despite several failed attempts, I stayed put for over three hours in that village. One parent told me my wait was futile as the parents won’t be able to make ends meet if children stopped working.”Pisal was persistent, though. She told them that they would get mid-day meals, fruits and chikkis at school. “This also did not deter them. So I told them to give me their children’s responsibility for two hours in the morning, after which they can help the parents. After much persuasion, they agreed and we were able to enrol all 18 to school.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-zilla-parishad-teachers-from-bhiwandi-persuade-rural-school-drop-outs-to-return-to-classes-101637425466984.html
20-11-2021||Mumbai||Farmers in Maharashtra won’t celebrate, rally in Mumbai on Nov 28||Farmers’ organisations in Maharashtra said on Saturday that they will not celebrate the Centre’s decision to repeal the three controversial farm laws as tribute to the 700 farmers who lost their lives during the year-long protest. They plan to bring the ashes of the farmers who died in the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh) incident to Mumbai, and hold a rally of 50,000 farmers before immersing the ashes in the Arabian Sea on November 28. Eight people had died in Lakhimpur Kheri when a speeding sports utility vehicle – allegedly driven Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish – rammed into a group of farmers returning after a protest against UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit. On November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced in a nationally televised speech that the three contentious farm laws, against which farmers from Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting on the outskirts of Delhi for over a year, will be repealed in the forthcoming session of Parliament. To mark what it termed as a farmers’ victory, Congress celebrated ‘Kisan Vijay Diwas’ on Saturday. It also directed party leaders to meet with the families of farmers that lost their lives during the protest in the last one year. Meanwhile, Ajit Nawale, general secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS) said on Saturday that his outfit will not celebrate the repeal announcement. ABKS is part of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a coalition of 40 farmers’ organisations from across the country formed in November 2020 in response to three farm laws passed the same year. “There is no call from Samyukt Kisan Morcha to celebrate the day as 700 families of the farmers are grieving,” Nawale said. “For us, this is not a proper time to celebrate because the fight is not over yet. Until the farm laws are repealed in Parliament, we will continue to agitate. We don’t trust the BJP-led Central government. They are capable of doing anything.” The three laws – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act – were given assent by President Ram Nath Kovind on September 27, 2020 just days after both houses of Parliament passed them unanimously. On January 12, 2021, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the farm laws and appointed a committee to look into farmers’ grievances. Nawale said, “To create awareness among farmers about the treatment meted out by the Centre and to remember the cause for which hundreds of farmers sacrificed their lives, we have brought ashes of the farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri and started taking them to all the districts as part of our campaign. The campaign will culminate in Mumbai in the form of a rally on November 28 in which prominent farmer leaders such as Rakesh Tikait will participate. The ashes will also be immersed in the Arabian Sea in Mumbai the same day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farmers-in-maharashtra-won-t-celebrate-rally-in-mumbai-on-nov-28-101637425046507.html

The cities were evaluated for a total of 6,000 marks divided into three categories, including citizen’s voice, certifications and service level programme. Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) has scored 2739.92 out of 6,000 marks in the survey, which was 1,186.89 higher than its previous year’s score of 1552.11.PMC jumped to the third rank among 97 cities in the Ganga towns category from last year’s 37th rank.Last year, PMC stood last among all 47 urban local bodies with a population of more than 10 lakh. Harshita, public relations officer of Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL), said, “Patna’s ranking in the cleanliness survey has improved than last year. Constant efforts are being made by the civic body to perform even better in coming years.”She said that PMC fetched better marks in the citizen voice’s category as a large number of people shared their opinion. Altogether 477,849 people in the state voted for their respective local bodies. Of them, more than 2.01 lakh voters were polled from PMC. Open defecation free plus certificate helped the civic body 300 points, which was zero last year.PMC claimed a cent per cent door to door garbage collection across all six circles. PMC aims to improve the score by achieving cent per cent waste segregation practice in the capital city. “We have carried out extensive awareness programme for bringing behavioural change among citizens for disposing of dry, wet and biomedical wastes separately.

Police sources, however, said the complaint was found to be false during a probe ordered by the district administration.“In his letter to the top police officers, additional district and session judge Avinash Kumar had claimed that Chandramani, the then station house officer (SHO) Jhanjharpur police station, had said at a public function that if given green signal by Madhubani superintendent of police (SP), he could barge into his chamber and beat him,” said Singh, himself an additional district judge at Kishanganj. Police sources, however, said that following orders from the district judge, the administration had constituted a two-member committee of subdivisional officer and the deputy superintendent of police to probe the incident, but found the allegation false.A departmental probe against Chandramani is still going on, sources said. Madhubani SP Dr Satya Prakash and additional director general of police (headquarters) J S Gangwar refused to comment. On November 18, ADJ Avinash Kumar, who is no stranger to controversies, filed a police complaint alleging that station house officer of Ghoghardiha police station, Gopal Krishna, and sub-inspector Abhimanyu Kumar Sharma entered his chamber, assaulted him and even pointed a pistol at him.Both police officers, who have alleged they were assaulted in the court premises the same day, have been arrested.Meanwhile, taking immediate suo motu cognisance, the Patna High Court set up a special bench to hear the matter the same day. The bench fixed the next hearing for November 29 and state’s chief secretary, police chief and Madhubani SP have been asked to appear before the court with a report. Avinash Kumar, who has been in the headlines for his unusual orders, was stripped of his judicial powers by the Patna high court on September 24 this year.In one of his orders, he had granted bail to a molestation accused on the condition that he would wash clothes of the entire village for free for a week.While he was posted in Patna, he had served show-cause notices on the chief secretary and the state police chief for non-compliance of the order to deduct ₹2,500 from the DM and SP’s salaries in a lynching case and deposit the sum to the CM Relief Fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/madhubani-judge-assaulted-by-cops-has-a-running-feud-with-police-101637422646256.html

There is nothing more to the incident. After an inquiry, a diary entry was made at Andheri police station We will be approaching the app operators to get information about this unidentified person,” the official informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/student-tips-off-mumbai-cops-on-unidentified-man-s-bomb-threat-on-messaging-app-101637421418237.html

Gor is accused of supplying five SIM cards to the main accused – dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze. Some of the SIM cards were purportedly used by the accused persons for communication during the commission of the crimes. NIA had claimed that Gor was part of the larger conspiracy hatched by Vaze along with the other accused to eliminate Hiran – the owner of the explosives-laden car that was found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia. Gor’s counsel, advocate Aniket Nikam, had argued that it was Vaze who had summoned his client’s employer to his office at Mumbai Police commisionerate and had asked him to supply dummy SIM cards to them. Vaze had told the employer that the SIM cards were required by the police for a secret operation which was never disclosed either to Gor or his employer. Nikam added that Gor had never spoken to Vaze nor was there any call data record (CDR) to that effect. Gor’s employer was threatened by Vaze and coerced to provide some SIM cards, following which the cricket bookie procured them, claimed Nikam, adding that the cards were used by Vaze and others for getting the Thane trader killed. “Gor never knew why the SIM cards were being required by Vaze. Before charging any person with conspiracy, the end objective should be known to the accused who is to be charged. There is nothing on record with NIA to show that Gor was even aware of the conspiracy,” Nikam submitted. Opposing the bail application, NIA said, “Gaur was a part of the larger conspiracy hatched by Vaze along with former Mumbai Police personnel Sunil Mane and Vinayak Shinde.” The federal agency further claimed that the SIM cards used by the accused were provided by Gor and were used to call Hiran and bring him out of his house, and later he was killed. However, judge AT Wankhede of the NIA court granted bail to Gor in the case.Previously, the case was being probed by the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS). Later, NIA took over the case from ATS. On February 25, a green Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a note threatening to kill members of the Ambani family. Hiran’s body was found on March 5 in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-explosives-case-mansukh-hiran-murder-bookie-naresh-gor-granted-bail-101637421267119.html
20-11-2021||Pune||Maharashtra’s first police dog training centre to come up at Baramati||The state will be setting up the first state-of-the-art dog training centre for Maharashtra police spread over 20-acre of land at Baramati at a cost of Rs50 crore. The dog training centre will be located near the additional SP’s office due to the police force’s diverse objectives of tackling terrorism and Naxalism, and detecting crime among others.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, “Dog squads play an important role in terms of protection. Trained dogs work well to deal with incidents such as thefts, bomb blasts, arrival of VIPs for events, anti-Naxal operations and sniffing RDX. The dog training centre in Baramati will have all the necessary facilities. A spacious dog training centre worth about Rs50 crore will be set up on 20-acre land which has already been identified and is vacant.”“You will be awestruck when you see the institute yourself. It will be on the lines of a horse stable. Today, many changes are being seen in different fields especially policing, where sniffer dogs play a very important role in the protection of human lives,” Pawar said.Currently, the sole dog training centre in Maharashtra is located at the Shivajinagar police headquarters; it came into existence in 1965 as part of the state CID. Regular and refresher dog training courses are organised by the chief dog master under the supervision of the additional superintendent of police. There are four dog trainers of the rank of head constable (H.C.) and attendants working under the chief dog master. Presently, there are 92 dog units across districts and commissionerates in the state. According to the state CID, each dog unit is helmed by an officer of the rank of PSI. There is an initial training period of six months. However, this duration largely depends on the ability of the dog and the training imparted.The state CID is also looking for land for the proposed state-of-the-art dog training centre in Pune. The current dog training facility houses only 26 dogs. Moreover, it does not have a residential facility for dog handlers. In 2013, the state government had allotted 13-acre land at Daund but the CID could not acquire the land due to its distance from Pune which had legal ramifications. In 2020, the state government provided a 5-acre land parcel at Wadachiwadi near Kondhwa. Since it was in the immediate vicinity of a police firing range, a feasibility study of the land and site was carried out by the CID wherein it was revealed that constant firing at the range would be a source of disturbance for dog training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtras-first-police-dog-training-centre-to-come-up-at-baramati-101637421146370.html

20-11-2021||Mumbai||Nepean Sea Road residents to get wide footpath after 12 years||Mumbai The residents of Nepean Sea Road will get wide footpaths after a wait of 12 years. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has proposed a plan to expand and beautify the footpaths on the entire one kilometre Nepean Sea Road stretch to make it pedestrian-friendly.The project is expected to cost ₹3 crore and the construction work is expected to start by the end of November and will finish by February 2022. It is funded through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives and local residents are also being involved in the development process.Speaking with HT, assistant municipal commissioner from D ward Prashant Gaikwad said, “As part of the proposed plan, the carriageway will be 6.5-metre wide and the average width of the footpath will not be less than 2.5 metres. In parking areas and junctions, the footpath could be as wide as 5 metres,” shared Gaikwad.He also assured that the portions of the road which has zebra crossing, will be elevated to ensure that pedestrians and people with disabilities don’t have to step down from the footpath while crossing the road. The plan also includes making a special bus bay near the existing BEST bus stop.Rahul Kadri, architect and chairperson of the Nepean Sea Road Citizen’s Forum said, “The idea behind this project is to encourage people to walk instead of using vehicles in the stretch,” Kadri told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nepean-sea-road-residents-to-get-wide-footpath-after-12-years-101637417609319.html
20-11-2021||Mumbai||Still 3 lakh to be given first vaccination dose against Covid in Thane Municipal Corporation limits||Despite rigorous campaigns and vaccination drives, Thane Municipal Corporation has around three lakh beneficiaries left to be administered with the first dose.There has been only a 26.21% increase in first dose vaccination post Diwali, according to the surveyors. TMC officials claimed that the reluctance in the minds of people in certain pockets of the city continues.“I am very scared of needles and my children kept insisting on getting vaccinated but I ignored them. It was only when the TMC officers came and said that this will benefit my health that I visited the centre half-heartedly,” said Shailaja Pawar, a 57-year-old resident of Diva who got her first vaccination against Covid on Thursday. Meanwhile, there are entire families in Mumbra who are not keen on getting jabbed. “None of us in our vicinity have been detected Covid positive in the last two years. We have not been affected during the wave. Then, how will it impact us going forward? We are not keen on getting vaccinated and then falling ill,” said Faiza Shaikh, a 55-year-old resident of Mumbra. Faiza’s entire family including senior citizens have not been jabbed yet.Thane city has nine wards wherein areas like Majiwada-Manapada and Vartak Nagar had already achieved 100% first dose vaccination while Kalwa and Wagle Estate have now achieved more than 100% and around 90.35% first dose inoculation, respectively. These are the wards that have plush residential areas and a large number of moving population.Uthalsar ward has had a major impact post Diwali. It has now achieved 87.69% vaccination, up from 51% until October 25. Meanwhile, areas like Diva, Lokmanya-Savarkar Nagar and Mumbra that are densely populated and have remote pockets as well are still at below 30% first dose vaccination.TMC conducted special camps at places of worship to increase the number of first dose vaccination. “The areas with the least vaccination are Kausa, Mumbra and Shil within Thane civic body. Savarkar Nagar, Kharegaon, Retibunder and some parts of Diva also have fewer vaccinated population,” said Dr Prasad Patil, immunization officer, TMC.Despite the rigorous drive initiated, wards like Diva, Lokmanya-Savarkar Nagar and Mumbra have seen hardly a 10% hike each in the last three weeks.Ranjana Patil, a TMC nurse, said, “There are various reasons cited by people to avoid vaccination including reluctance, nervousness, worry for the side effects of the vaccine, believing in rumours about its after effects and many more. There is a lot of convincing and cajoling required before vaccinating those residing in chawls or slum pockets of the city.” Patil is one of the nurses in camps set up in areas with low vaccination response.Dr Sanjay Pingulkar, general physician and member of Thane Rapid Action Covid Team, said, “The main aim of vaccination is to reduce the impact of the virus. For an inoculated individual, hospitalisation usually does not arise according to the current trends. There are only certain pockets in the city that are having an unvaccinated population. As the number of cases is low, the situation seems to be in control. But if the probable third wave strikes, we will have to wait and watch how it will impact the unvaccinated population. The vaccinated population can develop herd immunity as well across the district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/still-3-lakh-to-be-given-first-vaccination-dose-against-covid-in-thane-municipal-corporation-limits-101637417486753.html
20-11-2021||Mumbai||CBSE students allotted exam centre 26km away, board officials assure change||Sixty class 10 students of Malad’s Billabong High School were shocked to find out that the exam centre allotted to them for the upcoming board exams was nearly 26 kms away from their school and residence. All residents of Malad, these students were assigned to appear for their board exams at KMS School in Parel.While minor papers for CBSE class 10 and 12 students commenced from November 16, the major papers are scheduled to start from November 30 this year. Worried about the amount of time students will end up spending commuting to and from the exam centre, parents approached the regional office of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in Pune, where authorities have now assured them of a change in exam centre.“As if preparing for the exam is not tough enough, our children were expected to travel 50 kms every day (to and fro) for the exams. I was contemplating booking my daughter and myself into a hotel room in Parel, close to the exam centre,” said the mother of one of the students.Starting this academic year, CBSE decided to conduct board exams in two rounds—the first of these rounds is currently underway. The 90-minute objective type question papers will be answered on OMR sheets.“November 30 onwards students will go to the allotted exam centre to appear for their papers and we refuse to understand why our school principal did not raise objection to such a grave error when she was first informed about it. Students received their hall tickets early this week and despite several queries raised (by parents), they got little help from the school.Repeated attempts to reach school authorities did not yield any response.An official from the CBSE regional office in Pune told HT that the complaints from parents of the school has been received and new hall tickets will be released by early next week. “We have reallocated these students to another school at a distance of 4km,” said M Dharmadhikari, CBSE regional director for Pune (Mumbai schools are under its jurisdiction).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbse-students-allotted-exam-centre-26km-away-board-officials-assure-change-101637415805719.html
20-11-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka writes to PM Modi, seeks removal of MoS||The Congress wants to keep the pressure up on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issues of farmers’ agitation as it has urged him to withdraw cases registered against farmers and to not share dais at the DGPs/IGPs’ conference with Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni whose son Ashish Mishra is the main accused of the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence.As the Congress celebrates “Kisan Samman Divas” on Saturday to mark the victory of farmers following the PM’s announcement to repeal three “black” farm laws, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has sent a letter to Modi urging him not to share dais with the union minister and dismiss him.“Don’t share dais with your union minister of state for home if your intentions are clear towards farmers. Dismiss him. Withdraw cases registered against farmers and give financial assistance to the families of those killed in the agitation of farmers,” said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her letter sent to the PM on Saturday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been camping here since Friday evening for the three-day 56th Conference of Director Generals of Police (DGP) and Inspector Generals of Police (IGP) at Police Headquarters, Lucknow.“I have read in newspapers that you will be holding discussions with the country’s top brass responsible for maintaining law and order at the DGPs’ conference in Lucknow. All the country watched the cruelty done to farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri… Uttar Pradesh government has tried to crush the voices raised for justice because of political pressure. The Supreme Court too has observed that the state government appeared having intentions to save some special accused in the case. I have met families of the farmers who died in Lakhimpur Kheri violence. They are in unbearable pain. All these families want justice. There is no hope for justice with union minister of state for home continuing in office,” said Priyanka.Questioning Union home minister Amit Shah and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath for sharing dais with Teni recently, she said, “You are the Prime Minister. You know about your responsibility towards the farmers. To ensure justice to every citizen is the duty as well as the moral responsibility of the Prime Minister.”“Addressing the people, you said the decision to repeal farm laws was taken in the interest of farmers with truthful intent and pure heart. You said you have good intentions for farmers. If this is true, getting justice for victims of Lakhimpur Kheri violence should be the top priority for you… If you share dais with the father of accused, this will give a message that you are with those patronising the killers. This will be disrespectful to 700 farmers who have lost their lives,” Priyanka said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-removal-of-mos-101637414849686.html

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn is again planning a dedicated startup policy||Slug: It had earlier formulated Chandigarh Startup policy, 2021, but last year decided against notifying the draft in favour of Centre’s startup action plan It’s still not over for the Chandigarh startup policy. The UT administration is once again considering formulating a dedicated policy specific to the city requirements.The administration had earlier formulated an ambitious ‘Chandigarh Startup policy 2021’, but last year decided against notifying the draft in favour of the Centre’s startup action plan.“We are revisiting the issue and will soon take a comprehensive view on the policy. The Centre’s action plan is generic. If we want to give specific benefits to Chandigarh startups tailored to their needs then we need a Chandigarh startup policy,” said a senior UT official.Currently, startups in the city can be registered under the Centre’s action plan, 2016, on its startup portal. Also, the Society for Promotion of IT in Chandigarh (SPIC) helps IT-related startups.The UT industry department has started discussions with different stakeholders, including the local industry. A high-level meeting to be chaired by the UT adviser has been called by the department and the industry representatives have been invited to the meet scheduled for November 22.“The industry representatives and also officials within the administration believe that a localised startup policy can be critical in providing the essential funding, mentorship and market access support required by startups to grow as important contributors to the local economy in terms of revenue and job creation,” said the official.A startup policy contains provisions to incentivise key startup stakeholders such as incubators and institutions of higher education among others so as to promote holistic development for India’s startup ecosystem.Out of the 36 states and union territories, 30 have their own dedicated startup policies.Once being promoted as an IT hub, Chandigarh has been lagging behind neighbouring cities, particularly Mohali, in terms of attracting new talent and setting up industrial units.Likely on lines of 2021 draft policyThe revived policy is likely to be formulated on the lines of the Chandigarh Draft Policy, 2021.The draft recommended setting up a Chandigarh Seed Fund Scheme to plug in the gap for early-stage startup financing in the UT, interest-free loans, empanelment of startup mentors, and development of co-working spaces, and setting up of incubators.The policy will provide for incentives over and above the Startup India Action Plan of the Government of India. “In case the same benefit is enlisted in another policy of the UT administration, it may be availed under only one policy,” said the official.A startup portal (website) will also be created, which will be a one-stop platform for startups and ecosystem stakeholders containing all relevant information and resources.At least 10% of all goods and services will be procured by the administration from UT-registered startups, states the draft policy, a copy of which is with the HT.The 2021 draft also mandated the administration to set up a dedicated entrepreneurship centre for Women (ECW), which was envisaged as a hub for aspiring and seasoned women entrepreneurs providing access to mentorship, capacity-building exercises, and other programmes beneficial for women-led startups. The ECW shall run dedicated incubation and acceleration programme for women on an annual or biannual basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-is-again-planning-a-dedicated-startup-policy-101637413285756.html
20-11-2021||Mumbai||After inauguration last December, indoor sports complex in Vashi lying unused||To give a boost to the city’s sports infrastructure, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) had developed an indoor sports complex at Vashi Sector 10 and inaugurated it last December.However, the complex has not been opened for the local residents even for a single day after that.According to officials from the civic sports department, the complex was developed mainly for promoting games such as billiards, table tennis, carrom and chess. They developed the single-storied building of the complex by spending ₹66 lakh on one part of a ground near the mini-seashore.Avinash Lad, former corporator of the area, said, “Due to the lack of indoor sports complexes in Navi Mumbai, our youth have to travel to Mumbai. We had been raising this matter for the past several years and NMMC finally approved the proposal in 2018. So, even as small in size, this is the first indoor sports complex developed by the NMMC. Sadly, they took no effort to open it in the last one year.”According to the officials, the size of the entire ground is 11,891sqm. Of this, they used 1,577sqm of land for this complex. The rest of the ground has been reserved for outdoor games like cricket, football and handball. Manish Bhoir, an activist and sports enthusiast from Vashi, said, “After the second lockdown, NMMC opened all parks, gardens and gymnasiums. Even the private clubs and other institutes are now continuing with their routine affairs. Why can’t NMMC open this indoor sports complex for us?” Manoj Mahale, deputy municipal commissioner of NMMC (sports), said, “Even as we developed this complex keeping in mind different indoor games, our priority was to promote billiards through it. At present, we don’t have anyone who can train the visitors on that game. We are in the process of hiring coaches and as soon as we do that, the complex will be opened. It may take us one more month to finish the process of hiring.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-inauguration-last-december-indoor-sports-complex-in-vashi-lying-unused-101637413225466.html

However, there is no smooth public transport system to travel the distance. According to the ACTREC officials, around 200 patients travel to their centre from the hospital in Parel almost every day.SH Jafri, senior administrative officer of ACTREC, said, “A large number of our patients are not locals of Mumbai and hence they face a lot of problems while travelling from Parel to Kharghar and vice-versa in trains, especially during the peak hours. Therefore, we have requested NMMT to start bus services between the two hospitals. As around 200 patients come here in a day, a minimum of three buses will be required. We have asked for one bus in the morning, one during the day and one in the evening (to and fro). The NMMT officials have given us a positive response.” Yogesh Kaduskar, general manager of NMMT, said, “Many of our buses and officials were dedicated to transporting Covid patients during the pandemic. Now, since the Covid scenario is much better in Navi Mumbai, we are taking them back from NMMC. Therefore, we may not have any issue dedicating a few buses between these two hospitals. We will analyse the entire scenario and take a decision soon.”On August 15, NMMT started bus services between Kharghar railway station and ACTREC, which is located at Sector 22, receiving a very good response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tata-centre-asks-for-nmmt-bus-services-between-parel-and-kharghar-101637413168493.html
20-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police constable arrested for molesting 10-year-old girl||Bhandup police have arrested a police constable attached to the Worli local arms (LA) unit for allegedly molesting a 10-year-old girl. The accused police personnel has been suspended from service, pending a departmental inquiry. The accused, Harshal Bodke, is a resident of Kalyan. According to police officers, Bodke, 25, had last week visited a Bhandup bar along with his two other friends. After having some drinks, the trio was roaming around on bike outside the railway station area. According to the complainant, the accused got down from the bike and inappropriately touched her daughter. She raised an alarm and visited Bhandup police station to report the matter. The woman and her daughter had come to Mumbai from Ratnagiri. On the basis of her complaint, the police registered an offence on November 15 and arrested Bodke under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012. After his two-day police custody, a local court has remanded him in jail custody. A police officer from Bhandup police station said that during interrogation, Bodke claimed that he had not touched the girl with an intention of molesting her. He claimed that he has been married for the past five years and has no children. He love kids and was just trying to speak to the girl, he claimed in his interrogation. However, the police department observed that prima facie his act was “shameful and immoral” and hence, suspended him.

20-11-2021||Lucknow||Maya demands new farm law guaranteeing MSP||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday said while the withdrawal of three contentious farm laws was a late but much needed move, the government was yet to act on a demand by farmers to enact a farm law guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) to them for their produce.She also sought to remind the BJP government that the country had suffered due to what she described as the “autocratic” Congress regime led by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In a veiled manner, she said the Centre’s decision to withdraw farm laws might have been politically motivated. Mayawati is among the several opposition leaders who have said that the Centre’s announcement was forced upon due to electoral compulsions in Punjab and in western UP, areas where farmers’ agitation was widely expected to cost the BJP in the 2022 assembly elections. Throughout their agitation the farmers had flagged, among other things, the government’s plan to do away with the MSP and despite firm and repeated denials by the government, the farmers had stuck to their stand. “The Centre’s withdrawal of three controversial farm laws following a sharp agitation has been dubbed a late but wise move. However, it has also been described as a decision forced upon by electoral compulsions. Hence some strong steps are required in this regard,” Mayawati tweeted. “It is in this light that a new law guaranteeing minimum support price to farmers is enacted,” Mayawati added. On Friday too, she had said though announcement for withdrawal of three contentious farm laws had been made, the government was yet to act upon a demand by farmers to enact a law guaranteeing minimum support price for their produce.Mayawati also said it would be better if the Centre ensured the cases registered against farmers who had been agitating against those farm laws were withdrawn. “In the past, the country has suffered a lot due to the then Indira Gandhi-led Congress party’s autocratic behaviour. Now, the country hopes it never has to witness a similar thing again,” she tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/maya-demands-new-farm-law-guaranteeing-msp-101637408485007.html

"This Court is required to be sensitive to fact that there has to be presence of basic material in the form of evidence so as to substantiate the case of conspiracy against the Applicants," the judge added.No drug was found in Aryan Khan's possession while the quantity recovered from Merchant and Dhamecha were 'small' under the NDPS Act, the court noted. But there was no such material, the judge held. The NCB has alleged it seized 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone MD, 21 grams of charas and 22 pills of MDMA ecstasy after its raid on the cruise ship.Also read | SRK's manager to be summoned again, say cops as Pooja Dadlani skips questioningThe Bombay HC judge also observed that the WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan did not have anything objectionable to suggest that he conspired to commit offences under the NDPS act."After having gone through the Whats-App chats extracted from Applicant/Accused no. 1’s (Khan) phone, nothing objectionable could be noticed to suggest that Applicant nos. 1 & 2 (Merchant) or all three applicants alongwith other Accused persons in agreement have meeting of minds and have hatched conspiracy committing the offence in question," the order said."Rather the investigation carried out till this date suggests that Applicant/Accused nos. 1 & 2 (Khan and Merchant) were travelling independent of Applicant/Accused no. 3 (Dhamecha) and there was no meeting of minds on the aforesaid issue.”Also read | Sameer Wankhede part of plot to kidnap Aryan: Nawab MalikAryan Khan was taken into custody by the NCB on October 2 after the central agency led by senior official Sameer Wankhede raided a cruise ship.

20-11-2021||Lucknow||UP Board exams-2022: Teams under DIOSs to undertake centres’ mapping||The exam centres allotment policy for the proposed high school and intermediate examinations-2022 of UP Board expected to be held in the last week of March next year has been released by the state government. Like last year, this time also priority will be given to girls’ schools for being made exam centres, said state education department officials in the know about the development. “For the first time, a system has been introduced of constituting a team at the level of district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) for mapping (geo location) of schools to be made exam centres,” they said.Earlier, the mapping process of the examination centres was done at the level of principals but this was resulting in avoidable delay in centre allotments. To solve this problem, the responsibility of mapping had now been given to the DIOSs, the officials added.“The exam centre allotment policy for the 2022 UP Board examinations has been issued by the state government. We request for time bound action for centre allotments using the online mode as per these norms,” UP Board secretary Divyakant Shukla has said in a missive sent to all district magistrates (DMs) and DIOSs of the state intimating about the government’s decision along with a copy of the centre allotment policy as conveyed by additional chief secretary (secondary education) Aradhana Shukla on November 18, 2021.

20-11-2021||Lucknow||Row over book: Rizvi slams Owaisi, says he should have read it first||Slamming All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi for lodging a First Information Report (FIR) against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through “objectionable” content in his book “Muhammad”, former Uttar Pradesh Shia Waqf Board chairman Wasim Rizvi said the Hyderabad MP (Owaisi) should have read the book before lodging the FIR. “My book is about all truth and is based on hidden facts. Owaisi should have first gone through my book that is based on all facts before reacting,” Rizvi said in a video statement he released on Saturday morning.“Through his party, Owaisi is trying to mislead Muslim youths and pushing them further towards terrorism. He is hatching a conspiracy against the non-Muslim community and is planning a bloodshed,” Rizvi alleged in his 34-second statement. On Wednesday (November 17), Owaisi had lodged a complaint against Rizvi and his associates with Kamatipura police station in Hyderabad alleging that “the book written in Hindi uses ‘objectionable language’ against Prophet Muhammad”. The case was registered against Rizvi and his associates under sections 153A (promoting enmity among people on grounds of religion), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), and other sections of the Indian Penal Code based on Owaisi’s complaint.Earlier on November 4, Rizvi released his book at Dasna Delvi temple at Ghaziabad in the presence of Hindutva leader Narsinghanand Saraswati. However, the issue snowballed on November 15 after Rizvi posted the cover page image and buy link of the book on his facebook wall with a note—‘You can easily download e-book Muhammad from here’.

20-11-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: AgriVijay is re-farming the eco-revolution in India||AgriVijay, a Pune-based agritech startup founded by Vimal Panjwani and Shobha Chanchlani, in the midst of the Covid outbreak back in June 2020, has developed a marketplace for renewable energy products connecting farmers and rural households. With a vision focussed on increasing farmer savings and incomes, reducing dependency on fossil fuels such as diesel and firewood, along with contributing to the climate change mitigation, AgriVijay is “empowering farmers for tomorrow” with renewable energy products in solar, biogas, and electricity.In the beginningA BTech in Bioinformatics and with an MBA in Agribusiness Management from Symbiosis Institute of International Business (SIIB) in Pune, Vimal Panjwani never thought that he would have his own startup, that too amidst a Covid-19 outbreak. Panjwani has a decade of experience working in different multinational companies. While he was thinking of switching his role after quitting his job in February 2020, Covid happened and Panjwani was left clueless.Says Panjwani, “I was at home with my mom, Shobha Chanchlani, a retired government employee from Rajasthan, when she said I can’t sit idle at home and want to do something in life. She asked me why I didn’t start my own company instead of building it for others? I was never inclined to become an entrepreneur, but she pushed me to become one. I was passionate for farmers and climate change and renewable energy. She was ready to invest all her funds and we thought let’s work on this.”“I came up with an idea that farmers still struggle to get renewable energy products at the village level – whether you talk about solar, biogas, electric, wind or hydro; farmers don’t have knowledge about the product and they don’t get it at village level. So, we decided why not open a marketplace of renewable energy where we will understand the energy needs of farmers and help them increase savings and income and we will also mitigate the climate change issue which is need of the hour. AgriVijay was born as an idea,” Panjwani said.Lockdown “child”Panjwani wishes that farmers and everybody else in the ecosystem wins. “Vijay, in Hindi, means winning and farmers should feel the connect with our Indian company. Our vision is to make agriculture win with renewable energy. Hence, we named our startup AgriVijay, which was officially registered on June 25, 2020. This journey started from an apartment in Pashan during the Covid-19 lockdown period.”Born and brought up in Ajmer, but settled in Pune, Panjwani had been to Rajasthan in November 2020. Meanwhile, he was working on the business model, idea, pitch deck, marketing. Stuck in Rajasthan due to lockdown, Panjwani launched operations from his hometown. Says Panjwani, “We hired a small team including a field sales executive and decided to utilise local languages to communicate with the farmers to discuss their problems related to energy requirement. We started a call centre through which farmers started reaching out to us. After hearing their problems, we started recommending a renewable energy-based solution which can be a solar, biogas, electric or anything. Our field sales team started meeting farmers to discuss the energy needs with them. So, we decided we need to have two types of models – offline and online.”Renewable energy storesIn the first few days itself Panjwani and his team realised that farmers don’t buy solar water pumps, solar inverters, biogas digesters or electric tractors online. “These are very capital-intensive products and farmers are not so comfortable buying these products online. So, we started our offline model which is called as renewable energy store model, which is at village level. These stores located in villages are opened by the businesses which were impacted by Covid and want a cash flow. Along with the cash business, we actually bring savings for rural community and also earn some income. That’s why this model worked very well. Our first store opened in December 2020 and then we started getting orders for solar pumps, solar inverters, biogas digesters. By the time we came to Maharashtra in February, we had already generated a good amount of business in Rajasthan. We had about 10 renewable energy stores by March 2021,” Panjwani stated.Survival skillsSays Panjwani, “When we started in Maharashtra on April 15, 2021, we were witnessing the second wave and then again lockdown was announced. I think we were born in Covid and the challenge of the lockdown actually aggravated our needs, but made us more resilient. For more than 1.5 months we were locked in home, trying to communicate with farmers and deliver orders and complete the installations.”“When the second lockdown opened, we grew very fast. In Maharashtra we now have 40 renewable stores activated in Maharashtra from June 2021 till date. We have covered the entire Vidarbha region. We have a branch office in Baramati with support of Atal Incubation Centre and Niti Aayog,” Panjwani added. TeamworkAgriVijay has a 15-member team spread across Maharashtra and Rajasthan. With offices in Baramati (Pune) and another one in Jaipur supported by Bajaj Foundation, AgriVijay has recently entered UK with their first international office. “We are joining the global climate change and sustainable development goals movement because we are hiring rural youth and training them to become renewable energy warriors. We are also building small rural businesses at village level as renewable energy stores,” says Panjwani.“We have a field sales and technical team along with the call centre. Availability of renewable energy products only at the urban or semi-urban areas limits the options for the farmers to choose these products and become renewable energy producers. Our renewable energy stores educate farmers and their community about the renewable products and also make them available at village level.”“We also do product recommendations, delivery and installation. We have 25+ companies in solar, biogas and electric as our partners at the head office level which gives us 150+ products range of huge renewable energy products for farmers. All these companies are either startups or other big brands such as Shakti, Toyota,” Panjwani stated.Insurance and EMI AgriVijay has now launched free solar insurance on renewable energy products. “Most of farmers and families were not switching to solar products because they feared that someone might steal the solar panel or natural calamities like heavy rains, sand dunes may damage the panel. Hence, we started giving free solar insurance against theft and damage so that farmers can switch to renewable energy easily with us. We are also launching easy EMI scheme from next month with one reputed NBFC and bank so that poor, small and marginal farmers can buy these products on easy instalments. By next month we will launch the EMI scheme in Baramati and Jaipur for farmers,” adds Panjwani.Everybody winsAgriVijay has touched the lives of 5,000 farmers and their families from Maharashtra and Rajasthan till date, claims Panjwani. “We have onboarded 100 farmers and their families with products such as solar water pumps, solar water heaters, solar inverters, biogas digesters, solar street lights, and we have mitigated thousands of tonnes of GHG and CO2 emissions in just 10 months. We want to open 1,000 renewable energy stores with 10,000 farmers/families. We are not just a marketplace. We are an Agritech social enterprise and we want to remain that. We want to scale our idea and product portfolio across rural regions of India, but at its own pace.”Future plans Says Panjwani, “After we raise our first round of funding, we want to scale our model to other states mainly Gujarat, Telangana, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh where farmers are actually waiting to have an option to increase their savings and income. We also have a plan to open 1,000 renewable energy stores in next five years. We are trying to mitigate at least 100,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. We will soon open small offices and operation points wherever our stores are increasing.”“We are also going to start our B2B department. We will work with CSR departments of companies who are looking to deploy funds or adopt a village or penetrate a renewable energy product in a village or do something with their CSR funds. We will help them make these products available, install and make the village or community savings or incomes increase. We will also add this to our portfolio as a revenue stream,” he added.Challenge from traditional distributors Says Panjwani, “Typically distributors deal with one particular product or technology or company. USP of AgriVijay is that we are multifaceted and the product range is huge. We have solar milk can chillers, solar dryers, biogas gensets, electric tractors, electric two wheelers. We are also adding electric charging stations - the infrastructure for renewable energy. Being multifaceted is why we are getting in direct competition with dealers and distributors at this time.”Does it work?“Earlier, we were paying 15 to 20 thousand on electricity bills for irrigating our vegetable farms. Now we are saving that money. We got a return on our investment on the Solar Water Pump installed by the AgriVijay team in just 1 year. We also got free solar insurance from the team making us feel secure against theft and damage from natural calamities.”- Farmer Shahbuddin, Khanpura village, Rajasthan“I took the AgriVijay franchise after COVID19 second lockdown. I have generated a profit of about ₹20,000 in three months by educating farmers and communities about and selling solar inverters, solar water heaters and pumps.”- Swapnil Chandgude, Renewable Energy Store Owner, Baramati||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-agrivijay-is-re-farming-the-eco-revolution-in-india-101637405785025.html

20-11-2021||Delhi||Sundeep Sharma: Can tell where a joke will land while writing it||Comedians, many a time, face flak over things they end up saying during a performance. However, stand-up comedian Sundeep Sharma says that once he says something, he knows exactly the amount of laughs or controversy it would generate. “Just as Neeraj Chopra knows how far his javelin will go, a comedian also knows where he will land up after saying what he says. It’s a personal call. As a performer, you know how to push boundaries. Everyone at different stages of their career knows what they are saying. As a comedian, I can assume the kind of laughs a joke will get while writing it, and also have a fair idea of where it will land. In India, the more controversy you create, the more tickets you sell,” he states. Sharma hails from Mumbai, but he stayed in Delhi for 12 years at the start of his career. And, performing in Delhi-NCR is like a trip down memory lane. “I stayed in Saket... That Delhi was different. There were so many trees that the road looked like a painting, with sunlight coming through them,” he recalls. Ask him if he has a plan in mind ahead of his performances in Delhi-NCR, and he shares, “Delhi has a lot of college crowd that comes after classes. But, it also has old residents of the city who come to watch my shows. Gurugram, on the other hand, has a younger crowd. But, my content remains the same. There is, of course, a slight bit of change in the interaction with the audience, depending on the situation.”Catch it Live:What: Stand up comedy by Sundeep SharmaWhere: Imperfecto, Ansal Plaza , Barish Moon Bar and Brewery in Noida and Daddy of Tastes (D.O.T) at GurugramWhen: November 20 (Imperfecto, Ansal Plaza), November 21 (Barish Moon Bar and Brewery) and November 27 (Daddy of Tastes) Timings: 4 pm (Imperfecto Ansal Plaza), 7 pm (Barish Moon Bar and Brewery), 5pm (Daddy of Tastes)Nearest Metro station: South Extension station (Imperfecto Ansal Plaza), Noida Sector 18 Metro Station (Barish Moon Bar and Brewery) and HUDA City Centre (Daddy of Tastes)Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sundeep-sharma-can-tell-where-a-joke-will-land-while-writing-it-101637403144417.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||Hybrid work the new normal? Delhiites juggle between WFH and WFO||Getting up early in the morning, packing your work bags, setting out on a long commute and making it to the office in just the nick of time... what felt like a normal daily routine once, has become a rare occurrence after a year and a half of battling the pandemic. And as the city comes back to a semblance of normalcy, many workplaces in Delhi-NCR are adopting a hybrid working model, allowing employees to work from home for some days a week and visiting office on the rest. While some are glad to be back, others feel frazzled from this half-and-half system. “I work on hardware and now that Covid-19 cases are less, I am going to work once in two weeks for things that can’t be done sitting at home. But ab aadat nai rahi travel karne ki, so it gets very tiring and then because half my stuff is at home and half is at office, it’s tough to balance. Toh office se vapis aake bhi kaam karna padhta hai,” says Siddharth Verma, a tech professional from Malviya Nagar. And Verma is not the only one who feels tied to work 24*7 in this model. Rahul Bhardwaj, a sales professional who travels from Faridabad to Noida for work, shares, “It takes me one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening in commute. It’s exhausting. Usually at office, the day ends once you step out of the office. But now, in this setup, once you are back home, you are still working as you have your laptop .”And to further add to the difficulties, all employees are not called in at the same time to maintain social distancing. “My work involves physical review of fabric qualities. We work as a team, but if half of people are working from home and half are present at the office, then work never gets done correctly,” says Neha Shukla, a merchandising manager from Paschim Vihar. But for some, going to work is a welcome change. “We all missed our chit-chats with colleagues and the coffee breaks. These fillers keep us going about our schedules,” says Diksha Garg, a CA from CR Park. Aditi Gupta, a Gurugram-based marketing professional, makes the most of the situation by carrying her laptop to work. “I’m happy to go the office as it helps me concentrate. I carry my laptop, so it’s easy to set up workstation wherever I am working from,” she saysAuthor tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hybrid-work-the-new-normal-delhiites-juggle-between-wfh-and-wfo-101637402973356.html
20-11-2021||Other||Odisha allows jatra shows with a maximum audience of 2000 people||With daily Covid cases in the range of 200-250 over last week, the Odisha government on Saturday allowed all cultural activities, including jatra and open-air theatres, with a maximum attendance of 2000 people, officials said.In his order, Special Relief Commissioner PK Jena said cultural gatherings/programmes including melodies, orchestra/jatra/opera, dances-classical, folk and other permitted dance forms, cultural competitions, open-air theatres/drama/nukkad natak/street plays/other such performances would be allowed to open with due compliance to Covid-19 protocols.Jatras are travelling open-air theatres that are very popular in rural and semi-urban Odisha and perform shows on social issues at night. Over 40000 artists and technicians depend on jatra.However, only 2000 persons would be allowed to attend such shows and will have to maintain a distance of 6 feet from each other. Everyone in the audience will have to wear face masks.Expressing happiness, Daitari Panda, president of Jatra Kalakar Sangh, said, the permission to have 2000 people watch jatra shows is a welcome step to stop the industry from dying. “Though we had permission to organise Jatra with a provision of 500 audiences, it was not enough to revive the industry and the artists,” he said. With jatra troupes unable to hold shows, many artists had taken to selling vegetables, fish and fruits to run their families.The government said the facility for online booking of tickets may be arranged by the organisers and a sufficient number of counters should be opened to prevent crowding during the booking of offline tickets. For indoor halls, the number of viewers/spectators will not exceed 50% of the seating capacity of the hall.The order said cinema halls, theatres would be allowed to open with up to 50% of capacity and operate with due compliance to Covid protocols.

20-11-2021||Delhi||#AadiMahotsav: A celebration of tribal culture, cuisine and creativity||New DelhiPromoting tribal craft, culture and spirit, the annual Tribes India Aadi Mahotsav in the Capital breaks the perception around tribals or adivasis, being primitive forest dwellers and connects them to buyers and adds to their income stream. For Lahaul Spiti-based tribal textile artisan Gulshan Kumar, who has been participating since 2015, the exhibition is a way for generations to continue their crafts. He says, “Coming to the festival adds to our revenue, which also helps in next generations not repelling from our traditional craft.” One among the 1,000 participating craftsmen from over 20 states across India, Kumar exhibits handmade shawls and woollen clothing from the Himalayan region. The exhibition at Dilli Haat, INA sees the sale of vibrant tribal handicrafts, art, paintings, fabrics and jewellery across 200 stalls. The team of Rajesh Yalam, a Gond tribal from Bastar, Chhattisgarh, is selling local tribal food. “I’ve been visiting [the exhibition] for three years.

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal | Chitkara University unveils entrepreneurship cell Jazba||Chitkara University, Himachal Pradesh, on Friday unveiled its entrepreneurship cell, Jazba, under the aegis of the Chitkara University Centre For Entrepreneurship Education and Development (CEED). Jazba hopes to motivate students to become job creators and inculcate leadership qualities in them. Speakers at the entrepreneurship summit included a 16-year-old budding scientist and crypto expert Aryaman Verma; IIT Mandi catalyst programme faculty and head Puran Singh; Learning at Ingenious Faces director Nupur Mahajan; and WYN Studios founder Souniya Khurana.Professor Sumeer Walia, director CEED, Chitkara University, said, “Jazba or passion is very much related to entrepreneurship as risk-taking ability, freedom and creativity are all a part of the process. Moreover, entrepreneurship is about daring personalities who have the passion to walk on the cliff and take risks to build great enterprises, that’s why we named our e-cell as Jazba.”Speaking at the event, Mahajan said, “Such events form an integral part of the career of a student. If a student has experienced global exposure by being an intern in an international start-up, it adds a tremendous amount of confidence and hones the personality and skills.”“Failure is a new qualification that is respected by top employers and podcasting is the future communication methodology where we can leverage the power of audio and turn it into a business,” said Khurana.“Startup is a new way of creating and developing the product and delivering a service in an innovative way. The focus of incubators should be the development of a founder’s mindset and creating founders rather than creating only innovators,” said Puran Singh. Chitkara University pro-chancellor Madhu Chitkara said, “Entrepreneurship development has been one of our focus areas. Chitkara University Himachal Pradesh has a successful record of creating some brilliant start-ups such as Chai Nagri, ROBO Champs, SD Academia and many more.”Talking about the future events of JAZBA, Professor Sumeer Walia, director CEED, said, “In December, a huge event ‘Hackday 2021’ will be conducted where teams of students will compete against each other to create problem-solving business ideas using AI-based technologies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-chitkara-university-unveils-entrepreneurship-cell-jazba-101637401165906.html

Ashpak Balorgi, a councillor of Akkalkot Municipal Council in Solapur district, had moved high court questioning the November 9, 2021 decision of the ECI and sought a direction to the authority to hold elections for the MLC seat from Solapur local authorities constituency. The term of sitting members from seven seats of the Maharashtra legislative council ends on January 1, 2022, but the ECI has decided to hold elections only for Mumbai, Kolhapur, Dhule-Nandurbar, Akola-Buldana-Washim, and Nagpur constituencies The ECI has, however, decided to exclude two seats – Ahmednagar and Solapur local authorities constituencies – for failing to meet the criteria of at least 75% functional electorate. Balorgi moved high court questioning the decision on two counts – first, he contended that the conclusion that Solapur constituency did not meet the criteria of 75% functional electorate was factually incorrect, for five new recently created municipal councils in the district were taken into consideration. He contended that no elections have been held for the new municipal councils and if they were excluded from the zone of consideration, the functional electorate (elected representatives of local bodies) in the constituency would be 82.82%. The contention, however, failed to impress upon the division bench of justice Gautam Patel and justice Madhav Jamdar. The bench dismissed Balorgi’s petition on Monday. The bench said once a municipal council is constituted, it is difficult to see how it can be “excluded” from the computation for the purposes of reckoning a number of electors. “Indeed, we perceive a wholesale failure of logic in this argument,” said the bench. HC clarified that if these newly formed councils were to be excluded today, and an election from the Solapur constituency was directed to be held, then, in a few months, when the newly-formed councils have their electors, there will be no possibility of an election to the Solapur constituency, for the election will already have been done — and the newly formed councils would be entirely disenfranchised. Instead, the court said, if Solapur is excluded for the present, then, once the electors for the newly-formed councils are formed, the election process can begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-interfere-with-eci-s-decision-to-exclude-solapur-from-mlc-elections-101637400865607.html

Of those vaccinated, 38,000 were in the 18-45 years of age group and the remaining 35,749 were above 45 years of age.“Apart from Bankatwa, residents of neighbouring blocks namely Chirraiya, Dhaka to name a few were also vaccinated in Bankatwa block and as a result, the number of the second dose inoculation surpassed the first dose of vaccination in our block,” said Dr Ashutosh Kumar, medical officer and in-charge of primary health centre (PHC), Bankatwa.East Champaran district magistrate Shirsat Kapil Ashok said that except for children and non-resident workers, the double dose of vaccine has been administered to all available eligible 18-plus population in Bankatwa block. “This could be possible thanks to the active participation of beneficiaries aided with assistance extended by the state government and efforts taken by our government officials, health workers and UNICEF,” said district magistrate Shirsat Kapil Ashok.Ashok said that the district administration is keeping an eye on workers and other non-residents of Bankatwa block. “They will be administered the same if remained to be inoculated yet. Of lately, we ran a special drive which benefitted a large number of non-residents in the course of their stay in native places during festive occasions,” said the district magistrate.When asked if Bankatwa is Bihar’s first block to achieve this feat, DM’s said, “It could well be but anything can precisely be said only after confirmation from authorities concerned at the state headquarters.”When contacted, Pratyaya Amrit, additional chief secretary, health, Bihar described it as a stupendous effort and complimented the efforts. “There isn’t any reason to disagree with what DM (East Champaran) says. If it is so, Bankatwa is Bihar’s first block to achieve it. It’s great teamwork... The people of Bankatwa have set a model for other blocks of Bihar to follow,” said the additional chief secretary.Located in East Champaran’s Sikarahana subdivision with ten panchayats, 27 revenue villages and 131 Anganwadi centres and having a population of 1,16863 as per 2011 census, Bankatwa sought limelight in June this year after it became Bihar’s first block where entire eligible inhabitants above 18 years of age were vaccinated with the first dose against Covid-19 as well.Munendra Kumar, block mobiliser coordinator (BMC) of UNICEF, Bankatwa, described the biggest challenge to alert the beneficiaries. “Unlike the vaccination for the first dose, the alleged misgivings about the vaccines were not there. But then we had to alert the beneficiaries for their second dose. However, we had to give many reminders in some cases,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bankatwa-becomes-bihar-s-first-block-to-complete-double-vaccination-in-eligible-population-101637400325889.html

Due to Gurupurb, the Muslims themselves refused to offer Namaz to avoid any conflict. We will take the final decision on Namaz next week.""Why there is an issue in offering Namaz in public or open space when we can take out Kanwar Yatra or Nagar Kirtan. In the 1984 riots, Muslims gave a message of brotherhood by saving the lives of thousands of Sikhs," he added.Meanwhile, a local resident Lakhiram Yeduvanshi has offered his land to perform Namaz."I contacted the chairman of Muslim Ekta Manch in order to offer them land to offer Namaz. There are some miscreants who want to disturb the peace in the area. I am offering my plot to the Muslim brothers to perform Namaz," said Yeduvanshi.Earlier on November 18, the Gurdwara association of Sadar Bazar in Gurugram had decided to offer its premises for Friday prayers following objections over the offering of namaz in public and open places.The Gurugram administration had withdrawn permission to offer namaz at eight out of 37 designated sites.As per an official statement from the district administration, the permission was cancelled after an objection from the local people and Resident Welfare Association (RWA).On several occasions earlier, residents of Gurugram have complained and staged a protest against Friday namaz offered at a public ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/despite-nod-no-friday-prayers-offered-at-gurugram-gurudwaras-on-gurupurab-101637398978884.html

On November 3, Gauhati High Court found the Foreigners Tribunal’s order incomplete and asked the Hailakandi foreigner’s tribunal (FT) to hear the case again on December 3, 2021. Ree died on Friday evening due to a cardiac arrest. His last wish was to prove his Indian identity which remained unfulfilled.In December last year, 104-year-old Chandradhar Das died with a similar unfulfilled wish. Das, who migrated to India from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1956, used to say, “I won’t die before I prove my identity.”Sukdev Ree was a resident of the Mohanpur village under Algapur assembly constituency in Hailakandi district. He was released from the detention camp on February 26, last year based on a supreme court’s advisory to release the inmates who have served imprisonment of two years or more. A daily wage earner, Ree used to earn ₹110 per day whenever there was production going on in the tea estate. A case was registered against him in 2012 and he appeared before the court a few times before his arrest on June 24, 2016.Tribunal Court declared Sukdev Ree a foreigner of post 25.03.1971 stream in an ex-parte judgement because he did not appear at the time of cross-examination on several occasions. The court said, “The petitioner failed to discharge the burden cast upon him under Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946.”Recently, this order was challenged by Ree’s lawyer in Gauhati High Court. Justice Kotiswar Singh and justice Malashri Nandi after hearing a petition to reopen Sukdev Ree’s case on November 3 found that Ree deserved another chance to produce his documents.They wrote to the FT Hailakandi, “Considering the nature of the case and after hearing, we are of the view that the petitioner has furnished documents before the Tribunal to claim that he is an Indian. Documents including voters lists of 1966 and 1970 in which the name of his father appeared and subsequent the voters lists of 1977 and 2005 where the name of the petitioner appeared. Accordingly, it has been submitted that the petitioner has sufficient evidence. Considering the circumstances, we are of the opinion that another opportunity may be granted to the petitioner to prove that he is an Indian citizen and not a foreigner.”“It is made clear that if the petitioner fails to appear before the foreigner’s tribunal, Hailakandi on 03.12.2021, the earlier order passed by the learned foreigner’s tribunal on 20.04.2016 will stand revived and the order passed by this Court today will stand vacated and law will take its course,” the order further states.Sukdev Ree’s wife Sishubala expressed that at one point, her husband refused to appear before the court due to the harrasment by the lawyers.“After getting a notice from Tribunal Court, we met a lawyer. But he kept asking for money – sometimes ₹2,000- ₹3000 or more. We took loans and paid the lawyer but after a point, we just gave up as we did not have enough money to fight the legal battle. We have kids to feed instead. We didn’t realise that he’ll be arrested,” she said.According to Dhonu Ree (35), the eldest son of Sukdev Ree, his father didn’t want to challenge the court’s order even after coming out from detention camp.“My father lost hope when few social activists came forward. Recently, when he heard about a fresh change to prove his identity, he started preparing. He was so excited and used to say that he’ll fight again. He won’t leave a legacy for his kids that their father was a Bangladeshi. His dream remained unfulfilled,” Dhonu said.Dhonu also informed that they’ll appear before FT-3 of Hailakandi on December 3, with all documents of Sukdev Ree, so that he becomes an Indian even after his death.Social activist Kamal Chakraborty, who fought for Sukdev Ree’s bail last year, informed that Sukdev’s father’s name is Dhiraj Bauri and his grandfather’s name is Monu Bauri.“When Sukdev Ree’s father’s name got changed from Dhiraj Bauri to Dhiraj Ree during voters list updating process, they had no clue. Someone like Sukdev Ree, who is an original inhabitant of Assam and has got nothing to do with Bangladesh, had to live as a foreigner unless he appealed at High Court.”“Supreme Court says, Tea Garden Tribes fall under Original Inhabitants of Assam category in respect to The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issues of National Identity Card) Rules 2003, under clause 3(3). I am surprised how the tribunal court declared Sukdev Ree a foreigner,” Chakraborty added.Sukdev Ree fell unconscious on Friday afternoon and was taken to a local government hospital. After an initial medical checkup, he was sent back home. In the evening around 6:30 pm his health deteriorated and family members called a local doctor. The doctor visited his house and declared him dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/65yrold-declared-foreigner-in-assam-dies-before-last-chance-to-prove-indian-identity-101637399064378.html
20-11-2021||Kolkata||BJP's Tathagata Roy bids 'farewell' to party's West Bengal unit for time being||Senior BJP leader Tathagata Roy, who has been lashing out at the party's West Bengal leadership since the assembly poll debacle, on Saturday said he has decided to bid "farewell” to the state unit of the saffron camp for the time being, apparently indicating that he would stop criticism of its leaders.Roy said he would wait to see the municipal poll results in Bengal. According to sources close to him, the term “farewell” doesn’t mean that he is leaving the party. Roy was trying to say that he would stop attacking the state leadership for the time being as his criticism led to an embarrassment to the party, the sources said. Earlier this week, the former governor of Meghalaya had said the party would become extinct if the state unit did not mend its ways. "I was not writing on Twitter to get applause from people. I was doing this to make the party aware of the fact that some leaders got swayed by women and wealth. Now only results will speak. I will wait for the results of the municipal polls. Farewell, for now, West Bengal BJP!” Roy said on the microblogging site on Saturday. State BJP leaders declined to comment on the development. "BJP’s well-wishers pointed out that I should make complaints about money and women within the party and not publicly. I politely tell them that the time has passed. The BJP can do whatever it wants to me. But if they do not radically reform their way of functioning, the extinction of the party in West Bengal is inevitable," Roy tweeted earlier this week. Roy had asserted that he would continue to play the role of his party's "conscience-keeper" after BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh told him that he was free to leave the camp if he was "upset and ashamed" over its style of functioning. Roy had recently been critical of the decisions taken by BJP's West Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya, Ghosh, and senior leaders Arvind Menon and Shiv Prakash, ahead of March-April assembly polls, and blamed them in a series of tweets for the saffron camp's poor show in the last assembly elections. The BJP won only 77 seats of the 294-member West Bengal assembly in the last elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjps-tathagata-roy-bids-farewell-to-party-s-west-bengal-unit-for-time-being-101637397959221.html

What we know so far||With no relief from air pollution, Delhi government may bring back its ‘odd-even’ rule for vehicular traffic, Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan reported on Saturday. Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the national capital has already asked commuters to get colour-coded fuel stickers for their vehicles, Livehindustan further said.This comes days after Delhi's environment minister Gopal Rai told news agency Reuters in an interview, "If air pollution levels stay high, we will look at new measures like the odd-even (vehicle) system."The odd-even system of the Delhi government allows private vehicles to be driven only on alternating days, depending on the last digit of their number plate.The chromium-based hologram fuel stickers – blue for petrol or CNG and orange for diesel – were mandated by the Supreme Court and under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 for all vehicles registered in the national capital territory (NCT) of Delhi, read a notice issued by the Transport department on Friday."The owners of old vehicles are advised to approach dealers concerned for affixing Chromium based hologram stickers on the windshield of their vehicles depending on the relevant class of fuel," the notice stated.The rule was implemented especially for vehicles registered prior to April 2019 that did not come with these stickers. The colour-coded stickers help enforcement personnel easily identify the fuel type of a vehicle during checks on the roads.Those who commute in their vehicles without the sticker are liable to a fine of ₹10,000, compoundable to ₹5,500 for the offence."We are only increasing awareness about these stickers and no enforcement drive is planned in near future," a transport department officer told news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oddeven-rule-to-return-in-delhi-what-we-know-so-far-101637386740733.html
20-11-2021||Jaipur||‘Centre should decide soon on need of booster dose’: Gehlot||Emphasizing the need for Covid-19 booster dose, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said a letter will be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to permit booster dose. He said it is learnt that booster doses are being administered in about 35 countries of the world. In such a situation, it is necessary for the Central government to take appropriate decisions regarding the need for booster doses and issue guidelines to the states to save the people from the third wave. The state health department will be conducting its own serosurvey to assess the need for vaccines booster doses. Under the survey, over 16,800 samples from 14 districts will be collected to assess the immunity of the people who have been administered with the first, second or no dose of the vaccine. Gehlot expressed his concern over the increase in the number of corona positive cases in some districts of the state in the last few days. He said that in view of the experiences of the second wave and the nature of this virus, the strategy of re-testing, tracking and tracing should be implemented strongly. He said that it is necessary to stop the infection at the primary level so that the people of the state can be saved from the third wave. Reviewing the Covid-19 situation and that of seasonal diseases on Friday, he said that sampling should be increased across the state. Principal of SMS Medical College, Dr Sudhir Bhandari, said that after vaccination, serosurvey is being done to check the immunity in people, in which frontline workers, health care workers and the general public have been included. The purpose of the survey is to measure the immunity level in the general population and health care workers, find out monthly changing trend of immune response for 12 months, compare immunity level in vaccinated non-diseased, vaccinated and diseased, non-vaccinated without disease and non-vaccinated with disease persons in the general population and compare immunity level. Bhandari said the study will help in the prediction of the risk of further outbreaks/COVID wave and the need for a booster dose of vaccines. After three-month, Rajasthan reported a death due to Covid-19 in Jaipur district on Thursday. The state reported 18 cases, taking the tally of active cases to 95. As many as 12 cases were found in Jaipur, followed by 4 in Ajmer and one each in Baran and Pali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/centre-should-decide-soon-on-need-of-booster-dose-gehlot-101637388083819.html

20-11-2021||Bhopal||MP govt plans to impose surcharge on liquor, others services to fund cow welfare||The Madhya Pradesh government is planning to impose a surcharge on products such as liquor and services provided by local bodies to generate ₹100 crore to meet the expenses of running cow shelters in the state, a senior finance department official said on Friday, after meeting of Gau Samvardhan Board with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan a day before.The official said a decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of Gau Samvardhan Board Thursday in Bhopal after the efforts to get donations evoked lukewarm response from people and the revenue for cow protection from Mandi Board had declined due to the implementation of new farm laws in 2020.Although Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced that the three farm laws would be repealed, the state government officials provided no clarity on whether the sale and purchase of agricultural produce in designated markets would resume.“The (Gau Samvardhan) board needs ₹160 crores to feed 2.6 lakh cows living in 1,300 cow shelters. But, the budget provided is ₹60 crore. So, every day per cow expenditure needed is ₹20 as against provided ₹6 per day. In the meeting, which was chaired by Chouhan, the discussion was held on generating funds only,” said a senior officer of the animal husbandry department, who did not wish to be named. According to JN Kansotiya, additional chief secretary, Animal Husbandry department, the CM directed officers to impose some welfare surcharge on products and services to generate income for cow welfare and protection scheme to resolve the issue of financial crises. He added that the finance and commercial tax department have been asked to prepare a proposal.A senior officer of the finance department, not willing to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media, said, “We can’t impose any additional tax on the products and services which are already covered under GST. We are left with two options - imposing a surcharge on alcohol used for human consumption and petroleum product. As the prices of fuel are already high, we are focusing on imposing a tax on liquor, electricity and services provided by the municipal bodies.” The plan will be finalised soon and it will be approved by Gau (cow) cabinet which was formed last year for deciding for welfare and protection of cows, the officer said. State finance minister Jagdish Devda said, “The state government is planning to impose an additional duty for welfare and protection of cows. But at the same time, we don’t want to put an extra burden on common people so the decision will be finalized by the cabinet soon.” Earlier, then chief minister Kamal Nath had also proposed to impose cow cess in October 2019 but after he resigned in March 2020, the proposal took a back seat. The opposition Congress attacked the state government for spending money on events and putting an extra burden on the people by imposing a tax to run welfare activities. “BJP-led state government is spending crore of rupees to organise events like they recently did on Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas but they have no money to feed cows. The state government wants to run all the welfare schemes by imposing the tax on common people. Even the money collected from the tax will be spent on organising events of cow protection not on cow welfare,” said JP Dhanopia, spokesperson, MP Congress committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-govt-plans-to-impose-surcharge-on-liquor-others-services-to-fund-cow-welfare-101637385083917.html

The incident came hours ahead of Bharat Bandh called by the outlawed CPI (Maoists) on November 20 to protest the arrest of their top ideologue Prashant Bose and his wife and central committee member Sheela Marandi by Jharkhand Police last week. “Rail tracks on both up and down line have been damaged in the alleged bomb blast at around 12.40 am. The matter is being investigated.

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Despite PM Modi’s assurance, farmers refuse to call off protest at Ladowal Toll Plaza||Despite the Prime Minister announcing the revocation of the three farm laws, almost a year after their passage triggered widespread farmers’ protests, the farmers protesting at the Ladowal Toll Plaza have refused to vacate the spot.While the farmers’ protests were primarily concentrated on the Singhu border, the protest at the Ladowal Toll Plaza, also came to gain significance as farmers blocked the Panipat-Jalandhar Toll demanding revocation of the controversial farm laws that were enacted on September 17.Farmers, who have been living in temporary huts at the Ladowal Toll Plaza for almost a year, say they would end their protest after all the contentious farm laws, including the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmer’s (Empowerment And Protection) Agreement Of Price Assurance And Farm Service Bill, 2020, and The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, are officially withdrawn in the winter session of the Parliament.‘Pained that we had to lose 700 farmers’“This is the best gift we could have expected on Gurpurab, but we are also pained as over 700 farmers were martyred in our battle against the arrogant Central government. For now, we will continue to hold fort here till the laws are officially withdrawn,” said Boota Singh Shadipur of the Kirti Kisan Union. Pardeep Singh of the Bharatiya Kisan Union said the protest will continue until the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is an umbrella body of farmer unions, calls off the protest. “Many farmers have been protesting against the controversial farmers’ laws for a year. A few lost their family members, but that did not deter their spirit. The government could have taken the step earlier when our leaders invited them for talks. Meanwhile, we lost hundreds of farmers. Now, we want everything in writing before we end our protest here”, said Pardeep.Commuters congratulate farmers Commuters, including truck drivers, police men and passersby, stopped at the Ladowal protest site to hug and congratulate the farmers for their landmark victory.“We are not distributing sweets yet but we will do that once the laws are slashed in the parliament. We are happy that the Guru has blessed the Prime Minister with better sense and humanity”, said Surender Kumar, a farmer at the Ladowal toll site.Ram Kumar, a truck driver said that many people including beggars would eat food at the Ladowal site. All sections cheer The urban population, which has also been supporting the farmers’ agitation, were also seen cheering for the farmers. Restauranteur Sukhkaran Gill, who is member of a biker group that has been holding rallies in support of farmers, said though it is a politically motivated move, it is a victory for farmers. “We have been supporting the agitation as implementation of these laws would have impacted the urban population too. Corporate houses would have taken over the markets and there would have been no place for small traders and businessmen.” A transporter, Jagdish Singh said that the economy of the state depends on the farming sector and it was necessary to support the farmers in their fight against the Union government. “The government should repeal the farm laws at the earliest so that the farmers, who have been protesting for over a year can return to their houses safely. Over 700 farmers have already died during the agitation and the Union government is responsible for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-pm-modi-s-assurance-farmers-refuse-to-call-off-protest-at-ladowal-toll-plaza-101637361192841.html

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Farm laws repealed: Ludhiana industry anticipates boost in business, investment||Ludhiana: Not just farmers, even the local industry, which suffered losses due to frequent disturbances, dip in sales and increased transport costs due to farmer agitations on the Delhi border, has reason to celebrating the repeal of the three contentious farm laws.With an end to the agitation finally in sight, industrialists are hoping that peace in the state will boost investment and business as investers and customers from outside the state will be able to visit the industrial hub without any fear.An industrialist, requesting anonymity, said, “Our transport costs had increased as drivers had to take detours due the farmers’ protest on the Delhi border. Frequent ‘bandhs’, and ‘rail roko’ agitations were also a setback for businesses that were already suffering due to the pandemic.”All Industries And Trade Forum president Badish Jindal said, “This will also improve the relationship between the state and Union government, which is good for the economy. International and domestic buyers will now be able to reach the state without fearing disturbances. Demand in the local markets will also increase, as farmers had curtailed the purchase of non-essential items amid the ongoing agitation.”Knitwear And Textile Club president Vinod Thapar said, “At least 50% of our business comes from traders in New Delhi and thus, our business was severely hit as the cost of transportation and raw materials increased.”Urging farmers to call off the protest, United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) president DS Chawla said, “A few persons with vested interests are now provoking farmers to wait till the laws are repealed. The PM has assured that the laws will be repealed, and the farmers should accept his word and end the agitation.”Even traders were relieved, Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal president Arvinder Makkar said, “The farmers had postponed the weddings of their children and have also stopped purchasing non-essential products. This had a major impact on the market. Now, hopefully, things will go back to normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-laws-repealed-ludhiana-industry-anticipates-boost-in-business-investment-101637360532808.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Farm laws repealed | A silver lining appears for out-of-work toll plaza staff||For the toll plaza workers of Punjab and Haryana, who had been rendered jobless after the agitating farmers laid siege to their work stations, a silver lining is finally in sight, now that the Prime Minister has agreed to annul the contentious farm laws. The enactment of the three farm laws had led to widespread protests, with the agitating farmers capturing toll booths in the region . Out-of-work staffers are hopeful that once the farmers call off their protracted protest, they will be reinstated. Shekhar, who has worked at the Ladowal toll plaza, says over 100 staffers worked at the toll plaza in three shifts – 8am to 4pm, 4pm to midnight and midnight to 8 am – before the farmers captured the booth. “Now, around four to five people of the cleaning and security departments work at the plaza. Many people were not given salaries as the company managing the toll for the National Highway Authority of India did not earn anything,” he said, adding, that their manager had also been fired. “Though workers were paid only ₹10,000- ₹12,000, but at least they were making a living. As the farmers will call of their protest in all likelihood, toll plaza operations will get back on track and the staff will be reinstated. The project manager of the private company managing security at the Ladowal toll plaza , Krishna, said that no notification had been received so far regarding the resumption of normal operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-laws-repealed-a-silver-lining-appears-for-out-of-work-toll-plaza-staff-101637360232842.html

Last time, he went to Delhi on January 23 to attend the Republic Day tractor parade along with his nephews but died on January 26 due to cardiac arrest. Bhupinder is survived by his wife and three children. His son Hardeep Singh, who got a job of peon in the state agriculture department, said that his father was even encouraged the fellow villagers to participate in the protests. Hardeep said his elder sister Amanjot couldn’t handle the shock of their father’s death and went into depression. “She suffered brain haemorrhage attack and died on March 26. We have got compensation from the government but we are facing problems over electricity bills. It is a great news that the Centre has announced to repeal the 3 laws and the “sacrifice” of his father and sister did not go in vain,” he added. ‘For my father, protest was a fight for survival’Baldev Singh, a 63-year-old farm labourer from Dadwindi village in Kapurthala district, had been visiting the Singhu border along with his fellow villagers since November 26 last year.

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ensure punishment to those involved in killing of civilians in Hyderpora: PAGD to President Kovind||The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) has appealed to President Ram Nath Kovind to ensure that the rule of law prevails in Jammu and Kashmir and those “erring officials” involved in the killing of civilians in the Hyderpora encounter are brought to book and punished. In a letter to the President that was issued to the media on Friday, PAGD president Farooq Abdullah said the tragic incident in Hyderpora has evoked enormous public anger. “In this unfortunate incident three civilians got killed in suspicious circumstances. The incident calls for a time-bound judicial probe so that true facts are unravelled and brought in public domain,” he said. PAGD is the alliance of six mainstream political parties in Jammu an Kashmir, including the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Abdullah, who heads the National Conference, said such unfortunate incidents widen the gulf between the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the Government of India and, therefore, are to be avoided at any cost. “We would remind Your Excellency that the administration of Jammu and Kashmir is being run in the name of Your Excellency by the Lt. Governor acting as an agent and, therefore an onerous responsibility is placed on Your Excellency to ensure that the rule of law prevails and the involved erring officials are brought to book and punished under law,” he said. He also raised the issue of the practice of taking away bodies of the victims of such incidents and depriving their families of the right to organise their burial in accordance with religious practices. “In the unfortunate incident of Hyderpora also, the bodies of three civilians have been taken away by the security forces and reportedly buried 100 km away from their residences. Your Excellency, the right to decent burial is well recognised in the Constitution of India as well as in the international humanitarian law. “The dead bodies cannot be denied the right to burial under any circumstances including the so-called law and order problem. The bereaved families likewise also have a right to organise burial of the dead body in accordance with their religious practices,” he wrote in the letter dated November 18. The PAGD alleged that in the past few years such rights have been “violated with impunity”. “In the present case these rights are being denied. We would request Your Excellency to intervene in the matter and ensure that the dead bodies are returned to their families so that they can perform their last rites in accordance with their respective religious practices,” it said. The matter is of grave concern and calls for an urgent action, Abdullah added. The bodies of the two civilians -- Altaf Bhat and Mudasir Gul -- killed during Monday’s encounter in Hyderpora area of the city were exhumed at Handwara late on Thursday and were handed over to the families. The bodies were buried here during the night after their last rites were performed by the families.

His death further deteriorated the condition of the grieving family which is already reeling under debt. The elderly man, who had already spent 20-25 days at the protest site in July this year, went there again in mid-September for 15 days. On the day he was to return, when he went to the langar to take food he suffered a massive heart attack and died.His son Amarjit Singh, 37, said, “We are not able to repay the loan and our land is mortgaged. I am forced to do labour work in a company at Indore and my elder brother runs an auto-rickshaw. Our family is struggling to earn the bread.”‘My father spent nights on road to fight for farmers’ rights’ Kabal Singh (55) of Lashkari Nangal village falling in Amritsar district’s Ajnala sub-division was returning home on a bike from a sit-in being staged by the farmers outside the residence of senior BJP leader Shwait Malik along with his friend Hira Singh on October 8. The two met with an accident and Kabal, a retired armyman, died on the spot due to his injuries. Hira, who was seriously injured, is still fighting for his life. “After protecting the country’s borders for years, he was forced to spend days and nights on the road to fight for the rights of farmers for several months. Sadly, he is not around to see the victory of the stir,” said Kabal’s elder son Jagmeet Singh.All of Kabal’s four children, including two sons, are married. “Both the sons are struggling to feed their families.

20-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The Old Delhi man from Rohini||Birds withdraw from their tree in the morning, and fly back to that same shelter by night. This bird leaves its tree in the sundown instead, and returns with the new sun. The bird in question is an extraordinary man. Nem Singh is 70. Long retired from a career in the “press,” he lives in distant Rohini but commutes daily to Kucha Lalman in Old Delhi. Here he comes with no other aim but to spend his entire day lounging quietly under a peepal tree. This is the street’s only tree—a peepal so tall, gigantic and dense that it reflects the kucha’s personality through its singular presence.It is 2pm and Mr Singh, as always, is perched on the marble platform that circles the tree’s wide trunk. The stately bark is wrinkled into numerous folds, making the tree appear so venerable that the first instinct on seeing it is to bow the head in reverence. Indeed, idols of various gods have been carefully placed within the trunk’s natural niches. “This peepal must be a 1,000 years old,” mutters Mr Singh. With his long white hair, he too looks as reverential.A native of Old Delhi where he passed most of his life, Mr Singh moved to Rohini some years ago with his eldest son “after we sold off our ancestral house in (nearby) Katra Budhan Rai.” A Delhi Jal Board employee, the son is privileged with a government-allotted residential flat “where I’m looked after very well.” However, Mr Singh is pulled daily into the arms of his beloved “Purani Dilli.” He feels truly at home only in this street, under this tree. “Our old house is no more but this ilaka (area) is my true address.”The tree stands at an intersection of four by-lanes, and some local or the other is always striding past it purposefully on way to their destination. Everyone of these passers-by seems to be acquainted with Mr Singh, including the area’s “electric metre reader.” Many pause to exchange “haal chaal” with him. “All the kucha wale treat me with respect—Hindus and Muslims, ladies and gents.” While attended to with love and care by his son’s family, Mr Singh says he prefers the daytime ambiance of Old Delhi because “here people are always out on the streets, you can see life is continually going on, you are always hearing the sounds of fellow humans… in Rohini, everyone stays inside their flat.”Mr Singh arrives every morning at 9 by bus. A nearby tea-stall man keeps him supplied throughout the day with (free) chai. A resident who considers him “like a father-figure” sends afternoon meal without fail. “Although my bahu always packs lunch for me.” He leaves for Rohini by 7.Mr Singh now gets up for a brief stroll. Moments later, the street is resounding with the tap-tap-tapping of his metallic walking stick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-old-delhi-man-from-rohini-101637353584281.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Family of Bathinda farmer who died at Tikri border struggles to run the household||The family of Karamjit Singh Bhullar (48) of Mandi Kalan village near Maur town in Bathinda district, who died after falling sick while participating in the farmers’ agitation at the Tikri border near Delhi in April this year, finds it challenging to manage the household.“I never went to school and Karamjit ensured that all three children in our joint family studied well. Be it is farming or looking after other fronts, I was just assisting him. Now, I feel helpless without him in the fields,” said Karamjit’s younger brother Darshan Singh. The two brothers with a small landholding of 1.5 acres used to take another 5-acre land on lease to cultivate paddy and cotton in the kharif season and wheat as a rabi crop. The deceased’s son Kamalpreet Singh, 24, said his father was an activist of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) and contributed to the protests against the contentious farm laws. Bhullar passed away a week before his 49th birthday on Baisakhi day of April 13. “My father followed a call of the union and visited the Tikri border site of protest thrice. He passionately worked against the farm laws and we are happy today that these will now be repealed. During his last visit, he complained of acute diarrhea on April 2. He was rushed back home and died four days after he suffered a massive heart attack,” he said.The family received a compensation of ₹5 lakh with Kamalpreet, a graduate, getting assurance of job of a clerk in the agriculture department this month.The deceased had no debt on him. ‘A befitting tribute my brother, farmers’ Natha Singh, elder brother of Sukhpal Singh (30) of Bathinda’s Mandi Kalan village, who breathed his last on March 31 at home after falling seriously ill at the Tikri border during the farmer agitation in January this year, says that the announcement to repeal the central farm laws is a befitting tribute to his brother and farmers. “After losing our parents a few years ago, Sukhpal left for the Delhi border to protect the interests of the farming community. He was among other volunteers from Mandi Kalan frequenting Tikri several times,” said 43-year Natha to whom chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in September personally handed over a job letter of a peon in the agriculture department.Natha was given a compensation of ₹5 lakh by the state government.Natha’s cousin Major Singh recalls that Sukhpal was diagnosed with a fatal infection in the pancreas and the community extended financial support of ₹8 lakh for his treatment.“He was treated for over two months at PGIMER, Chandigarh. The youths took an initiative and collected money from villagers and leaders of the BKU’s Sidhupur and Dakaunda factions also ontributed. Though our family lost a member while battling at the dharna site, we got some sort of relief in an announcement to repeal the laws that were rejected by the entire rural community,” said Major, a school bus driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/family-of-bathinda-man-who-died-at-tikri-border-struggles-to-run-the-household-101637353453073.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Kashmir observes complete shutdown over Hyderpora civilian killings||Kashmir observed a complete shutdown on Friday against the killing of two civilians during an operation in Hyderpora earlier this week.Meanwhile, political leaders asked the government to return the bodies of another civilian from Jammu killed in the Hyderpora operation.On Friday, all shops and businesses establishments remained shut in the city and other rural townships, however, transport remained unaffected. The shutdown call was given by Hurriyat Conference against the killing of civilians.Due to the shutdown, there was less attendance in the government offices and elaborate security arrangements had been made across the Valley, especially in areas where the two civilian victims, Altaf Bhat and Dr Mudasir Gul, lived. Bodies of both the civilians were buried after exhumation on Thursday night.A senior police official said that no untoward incident took place during the burial. Additional troops were deployed in the city to meet any exigency, however, the day passed peacefully.Meanwhile, mainstream politicians and Hurriyat Conference demanded the return the body of another civilian Amir Ahmad Magray killed in the Hydepora.Former National Conference legislator and prominent Shia leader Ruhullah Mehdi raised questions on the Hyderpora operation. “Has Amir Magray’s body been returned to his family? And if not, why? Do the administration, and also we (the society), think he was a child of a lesser mortal? And what about the identity and details of the fourth one killed? Or was there a fourth one? Was there even a combatant among them?” tweeted Ruhullah Mehdi.Srinagar mayor Junaid Azim Mattu also sought return of the body of the third civilian killed at Hyderpora. “As a citizen of India, Amir Magray of Ramban enjoys the same rights (in life and in death) under Article 21 of the Constitution of India as Altaf Bhat and Mudasir Gul. Request @manojsinha_ Sahab that his mortal remains be handed over to his family for last rites,” Mattu said in a tweet.Hurriyat Conference in a statement said that body of a third person should be returned without any delay. “The authorities should desist from the criminal practice of ceasing bodies and denying their families the right to a proper burial. It is abhorrently inhuman,” Hurriyat Conference said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmir-observes-complete-shutdown-over-hyderpora-civilian-killings-101637353152085.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||DS Patwalia appointed new Punjab advocate general||The Punjab government on Friday appointed senior advocate Deepinder Singh Patwalia as new advocate general (AG) in place of APS Deol who had resigned on November 1 in the wake of demand for his ouster by state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. A service matters lawyer, 47-year-old Patwalia is the son of former Supreme Court judge Kuldeep Singh. An alumnus of Panjab University, he was designated as a senior advocate by the Punjab and Haryana high court in 2014. Patwalia’s name was considered first after Charanjit Singh Channi took over as chief minister on September 20. But, the choice fell on Deol, who soon ran into controversy for being the defence counsel of former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and some other accused in the 2015 sacrilege violence cases. Sidhu had been gunning for Deol. Patwalia, who took over the office late on Friday evening, has multiple challenges before him. The Channi government is running against time ahead of polls and is pressing for some kind of breakthrough in drugs cases and 2015 sacrilege violence cases. In the past, the Sidhu-led group had been critical of Amarinder Singh government of tardy probes on both these issues. The high court is yet to decide on opening of sealed cover reports in Punjab’s drugs cases. As of probe in 2015 sacrilege violence cases, it has also made little progress as the appointment of special public prosecutor Rajwinder Singh Bains has run into controversy and there is a stay on probe against Saini in any FIR till February from the high court. Saini’s role in building up the case in sacrilege violence cases is considered crucial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ds-patwalia-appointed-new-punjab-advocate-general-101637352912109.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Agri laws: Repeal ripples will go far beyond the farm in Punjab||The repeal of three contentious farm laws by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Gurpurb (the 552nd birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev) is imbued with huge symbolism for Punjab which was the epicentre of farmers’ protests for more than a year. The surprise announcement — a week before one of the most dogged stirs against agriculture reforms in the nation’s recent history was to enter its second year with a renewed intensity — is sure to impact the political dynamics in the poll-bound border state where the assembly election is slated for early next year. Here is how:Reprieve for BJPA closure on the agitation, sustained by a groundswell of sentiment and support in the countryside, comes as a major breather for the saffron party which was facing farmers’ ire on the ground in Punjab. The farm laws not only led to the rupture of its 24-year-old poll alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal which walked out of the National Democratic Alliance government last year, but also made it the prime target of the agitators’ wrath in rural Punjab. Now, the BJP is expected to leverage Modi’s well-timed gesture which came two days after the Centre reopening the Kartarpur corridor to Pakistan for Sikh pilgrims to regain the ground it lost in the Sikh constituency. But, a shrill politics over the agitation’s human toll of over 700 deaths will cast a shadow on the party’s outreach in the first election that it will be contesting in Punjab without its pre-poll ally Shiromani Akali Dal since 1996. BJP’s stakes are limited to urban areas but Modi’s course correction will help it test the waters in the countryside.Congress ups the credit warThe ruling Congress in Punjab which has consistently opposed the farm laws and passed assembly resolutions rejecting the central legislation twice has been quick to credit the ‘anndata’ (farmers) for “forcing” the Modi government to relent. Taking a political high ground on the Centre’s climbdown sits well with the party’s electoral objectives: to live down anti-incumbency sentiment and garner a slice in the rural vote pie. Not surprisingly, the Channi government, having already announced a string of concessions to farmers and other sections of voters, will now make the roll-back a key plank of its poll pitch in the assembly sweepstakes. Of course, Aam Aadmi Party and Akalis will be competing with the Congress to milk the issue for all its worth.New political equations on the cardsThe repeal of the laws has opened possibilities of new political alignments and alliances in Punjab. It is a major relief for the Shiromani Akali Dal which was smarting under the double whammy of the break-up of its alliance with the BJP and a backlash from its core constituency among peasantry for having initially supported the Modi government’s ordinances on farm reforms before the Parliament stamped them as the laws. Desperate to be in poll reckoning, the Akalis had forged an alliance with the BSP leaving 20 of 117 assembly seats to the junior partner. But, the elevation of Charanjit Singh Channi as Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister negated SAD’s caste card through BSP. The Akalis can now hope to recover some of the political ground they lost in their traditional bastion of Sikh peasantry. But, the key question in Punjab now is: will the SAD and the BJP warm up to each other and again forge an alliance that once welded the Sikh and Hindu constituencies in an electorally formidable way? Not before the polls, say Punjab observers. Their reasons: one, the bitter overhang of agitation vis-à-vis BJP will not dissipate in the run-up to elections; two, Akali bete noire Capt Amarinder Singh has already cosied up to the saffron party; and, third, SAD has already moved on, firmed its alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party and even announced seats. All this, however, doesn’t foreclose their post-election options in case of a hung assembly.Clears the way for Capt-BJP TangoThe repeal of farm laws opens up the window for a poll tie-up between breakaway Congress leader and former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh who has floated a new party, Punjab Lok Congress, and hinted at seat-sharing with the BJP in case there is a resolution of the farm issues. Though his party is yet to take off, former two-time CM is counting on his political heft to woo the disgruntled Congress leaders and make a common cause with the BJP to dent the party he was pushed out of unceremoniously. “I look forward to working closely with the BJP-led Centre for development of kisani,” Amarinder said in his post-repeal reaction, revealing his gambit.X-Factor of farm bodiesThe 32 bodies comprising the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, most of them rooted in Punjab, will be in a triumphant mode over the repeal of farm laws. But, will they take the electoral plunge to cash in on their victory? So far, they have ruled out contesting polls. But, some of the SKM constituents, particularly the Rajewal faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, are known to harbour political ambitions. All political parties will try and co-opt the farm unions who, buoyed by the success of their tenacious agitation, will be an X-factor at the Punjab hustings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/agri-laws-repeal-ripples-will-go-far-beyond-the-farm-in-punjab-101637352494199.html
20-11-2021||Noida||Farmers refuse to end protest in Noida despite repeated requests||The farmers protesting against the Noida authority refused to end their agitation on Friday, even as senior government officials assured them that their demands are being looked into. The farmers have been protesting for the last two and half months outside the Noida authority’s main administrative building located in Sector 6, seeking hiked compensation for their land acquired for the development, 1,000 square metres residential plot, and changes in building regulations in villages, among others. On Thursday night, Meerut division commissioner Surendra Singh and Noida authority chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari held a meeting with a 10-member farmers’ delegation in Sector 6 and requested them to end the agitation as their issues are being addressed. “We have sent the farmers’ demands to the state government which will take a decision as per the law,” said Maheshwari, CEO, Noida authority. However, the agitating farmers have refused to vacate the protest site.“They (authority officials) said the state government will look into our demands and take appropriate action. But we do not trust officials of the Noida authority because they keep changing their stands on our demands. We have decided that our agitation will end only after the authority accepts our demands and takes necessary action in a board meeting,” said Sukhbir Yadav, founder president of Bharatiya Kisan Parishad that is leading the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-refuse-to-end-protest-in-noida-despite-repeated-requests-101637352372075.html

20-11-2021||Noida||Farmers celebrate at UP Gate after PM’s announcement to repeal agri laws||Farmers camping at the UP Gate since last November celebrated with sweets and termed their year-long agitation against the three controversial farm laws a ‘victory’ after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced that the Union government has decided to repeal the laws passed by the Parliament in 2020. However, they reiterated that their protest will continue till the laws are not completely repealed. Farmers at the UP Gate have been occupying portions of the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageways on National Highway 9 for almost a year, and put up hundreds of tents at the protest site demanding roll back of the three farm laws and a law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for a range of crops. Hundreds of farmers at the UP Gate protest site, mostly from districts in western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Uttarakhand, have been preparing for a march to Delhi on November 29 ahead of the next Parliament session. Soon after the announcement on Friday, there was an exodus of farmers rushing to the protest site at UP Gate, said leaders of farm unions.Groups of young farmers also took rounds of the UP Gate in their tractors while waving the tricolour and chanting slogans of “Bharat mata ki Jai, kisan ekta zindabad.” Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of all farm unions, issued a statement soon after the PM’s address. “Samyukta Kisan Morcha welcomes this decision and will wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures. If this happens, it will be a historic victory of the one-year long farmers’ struggle in India. However, nearly 700 farmers have been martyred in this struggle. The central government’s obstinacy is responsible for these avoidable deaths,” said the statement. “SKM also reminds the Prime Minister that the agitation of farmers is not just for the repeal of the three black laws, but also for a statutory guarantee of remunerative prices for all agricultural produce and for all farmers,” it added. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and a spokesperson of SKM, rushed to the UP Gate on Friday. “It is indeed a victory for the farmers, and about 700 of them who gave their lives to the cause of this agitation. The PM’s announcement has come on the day of Prakash Utsav (Guru Nanak’s birthday) and it is a welcome step. However, we will still wait and watch till the laws finally get repealed. Moreover, a law on minimum support price (MSP) should be passed. The SKM will decide the future course of action in the coming days but for now, the protest will continue.” “The government is feeling the heat of the sustained agitation by the farmers.The decision has come ahead of the assembly elections scheduled to be held in several states next year. There should also be discussions on withdrawing the FIRs registered against farmers and the benefits that will be extended to the families of those who lost their lives during the agitation,” said Bajwa.The decision to repeal the three farm laws comes months before several states--Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand where there is an opposition to the farm laws--hold the assembly elections due next year. Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), and one of the principal leaders of the protesting farmers, said the agitation will not be called off anytime soon. “We will wait for the day when the farm laws are rolled back in the Parliament. The government should talk to farmers on the issues of MSP...” he tweeted. There have been multiple rounds of talks between the government and the farm unions, but none since January 22 this year, after which both sides have taken a strong stand on the question of repealing the farm laws. Sardar V M Singh, a prominent farmer leader who heads the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, which moved out of UP Gate in January after a tractor march to Delhi turned violent on the occasion of Republic Day , said there had to be some guarantee on MSP. “This agitation, however long it lasts, should result to something that benefits farmers. An ordinance (what ordinance) came in June 2020 and crops, such as wheat, dhan, makka, etc., were then going at a rate of 30-40% below the MSP. The government should give some guarantee on MSP. If the guarantee would have been given, there would have been no need for the three farm laws,” said Singh. In his address to the nation on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the MSP will be made more robust and transparent, and a committee will be constituted to take decisions on the matter. Some farmer leaders at the UP Gate protest site viewed the development as a “political compulsion”. “The decision has come ahead of the assembly elections in UP. It shows that the government is feeling the heat of the farmers’ sustained agitation for almost a year. The decision of the PM is welcome but we will wait to see it turn into a reality,” said Prabal Pratap Singh, spokesperson for BKU (Asli). However, Chandra Mohan, spokesperson and state secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Uttar Pradesh, refuted the claims of the PM’s announcement coming in the wake of the assembly elections “The statements have come from none other than the Prime Minister. The condition of the opposition in Uttar Pradesh is evident to all. The BJP is committed to farmers’ welfare and the statements coming from the PM shows that farmers’ welfare is his top priority,” said Mohan. Gathering to swell at UP-Gate border Many farmers rushed to the UP Gate protest site to celebrate their ‘victory’ in the ongoing agitation after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the repeal of the three farm laws on Friday morning. Officials of the Ghaziabad police said the gathering at the UP Gate will swell further and that they are keeping an eye over the development. “Many farmers, who went home, have started thronging the protest site at UP Gate to be with the protestors. It is expected that the gathering will swell further and we are keeping an eye over the development. We are in regular touch with farmer leaders; our personnel will continue to man the protest site,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). Police estimate currently, there are 400 to 500 farmers camping at the UP Gate protest site. Farmer leader Bajwa said more farmers will join. “It is a victory for farmers. They want to be with the protesting farmers as a mark of celebration. More farmers will arrive here,” he added. Commuters want route be opened nowMeanwhile, daily commuters are upbeat about the development but are apprehensive as to when normal movement of vehicles will resume on National Highway 9. They also demanded that farmers should vacate the protest site after the PM himself announced a repeal of the farm laws. “When the PM himself has announced to roll back the farm laws, farmers too should cooperate and vacate the UP Gate protest site in the interest of daily commuters. It is almost a year that commuters are having to take alternate routes for their daily commute,” said Alok Kumar, a resident of Arihant Harmony, Indirapuram. The farmers’ protest at UP Gate has led thousands of daily commuters to take alternate routes to enter Delhi. A huge volume of traffic also passes through the Kaushambi Township near the Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border. “We see the development as a welcome sign, but we think that there is no immediate relief coming our way. Thousands of vehicles pass through the township every day. We will wait for the developments and hope the farmers’ issues get resolved soon, so that commuters don’t have to suffer,” said V K Mittal, president of the Kaushambi township Residents’ Welfare Association (Karwa). Recently in October, the Delhi police removed barricades from the UP-Gate but the farmers continued with their protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-celebrate-at-up-gate-after-pm-s-announcement-to-repeal-agri-laws-101637351772057.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||‘Will return after repeal process goes through in Parliament’||Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a repeal of the three contentious farm laws breaking a year-long impasse and asked protesting farmers to return to their homes, demonstrators at the three borders across Delhi exhibited mistrust against the promise and said they would not leave the protest spots unless the laws were repealed in the Parliament.Sukhbir Singh, 43, a farmer from Moga district of Punjab who has been on the Singhu border since November 26 last year, said the mistrust stems from the fact that the government had gone back on its promises several times.“Be it implementation of the Swaminathan report or other matters, the government is known to sway from one side to another. We welcome the announcement but this is only a half-victory. We will wait till the laws are repealed on paper and other demands of the farmers are met including removal of all fabricated cases against us,” he saidA similar sentiment was shared by farmers at Tikri and Ghazipur borders. Yubraj Singh, 62, a farmer from Moosa village in Mansa district said celebrations could wait. "We want to wait for this announcement to be acted upon. Along with the farm laws, there are other laws around electricity bills and stubble burning which have provisions such as a fine of ₹1 crore and a five-year jail term for stubble burning. We want to wait and see the government’s stand on these issues while they work on the repeal," Singh said.Gurpreet Singh, 25, a farmer from Harchowal village in Gurdaspur district in Punjab, said that despite the announcement of repeal, the move would not benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party electorally in Punjab in the Assembly election next year. Singh and his family had voted for the party in the last Lok Sabha election.“Sustaining the agitation took money and lives of our people. For instance, every ten days, our village had to spend ₹40,000 just for diesel to make one round trip to the protest spot. Nearly 700 farmers died during the movement. Though we won, it came at a heavy cost. No one from our village will vote for BJP in the upcoming elections as their arrogance forced us to protest and pushed our state’s economy back by several years,” he said.His friend Naib Singh, a member of Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan in Gurdaspur, however, said the government was not eyeing Punjab Assembly elections. “The decision has nothing to do with elections in Punjab or the protesting farmers because the government knew that they will not garner votes in Punjab. That was never an option. But through us, they want to win the upcoming Uttar Pradesh election that is crucial for this regime."Several protesters said that the events of the past year also fuelled the anger and mistrust against the Centre and BJP. “It takes a toll to travel back and forth every two weeks for one whole year,” said Gurdeep Singh, a computer engineer from Kurukshetra in Haryana who came to the protest site for three days in December last year but decided to stay throughout these months. “People have been demanding repeal of laws since September last year and protesters have been attacked and vilified in various ways across different states. We have been killed and mowed down. All those will not be forgotten,” he said.With the harvest season underway, many agitating farmers have returned home to either work on the field or celebrate Gur Purab – the festival marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev – with their families in their home states of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. While the protest sites had fewer than the usual number of protesters in the initial days, those present at Singhu, Ghazipur, and Tikri on Friday engaged in celebrations by distributing sweets and holding tractor rallies. They also held kirtan earlier in the day.The lack of crowds also sparked concerns among many over possible face-off with authorities or mischievous elements. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 40 farmer groups, also said that it is mobilizing farmers from several states to mark the first anniversary of farmer agitation on November 26.“We all know what this government is capable of. You saw what happened on January 26; how farmers were vilified and how the narrative was turned against us. We do not want history to repeat and will mobilise more supporters. More people will start coming in by evening (Friday),” said Prakash Singh, a farmer from Moradabad at Ghazipur.(With inputs from Soumya Pillai and Paras Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-return-after-repeal-process-goes-through-in-parliament-101637350922542.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Shukla gives clarion call to Himachal Congress workers for 2022 assembly elections||A fortnight after the party won bypolls to three assembly constituencies and Mandi parliamentary segment, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Himachal Pradesh affairs, Rajiv Shukla on Friday, gave a clarion call to the warring factions of Congress to sink their differences and work for the party’s victory in 2022 assembly elections. “All Congressmen needs to put their differences aside. Congress stood as a united force during the bypolls, it needs to do it further in the 2022 elections,” said Rajiv Shukla while addressing a meeting convened in party headquarters Rajiv Bhawan to commemorate former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s birth anniversary and launch of a membership drive.

Shukla also hit out at the government saying that the central government should have withdrawn the three ‘black” laws much earlier.” “We all should work together to live up to the dreams of beloved leader Virbhadra Singh,” he said. AICC secretary Sanjay Dutt gave credit to party workers and leaders for the victory in bypolls. “The Congress results have startled the BJP; we would continue this winning streak in the assembly elections too,” he said. The party leaders also honoured the three newly elected legislators Rohit Thakur, Sanjay Awasthi and Bhawani Singh Pathania. Party honoured Lok Sabha member Pratibha Singh. State party chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore exhorted the party workers to continue their diatribe against the BJP. He also lauded Congress legislator Rohit Thakur for forfeiting deposits of BJP candidates in Jubbal Kotkhai. Congress legislature party leader Mukesh Agnihotri also spoke on the occasion. He hit out at both the central government and state government over its policies.

Arrest of the officials is a step in this direction as action was taken immediately and further investigation is on,” he said, during his visit to Karnal.On arrest of the HPSC officials having raised questions over the government’s tall claims of fair recruitments, Khattar slammed the previous governments for not taking action against people involved in corruption. “The BJP government did not hesitate to send them behind the bars. There is no space for the corrupt and corruption in this government,” he said.The state vigilance bureau on Thursday had arrested the deputy secretary of the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) and two others for allegedly manipulating the marks of candidates who appeared in the written examination for recruitment of dental surgeons, conducted on September 26, 2021, and recovered ₹1.07 crore from the officer’s residence.‘Want to break old myths’Khattar on Friday said he intentionally wants to break the old myths of not visiting Kapal Mochan Mela or other places which might lead to electoral losses in future, which is a common belief in Haryana.“I’ve also heard that no sitting CM of Haryana or Punjab has visited the mela in the last 50 years. I cancelled two meetings to attend the mela and had come here earlier as well. There are also myths that no incumbent CM goes to Madhuban (in Karnal) and none has visited in the last 30 years. I’ve been there thrice, even during my last term. I’m here to break such myths. We should not follow such superstitions,” the CM said.Khattar was in Yamunanagar’s Bilaspur region to take part in the ongoing historical mela, a spiritual site of communal harmony that started on Monday. He visited many places of worship and took a holy dip in a sarovar. He praised the district administration for making good arrangements in a limited time and said nearly two lakh devotees visited the mela on Thursday.“In view of religious tourism, we will develop the region between Panchkula’s Kalka and Yamunanagar’s Kalesar under which we are enhancing infrastructure in Kapal Mochan,” Khattar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hpsc-officials-arrest-an-achievement-of-govt-to-eliminate-corruption-khattar-101637351111958.html

We are running about 220 centres and there the vaccines are available in abundance, which is nearly 30,000-35,000 per day. So, there is no shortage,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination.“Many of our staff have also been assigned duties of the block level officers for election work. Otherwise, we have made complete outreach to the residents with different measures including evening camps, door-to-door campaigns, and making telephonic calls. Many centres have been given a target of 150 doses daily, and those have witnessed a turnout of only 80-90 beneficiaries. So, we are reviewing the situation, considering the deadline which is set on November 30,” Dr Mathuria added.The daily turnout of beneficiaries has also come down after Diwali on November 4 this year.According to the CoWIN portal, the health department administered a daily average of 6,084 first doses per day between October 21 and November 3, and 5110 first doses per day between November 4 and November 18.“Vaccination is of utmost importance for protection against Covid-19. It has been a trend in the past that complications like tuberculosis or polio have reduced considerably only after vaccination... Door-to-door vaccination should now be started to vaccinate the remaining beneficiaries,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad chapter.“At present, there’s a lower rate of infection and a higher rate of sero-prevalence in the district, keeping the spread of infection at bay. In case of the predicted third wave outbreak, people who have not been vaccinated will be affected,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/low-turnout-of-first-dose-beneficiaries-may-hamper-vaccination-target-in-ghaziabad-101637350991842.html

The monument is dedicated to martyrs of “Saka Chamkaur Sahib” (the Battle of Chamkaur Sahib, fought with the Mughals in 1704) in which two elder sons of the tenth Guru along with 40 other Sikhs were martyred.Speaking on the occasion, Channi said the state-of-the-art theme park project would go a long way in apprising the people about the saga of “Kacchi Garhi”.The CM said the battle of Chamkaur Sahib is a watershed moment in the Indian history where just 42 brave warriors, including the elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh, fought valiantly against the coalition forces of the Mughals.Channi also complimented his predecessor Captain Amarinder Singh for initiating the prestigious project during his tenure.The CM and governor also visited 11 galleries at the theme park, which effectively showcase Sikh history and glorious past. Earlier, the CM and governor paid obeisance at Gurdwara Sri Qatalgarh Sahib and inaugurated a heritage street from the main road to shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chamkaur-sahib-cm-guv-open-dastan-e-shahadat-theme-park-101637350940255.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Repeal of farm laws: Much needed reprieve for Haryana govt||Repeal of the three farm laws has come as a political and administrative relief for the BJP-JJP coalition government in Haryana which has been fire-fighting the law and order fallout of an unrelenting farmer agitation for around a year.It all started on November 25 when farmers from Punjab assembled in Ambala with their ‘Dilli chalo’ call. The agitation soon gathered momentum in Haryana. The state’s proximity to New Delhi led to farmer unions pitching permanent tents on the Haryana-Delhi border at two locations, Singhu and Tikri, hindering the major arteries to the national capital.As the agitation gathered momentum, the emboldened farm union leaders started targeting the BJP-JJP coalition leaders through boycott calls and more seriously, by disrupting their functions and field visits.That led to multiple clashes between farmers and the police. With the Opposition parties, the Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) at the back of farmers, the farmers’ stir polarised the state polity.A string of confrontations in Ambala, Karnal and Jind spiked tensions, even as the Khattar government claimed to have exercised “utmost restraint” while dealing with the delicate law and order crisis.Adding to the BJP’s woes, it’s own senior leader and former Union minister Birender Singh came out in support of farmers and counselled the state government to resolve the deadlock. Farmers’ protest resonated in the recent bypoll in Ellenabad in which the BJP lost to INLD despite having improved its vote share. In fact, the farmers’ unrest seemed to overshadow a series of pro-peasantry initiatives of the state government.All that is set to change after the Prime Minister’s announcement on Friday, says Prof Rajender Sharma, of political science department at the Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, adding, “The political and economic activities will finally resume after a year of disruption.”Narendra Kumar Bishnoi, head of the business economics department at Hisar’s Guru Jambheshwar University, said the farmers’ economic condition has not improved in the last seven to eight years. “They are losing confidence in government policies. They do not trust the government’s three farm laws which were basically good for them. Instead of looking for foreign companies, the government should motivate local traders and farmers to start agro-based projects,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/repeal-of-farm-laws-much-needed-reprieve-for-haryana-govt-101637350939141.html

The National Green Tribunal (NGT), in a 2015 order, has banned petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years in the national capital region (NCR). In October 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the NGT order and directed that such vehicles be impounded.AK Pandey, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that there are approximately 775,000 registered vehicles in Gautam Budh Nagar. “We found that there are about 110,00 diesel and petrol vehicles that are over 10 and 15 years old. We conducted an enforcement drive and impounded 34 petrol vehicles and 48 diesel vehicles. We also issued fines of ₹10,000 each to about 276 violators for not being able to show us Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates,” he said. Pandey said that the transport department is issuing notices to the owners of these old vehicles to surrender their registration papers. “They should scrap the old vehicles and inform the transport department. We will deregister these vehicles from our records. If people are found driving such vehicles, action will be taken against them,” he said. Ganesh Prasad Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the traffic department is also conducting enforcement and awareness programmes to check pollution. “This month, we seized 233 diesel and petrol vehicles that are older than 10 and 15 years, respectively. We also deployed traffic police personnel at different fuel stations to compulsorily check vehicles’ PUC once people visit for fuel. The vehicles lacking PUC certificates are fined ₹10,000,” he said. The traffic police have deployed its personnel at the Noida-Delhi borders to stop the entry of heavy vehicles in Delhi till November 21 in accordance with Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)’s directions.The CAQM late night Tuesday directed that schools, colleges, and educational institutions in the National Capital Region will remain closed until further orders. It also said that only five of the 11 thermal power plants located within a 300km radius of Delhi will remain operational till November 30, construction and demolition activities are banned in Delhi-NCR till November 21, and banned trucks carrying non-essential items from entering Delhi till Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/transport-department-to-deregister-100-000-old-vehicles-to-check-pollution-101637350812743.html

The bullet, fired from outside, damaged the window of a room on the second floor and hit its roof. No one was injured in the incident, the hotel management said in the complaint. Rishikant Sharma, 35, hotel manager, said in the police complain, “We dialled 112 and informed police about the matter. We demand the police investigate the matter and take action,” he said. When contacted, Sharma said that he has filed a complaint and he has nothing else to add. Arun Malik, Sector 18 police checkpost in-charge, said that a police team reached the spot after receiving the information. “A guest was staying in the room when the incident took place. There was a sudden bang and the window’s glass smashed. The guest informed the hotel management. Initially, it was believed someone had thrown a stone or a piece of brick at the window. But investigation showed a bullet was fired,” he said. Malik said the police team scanned the footage of CCTV cameras in nearby areas but could not trace the suspect. “It appears someone opened fire randomly in an inebriated condition and fled the spot. We have registered a case against an unknown person under Section 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), Section 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and Section 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 20 police station.

20-11-2021||Noida||Despite reduced fire counts, air in Noida and Ghaziabad remains ‘very poor’||Even as the instances of stubble burning have reduced considerably over the past one week, the air quality in Ghaziabad and Noida remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Friday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) of Ghaziabad on Friday was 377 against 360 a day earlier. Similarly, the air quality in Noida and Greater Noida also worsened. While Noida recorded an AQI of 376 on Friday against 336 a day earlier, Greater Noida witnessed an AQI of 382 against 308 on Thursday, showed the CPCB data. The condition has been persisting despite the share of stubble burning in PM2.5 has reduced and ranged from 12% to 2% during the period from November 14 to 19. On November 7, three days after Diwali, the share of farm fires had gone up to 48%, according to the data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar). Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that different agencies in both Ghaziabad and Noida are regularly taking up pollution control measures. “However, the prevailing conditions are due to trapped pollutants which are not getting dispersed due to low wind speed. The situation is likely to persist till November 21. We are awaiting orders from the state officials regarding the directions given by the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region. However, our ground level enforcement has been strengthened with regular inspections, including night inspections, by our teams,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. Experts said that the government agencies have not done enough to deal with local pollution sources. “The prevailing conditions are due to local pollutants. The officials are still waiting orders from the UP government after the CAQM recently issued renewed directions to take up stringent measures like stoppage of construction activities, closure of schools, among others,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. Meanwhile, a forecast by Safar said on Friday that the AQI is expected to remain in ‘very poor’ category on Saturday even as the farm fire counts have reduced considerably. “Local surface winds are low with moderate ventilation of near surface pollutants. From 21st onwards, surface winds are likely to be strong resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality. Transport level winds are likely to be strong during November 21-23, flushing out locally emitted pollutants from Delhi to the south-east region that may improve air quality further to the lower end of ‘very poor’ or ‘poor’ in Delhi,” the forecast said. It added that the effective farm fire count is 1,077 and its contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 on Friday was negligible at 3%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/despite-reduced-fire-counts-air-in-noida-and-ghaziabad-remains-very-poor-101637350511770.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||Covid, now pollution: Shutting schools taking a toll on learning||With the Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM) announcing the closure of educational institutions for in-person classes until further notice in Delhi, uncertainty has once again clouded learning in schools, many of which reopened for physical classes only two weeks ago.Several principals said that there is a lot of uncertainty and despondency among students due to the abrupt closure of schools, and advocated a more nuanced approach in response to air pollution.Manika Sharma, director, The Shri Ram Schools in Delhi-NCR, said that classes should be allowed in schools that were equipped with adequate infrastructure for countering pollution.“Schools like ours that already have air purifiers installed should be exempted from closure. We are all already masked up (to protect against Covid-19). That takes care of pollution as well. Now, we are doing more harm by compelling children to stay at home. This is something that should be looked into by the government,” said Sharma.School administrators and educators pointed to the toll the continuing closure of schools takes on students -- not just in terms of learning outcomes, but also social and psychological development.Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said that it is crucial to come up with a workaround to tackle pollution so that children’s learning is not interrupted. Acharya said that the abrupt closure of schools has affected the mental health of children yearning to be back in classrooms.Schools in the Capital were closed for physical classes on account of Covid-19 last March and allowed to reopen in a limited way for students of higher grades early this year. They finally reopened for all classes on November 1 only to be shut again on November 13.“The blanket closure of schools is not the solution to the pollution problem. The government might not be able to provide exemptions to some schools due to logistical reasons but some sustainable solution that doesn’t disrupt learning is needed. Most people are going out and about. They are not locked up inside their houses due to pollution. Constant closure of schools both because of Covid and pollution gives the impression that they are the most unsafe places, which is not true,” said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka.She said that the unpredictability and uncertainty from school closure has adversely impacted the learning environment. And the suspension of in-person classes for the past two years had also led to behavioural issues among children, she added.Other schools that have taken measures to tackle pollution within the campus said that doctors and experts could suggest measures for schools to function amid the prevailing situation.Richa Sharma Agnihotri, principal, Sanskriti School, said that the school has taken multiple measures over the years to ensure that learning is not disrupted on account of pollution. The school had created the area outside the premises into a no-car zone for the past many years. All classrooms are equipped with air purifiers and purifying plants have been placed across the school campus.“There is a constant conversation around pollution and we encourage children and their parents to avoid cars and walk,” said Agnihotri.She said that while the suspension of in-person classes was disappointing, one could not take the concerns surrounding pollution lightly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-now-pollution-shutting-schools-taking-a-toll-on-learning-101637350073439.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Repeal of farm laws: Respite for embattled BJP, SAD in poll-bound Punjab||The repeal of the three contentious farm laws announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come as a much-needed respite for the embattled Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab that votes in three months even though the protesting farmers are still to call off their stir.The BJP and its former alliance partner, SAD, have been at the receiving end of the farmer unions’ ire in the state that is the hotbed of the agitation. Their leaders have been repeatedly targeted by the protesters, who halted their movement, disrupted meetings and even laid siege to houses of some of them, in the past one year.Besides easing tension in Punjab where the stir started in August 2020 before spreading to Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh, the PM’s big announcement appears set to change the electoral dynamics by creating a level-playing field ahead of the elections, according to political experts.Crucial issue slips out of Cong handThe SAD and the BJP are now hoping for normalcy to return to the state following the Centre’s move to renege on an important decision so that they can run their campaign smoothly, while the ruling Congress, seeing an important issue is slipping out of its hands, has amped up its rhetoric on statutory guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) and other demands of the protesting farmers.Guru Nanak Dev University’s former head of political science department Professor Jagrup Singh Sekhon said the BJP agreed to withdraw the laws primarily with an eye on the crucial UP elections, but its impact would also be felt in Punjab where the party is not a major political player on its own in a four-cornered contest. “Pressure will be off from both the BJP and SAD. The Akalis have strong pockets of support in rural areas, but face trust deficit, whereas the Congress remains sharply divided. The AAP is still to get in the groove,” he said, calling the upcoming elections anyone’s game.BJP’s tie-up with Capt possibleFor the BJP, the doors have opened for a “seat arrangement” with former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh who announced his separate outfit, Punjab Lok Congress, after quitting the Congress and the breakaway factions of the SAD. “I look forward to working closely with the BJP-led Centre for development of farmers and Punjab’s progress,” the two-time former chief minister said while welcoming the PM’s announcement to withdraw the controversial laws. Capt Amarinder had resigned from the CM’s post on September 18 amid a rift in the Punjab Congress.SAD hopes to recover groundAt the same time, the Centre’s decision is also a breather for the SAD, which had walked out of the NDA over the farm legislations, but has still been facing the heat for initially backing the laws. The Akalis also seem confident of regaining the support of the farming community, their core political constituency, and the rancor to peter out.Ashutosh Kumar, professor of political science, Panjab University, said the scrapping of farm laws is a setback for the Congress, which adopted a soft approach towards the protesting farmers and has been counting on their support. “The BJP can fight on urban seats in alliance with Capt Amarinder who has acceptability in the Hindu community. There is, however, no chance of revival of alliance with the SAD before the elections as the latter has tied up with the BSP. It is a fluid situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/repeal-of-farm-laws-respite-for-embattled-bjp-sad-in-poll-bound-punjab-101637350331884.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Repeal of farm laws: Much delayed, but a welcome step, says Channi||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday termed the Centre’s decision to repeal three farm laws as much delayed, but a welcome step. “Had Prime Minister Narendra Modi taken this decision much earlier, several precious lives would have been saved,” he said in a statement, accusing the Centre of thrusting the legislations “arbitrarily” on the farmers without taking them into confidence. Asking the Centre to make its stand crystal clear on the minimum support price and public procurement of farmers’ crops, Channi said the Central government should admit on record to have made a Himalayan blunder in bringing these bills for which it hardly bothered to even relent for the past one-and-a-half years. The CM also demanded adequate compensation for the farmers for the humungous losses of life and property suffered by them. “A financial package should be announced to help the farmers and labourers reeling under the huge burden of debt,” he added. He said that the state government should also be compensated for financial loss and damage to property during the farmers’ protest. Hitting out at the rivals, Channi said that the SAD and the BJP had been singing paeans for the central government for these laws but with what face they would go to people now. “There was a nexus between Akalis, BJP and even Captain Amarinder Singh who made all out efforts to weaken the farm movement but in the end it’s victory of good over evil,” he said, targeting his predecessor. Channi, who was sworn in as the chief minister two months ago, said his government had outrightly rejected the three farm laws, besides repealing the contentious Contract Farming Act 2013 enacted by the then Parkash Singh Badal led SAD-BJP alliance government in the recently concluded special session of the state assembly.Channi said the Centre announced the repeal of these laws when it was left with no other option. “They have just made the announcement but we will wait till these laws are repealed in Parliament. They (Centre) cannot be trusted till then,” he said at a press conference convened at a short notice before demanding statutory guarantee for the minimum support price. The CM said the central government needed to guarantee MSP by law to regain this trust and this should be done along with the repeal of the three laws. There was a conspiracy to weaken Punjab by wearing down its agriculture sector but the Centre has had to back off due to the strength of democracy, he alleged, congratulating the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha. Channi also exhorted the farmer unions to join the fight against the Centre’s notification that extended the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) from 15km to 50km inside the international borer. “It is a big battle. We all have to fight together to reduce this (BSF’s operational remit) to 5km,” he said, urging the protesting farmers and labourers to get ready for this. Channi also hit out at the AAP for notifying one of the three laws in Delhi ruled by the party, telling them to also withdraw it. “A memorial will be set up in the memory of farmers who lost their lives during the protest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/repeal-of-farm-laws-much-delayed-but-a-welcome-step-says-channi-101637350091810.html

Health department officials said that the girl died at a private hospital where she was taking treatment for high fever. Data released by the district administration on Friday evening confirmed that one person died of dengue. The city has reported around 300 cases of dengue till date. According to the girl’s medical summary, a few days ago, she was admitted to a private hospital for high fever, which turned out to be dengue haemorrhagic fever that led to multiple organ failure. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram said patients should report immediately to the hospital if they have any dengue symptoms. “Any delay in treatment leads to complications, which sometimes proves fatal. All measures are being taken to check the growth of mosquitoes but still people must take precautions,” he said. Yadav also said that residents of urban villages and densely populated areas should particularly take precautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10yearold-girl-succumbs-to-dengue-first-fatality-in-gurugram-101637349731681.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||Traverse Vasant Vihar on wheelchair to ascertain useability: Delhi HC||Freedom of movement is a constitutional guarantee and it should not be hemmed in by the lack of civic amenities, the Delhi high court has said.The court, while hearing a plea on the concreting of hundreds of trees in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, also ordered an official of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation to traverse the length of the colony’s footpaths on a wheelchair, without any help from anyone, to ascertain the useability of pavements.The court was hearing a plea by a resident who alleged inaction on the part of the authorities to preserve trees. The plea also cited non-compliance of earlier orders passed by the high court as well as the National Green Tribunal.“Citizens need to be empowered and facilitated in the enjoyment of their constitutional rights, for which provision of basic civic amenities is essential, like a safe and secure neighbourhood, and tree-lined avenues and footpaths, where an endeavour of a leisurely stroll is actually a pleasurable exercise and not an obstacle dodging, harrowing experience,” justice Najmi Waziri said in an order of November 15.The court said such a harrowing experience would discourage people from walking to neighbourhood shops, taking part in community bonding, holding cultural events, and spending their leisure time in parks.“Instead, people would use motor vehicles, adding to the city’s ever-burgeoning traffic congestion and unmitigated air pollution. So, it all starts with taking care of the neighbourhood trees and greenery and ensuring that the footpaths winding through the tree-shaded avenues are obstacle free,” the court further said.HT, on December 11, last year, reported how 80% of the trees in Vasant Vihar have been concretised. The story was based on a citizens-led tree census, which showed that of a total 4,993 trees on its streets, 3,859 were heavily concretised. The census also showed that over 450 trees had nails, tree guards, barbed wires etc. in or around them, 764 trees were lopped off, and at least 793 trees were infested with termites.To ensure the useability of footpaths, the judge directed the executive engineer/ assistant engineer/ junior engineer of the SDMC, to traverse the length of the colony’s footpaths on a wheelchair without any aid or assistance from anyone.“This will test the efficacy of the SDMC’s efforts to make streets and footpaths user friendly,” the court said.During the earlier hearing on November 9, the court had sought the response of the SDMC and the Delhi Police on the concreting of hundreds of trees in Vasant Vihar. In response, the civic body submitted numerous photographs to the court and informed the court that it had removed the concrete from around several trees.The court noted that efforts have been made by the municipal corporation since the last date to rectify the lack of care for trees, while also recording the civic body’s assurance that the work will continue in earnest.Additional standing counsel for Delhi Police submitted that all assistance will be given to the SDMC for carrying out the court’s directions and for removal of encroachments and/ or obstructions on footpaths and other public spaces.The judge then directed that remedial measures be initiated in earnest and all concreting, beyond the road and the walking paths, be removed, no matter how deep the concreting was.The matter will be next heard on November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/traverse-vasant-vihar-on-wheelchair-to-ascertain-useability-delhi-hc-to-sdmcofficial-101637349551812.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt reconstitutes Covid deaths panel||The Delhi government has re-constituted the six-member panel tasked with investigating deaths due to shortage of oxygen during the second wave of the Covid pandemic, and award compensation up to ₹5 lakh, pursuant to a Delhi high court order in September that overruled the objections raised by the Delhi lieutenant governor to the panel.The committee, which was initially constituted on May 27, never took off as the Delhi lieutenant governor did not approve it.But, the Delhi high court in September allowed the constitution of an expert committee to probe the deaths related to oxygen shortage, stating that its function will not overlap with another Supreme Court sub-committee that was tasked with understanding what led to the shortage of oxygen, and what could be done to prevent such a situation in future.The overlapping of the brief of the two committees was cited as one of the reasons by the LG office for not granting the approval.“… pursuant to the directions of the Hon’ble High Court … the committee comprising of the following officers constituted to assess on case to case basis, complaints and/ or representations received regarding death due to lack of oxygen, for grant of ex-gratia compensation over and above the no-fault ex-gratia of R 50,000 already ordered by the government,” read the November 15 order, issued by deputy secretary of health and family welfare S Sunil. HT has seen the order.According to the order, the committee comprises professor of medicine at Lok Nayak hospital, Dr Naresh Gupta; senior anaesthetists from the hospital, Dr Amit Kohli; senior anaesthetist from Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital, Dr Sanjeev Kumar; assistant director of planning at the directorate general of health services, Surendar Kumar; medical superintendent of Mata Chanan Devi hospital, Dr AC Shukla, and medical superintendent of Tirath Ram hospital, Dr JP Singh.Calls to three of six committee members went unanswered; and a fourth member, on asked not to be named, confirmed that the committee has been “revived” but hasn’t met yet.“Yes, the committee has been revived but we haven’t received any notice for meeting yet,” the member said.The committee members remain the same, however, two additional terms of reference were added as per the November 15 order. The new terms of reference mentions that committee will pass a “reasoned order” only after examining all documents and asking the hospitals for an explanation. The committee has also been asked to conduct only a “fact finding” exercise and not assign fault to any hospital or nursing home, the order states.On May 4, the Delhi government told the Delhi high court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at Jaipur Golden Hospital had happened because of oxygen shortage. Later, health minister Satyendar Jain said that it was a “preliminary report”.In June, the Delhi government proposed another expert committee to ascertain number of deaths caused by oxygen shortage in the Capital during the last wave of the pandemic but Baijal did not approve it.On July 20, the central government told the Parliament that states recorded no deaths caused by oxygen shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic. With that, the AAP government in Delhi, revived its demand for setting up its own expert committee on the matter.On August 16, Sisodia sent a file to Baijal’s office for the second time seeking approval for setting up the expert panel and sought Union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention in the matter. But, LG rejected the demand again.At its peak, Delhi recorded around 28,300 cases in a day and a positivity rate exceeding 36% on April 20 and 22 respectively. Around that time, at least 31 people are believed to have died because of oxygen shortage in two separate incidents in two separate hospitals – Jaipur Golden and Batra hospitals.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on August 25 said Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya has written to the Delhi government that it does not need to form a separate committee for probing oxygen related deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, citing a separate committee which is already working on it.“The central government’s fraud on deaths due to lack of oxygen has come out in the open. Union health minister is presenting false arguments to avoid investigation. He has written to us saying Delhi government does not need to set up a committee to probe deaths caused by shortage of oxygen because a high-level committee, constituted under the Supreme Court’s direction, is already working on the matter across states,” Sisodia then said in a video press briefing.Neither the task force set up by the Supreme Court, nor the sub-group formed in the states for oxygen audit is mandated to investigate the deaths due to lack of oxygen, the task force and the sub-group are mandated with configuring allocation of oxygen supply and medicines,” Sisodia added.On September 21, a Delhi high court bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said that it does not see any difficulty in the constitution of the committee, which, besides finding the reasons for the death, will recommend the compensation amount for the families of those deceased.“[The] Supreme Court [order] is on logistics and not specifics... We take it that there should be over overlap,” the bench said, clarifying that committee will not overlap with the areas already being looked into by the subcommittees constituted by the apex court.Medical superintendent Dr SCL Gupta, of Batra hospital, where 12 critical Covid-19 patients, including a senior doctor from the hospital, died on May 1 due to an 80-minute disruption in oxygen supply, on Friday said that the hospital has received no communication from the committee.Dr DK Baluja, medical superintendent of Jaipur Golden hospital, also said that the hospital received no communication from the committee. Twenty Covid-19 patients at the hospital died on April 23 after a drop in the oxygen pressure because of the shortage.A senior official from a tertiary care hospital in the city, asking not to be named, said there was no mechanism to report deaths due to oxygen shortage so far because the last time the committee was disbanded as soon as it was constituted.According to the order, the complaints will be received by the nursing home cell of the health department both online and offline. The committee will meet at least twice a week either physically or through video conferencing, and it will be empowered to seek documents from hospitals such as supply records and stock position. It will also check what were the steps taken by hospitals for maintaining sufficient oxygen stock, the order said.“The committee will draw up an objective criteria to award compensation, limited to a maximum of R 5 lakhs in each case,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-reconstitutes-covid-deaths-panel-101637349372991.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||Aftermath of farm laws’ repeal: Residents hope for a smoother commute soon||With one of the longest running movements in the post-Independence India being carried out right at their doorstep, local residents near the three key farm protests sites of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders have had their share of good and bad experiences. Several local residents helped sustain the protesters, who were hundreds of kilometres away from their homes, but several others were frustrated by traffic snarls, long detours, and the loss of business that the stir caused.At the Tikri border, Dinesh Sangwan, a local resident who runs a medical shop which directly overlooks the main protest stage, said it has been an unprecedented experience for the area’s residents. “Yes, there is resentment among people, but the majority still supported the farmers during the protest. I remember that there was an acute drinking water shortage after the first two days last year, and all bottled water was exhausted. The locals then provided drinking water, and also sent milk, buttermilk and vegetables,” Sangwan said. Rajesh Lohat, another resident of the area, said that the protest helped bridging the Haryana-Punjab divide. “There has been a complicated relation between our two states due to water-sharing, Chandigarh, and language issues. But the protest has helped bridge the differences to a large extent,” Lohat said.Across the eastern border of the city, Prem Singh, a resident of Ghaziabad who was at the Ghazipur border on Friday, said his family has been coming to the protest site for the last six months and helping the farmers with odd jobs such as chopping vegetables, providing drinking water, and cleaning tents. He said they wanted to show their solidarity with the farmers. “We all come here in the evening and peel potatoes or peas, or do any other small jobs around here to help the farmers. My son is in college, so once his classes are over for the day, he comes here and listens to the speeches. These people have braved a lot over the last year and it is not easy to live outdoors, facing the heat, the rain and the cold,” said Singh.For commuters between Delhi and Ghaziabad, the Friday’s announcement by the Prime Minister that the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws, came as a signal that their daily traffic woes may soon come to an end. Brijesh Goswami, who goes from Delhi from Indirapuram daily, said people had to spend an additional 40-50 minutes on the road to reach their destinations. “Either we take a 3km detour from Anand Vihar while moving from UP to Delhi, or go through a narrow road passing through Ghazipur poultry market and Khoda Colony. A checkpoint at Khoda adds 30 minutes to 1 hour during peak traffic hours,” Goswami said.Manoj Kumar Saini, 42, who runs a budget eatery -- Janta hotel near the Tikri Industrial area -- said he supports the farmers’ demands, but added that businesses along the highway have been devastated by the protests. “Unlike the Singhu and Ghazipur borders, the Tikri site has a large number of shops and industries. After the pandemic-induced lockdown, the protest has been a second major blow to the economy of the area. “I used to employ 13 workers last year, but now I have only four because factories have shut down and there are no customers,” Saini said. Rituraj Jha, a worker in the factories agreed with Saini. “Almost 40% factories and units have closed down operations due to lack of road access and labourers have migrated as there was no work,” Jha said, and added that Covid also led to closure of businesses. Sham Singh, who works at a store near the Singhu protest site, said the government’s decision was relief. “Our mall remain shut for more than 70 days before we reopened it in February. We suffered huge losses. Although farmers are buying clothes and shoes from us regularly, the income is still very low. I hope that the protesters soon vacate the site and we start getting normal business again,” he said. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella association of various farmers’ groups that was spearheading the agitation, welcomed the announcement by the Prime Minister, but said that the future course of action will be decided after the core committee meetings on Saturday and Sunday. For now, the farmers continue to stay put on Delhi’s borders.(With inputs from Soumya Pillai and Fareeha Iftikhar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aftermath-of-farm-laws-repeal-residents-hope-for-a-smoother-commute-soon-101637349371810.html
20-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Town planning dept slaps notice on 17 plot owners for violating norms||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Friday continued its drive against construction activities in private colonies and issued notices to 17 plot owners for continuing with their illegal construction activity or for not storing construction material properly. According to the directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Commission, construction activities have been banned in Gurugram and other adjoining districts due to high pollution levels. R S Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) said notices were issued to nine property owners in DLF Phase 1 and eight owners in Uppal South End and Vipul World after it was found that they were violating the CAQM directions. “A penalty of ₹30,000 has been slapped on each property owner for violations. We have also received complaints from other colonies and action would be taken against the owners,” he said. DTCP officials said that while developers of large projects have ceased construction, they are receiving complaints that individual plot owners are still going on with construction activity in some pockets of private colonies. “We are continuously monitoring the situation but can’t reach everywhere. We request people from across the city to inform us about any such violation. We will take prompt action,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner. The department also asked plot owners and contractors to ensure water is sprinkled on sand and other construction material and that they arecovered properly. The drive will be further intensified and the focus would on curbing activities causing pollution in the next few days, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-town-planning-dept-slaps-notice-on-17-plot-owners-for-violating-norms-101637349314579.html
20-11-2021||Gurugram||Namaz not offered at gurdwara in Gurugram||A group of Muslims visited the Sadar Gurdwara on Friday, and offered their greetings to the Sikhs who were celebrating Gurupurab even as no prayers were offered at any of the five gurdwaras offered to them by the Sikh community in view of the repeated disruptions by the Hindu right-wing groups. However, members of the Gurdwara Guru Singh Sabha -- which manages five gurdwaras in the city -- on Friday said that their offer was only in “case of an emergency”. The development came after several Sikhs said that they will protest if the committee members allow Muslims to offer namaz on the premises of a gurdwara in the city.Members of the Muslim community said they had a plan to offer namaz at 1pm at the gurudwara, but members of some right-wing groups reached there to disrupt the Friday prayers. “Hence, we made a collective decision to not offer namaz at the gurdwara,” said Altaf Ahmad, a member of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a citizens’ platform, and spokesperson for the Gurgaon Muslim Council. Sherdil Singh Sandhu, president, Gurdwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha, on Wednesday offered the gurdwara premises for namaz, but on Friday said that it was only in case of an emergency. Sandhu said his intention was not to offer space of a gurdwara to the Muslim community. “This is not possible in any way. How can we let our religious place get into any kind of controversy. Anyone can use ‘guru ka darbar’ in case of an emergency,” he said. Sandhu further said that even the Muslims will not like to use the premises for offering Friday prayers. “We will not take a decision that can land us in any controversy. I urge people to not believe any rumour that we have offered our space to the Muslim community. We will not let this happen anytime in future,” he said. Meanwhile, members of some right-wing groups on Friday reached the Gurdwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha at Kamla Nehru Park in the Sadar area around 12pm, and met the gurdwara committee members and spent nearly two hours inside the premises. Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, the legal advisor for Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, a right-wing outfit which has been protesting against offering of namaz in the open, said that they will not let the Muslims use their space for offering namaz. “We distributed 2,500 copies of a book titled ‘Guru Tegh Bahadur-Hind ki Chadar’ and paid tributes to Gur Nanak Dev. We asked the gurdwara committee members to not allow the Muslim community to use gurdwaras for Friday prayers. If the Muslims offer prayers in their houses or mosques, we have no objection,” he said. “After a discussion, the gurdwara sabha members have retracted their statement,” he said. Several police teams were also deployed at the Sadar gurdwara. A senior police official, seeking anonymity, said that the situation was under control at the gurdwara. Sardar Ravi Ranjan Singh, chairman of Jatka Committee, who released a video on Thursday night to criticise the decision of Sandhu, said that the gurdwara is only for Gurbani. “We held a meeting on Friday and criticised the decision taken without discussing it with other members. Gurdwaras are only for ‘Gurbani’. The president has assured us to reconsider his decision. No individual can take any decision without taking consent from others,” he said. Singh said there are many ways to promote peace and harmony, but ‘jagrarta’ in a mosque and namaz in a gurdwara is not logical. “We will discuss the issue with Sikh Sangat of Amritsar and Delhi and request for issuance of necessary direction,” he said. Daya Singh, president of All India Peace Mission and member of the Gurdwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha, said, “We had offered adjacent school space to the Muslims but they refused to offer namaz there. We did not want any issue on the occasion of Gurupurab,” he said. Raman Malik, spokesperson of Haryana unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said, “Those who are opening doors of gurdwaras for namaz are making a political statement, but those who responsible for maintenance of gurdrawa should remember that Sikh panth was started for protection of Sanatana Dharma from atrocities of Muslims,” he said. Representatives of the Muslim community said that they decided not to offer namaz at the gurdwara to “avoid anything untoward on the occasion of the birthday of Guru Nanak”. A delegation of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch met gurdwara committee members and handed over a letter to them, thanking them for their generous gesture of offering space to Muslims for namaz. “The manch salutes Sherdil Singh Sandhu for becoming the torchbearer of a movement that will inspire many people in Gurgaon to follow in his footsteps,” stated the letter. Henna Ahmad, who was part of the delegation, said that Muslims may not have offer namaz at a physical space of gurdwara, however, crores of Muslims in India have read namaz sitting in the hearts of the Sikh community. “Since Thursday, members of right-wing groups were using condemnable tactics to mount pressure on the gurdwara committee to stop Muslims from offering Friday namaz. Since today was a big festival of Sikh community -- Gurpurab, a huge rush of Sikh devotees was being expected and we did not want to jeopardize the security of anyone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/namaz-not-offered-at-gurdwara-in-gurugram-101637349312882.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh SSP issues orders to transfer 28 cops to district crime cell||After the announcement to form a new district crime cell in the city on Wednesday, the UT senior superintendent of police (SSP) issued orders to transfer 28 cops in total to the newly formed cell. Out of this, four cops, including an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and three constables, were assigned to be the reader staff of the DSP district crime cell and 24 cops, including one sub-inspector (SI), six ASIs, eight head constables, seven constables and two senior constables, have been deployed as staff for the district crime cell.The cell was formed after a one-member police reform commission, headed by former IPS officer KB Singh, in a report submitted on August 29, had recommended separation of investigation and law-and-order wings of the Chandigarh Police for better efficiency. The report stated that when the same personnel were assigned investigation and law-and-order duties, it had a cascading effect on the probe and leads to delays. The Chandigarh Police already have two investigation wings — the crime branch in Sector 11 and the operation cell in Sector 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-ssp-issues-orders-to-transfer-28-cops-to-district-crime-cell-101637349200739.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC chief for action against medical officer of health||The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) commissioner has written to the secretary, local government, UT administration, recommending action against medical officer of health (MOH) Dr Amrit Pal Singh for alleged “misconduct”.MC commissioner Anindita Mitra has submitted a draft chargesheet against the official after “delay” in servicing a tender for providing manpower (122 drivers) for 96 twin-bin garbage collection vehicles, said a senior UT official, who shared the letter with HT.The letter to the secretary states: “He (Dr Singh) has misconducted himself during his posting as medical officer of health in MC, Chandigarh. Accordingly, a draft chargesheet has been prepared against him... Since he is on deputation from Punjab, the chargesheet is required to be served by his present department being his appointment authority (sic).”After the UT secretary’s approval, the chargesheet will be forwarded to the secretary, health, Punjab. Thereafter, the department can chargesheet the MOH on the basis of the draft chargesheet prepared by the Chandigarh MC.It is learnt that Mitra took serious note of the proposal for constitution of a technical evaluation committee being put up on November 16 when technical bids were already opened on October 27.The MC commissioner further observed: “This is an extremely important tender as with these 122 drivers... 96 vehicles shall become operational for door-to-door garbage collection of unserviced areas. This is a problem of immediate concern as we are facing NGT cases as well as falling back on the Swachta Survekshan front…This is gross misconduct and misleading statements have been made and an important tender delayed (sic).”Mitra has reportedly also chargesheeted a superintendent and a senior assistant posted in the MOH branch in the same case, it is learnt. ‘I was fighting with medical issues’When contacted, Dr Singh said: “There was some delay in the tendering process, but now it has been completed well in time even though I was fighting with some medical issues. So now, we will request our superiors to withdraw the chargesheet.”Recently, Dr Singh was also grilled by the councillors in the MC General House meeting for delay in inviting fresh bids to award the sanitation contract in southern sectors. He was questioned on his file noting seeking the total road length in the city from the engineering department even after the final tender document was ready, which councillors alleged led to the delay in tendering process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-chief-for-action-against-medical-officer-of-health-101637349199589.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||UP man held for posing as RAW officer, duping Chandigarh woman of ₹11 lakh||The police have arrested a 42-year-old man from Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, for impersonating a RAW officer and duping a 20-year-old woman of ₹11 lakh. According to the police, Monika of Sector 38 (West), met the accused, Nilutpal Mishra, on Facebook in October 2019. Nilutpal told her he was a RAW officer and sent her pictures of their operations. On February 14, 2020, the accused told her he was going on a mission to Siachen and asked her for money, claiming he had lost his wallet. She gave him ₹35,000 and then on various pretexts he asked her for more money. She gave him ₹11 lakh in total. Later, he faked his own death sending pictures of his cremation through a friend and the friend who had been talking on his behalf told her not to contact him anymore. A cheating case was registered on November 3. The cyber cell froze ₹30 lakh in the account of the accused. The accused was arrested on Thursday from Mathura. He was presented in a court on Friday that sent him to one-day police remand. The accused told the police that he was working in Delhi and after his account was frozen, he fled to Mathura. The police said he had also duped other girls through various social media platforms in a similar manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/up-man-held-for-posing-as-raw-officer-duping-chandigarh-woman-of-11-lakh-101637349198571.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Farmers rejoice Centre’s U-turn on agri laws||Celebrations broke out at the Matka Chowk in Chandigarh on Friday morning after the Prime Minister announced that the three contentious farm laws will be repealed. Activists who had been sitting at the iconic roundabout since March 6, braving the second wave of Covid-19, monsoon and police intervention, were in a jubilant mood, as they danced to the dhol beats and raised slogans for farmers’ unity. Labh Singh, the septuagenarian Nihang who has become synonymous with the protest against farm laws at the Matka Chowk, was all smiles too, but said his sit-in will continue to press for other demands. “We will see whether the government follows through with what the PM has said. We will continue to protest till the government also listens to our demands on minimum support price (MSP) and pays compensation to those who lost their lives during the agitation,” he said.Many Panjab University student outfits had also been participating at the Matka Chowk protest and turned up there on Friday to celebrate. “The PM’s announcement is the first step. However, radical changes are needed and the government needs to do more for the benefit of farmers,” said Sandeep, president of Students For Society (SFS). As the announcement coincided with Guru Nanak’s Prakash Purab, protesters could be seen distributing sweets and wishing each other on the auspicious Sikh festival. In the evening, they lit candles and waved flags at the busy intersection. Cops were stationed nearby to ensure law and order.‘Historic, but just half victory’ While terming the PM’s announcement “historic” and “victory of farmers”, various agricultural organisations in Mohali also welcomed the move.Lakhwinder Singh, block president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), said the yearlong agitation of farmers has finally borne fruit. “The PM gave us a big present. However, the laws are yet to be repealed by the Parliament, and at present, this is just a half victory. About 700 farmers have been martyred in this struggle. Also, the government must roll back the electricity act and pollution act, besides bringing in a law to guarantee crop procurement on MSP.”Meanwhile, the organisation members continued to sit on a dharna at the Azizpur toll plaza and said it will be lifted only after a decision is taken by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha.Manpreet Singh Bunny Sandhu, vice-chairman, Punjab Agro Industries, and a senior Congress leader, said: “After tasting defeat in the recent bypolls, the BJP government has knelt before the farmers’ demands. This pro-people movement had garnered a lot of support from all over the world.”Even BJP workers celebrated the occasion. Led by the party’s state executive member Sanjeev Vashisht, some of them reached the farmers’ protest site at the Phase 3/5 light point in Mohali and distributed laddoos to those present there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhfarmers-rejoice-centre-s-u-turn-on-agri-laws-101637349197666.html

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Vehicles, vendors crowd streets in Ward 12||Stray dog menace, parking mess and poor maintenance of parks are top of the agenda for the voters in Chandigarh’s Ward No. 12 this municipal election.After the reorganisation, the ward comprises Sectors 15, 16, 17 and 24. Previously, these sectors came under three different wards. Sector 15 was under Ward 2 and represented by BJP’s Raja Bala Malik. Sectors 16 and 17 were with Ward 3, represented by mayor Ravi Kant Sharma. Sector 24 fell under Ward 4, which elected Sunita Dhawan of the BJP as the councillor.The ward is residential, commercial and institutional hub of the city. Sector 15 is known for a large number of paying guest accommodations and eateries; Sectors 16 and 24 predominantly have housing for government employees, bureaucrats and judges; and the Sector 17 is the commercial and institutional centre of the city.In Sector 15, the MC had allotted dedicated space to street vendors a couple of years back. Surender Sharma, a resident who plans to stand as an independent candidate in the MC election, says: “The situation in the ward has worsened in the last five years. The allotment of space to street vendors in the sector has created major problems for residents. But nobody is listening to our problems. We are tired of political parties not delivering.”In addition to the street vendors, Sector 15 residents complain about the mushrooming of paying guest accommodations, which particularly create parking problems.Parking woes, say residents in the ward, have increased in the last few years. Dr Madhurima Sharma, a resident of Sector 16 and an educationist, says: “The Sector 16 is managed very well. But the parking problem is getting worse every day particularly near the markets.”“Within the residential lanes, too, the problem has become so acute that during the night emergency, vehicles cannot pass through. We have sought authorities’ help, but so far nothing has happened,” says Anupam Mehta, a resident of Sector 16.Strays on the prowlEven stray dog menace is a problem across the ward. VK Jain, Sector 15 resident, says: “Senior citizens are afraid to venture out in the open as stray dogs are always on the prowl in the streets. The problem has become acuter now with the dogs moving in packs. Even though the MC repeatedly declares that it carrying out sterilisation drives, but we only see an increase in dog population.” In the neighbouring Sectors 16 and 24, too, residents complain of stray dog menace.Raj Bala Malik, BJP councillor representing Sector 15, says: “The stray dog menace is a pan-city problem. My opposition to settling street vendors in the area led to major reduction in the number of designated vends.”On the issue of poor park maintenance, Sunita Dhawan, BJP councillor representing Sector 24, says: “I got the RWA formed for proper management of parks.

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||34 more infected with dengue in Chandigarh tricity||Though the dengue cases have started ebbing in Mohali and Panchkula with a dip in temperature, Chandigarh is still reporting over 20 cases daily. A total of 34 fresh infections of dengue were reported in the tricity on Friday with Chandigarh reporting 22 cases followed by seven infections in Mohali and only five in Panchkula. The tricity’s fresh dengue count was 38 on Thursday. After a peak of dengue infections in October, the fresh cases are now ebbing daily with a dip in temperature as the climate conditions are not suitable for aedes mosquitoes to breed. However, no death was reported in any of the three jurisdictions on Friday.For this year, Mohali’s dengue count has now gone up to 3,732, with the death count being at 37. Chandigarh has recorded 1,336 cases so far, besides three fatalities. Panchkula’s case tally stands at 843, with one death so far this year.18 fresh Covid infections in tricityWhen dengue cases are dipping in the tricity, the daily Covid-19 infection tally is increasing. As many as 18 fresh infections were reported on Friday against six cases on Thursday.

20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC eyes 100% coverage with 96 more garbage vehicles||In another week, the Chandigarh municipal corporation will press into service 96 more twin-bin door-to-door garbage collection vehicles to achieve 100% coverage in the city, as mandated by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).“The additional vehicles will cover all markets in the city (around 200). Also, the vehicles will be used in areas that have fared poorly so far in garbage collection,” said MC commissioner Anindita Mitra. UT adviser Dharam Pal in a review meeting on the solid waste management targets set by the NGT had directed the MC to achieve 100% door-to-door garbage collection by November 30.Since the takeover of garbage collection, the MC has already deployed 489 twin-bin vehicles in the city. While around 400 vehicles were purchased at a cost of around ₹40 crore last year, 100 were earlier deployed in villages.The MC took over door-to-door garbage collection in December 2020, and has covered 85% of the city so far. There are 2.5 lakh households and commercial establishments that are to be covered. The takeover so far has bene marred with teething problems. There are issues related to MC vehicles not turning up on regular intervals and garbage not being picked from the doorsteps, particularly from upper floors. “As and when we receive a complaint, we immediately take action and ask the garbage collectors to follow rules laid out in the agreement signed with them. The MoU clearly stipulates that they would have to continue to carry on their duties as was earlier being done,” said Mitra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-eyes-100-coverage-with-96-more-garbage-vehicles-101637349192843.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Drugs case: HC grants default bail as Mohali police delay challan||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted default bail to a man held in a drugs case after the Mohali police failed to submit the chargesheet in stipulated time.The high court (HC) was dealing with a plea from one Gopi Jindal, who was arrested after the registration of a drug peddling case at the Dhakoli police station in Mohali’s Zirakpur on August 28 this year. On November 9, a Mohali court had dismissed his plea for default bail. Jindal had argued that the challan in the case has still not been presented. The forensic report obtained revealed that the total weight of drugs seized from him was 35.28 grams, whereas the NDPS Act considers seizure above 50 grams as commercial quantity. Therefore, it was not a case of commercial quantity and the challan in view of this had to be submitted within 60 days of the registration of FIR, the petitioner had stated.During the hearing, police had admitted that the quantity recovered from him was not commercial.The court, allowing bail, observed that for offence involving commercial quantity, the time limit for filing of the challan has been extended to 180 days. However, in the present case, the offence does not involve commercial quantity. Hence, the challan ought to have been presented within 60 days, and in case of non-presentation of challan, the petitioner is entitled to grant of default bail, which is a statutory right, the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drugs-case-hc-grants-default-bail-as-mohali-police-delay-challan-101637349191758.html
20-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram gets ‘very poor’ air for 5th day in a row||Pollution levels continued to be in the ‘very poor’ category with Gurugram recording an air quality index (AQI) of 323 as wind speed remained low on Friday. This is the fifth consecutive day that the air quality in the city is in the ‘very poor’ zone. With no rise in wind speed predicted till Sunday, experts said the air quality will remain bad as pollutants over Delhi and Gurugram are not getting dissipated. The air quality monitoring station at Teri Gram recorded an AQI of 333 while Gwal Pahari recorded 258. The AQI at Sector 51 station was 347 while the station at Vikas Sadan behind the mini-secretariat recorded an AQI of 357, which is the highest in the city. According to the IMD forecast, air quality over Delhi-NCR is likely to improve significantly from November 21, owing to relatively strong winds, and hover in the ‘poor’ category. “The air quality over Delhi-NCT is likely to improve and reach in lower end of ‘very poor’ category on Saturday and ‘poor’ category on Sunday,” the IMD predicted on Friday. Dr Anurani Sharma, associate professor at Teri School of Advanced Management, said currently, the windspeed was moderate at 2km/hour in Delhi NCR, which was not helping in dissipating pollutants, but is likely to pickup from Sunday onwards. “The cold winds coming from the hills are further reducing the temperature and the lack of local winds is keeping the pollutants trapped over the region. There is no control over meteorological factors but strict enforcement to curb local sources of pollution can help right now,” she said. Meanwhile, officials said they are doing everything possible to reduce pollution. R S Bhath, district town planner, (enforcement) said regular inspections are being done to ensure no construction activity is being undertaken and construction material is stored properly. “We are issuing challans if there are violations,” he said. Officials of the pollution control board said they are also checking construction sites to prevent violations. Vehicles are being checked to ensure there is no wrong parking alongside roads. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of state pollution control board, said all measures under the Graded Response Action Plan are being implemented. A spokesperson of the district administration said they are coordinating with all the agencies to ensure Grap directions are implemented. “All the civic agencies and other departments are coordinating to keep the pollution under control,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram. According to the guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 ‘severe’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-gets-very-poor-air-for-5th-day-in-a-row-101637349071629.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||A year of farm protests: Joy at Ground Zero, after 358 days||A year ago, when farmers from the agrarian states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh reached the Delhi borders to agitate against the three farm laws introduced by the Centre, they did not expect to be at the protest sites for 358 days.The occupants of the three border points -- in tents and trucks that morphed into shanties and makeshift cottages at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri-- on Friday burst crackers, danced, and sang to welcome the announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the Union government has decided to repeal the contentious laws.Though several of the protesters cautiously described the decision as a “half-victory”, it was not the surprise they expected on the morning of Guru Nanak Jayanti.“I was performing my morning prayers when a relative from Canada called up and informed me that the PM has announced they would repeal the three farm laws. I was shocked and exhilarated at the same time. But I still consider it a half-victory since we have been given only verbal assurance. We will only trust the government once they pass this decision in the Parliament and make it official. We will not leave before that,” said Karam Singh, a farmer from Bathinda who has been protesting at the Singhu border since last year.SinghuThe Delhi-Haryana border near Singhu village has become the focal point of farmers’ agitation over the past year. The protest site, which stretches up to 7km now, is dominated by farmers from Punjab and Haryana. Initially, farmers brought trucks and trolleys which served as their temporary homes. Gradually, concrete structures and air-conditioned trucks and have mushroomed amid an atmosphere of protest that is fuelled by several massive langars (community meals).In fact, the area has started looking like a small town in itself, with farmers even installing signage designating their own names for different areas on the Kundli highway.The stage area that was initially set up using tarpaulin sheets and bamboo sticks is now auditorium-like. The place has a makeshift hospital, a gym, a laundry service, a massage corner, and its own small gurdwaras.The agitation spot was only sparsely populated on Friday -- most farmers had gone back home, and were expected to return next week to mark November 26 as the anniversary of their occupy movement -- some protesters broke out into jigs near the main stage area soon after the PM spoke.Protesters said the resilience and support of their fellow farmers from across the country helped them continue the yearlong agitation. Surdev Singh, 54, a farmer from Malliana village in Moga district, said: “It will be difficult to say goodbye to the protest spot and other farmers as we have given a year of our life to this agitation. But I have learned the importance of peaceful protest.”GhazipurAt east Delhi’s Ghazipur border, where the protest has been spearheaded by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, who emerged as one of the principal faces of the agitation, protesters distributed jalebis and ladoos to mark the PM’s announcement.The Ghazipur border, initially as an ancillary protest site, gained national attention in January when UP Police tried to remove the agitators days after the tractor rally on Republic Day plunged into chaos and violence across sensitive areas in the national capital. The protest regained momentum overnight as images of Tikait -- in tears and appealing to people to join him at Ghazipur -- went viral.Ram Kumar Sharm, 68, from UP’s Nithari, has been arranging a langar for the protesters at the Ghazipur border from the first day of the agitation. He said that to celebrate the announcement on Friday, he made ‘moong dal khichdi’ with ghee and curd for lunch.“We usually have rotis and rice along with a vegetable and some dal for lunch, but since today is a big milestone for us, we are distributing khichdi. I started the langar stand on the first day of the protest and since then, I do not let anyone who comes here go hungry,” Sharma said.Many also said that the last year has been tough for them. Nanak Singh, 70, from Moradabad, remembers how many of their fellow supporters, with whom they had developed a bond, passed away waiting for this announcement.“A friend that I had made (75-year-old Kashmir Singh Ladi) went to the washroom, and died there. Over 700 farmers have died during the last year. Do you think this has been easy?” Singh asked.Om Raj, 85, said an announcement by the PM was not enough to call off the agitation. But, when the government agrees to all their demands, and when he does return home, he will miss his new friends. He has filled over 10 small diaries with the names and contact details of people he made during the protest. “I remember each one of them. We will catch up over the phone,” he said, pointing at his small diary.TikriThe dusty protest site at Tikri border between Delhi and Haryana witnessed dim celebrations on Friday. While a section of youngsters was bursting firecrackers, the organisers issued appeals from the main protest stage to desist from using any celebratory fireworks.Jagmati Sangwan, from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM)’s women’s protection group at Tikri, said there was certainly a feeling of happiness as three “black farm laws” were taken back, but the larger question was farm distress due to which thousands of farmers have committed suicide. “The monthly income of 86% farmers with less than 2-acre land holding is mere ₹6,286 -- even less than labourers in the unorganised sector. To make farming sustainable, we need MSP. It is a matter of life and death,” Sangwan said.Unlike the Singhu border protest site, with its relatively lavish langars, the counterparts at Tikri border have had a larger representation of farmers with smaller landholdings.Sweetened vermicelli and “kada prasad” was distributed at three places at the site on Friday.SKM leader Ruldu Singh, Mansa, president of All India Kisan Mahasabha, said the PM’s announcement came when they were celebrating Gurpurab. “We are still celebrating Gurpurab only. Several announcements have been made in the past, and we are not going back unless Parliament formally rolls back the laws. A meeting will be held by all farm leaders in a day or two,” he said.The trolley camps at Tikri are now restricted to the median of the road. On October 28 this year, police partially removed barricades from the border to restart vehicular movement. Heavily guarded by the central police forces, the narrow row of police barricades currently permits two-wheelers, ambulances and pedestrians to ply between Delhi and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-year-of-farm-protests-joy-at-ground-zero-after-358-days-101637348891621.html
20-11-2021||Gurugram||Few residents in Gurugram offer spaces to Muslims for Friday prayers||Amid the stiff opposition that members of the Muslim community are facing in several areas in the city for praying in the open, about 20 Muslims on Friday offered namaz at a vacant shop in Sector 12 that was offered by a resident last week. People from the Muslim faith said they have received offers from at least six residents, who are willing to let them use their premises for offering namaz.Haji Shehzad Khan, the chairman of Muslim Ekta Manch, said they have been receiving offers since last Friday from people of different communities. “Residents from at least six residential areas have offered their commercial and private land to us to offer prayers on Fridays. We have received calls from new, old and developing sectors in Gurugram, where in people are asking us to offer namaz from their place and get rid of the harassment we are facing every week,” said Khan. “We do not want to disturb anyone’s routine and are accepting only vacant land where maximum people can offer prayers,” he said.Some of the places offered for the Friday prayers needed cleaning. Muslims said they would be able to use the land next week. Likhi Ram Jadwanshi, a resident of Indra Colony in Sector 52, has offered his land in Sector 12 (Sheetla Colony). “Muslims can offer namaz at my 100 yard plot, which is lying vacant. I have no plan to start construction in the near future. I will not come under any kind of social or political pressure and go back on my decision,” he said. Apart from Jadwanshi, residents from Sector 44, 46, 57, 12 and areas from Old Gururgam have offered their places, said Khan. Altaf Ahmad, a representative of the Muslim community , said they do not want to disclose all the names. “People have big hearts and are offering their private places. We do not want others to come under heat as protesters have been mounting pressure on those who are offering to help us,” said Ahmad. “We are receiving offers to use someone’s office space, their parks and vacant land. We have enough places to offer namaz but only if there are no disruptions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/few-residents-in-gurugram-offer-spaces-to-muslims-for-friday-prayers-101637348771784.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||Protests against farm laws: Cops booked many, but charged a few||In 358 days since the morning of November 27 -- when farmers largely from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh started their sit-in protest against the three farm laws at three city borders -- Delhi Police filed at least 70 FIRs against the protesters in multiple cases. These include the Republic Day violence case and the Disha Ravi “toolkit” cases, according to officers aware of the matter.The cases relate to allegations of rioting, attempt to murder, obstructing police from doing their duty, and violating Covid-19 guidelines. Over 250 people have been arrested, who are all out on bail.HT spoke to several mid-level Delhi Police officers who confirmed that, of the 70 FIRs, police filed a charge sheet in only one case – the Republic Day violence. It is on the basis of a charge sheet, usually filed within 60 or 90 days of a case being registered, that court takes cognisance and starts a trial.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing on Friday that the government had decided to repeal the farm laws, farm groups demanded that the government withdraw all cases related to the protests. Delhi Police officers said they were yet to receive any directions about the investigation or filing of charge sheets in the cases other than the one about the violence on January 26, 2021, when a tractor march by the farmers got out of hand, leading to clashes in which 394 police personnel and 10 farmers were injured. One of the farmers lost his life during the protest, but that appeared to be an accidental death.“The withdrawal of farm laws and the crimes for which the FIR was lodged are two different things. The incidents happened, so legally speaking, the cases have to be investigated. But because the charge sheets have not been filed, it is possible that we may be asked to seek legal opinion,” said a senior officer who asked not to be named.Another officer, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said a decision may be taken only after protesters vacate the three spots on the Delhi border that they have blocked for nearly a year. “The decision will be taken at the MHA level. But one thing is for sure. In the Republic Day violence case, police will proceed legally because the charge sheet has been filed,” the second officer said.During the Republic Day tractor rally, protesting farmers deviated from the pre-approved route of the rally and clashed with police personnel. Protesters also entered Red Fort, vandalised the protected monument, and hoisted two flags -- one religious and one of a farmer union. Police said that the violence was a “well-planned conspiracy to defame the government”, but the farmer leaders distanced themselves from the event, some that some youngsters and “outsiders” got carried away.In a meeting of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha(SKM) held on Friday at the Singhu border, one of the agenda items of the meeting was the cases filed during the movement. SKM is an umbrella body of at least 40 different farmer unions. Prominent Farmers leaders, including as Darshan Pal, SS Pannu, Buta Singh Burjgil and Rakesh Tikait, have been named in more than one FIR. Harinder Singh, SKM’s media coordinator, said: “Hundreds of fabricated cases were imposed on protesting farmers in Punjab, Haryana, and other states including the ones during the Republic Day incident in Delhi. All such cases should be dismissed.”Another farm leader, Om Pal Mallik, regional secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union(BKU), said they would only vacate the borders cases only after the cases were withdrawn. Apart from the January 26 violence case, another case related to the movement was that of Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old climate activist. Police arrested Ravi on February 13, accusing her of collaborating with pro-Khalistan groups to orchestrate the Republic Day violence. Police said that she held a Zoom call with these groups before January 26 to plan a “social media storm” during the tractor rally. They also accused her of sharing a Google “toolkit” with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, on which the social media storm conspiracy was detailed. But police have not filed a charge sheet in this case. Ravi denied any role in a conspiracy, and several experts have contended that toolkits were a routine exercise in planning social media campaigns for a cause.A police officer, aware of the case development, said that police are still waiting for replies from Google and Zoom on the IP addresses of the people who had access to the toolkit. “The case is with the cyber cell. It can only proceed if they share the details,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/protests-against-farm-laws-cops-booked-many-but-charged-a-few-101637348651657.html
20-11-2021||Gurugram||Hindus play cricket, chant slogans to disrupt namaz at two sites in Gurugram||A group of residents and members of a Hindu outfit on Friday again disrupted namaz at two sites, designated by the city administration for Muslims to offer Friday prayers, despite assurances from the police that they will not allow disruptions. One of the sites where the prayers were disrupted was Sirhaul Village park, where prayers were disturbed last Friday as well. Protesters from the Hindu community raised religious slogans, following which Muslims shifted to another location. Namaz was also disturbed at the ground in Sector 37, where locals started playing cricket. Muslims offered namaz at the ground itself, but only after the police cleared the space. In Sirhaul, more than 40 members of Manavta Sanghatan, a Hindu group engaged in “social service”, and residents congregated at the park designated for namaz and started chanting religious slogans. “Last week, we informed everyone that we would not let anyone pray in the open. But Muslims again came to the park on Friday. We are adamant about not letting our parks be used for prayers. We will close the gates of the park next Friday and things may get ugly,” said Praveen Yadav (33), a resident. Haji Shehzad Khan, chairman of Muslim Ekta Manch, said when members of the Muslim community reached Sirhaul park, they were not allowed to offer prayers. “We are not troubling anyone, still people are not supporting us in many areas. Such incidents create differences between communities and we should try to spread love and peace instead of hatred,” he said. At Sector 37, around 15 men started playing cricket before Muslims reached the spot to offer namaz. The ground is opposite to the police station and Muslims had to seek the help of the police, who took almost an hour and a half to clear the ground. Sunder Chauhan of Khandsa village, who protested against namaz in the open, said they play cricket on the ground on their days off and the ground was not for any religious activity. “The cricket match was planned in September; and we will not allow Muslims to offer prayers in our area,” he said. Sachin Yadav, another resident who was playing cricket, said police asked them to allow the Muslims to offer namaz. “There is no ground in the village; this is the only space where children can play. Due to the namaz, our match was disrupted and we had to postpone it to Sunday,” he said. Police said Muslims who came to the spot for prayers did not have any permission document. Police have asked them to get a copy of the permission document next week, else they will not be allowed to offer namaz there. “We stopped the cricket match and got the ground vacated for Muslims to offer prayers. Both the groups had started arguing but we reached the spot and controlled the situation ,” said Sanjay Singh, station house officer of Sector 37 police station. On Friday, most Muslims chose to offer prayers at Sector 57 mosque, after the number of public sites for namaz was reduced from 37 to 20 two week ago. Namaz was not offered at any of the sites where objections were raised earlier, said officials of the district administration on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hindus-play-cricket-chant-slogans-to-disrupt-namaz-at-two-sites-in-gurugram-101637348300838.html

The judge gave the order while hearing a plea seeking the quashing of an FIR related to domestic violence and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The court was informed during the proceedings that the party had amicably settled the matter and the marriage had been dissolved. “Keeping in view the above facts and circumstances, since the matter has been amicably settled between the parties, no useful purpose will be served by keeping the case pending.

20-11-2021||Pune||Study on clamping to check blood loss during caesarean hysterectomy acclaimed||Pune: A study by a team of city doctors on aortic clamping for limiting blood loss during caesarean hysterectomy has been published in the International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, the official journal of the apex body of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The doctors who published the study suggested a modified technique of temporary aortic clamping which can significantly reduce blood loss and further complications. The study was conducted by a team of doctors from Pune’s King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEM) which includes Dr Vivek Joshi, director and consultant-obstetrics and gynaecology department, along with Dr Suhas Otiv, consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology, Dr Yogesh Sovani, consultant, urology and Dr Prasad Kulat, junior consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology. The placenta normally detaches itself from the uterus after delivery of the baby. However, due to previous surgeries on the uterus, like a caesarean-section, the placenta becomes pathologically stuck to the uterus and, in some cases, invades outside the uterus (placenta percreta). Dr Joshi said that in such cases the uterus has to be removed. He said, “A caesarean hysterectomy refers to removal of the uterus at the time of caesarean delivery and is a technically challenging procedure especially in placenta percreta due to massive bleeding which may occur during surgery. Currently, the technique used is the temporary aortic clamping which is an effective technique used during this procedure refers to clamping of the aorta which is the main artery coming from the heart and which supplies blood all the way down.” Explaining the suggestions made by the team in the study, Dr Joshi said, “We clamp it just above the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries, so that blood supply to kidneys, intestine, spinal cord and other organs is preserved, but the blood supply to the pelvis is blocked. Earlier the clamping was done all round the artery, but this could injure the lumbar vessels leading to paralysis of the lower limbs. We modified the technique wherein the same clamp is put from above covering only two sides and avoids posterior dissection of the aorta. Since the blood supply to other parts is maintained and blood supply to pelvis is blocked, the blood loss is limited significantly making the procedure safe and effective. This is becoming important as more C-section procedures are being performed especially in the last decade or so which is causing an increase in the incidence of placenta percreta.” Dr Joshi added that aortic clamping has reduced the blood loss from 3000-4000 ml to just about 650 ml. It would also reduce ICU admissions of such patients as complications are reduced. The simple technique of clamping can be mastered with practice by obstetricians under the supervision of a vascular surgeon, he said. The conclusion is based on a case study series of 15 women with placenta percreta who underwent a caesarean section with total hysterectomy at the hospital. The doctors had tried this technique of temporary clamping of the infra-renal aorta for reducing blood loss during hysterectomy. These fifteen women with placenta percreta underwent classical caesarean section followed by total hysterectomy with temporary clamping of the aorta. The procedure was associated with median estimated intraoperative blood loss of 650 ml. In addition, none of these women had ureteric injury or needed post-operative intensive care. Dr Joshi said, “Aortic clamping for 28-70 minutes was not associated with any intraoperative vascular complications or postoperative ischemic lesions in the lower limbs, kidneys, or bowel. After the initial successful results, we increased the procedures and till today we have used this technique in 26 women with similar outcomes. We feel that this should become a standard for management of such conditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/study-on-clamping-to-check-blood-loss-during-caesarean-hysterectomy-acclaimed-101637347572427.html

20-11-2021||Pune||Dengue, chikungunya on the rise in Pune during hot, humid Nov||Pune: With the city yet to see its normal mid-November winter temperature, hot and humid climate with unseasonal rains has led to a rise in dengue and chikungunya cases. The city has reported 72 confirmed cases of dengue and 27 confirmed cases of chikungunya till November 18 with figure same as October. Experts say that until the temperature drops, the number of dengue and chikungunya cases will not come down. As per the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) health department data, the city reported 228 suspected and 72 positive dengue cases and 27 confirmed cases of chikungunya in the past 18 days in November which is almost as much as the number that the city reported in October, considered as the ideal period for mosquito breeding and spread of these infections. In October, Pune city reported 408 suspected cases of dengue and 168 confirmed cases, and 38 confirmed cases of chikungunya. As of November 18, Pune city has reported a total of 2,697 suspected and 635 confirmed cases of dengue and a total of 245 confirmed cases of chikungunya. The civic body has issued a total of 2,488 notices and collected Rs1,56,950 in administrative fees as penalty after clearing breeding spots. As per the weather department officials, November is considered to be the beginning of winter in the city, but temperature fluctuations have been reported in the month with difference between the minimum and maximum temperatures touching at least 10 degrees Centigrade with strong rain spells. Rains add to water accumulation with the climate supporting the breeding of infection spreading mosquitoes. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer at PMC, said, “The hot and humid climate in October along with the October heat and the retreating monsoon all add to the ideal conditions of mosquito breeding. As the temperatures have not gone down in November, this also might aid the spread of dengue and chikungunya. Unless the temperature drops, it is unlikely that the number of cases might go down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dengue-chikungunya-on-the-rise-in-pune-during-hot-humid-nov-101637347091414.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||AAP demands compensation for ‘martyred’ farmers||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday demanded that the Central government pay a compensation of ₹1 crore and provide jobs to the kin of farmers who died while protesting against the three farm laws passed last year. AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh demanded that the Centre give the status of “martyr” to each of those farmers who “sacrificed their lives” while protesting against the “three black laws”. On Friday, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi announced that the government would pilot the repeal of farm laws. At least 700 farmers lost their lives during the nearly year-long protests, which began in the last week of November last year.“The government has decided to withdraw the three black farm laws because of their (Bharatiya Janata Party’s) defeat in the elections [the BJP lost three Assembly and one Lok Sabha seat in the Himachal Pradesh bypolls earlier this month]... Farmers and the people were teaching them lessons in elections. Narendra Modi’s egoistic government had to eventually bow down before the long struggle, strength and sacrifice of the farmers,” Singh said.AAP MLAs, councillors, office bearers and workers joined the protesting farmers at the Singhu border on Friday to congratulate, share sweets and celebrate with the farmers. AAP MLAs Sanjeev Jha, Ajesh Yadav, Bandana Kumari, Mohinder Goyal, Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, Mukesh Ahlawat, Jarnail Singh, Azadpur Mandi chairman Adil Khan met the protesting farmers. In a statement, AAP spokesperson and co-in charge of the political affairs in Punjab Raghav Chadha also congratulated farmers. “It’s big victory for the farmers of the country. I congratulate the farmers for the success of their long struggle. An egoistic government of the country had to kneel down. We salute the farmers of the country and their “inquilab” (uprising) and pay tribute to those farmers who sacrificed their lives (during the protest),” he said. Last September, the government passed The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act in the Parliament.​​Farmers were deeply sceptical of the laws they said would leave them at the mercy of big corporations, which could rig down prices. They also feared the changes would dismantle a system of state-backed regulated markets which offered assured farm prices. Farm unions, largely from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been holding year-long sit-ins at four sites near Delhi’s borders: Singhu, Ghaziabad, Tikri, Dhansa, and also at Shahjahanpur (at the Rajasthan-Haryana border).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-demands-compensation-for-martyred-farmers-101637346856086.html

20-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police arrest gang of interstate vehicle thieves||Four men, part of an interstate gang of vehicle thieves who allegedly sold vehicles stolen from the NCR in Manipur, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, were arrested Friday, Delhi Police said. Preliminary investigation by the police has revealed that the gang was controlled by a man in Dubai. Police said they seized 21 cars, including 10 Toyota Fortuners and four Hyundai Creta, from the suspects. The cars recovered by the police were stolen from Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana, said police. Deputy commissioner of police (south west) Gaurav Sharma said the four men have been identified as Abid (30) (identified by his first name) from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, Mohammed Asif(33) from UP’s Meerut, Sagolsem Johnson Singh(27) from Manipur and Salman (identified by his first name) from Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Police said Johnson received the stolen vehicles in Manipur, changed the engine numbers of the vehicles (with the engine number of those sent for scrapping) and sold the vehicles to prospective buyers. Police said that one of the key members of the gang, identified as Sarik Satta, is operating the gang from Dubai. Satta, a resident of Moradabad, has been arrested for stealing cars on several occasions by Delhi police. He was last arrested in 2018 and had come out on bail, after which he fled to Dubai, said police. Sharma said in the present case, police conducted raids and seized the stolen cars from the insurgency-hit areas in Manipur.“The first to be arrested was Abid, who was arrested from Uttam Nagar. He said he acts as a carrier in the gang. On October 3, he received a stolen Fortuner from three people at Delhi’s Kashmiri Gate and then handed over the car to Johnson and another person named Vidyasunder at Imphal (Manipur).”Abid also told police that there are many vehicle thieves operating with their accomplices in Manipur.Police are now working on identifying the other members of the gang.

20-11-2021||Lucknow||UP ATS arrests Delhi airport customer service executive in human trafficking racket||The UP ATS (Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad) on Thursday arrested a Delhi airport customer service executive for allegedly helping the members of an international racket involved in human trafficking from Bangladesh and Myanmar to European, Gulf and Southeast Asian countries on Indian identities, Uttar Pradesh police officials said here on Friday.The officials said a Lucknow court has granted his 10 days’ custody to UP ATS to interrogate the Delhi airport customer service executive about other airport and airlines staff suspected to be involved in this racket.Additional director general (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar said the arrested accused was identified as Ajay Ghildiyal, a resident of Dehradun in Uttarakhand.He said the accused has been working as a customer service executive at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in New Delhi since 2016.Another senior police official said Ghildiyal came in contact with Vikram Singh, a key member of the international human trafficking racket who was arrested earlier in this connection, in 2020 and since then he is helping those involved in the racket to clear the boarding passes of people being sent to European countries illegally on fake identities. He said Vikram Singh was arrested from his hideout in Ghaziabad on November 10.The officer also said Ghildiyal used to get ₹15000 for clearing the boarding pass per person and he used to share this with other airport and airlines staff to get their favours. The accused revealed that he has so far helped send over 40 people to Spain, Britain and other European countries illegally, the officer said.He also said the Delhi airport customer service executive is part of a widespread international network of human traffickers operating from South Africa and London (England).He said seven members of this international human trafficking racket have been arrested so far.

20-11-2021||Lucknow||PM Modi dedicates ₹2,655 crore Arjun Sahayak irrigation project to people in Mahoba||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday dedicated the ₹2,655 crore Arjun Sahayak irrigation project to the people in Mahoba district of Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh and said it would end the water woes of farmers in the drought-prone region. He also charged the previous Samajwadi Party government with non-cooperation in ending the region’s water scarcity. PM Modi was addressing the farmers for the first time since he announced the decision to repeal the Centre’s three contentious farm laws earlier in the day.“This project will benefit lakhs of farmers, they will get the water they have been waiting for generations in Bundelkhand,” he said.PM Modi also said that Mahoba is a witness to how the government has been brought to every nook-and-corner of the country from the closed doors of Delhi in the past seven years.Arjun Sahayak irrigation project is a flagship of project of the Uttar Pradesh government centering around providing water for drinking and irrigation in Mahoba.Quoting a couplet of Guru Nanak Dev on the importance of water in the Punjabi language, he said the project had remained a non-starter for years.“I discussed this crucial project with the then government many a time in 2014. They did not show any interest. It was the lifeline of this region,” PM Modi said.The work began under the Yogi Adityanath government in 2017 and has been completed in record time, he said.Asserting that the government was committed to the welfare of Bundelkhand, he said the previous government and “family-owned” political parties looted the region, its people and resources.“Those who kept cutting ribbons in the name of Bundelkhand’s ponds and water bodies for farmers did not allow a single penny to reach them,” he said.On the other hand, the water mechanism that the erstwhile rulers of Bundelkhand established had given the region prosperity and fame, he added.“I want to ask those parties, which ruled UP and Delhi, how this naturally gifted region became synonymous with struggles for water to an extent the people did not want to marry off their daughters in this region?” he said.“Let me tell (you) they worked for their families, there was corruption and commission, and you (farmers) remained desperate for a single drop of water,” he said, alleging that previous governments handed the region over to the mafia.These parties were creating ruckus when the Yogi government was bulldozing the mafia in Uttar Pradesh, he said.“No matter how much trouble they create, the development of state would not stop,” he said, adding, “They were not tired of looting the UP and we are not tired of serving the people.”He said many water related projects were underway under the Yogi Adityanath government. The government found the solution for the Ken- Betwa link in consultation with the stakeholders, the prime minister said.The linking would help lakhs of farmers in the days to come, he added. He said the problems were similar to those that prevailed in Gujarat where the Sardar Sarovar dam project allowed water to reach even the arid areas of Kutch.“I am from Gujarat and I understand your issues. Ee will replicate the success of Gujarat in Bundelkhand,” he said.Like people of Kutch in Gujarat earlier, the people in Bundelkhand had to migrate but this would change and a new life would be given to the region, he said. The PM said his government has taken a number of steps for welfare of farmers, including providing neem coated urea, the best seeds that give high-yield with low use of water and made record purchase of crops and increased minimum support price.He said he felt blessed in Mahoba from where he launched Ujjawala 2.0 scheme and had made a promise to Muslim women with regard to triple talaq.“From Mahoba, I promised my Muslim sisters that I will get rid of triple talaq for them. Today I am here to give my Bundeli sisters and farmers the best and biggest gift of this project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-dedicates-2-655-crore-arjun-sahayak-irrigation-project-to-people-in-mahoba-district-of-uttar-pradesh-101637332089998.html
20-11-2021||Chandigarh||Repeal of farm laws highlights PM’s supreme character: Manohar Lal Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, while welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the three farm laws, made today on the auspicious occasion of Gurpurab, said that repealing these laws has once again highlighted the supreme character of the Prime Minister.Addressing the media at his residence on Friday, Khattar said, “Ever since the Central government had brought the three agriculture laws for the benefit of farmers, especially small and marginal one’s, some farmers’ union had been protesting on the Delhi borders.”“Today, Prime Minister Modi, while once again choosing the larger public interest, announced to repeal these laws. However, soon after the introduction of these laws, a large number of farmers had considered these laws beneficial for them and had also appreciated the Central Government,” said Khattar.The Haryana chief minister said the decision of the Prime Minister shows that keeping the interest of the public is paramount for him as he announced to roll back these laws in the upcoming parliamentary session.“Like Prime Minister, I would also urge farmers sitting on Delhi borders, to immediately end their protest and return to their homes, as common man is also facing lot of difficulties due to this agitation. Now, positive attitude should be adopted towards this issue,” said the Haryana CM.Khattar said the Prime Minister has also said that a committee will be constituted for considering the farmers’ demands related to MSP. “In this committee, representatives of farmers’ unions, state governments and scientists will be included. I hope a decision in this regard will also be taken soon,” he said.Farmers should not worry now, there is no scope of showing distrust towards the Prime Minister, said Khattar.Responding to a question regarding withdrawal of cases registered against farmers, the Haryana CM said that in these cases, many other issues are taken into consideration, some cases are general while in some incidents, cases are registered under serious sections. “Now, a positive initiative will be taken from the state government’s side too and there will be no controversies,” assured Khattar.“Haryana has faced a major impact of this agitation and during this one year, I have held various meetings with the Prime Minister, senior leaders and even with farmer unions. As many as 11 formal meetings were held with the farmers on this issue, along with many informal meetings for sharing their message with the Centre. I think the effort put in by us has also played an important role in the decision taken by the Prime Minister,” said the CM.“The announcement made by Prime Minister today has certainly got mixed reactions as some have lauded him for this, while others are still not satisfied. I would urge the farmers that they should not worry now and trust the Prime Minister’s announcement,” said the chief minister while responding to a question regarding farmer unions showing distrust towards Prime Minister.Khattar said even the Opposition has also shown trust. ‘Linking this decision with elections is not logical’Responding to another question regarding Prime Minister suddenly announcing the repeal of these laws, Khattar said this decision has not been taken overnight, talks over this have been going on for a long time. “Linking this decision with elections is not logical and justified. Elections come and go. By taking this decision, Prime Minister has certainly shown a big heart. He has once again proved that he is a common man’s leader,” said Khattar.The CM also extended greetings on the occasion of Kartik Purnima and Gurpurab to the people of the state.Will urge Centre to withdraw cases against farmers: DushyantHaryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said it is a welcome decision that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken to withdraw the three farm laws. The deputy CM said he will urge the central government to withdraw cases registered against farmers in Haryana, Punjab, and Delhi during the agitation. He said the cases which are not very serious should be withdrawn while the court will deal with cases of serious nature. “PM Modi has taken a commendable decision in view of the long struggle of the farmers. It is the victory of the farmers’ struggle,” he said. He said the farmers’ struggle went on for a long time because the benefits of the laws were not publicised well and due to this, the image of these new laws were reflected in a bad light.He added that the PM himself admitted that there is a lack of understanding about the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-says-repeal-of-farm-laws-highlights-pm-s-supreme-character-urges-farmers-to-return-home-101637323688891.html
20-11-2021||Delhi||Submit data on complaints: Delhi assembly panel to Facebook||The committee on peace and harmony of the Delhi assembly, inquiring into the northeast Delhi riots that took place in February 2020, on Thursday sought a series of clarifications and information from Facebook India on steps taken by the social media giant in curbing and taking down inflammatory content and fake news in the country.The committee sought to know the company’s organisational capacity to handle and gate-keep the high volume of content from India, which accounts for almost 40% of Facebook’s total users globally.Facebook India’s (Meta platforms) public policy director Shivnath Thukral and its associate general counsel Saanjh Purohit deposed before the committee chaired by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Raghav Chadha on Thursday. Representatives of Facebook India were first summoned to appear before the panel on November 2, but the hearing was postponed to November 18 on a request from the company.The proceedings of the committee, which went beyond the scheduled limit of two hours, were significant because it was the first time that people could see lawmakers question Facebook India officials and hear their answers on issues ranging from hate speech to their system of fact checking. The social media giant informed the panel that it has one billion users across the world, of which at least 400 million are from India.Chadha and committee member BS Joon, also an AAP MLA, asked Facebook India to furnish data on user complaints and the subsequent action taken by the company in each case for a period of one month before and 60 days after the February 2020 riots in Delhi, in which 53 people were killed. Thukral said offensive material is removed from the platform by employing human reviewers and artificial intelligence. However, he acknowledged that these tools are not always perfect and there is still scope for improvement.The panel grilled Thukral and Purohit on whether the company has a definition of “hate speech”, especially in the Indian context. To this, Thukral replied: “Hate speech definition is very much there in the community standards. But it is ever evolving. For example in India, based on the inputs from civil society, we included caste slurs in the evolving definition of hate speech. Our community standards are a global document. We believe hate speech definitions apply uniformly across the world and whenever there are local considerations we would take them into account.”From time-to-time, the panel members and the Meta Inc officials kept referring to each other paragraphs from the Supreme Court’s July 8 order which upheld the powers of the Delhi assembly to summon both members and non-members, including representatives of Facebook. The order, however, said the panel could not engage in topics dealing with police, law and order, or land in its proceedings as these subjects are outside the purview of the committee as well as the elected government.Asked what actions were taken to curb inflammatory content during the riots last year, the representative said, “This is a matter of law and order and it is part of an ongoing investigation. Also, as per the SC judgment, I exercise my right to not comment on it.”The SC order came after Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan moved the Supreme Court on September 22 last year, challenging similar summons issued by the peace panel on September 10 and September 18. The summons stemmed from the committee’s decision to look into Facebook’s role following several foreign media reports that purported to show that the social media company may have acted in a politically partisan manner.Facebook India was also asked to provide details on the composition of its team based on religion. “Explain the composition of the Facebook India team including the number of religious minority employees. What is the religious affiliation of people working in Facebook India?”Chaddha asked. To this, Thukral said, "As far as we understand, Indian laws don’t allow us to differentiate based on religious affiliations when we hire. We do not ask such questions. As per IT laws, there is due diligence that we follow."Thursday’s proceedings also revealed that Facebook India had no dedicated grievance officer for the country when the riots took place last year. Thukral informed the panel that a grievance officer for the company’s India operations was appointed in May this year.Other questions to which the social media giant did not give clear answers included whether their fact-checkers are audited, how do they ensure their civil society partners are not biased, the basic criteria for recruiting the grievance officer, how its algorithm works, and whether it played any special role in curbing hate speech during and after the 2020 riots. The company was asked if it has a dedicated content policy team in India for the country and whether there is any gradation of hate speech.Chadha asked Thukral how many languages Facebook hosts on its platform and whether it has fact-checkers for each. Thukral replied that Facebook India hosts 20 languages but has a (fact checking) system which covers only 11 of those. He said Facebook detects problematic content on the platform and at least 97% of it is removed. In case of a user complaint, acknowledgement is given in 24 hours and the entire cycle to work on the complaint is completed within 14 days. In September, 182,000 pieces of content were removed from the platform, Thukral said.Chadha said the committee will take into account the information presented before it after Thursday’s proceedings. “Given the vast user base in India, it is always imperative for the global headquarters as well to intervene and account for the shortcomings and improvements in the market specific to the Indian context. The committee will further deliberate and decide on recalling the Facebook officials for another round of proceedings and examination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/submit-data-on-complaints-delhi-assembly-panel-to-facebook-101637261403300.html

All of these nations, including Germany and Russia, which are seeing record infection levels, are imposing lockdown-like restrictions and banning unvaccinated people from venues, leading to riots and protests.Soon after the Austrian government announced that it would impose a lockdown starting Monday and mandated its entire eligible population to get vaccinated within February, protesters took to streets in Vienna. The protests were spearheaded by right-wing political outfit Freedom Party who have vowed to oppose the new restrictions.Thousands of protesters took to Vienna's Heldenplatz chanting ‘Resistance’ and carried signs mocking Austrian chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and the nation’s health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein, news agency AP reported.The Austrian lockdown will remain in place for 10 days following which the authorities will take a call on whether to extend it for another 10 days. Vaccinations in Austria are one of the lowest in western Europe and at least 66% of Austria’s 8.9 million people are vaccinated.‘Orgy of violence’The Netherlands’ Rotterdam saw violence as police were forced to fire bullets at protesters on Friday. Police arrested 51 anti-lockdown protesters on Saturday and said that a hunt is on for more instigators.“Fifty-one people were arrested during the major disturbances on Friday evening and night on Coolsingel (street) in Rotterdam. About half of them were just underage,” Rotterdam Police said. The police also said that two of these protesters were also hit by a bullet when the police allegedly fired at protesters to disperse them. Ahmed Aboutaleb, Rotterdam mayor, called the protests an ‘orgy of violence’, news agency Reuters reported.Hundreds of protesters also took to the streets of Amsterdam on Saturday to protest against the partial lockdown imposed by Dutch authorities.A news report by AP says that protests are also expected to take place in Switzerland, Croatia and Italy against lockdown measures despite Europe seeing a rise in the number of cases, which health officials have attributed to not taking vaccines and not following Covid-19 preventative measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-covid-spike-europe-sees-protests-against-lockdowns-vaccine-mandates-101637429844646.html
20-11-2021||World||Brazil faces charges of ‘greenwashing’ over Amazon deforestation||Despite recent headline-grabbing promises to protect its rainforest before the end of the decade, Brazil has once again seen a jump in deforestation.The latest figures released by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE), which tracks the state of the Amazon rainforest, showed a 22% increase from last year. Some 13,235 square kilometers (5,110 square miles) disappearing between August 1, 2020, and July 31, 2021. The new statistics were dated October 27 — before the start of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow — prompting environmental organizations like Greenpeace to accuse the Brazilian government of trying to clean up its image during the crucial talks."There is no amount of greenwashing that can hide what [President Jair] Bolsonaro is doing to destroy the Amazon. If anyone believed Bolsonaro's government's empty promises at COP, the truth is in these numbers. Unlike Bolsonaro, the satellites don't lie," the group said in a press statement.A pledge to save the rainforest?Brazil, along with more than 100 other global leaders, pledged during the UN climate conference in Glasgow to stop and reverse deforestation by 2030. Its Amazon rainforest represents about a third of all the tropical forests left on Earth.This huge, biologically rich region is key to helping absorb planet-warming CO2; forests absorb roughly 30% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, according to the World Resources Institute.But, despite a significant drop in deforestation from a high of 27,700 square kilometers (10,700 square miles) in 2004 to just over 4,500 square kilometers in 2012, illegal logging, agricultural expansion, and damaging wildfires have slowly pushed that rate back up over the last decade — especially since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019."The environmental track record of Brazil's federal government is appalling, and multiple lines of evidence show that they have been simultaneously encouraging deforestation whilst reducing investment in environmental enforcement," said Jos Barlow, a British conservation science professor based at Lancaster University, who has worked in Brazil since 1998."Without a dramatic change in their approach, the commitments made at COP should be seen in this context — at least until the election in a year's time," he told DW.Amazon has ‘already changed beyond all recognition’The Brazilian rainforest plays a key role in mitigating climate change, but Bolsonaro is primarily concerned with its economic possibilities. Under his government, environmental authorities have been defunded and land protections loosened. This has encouraged loggers, farmers, and cattle ranchers to further develop the Amazon region, some 60 per cent of which — about the size of western Europe — is found in Brazil."The Amazon is in the center of the global debate on climate change," said Andre Guimaraes, executive director of a Brazilian think tank, Amazon Environmental Research Institute, in an email to DW. "It stocks carbon, and it is a source of rain to agriculture and energy. But nothing seems to echo [with] the federal administration, that has chosen wrong, expensive and inefficient ways to deal with deforestation."Some observers believe parts of the world's largest remaining rainforest may be nearing a tipping point, beyond which its ecosystem could collapse and substantially weaken any efforts to limit global heating.Barlow, a co-founder of the Sustainable Amazon Network research group, has noticed significant changes in the Santarem region, in the eastern part of the Amazon. Since the 1980s, he said the region has seen a 34 per cent decrease in rainfall during the dry season, a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), and an increase in huge wildfires that have wiped out more than 1 million hectares of forest.“The forests and the landscapes have already changed beyond all recognition in the past 20 years, and the rate of change is speeding up. So yes, it is very close to a tipping point. But I like to hope we can still avert it, even in these regions,” he told DW.EU takes steps to limit deforestationBarlow was encouraged by the actions of state-level governments in the Amazon region, some of which have made their own commitments to stop deforestation. “There is also increasing international pressure, with Europe and the UK committing to deforestation-free commodity imports,” he said.On Wednesday, the European Commission presented a proposal to restrict imports on goods linked to deforestation, among them soybeans, palm oil, beef, wood, and products made from them. Brazil, which produces many of these products, would be hit particularly hard."These initiatives show that the European Union is serious about the green transition," said Frans Timmermans, the European Commission vice president in charge of the EU's Green Deal, adding that this would help "promote sustainable consumption."“This is an important step in the right direction, and it provides a powerful incentive for business to adapt and regulate itself,” said Barlow. But, he added, it wasn't enough: implementation would be a “huge challenge”, as would compliance. And, he pointed out, much of Brazil's beef is exported to places outside of the EU, like Egypt and, more generally, the Middle East. “We need all countries to agree to this.”The measure, which could still undergo changes before coming into force, will still need approval from EU member states and the European Parliament.Barlow also said measures to limit forest degradation and support the livelihoods of local Amazonians were crucial, a stance echoed by Giulia Bondi, an EU forest campaigner with transparency group Global Witness.“The European Parliament and EU member states must now strengthen this law to uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, stop EU financiers bankrolling and profiting from global deforestation and associated abuses, and include key commodities like rubber and maize,” she said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-faces-charges-of-greenwashing-over-amazon-deforestation-101637428419784.html

The refineries were targeted with bomb-laden drones, he said, adding that other military locations targeted were in Abha, Jazan and Najran. Saree did not comment on any damage caused by the attacks. The strikes were in response to an escalation by Saudi-led coalition forces, which increased air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, Saree said. It also came as joint forces backed by the coalition continued to make advances in Hais district in the Hodiedah province.Saudi Aramco, the Saudi energy ministry and the media ministry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Read more: Iran-Backed Houthis Detained 25 Yemenis Working for U.S.Coalition forces meanwhile said they destroyed 13 military targets for the Houthi rebels in Sanaa, Marib and Saada.

20-11-2021||World||With lights back on, Times Square hopes to regain its lustre||David Cohen has been yearning for a return to the days when business boomed at his family’s souvenir shop in Times Square.While tourists have begun returning, foot traffic into Grand Slam souvenirs is still not what it was before the coronavirus pandemic, when hordes of global visitors crowded under the canopy of electric billboards just outside his door.But the return of foreign tourists to a place popularly called the crossroads of the world may help hasten recovery for businesses like his — many of them mom-and-pop shops — that collectively employ thousands of people and serve as one of New York City’s most important economic engines.“We welcome them back with open arms,” Cohen said after the U.S. began allowing vaccinated international travellers into the country this month. “We’ve got a long way to go.”Times Square had long stood as an emblem of New York’s hustle and bustle, but when Broadway theatres shut their doors at the height of the pandemic, 9 in 10 businesses in the area closed, according to a district civic group, The Times Square Alliance.Three-fourths have since reopened, bit by bit, as Broadway shows began reopening to vaccinated-only audiences.Among those hopefully restarting are businesses that don’t cater directly to tourists, but are part of the city’s entertainment ecosystem.Sam Vasili’s Shoe Repair reopened last month across 51st street from the Gershwin Theater, where it had operated for three decades before a long pandemic closure.Owner Sam Smolyar was all grins on a recent afternoon as he shared the news that a Broadway production set to reopen nearby had requisitioned his help. For years, he had been helping outfit the Rockettes with custom-fitted boots. “We rely on the theatre, and on the businesses around here,” he said.He hopes more people buying tickets on Broadway will mean busier times.“It starts to get better,” said Vasili, who employs three people at the shop.Just before the Covid-19 outbreak, New York City had been posting record numbers of tourists — 66.6 million in 2019, including 13.5 million from outside the United States. Then the pandemic hit, prompting severe restrictions on foreign travel.A marketing blitz has been underway for months to remind Americans that New York City is again open for business and ready for the visiting masses. Now the city is expanding its outreach to those outside the United States, who are especially coveted because they spend more time and more money during their visits.While domestic travel accounted for 80% of New York visitors, foreign tourists account for about half of the city’s tourism spending and typically represent half of all hotel bookings.Tom Harris, president of the Times Square Alliance, said the district is already rebounding. Since May, he said, the number of pedestrians counted in some places has grown from 150,000 per day to as many as 250,000 — still far below the roughly 365,000 people who tramped through the grid of streets before the pandemic.“Between the return of Broadway, the return of international tourists,” Harris said, “we really expect to be at those pre-pandemic numbers sooner than most people predict.”Those returning visitors included people like Marina Galan, who soaked in Times Square from the bleachers under a cascade of lights. She and her friends flew to New York from Madrid on the first day U.S. borders became open to vaccinated tourists.“When you come back to New York, this is what you want to see,” she said. “Everything is kind of back to normal.”Her friend Pablo Leon said he was eager to return. The group took a risk last March when they bought tickets for the Broadway musical Hadestown, even though uncertain about when they’d be allowed to travel to the United States.“That was the true gamble because we bought the tickets for tonight, without any knowledge if we were going to be able to come here,” Leon said.NYC & Company, the city’s tourism agency, is spending millions of dollars overseas to draw tourists back to the city. It projects 2.8 million foreign visitors by the end of the year, a sliver of the 13.5 million who visited in 2019. With borders reopened, officials hope that the number of visitors will steadily rise over the next few years and again reach record levels within the next four years.“We’re hoping to do everything we can to accelerate that timeline,” said Chris Heywood, the agency’s executive vice president.The campaign is initially focused on Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and parts of Europe, but will likely expand into other countries — possibly into China, a particularly lucrative market because Chinese visitors significantly outspend other nationalities.Chinese visitors, however, may be deciding to stay put for now because of quarantining requirements back home — at least two weeks after returning from an overseas trip.“Daytrips and domestic tourists are helping Broadway, museums and restaurants, but New York can’t reach our pre-pandemic level of visitors until international tourism returns in full,” New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said. “Reopening America’s borders is a big help, but other factors, beyond our control, make it hard to see when we’ll get back to the numbers we had before the world shut down.”The return of annual traditions like New York City’s big Thanksgiving parade and the Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration could attract more visitors.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also has announced a $450 million initiative to help revitalize the tourism industry.On a recent day, William Brownstein hawked comedy club tickets to passersby who might now be ready to laugh off the months of grim news.“With all the crazy things going on” — with Republicans and Democrats, with pro- and anti-vaccine viewpoints — “you got to laugh about it,” said Brownstein, who returned from his unplanned hiatus in May, soon after comedy clubs were allowed to reopen.“I think as time progresses, we will see a lot more people come,” he predicted. “It’s just going to take a little time, but they will be back like they were before.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-lights-back-on-times-square-hopes-to-regain-its-lustre-101637421926292.html
20-11-2021||World||'Burning the metro': Chile election divides voters between protest and order||For many Chileans, Plaza Baquedano, a broad rotary in central Santiago that for decades served as a center of social protest, has become a powerful symbol of hope.For two years, city residents have regularly gathered here to protest pensions that are too low, public transit fees that are too high and, more generally, an old-guard political class that just does not get it.The statue of a nineteenth-century general that sat at the plaza's center has been removed, and its plinth is now covered in left-wing political literature.Most credit the protests - known collectively as the "estallido social" or "social outbreak" - for bringing about an ongoing rewrite of the nation's Pinochet-era constitution. The "estallido" has also helped propel the candidacy of 35-year-old leftist Gabriel Boric, a relative newcomer who has become a serious contender in this Sunday's presidential election.But not everyone is so enthralled.Among the detractors is Ramon Zambrano, a doorman at a nearby apartment building."You can protest, but peacefully. They're making a mess, burning cars, burning the metro. What are they doing?" he asks, while pointing out the damage done to the now graffiti-covered building where he works.In a sense, the situation around Plaza Baquedano represents the central paradox of the election in Chile. While Chile's Left gained significant traction via dozens of massive marches that began in 2019, two years of sometimes-violent protests have made many voters wary.That - combined with a widespread perception among Chileans that crime is on the rise - has created an opportunity for the Right to gain ground by hammering home a law-and-order message.While Boric, who rose to fame heading student protests in 2011, had been leading for most of 2021, José Antonio Kast, an ultra-right-wing former congressman who draws comparisons to Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has risen in the polls dramatically in recent weeks.Most recent polls show Kast drawing the largest vote share on Sunday. A November 6 survey by consultancy Activa Research has Kast narrowly winning a likely runoff in December.Burned OutFor Kenneth Bunker, director of political consultancy Tresquintos, a particularly violent round of protests in late October helped boost the Right.A series in the southern Araucania and Bio Bio provinces - where police and separatist indigenous groups have long feuded - has also played into Kast's hands."I think there is a very important part of the country that's tired, they don't want any more of this," said Gonzalo Cordero, a political consultant and columnist for the national La Tercera newspaper.Boric's supporters point out that almost 80% of Chileans, many fed up with the nation's ultra-free-market economic model, voted last year to rewrite the nation's constitution. A conservative like Kast would do little to quell discontent, they argue."I think that if Kast is elected, there will be an 'estallido 2.0'," said Pedro Muñoz, an elected member of the body re-writing Chile's constitution.Still, the Kast campaign is leaning in to the law-and-order message, as are his supporters.At his campaign's closing event on Thursday night, he pledged repeatedly to crack down on crime. The strongest applause came when he spoke in favor of police officers, many of whom have been accused by the public and prosecutors of using violence against protestors.Several supporters insisted without evidence in interviews that the "estallido" was the product of foreign provocateurs, such as the Venezuelan or Cuban governments.Banners in favor of Trump were common, as were anti-crime banners such as "Orden con Kast," or "Order with Kast."Boric, for his part, is leaning in, too. While for Kast's supporters the protests are a symptom of decline and disorder, for Boric, they are a sign the previous order was not worth saving."We're going to do our politics from the streets," Boric said at his own campaign event on Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/burning-the-metro-chile-election-divides-voters-between-protest-and-order-101637410223375.html
20-11-2021||World||China’s 2020 birth rate was lowest in 43 years||China’s birth rate fell below one percent in 2020, marking the lowest rate of childbirth in 43 years, official statistics have revealed, state-run tabloid Global Times reported on Saturday.The birth rate in 2020 was recorded as 8.52 per thousand people, according to the recently published China Statistical Yearbook 2020 compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the report said. According to the report, the natural growth rate of the population was 1.45 per thousand, which was also a new low in 43 years.The birth rate is the number of births in the total population, while the growth rate is calculated after deducting the number of deaths from births.The birth rate in China was 10.48 per 1,000 in 2019, according to NBS data released last year. The latest population data from NBS indicates the extent of China’s demographic problems, which is fewer births and an ageing population. The country’s birth rate has been falling for years prompting the government to gradually ease the one-child policy, which was in place since the late 1970s.“An article published in May this year in a professional journal Population Research, affiliated with China Population and Development Research Center, found out that the monthly decline of birth rate has nosedived in 2020 compared with the same period of 2015, with November and December declining above 45 percent respectively,” the report said.Demographers say the falling number of women of childbearing age, and the impact of Covid-19 contributed to the low birth rate. “There are three main reasons: Number of child-bearing women shrinking, rapid urbanisation and more people receiving higher education, and delay of births due to anti-Covid-19 measures including vaccination,” Huang Wenzheng a demography expert at the Beijing-based think-tank Centre for China and Globalisation told HT.China, the most populous country in the world, is burdened with an ageing citizenry despite scrapping the decades-old one-child policy in 2016.China’s population is growing at its slowest pace in decades with the country adding only 72 million people in the past decade, the once-in-a-decade census data showed earlier this year.In May, China allowed married couples to have up to three children, in a major shift from the current limit of two following a worrying decline in births confirmed in new Census data.“The three-child policy and supporting measures will be conducive to improving China’s demographic structure and implementing the national strategy of actively responding to population aging,” the Chinese government said about the decision.“The document on improving birth policies to promote long-term and balanced population development allows a couple to have three children and draws up supporting measures to encourage births,” it said.The change to the two-child policy did not show the desired growth in population needed to sustain the world’s second-largest economy in the long run.Beijing faces tough social and economic questions on how to look after hundreds of millions of elderly citizens as the younger population is set to shrink in the next few decades.The number of newly married couples in China in the first three quarters of 2021 also plummeted by 17.5% compared with 2019 as the youth’s willingness to get married is declining both in cities and the countryside, a state media report said earlier this month.According to statistics from China’s ministry of civil affairs, there were 5.88 million newly married couples in the first three quarters of 2021, 17.5% less than in the same period of 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-2020-birth-rate-was-lowest-in-43-years-101637410945408.html

He was aged 16, it added.Most of those killed on Wednesday were in North Khartoum, which lies across the Nile river from the capital, medics said.Police officials deny using any live ammunition and insist they have used "minimum force" to disperse the protests. They have recorded only one death, among demonstrators in North Khartoum.On Friday, small groups of protesters rallied in several neighbourhoods after prayers against the military coup, especially in North Khartoum, where people were seen building barricades across the roads. Security forces sporadically fired teargas to disperse them.The SPA reported that security forces had "stormed homes and mosques" in there on Friday."We call for those responsible for human rights abuses and violations, including the excessive use of force against peaceful protesters, to be held accountable," US State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement."In advance of upcoming protests, we call on Sudanese authorities to use restraint and allow peaceful demonstrations," the US added.The African Union, which suspended Sudan after the coup, also condemned "in the strongest terms" Wednesday's violence, in a statement released Saturday.AU Commission chair Moussa Faki Mahamat called on Sudan's authorities "to restore constitutional order and the democratic transition" in line with a 2019 power-sharing deal between the military and the now-deposed civilian figures.Sudan has a long history of military coups, enjoying only rare interludes of democratic rule since independence in 1956.Burhan, the top general, insists the military's move "was not a coup" but a step "to rectify the transition" as factional infighting and splits deepened between civilians and the military under the now-deposed government.He has since announced a new civilian-military ruling council in which he kept his position as head, along with a powerful paramilitary commander, three senior military figures, three ex-rebel leaders and one civilian.But the other four civilian members were replaced with lesser known figures.bur/pjm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudanese-anti-coup-protesters-call-for-mass-agitation-as-death-toll-rises-to-40-101637407708959.html

But it failed to get the parliamentary nod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-to-not-allow-nationals-of-third-country-to-travel-to-india-via-kurtha-jayanagar-railroad-101637406686146.html

We want to reduce the use of plastics in packaging and ban its use in items linked to littering," said environment minister George Eustice.“We have already banned plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds and now plan to extend the ban to cutlery and balloon sticks where alternative materials, like wood can be used.”A ban on supplying plastic straws and stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds came into force in England last year.Forced charges for single-use carrier bags has cut consumption in the main supermarkets by 95% since 2015.The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for their own policies on plastic waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-seeks-ban-on-single-use-plastic-plates-cutlery-to-reduce-waste-101637400181442.html

Muslims generally believe any physical depiction of Islam’s prophet is blasphemous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ban-on-tiktok-lifted-for-the-fourth-time-in-pakistan-101637398922031.html

She alleged that Zhang, who was a member of China’s top political group headed by President Xi Jinping, had coerced her into sex.“In the past few days, she stayed in her own home freely and she didn’t want to be disturbed. She will show up in public and participate in some activities soon,” Hu Xijin, editor Communist Party-owned tabloid Global Times tweeted on Saturday.He said that he was able to confirm through sources that photos of Peng that had been shared on Twitter by a journalist working for Chinese state media were in fact showing Peng at home, and in her “current state”.“I confirmed through my own sources today that these photos are indeed Peng Shuai’s current state,” Hu said.The United Nations, United States, along with tennis governing bodies, human rights groups, retired players, and several athletes’ lobbies have raised questions about Peng. Several top tennis stars like Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, and Naomi Osaka have also voiced their concerns about the Chinese star.The UN on Friday called for an investigation into the whereabouts of Peng.“What we would say is that it would be important to have proof of her whereabouts and well-being, and we would urge that there be an investigation with full transparency into her allegations of sexual assault,” Liz Throssell, the spokesperson of the UN Human Rights office, told reporters in Geneva.“According to available information, the former world doubles No. 1 hasn’t been heard from publicly since she alleged on social media that she was sexually assaulted. We would stress that it is important to know where she is and know her state, and know about her well-being,” Throssell said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday that President Joe Biden’s administration wanted China to “provide independent, verifiable proof” of Peng’s whereabouts and expressed “deep concern” about her.The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) has threatened to pull tournaments out of China over Peng’s disappearance.The Intense international scrutiny over tennis star’s whereabouts come two-and-half months ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics, scheduled to start from February 4, 2022.This is the second time that the official Chinese media has come to the aid of the government, which has so far been silent on the case or on Peng’s whereabouts.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters on Friday that the matter was “not a diplomatic question and I’m not aware of the situation.”CGTN, the English channel of China’s official broadcaster CCTV on Thursday tweeted an email purportedly from Peng, in which the sports star alleged that she is well and safe.In the email, Peng also denied the allegations against former CPC politburo standing committee member, Zhang Gaoli.“Hello, everyone this is Peng Shuai.

20-11-2021||World||Chinese live streamer banned from all-you-can-eat restaurant for eating too much||Have you ever been punished for eating too much? A Chinese food live streamer claimed that he has been banned from a restaurant for doing just that.Known as Mr Kang, the man told Hunan TV that he was blacklisted from Handadi Seafood BBQ Buffet in China’s Changsha city after a string of binges, according to a BBC report.So, what did he eat?Mr Kang reportedly ate 1.5kg of pork trotters when he visited the restaurant the first time, and 3.5kg to 4kg of prawns during another visit.The live streamer claimed that the restaurant is “discriminatory” against people who can eat huge quantities. “I can eat a lot – is that a fault?” Mr Kang told Hunan TV, pointing out that he didn’t waste any food item.The restaurant owner, however, said that Mr Kang causes him to lose “a few hundred yuan” each time he goes to the venue. He further stated that the live-streamer can drink 20 or 30 bottles of soy milk and consumes an entire plate of pork trotters. “And for prawns, usually people use tongs to pick them up, he (the live streamer) uses a tray to take them all,” he added.The owner said that going ahead, he is banning all live-streamers from his restaurant.Meanwhile, the news of Mr Kang getting blacklisted from the Handadi Buffet has garnered over 250 million views on Weibo – one of China’s biggest micro-blogging sites. There, however, have been mixed reactions to the story with some viewers saying that the restaurant should not be an all-you-can-eat place if the owner cannot afford it, while others feeling bad for Mr Kang.Mr Kang is one of multiple eating influencers in Asia – a trend that has gained massive popularity over the last decade.The Chinese government has lately been clamping down on eating influencers, with President Xi Jinping emphasising on fighting against “food waste” as its crisis remains an increasing concern for the world’s most populous country.According to a BBC report, following President Jinping’s message on food waste, social-media companies commenced taking action against eating influencers. Now, people searching for keywords such as ‘eating livestream’ or ‘eating slow’ are being shown warning notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-live-streamer-banned-from-all-you-can-eat-restaurant-for-eating-too-much-101637395699922.html

20-11-2021||World||Japan to hold Quad summit next year, Taiwan is the focus||Japan has agreed to host a meeting of the Quad next year - the second in-person meeting of the group - the White House's Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell said on Friday. The four-nation group, technically called the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, comprises of the United States, India, Australia and Japan.It is a bloc of countries positioning itself as a check against China's growing aggression in the Indo-Pacific and outside.Speaking at an event of Washington-based think tank US Institute of Peace, Campbell did not explain in detail the type of Quad meeting to be hosted by Japan in 2022. However, Japan Times reported that it could be held as early as next spring.Campbell also said that India is a "critical and crucial" member of the Quad and that Washington is determined to build relations with New Delhi. "I'm very bullish about the future with India. I think we all recognise that the critical, crucial member in the Quad is India," Campbell said at the event.He added that India will be a key fulcrum player on the global stage in the 21st century and along with Vietnam and a few others, tops the list of critical countries that will define the future of Asia.Talking about China, the White House official said that the United States' expanded cooperation with partners is causing China "heartburn" and Chinese President Xi Jinping made clear to President Joe Biden in a virtual meeting on Monday that Washington's work to bolster ties with allies represented Cold War thinking.The announcement about Quad meeting coincided with a State Department statement that the US will hold a session of an economic dialogue with Taiwan in the face of increasing pressure on the island from China. The State Department said that US under secretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, Jose Fernandez, will lead the second US-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue on Monday.This is a part of increased US engagement with Taipei to the anger of Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own.If the Quad summit takes place, it will be the first time for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who took office in October, to attend such the gathering, and will give a chance to Joe Biden to make his first visit to Japan as US President, Japan Times reported, quoting sources.The first in-person Quad summit was held in Washington in September this year, where leaders of the four countries committed to a "free and open Indo-Pacific".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-hold-quad-summit-next-year-taiwan-is-the-focus-101637378511426.html
20-11-2021||World||Lockdown in play again as European nations witness worrying rise in Covid cases||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic seems to be rearing its ugly head in Europe as Austria has already announced its plan to reimpose a full lockdown while neighbouring Germany has warned it may follow suit. On Friday, Austria reported 15,809 fresh infections, an all-time high, prompting the government to announce new restrictions. It will be Austria’s fourth nationwide lockdown since the beginning of the pandemic last year."We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated," Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. "It hurts that such measures still have to be taken."Austria’s plan to impose a 10-day lockdown from Monday and mandatory vaccination for citizens starting February 1 has infuriated many, triggering objections from the far-right Freedom Party."As of today, Austria is a dictatorship," Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with this inscription.Meanwhile, a fourth Covid wave has plunged Germany into a national emergency and vaccinations alone, according to health minister Jens Spahn, will not cut the infections. Spahn’s warning suggests that lockdown measures may be on cards for Germany, Europe's largest economy. During a news conference, Spahn was asked whether Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown."We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out,” Spahn replied. "We are in a national emergency.”With Europe becoming the global epicentre of the pandemic again, some countries are clamping down on the unvaccinated. The Netherlands government has proposed excluding negative tests from the national health pass, allowing only vaccination or recovery from infection, reported Bloomberg.As protests in the Netherlands over the Covid curbs turned violent on Friday night, the Dutch police fired warning shots and deployed a water cannon to push back the crowd. The police said in a statement that two people were injured “related to the fired shots”, without providing further details about the injuries and ammunition used in the firing.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-in-play-again-as-european-nations-witness-worrying-rise-in-covid-cases-101637376184534.html
20-11-2021||World||Tesla worker alleges women face ‘rampant sexual harassment’ in lawsuit||Tesla Inc.’s female employees face “rampant sexual harassment,” according to a lawsuit by a woman who works in the electric carmaker’s Fremont, California, factory.Jessica Barraza, 38, said in a complaint filed Thursday in state court in Oakland that she experienced “nightmarish” conditions as a night-shift worker at Tesla, with co-workers and supervisors making lewd comments and gestures to her and other women multiple times a week. When she complained to supervisors and human resources, they failed to take action, Barraza says.She suffers from panic attacks as a result of three years of such behavior and “is afraid to return to work knowing that her body could be violated at any time with no repercussions,” according to the complaint. “She is on medication and in therapy, and she is not the same person she used to be.”Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Barraza’s suit was reported earlier by The Washington Post.The case comes as Tesla is already facing what it called a “staggering” $137 million jury verdict in favor of a former contract worker who said he experienced pervasive racism at the Fremont factory. Tesla is now challenging that award.A juror in that case told Bloomberg News that the panel hoped to prod Tesla executives to “take the most basic preventative measures and precautions they neglected to take as a large corporation to protect any employee within their factory.” Tesla has been dogged by allegations of discrimination at its Fremont plant for years, but most employees are bound by arbitration agreements that keep cases confidential. For two years, Tesla investors have tried to compel the company to disclose more information about how it uses arbitration with employees via a shareholder resolution. Each time, the company’s board was opposed to the effort, and the resolution failed to get enough votes to pass despite growing support.“Tesla has carved out the right to go to court on the claims that are important to them while prohibiting employees from doing the same,” David A. Lowe, an attorney for Barraza and partner at Rudy Exelrod Zieff & Lowe, said about Tesla’s use of arbitration. Barraza’s case is “so important on the merits,” he said. “It’s such an egregious and compelling situation that Jessica describes.”Other women have filed complaints about their experience working at Tesla. Rebecca Spates, a Black woman who joined Tesla in June 2019 through a staffing agency, alleged in a lawsuit she was subject to discrimination over her race, gender and age. Among other claims, Spate complained to management about a co-worker touching her buttocks, according to the complaint filed in September in Alameda County Superior Court. Ex-Tesla Employee Called Racial Slur Wins Rare $1 Million AwardIn 2020, 31 complaints were filed with California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging discrimination at Tesla on the basis of race, age, gender expression, disability and pregnancy, according to data obtained from public records. The state agency issued right-to-sue letters in a majority of the cases; a handful were closed with insufficient evidence.The case is Barraza v. Tesla, 21-cv-2714, Superior Court of California, Alameda County.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-worker-alleges-women-face-rampant-sexual-harassment-in-lawsuit-101637373203550.html

The incident took place at Rotterdam; however, it is not clear what type of ammunition was used by the police, the Mail report said.It quoted the local media to further say that 20 people were arrested.The Rotterdam Police said that protesters lit fire in one of the city's main shopping streets, prompting the cops to fire water cannons to disperse the demostrators."A demonstration on the Coolsingel resulted in riots. Fires have been set in various places, fireworks are set off and the police have fired several (warning) shots. The police are present in large numbers and are trying to restore order. The ME has been deployed," the Rotterdam Police said on Twitter.Several videos of the police firing in Rotterdam emerged on social media soon after the incident. One of them shows a person being shot, but its authenticity is yet to be ascertained.The police said on Twitter that it's unclear how, or by whom, the person was shot.There is rising anger among the people as a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity due to increasing cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Austria has already announced a full lockdown, while the Netherlands has resorted to partial lockdown. There are restrictions on unvaccinated people in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns.Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rotterdam-police-open-fire-as-protest-over-covid-curbs-turns-violent-7-injured-101637372256102.html
20-11-2021||World||Checkup finds Biden fit for duty; Kamala Harris briefly in power||President Joe Biden remains “healthy” and “vigorous” and fit for duty, but is showing some signs of aging, his doctor said Friday after the oldest president in American history underwent his first routine physical in office and — in a history-making moment — briefly transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris while he underwent a colonoscopy.Harris, the first woman, first Black person and first person of South Asian descent to be vice president, was — for one hour and 25 minutes — acting president while Biden was under anesthesia.Over more than five hours Friday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the president underwent a battery of blood, physical, gastrointestinal, dental, vision and neurological examinations. Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who has been Biden’s primary care physician since 2009, wrote in a six-page memo released by the White House that Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, “remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.”O’Connor, however, revealed that he investigated Biden for increased instances of “throat clearing” during public remarks and a stiffening of his gait. O’Connor reported that Biden’s coughing was the result of gastrointestinal reflux and that the stiffened gait was the result of a new diagnosis of “mild peripheral neuropathy,” spinal arthritis and compensation for a broken foot sustained a year ago.Interest in Biden’s health has been high ever since he declared his candidacy for the White House in 2019 and remains intense as speculation about a 2024 reelection bid swirls. The visit to the medical center in the Washington suburbs was for his first routine physical exam as president — and his first since December 2019.As part of the screening, Biden underwent an “extremely detailed neurological exam” that ruled out stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but caught the neuropathy, which is nerve damage in the hands and feet. O’Connor said the most common cause of the condition is diabetes, but Biden is not diabetic. Biden, he said, would soon try custom orthotics to improve his gait.During the course of Biden's colonoscopy a “benign-appearing polyp” of about 3 millimeters was identified and removed and would be studied over the coming week. O’Connor said Biden has never had colon cancer.Biden's reported body mass index classified him as slightly overweight, but his cholesterol was under control. Biden, O'Connor said, is prescribed the anticoagulant Eliquis, the statin Crestor and the seasonal allergy spray Dymista, and regularly takes the over-the-counter allergy pill Allegra and the antacid Pepcid.O'Connor reported that Biden does not use tobacco products or drink alcohol and that he exercises at least five days per week.Press secretary Jen Psaki said he resumed his duties after speaking with Harris and White House chief of staff Ron Klain at approximately 11:35 a.m.As Biden left the medical center in the afternoon, he said he was feeling “Great!”“Great physical and a great House of Representatives vote,” he said, referring to the House passage of his roughly $2 trillion social and environmental agenda.After arriving back at the White House, he said “Nothing’s changed” with his health, joking, "We’re in great shape, and I’m looking forward to celebrating my 58th birthday.”While serving as acting president Harris was working from her office in the West Wing, Psaki said. She later traveled to Ohio once Biden awoke from the procedure.Biden was keenly aware of the history he was making when he selected Harris to be his running mate, Psaki said, adding that she made “history every day” in the job.“Today was certainly another chapter in that history I think that will be noted for women, young girls across the country," she added.During Biden's last physical exam, doctors found the former vice president to be “healthy, vigorous” and “fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency," according to a doctor’s report at the time.In that report, O’Connor said that since 2003, Biden has had episodes of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that’s potentially serious but treatable. At the time, O’Connor cited a list of tests that showed Biden’s heart was functioning normally and his only needed care was a blood thinner to prevent the most worrisome risk, blood clots or stroke.Biden had a brush with death in 1988, requiring surgery to repair two brain aneurysms, weak bulges in arteries, one of them leaking. Biden has never had a recurrence, his doctor said, citing a test in 2014 that examined his arteries.Dr. Jeffrey Linder, chief of general internal medicine and geriatrics at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, read the White House report and said it contained nothing that’s particularly worrisome.“All in all, according to this report it seems like he’s in pretty good shape, with very common age-related illness,’’ including atrial fibrillation and stiff gait, Linder said.While the cause of Biden’s mild neuropathy is unknown, Linder said it is not an unusual problem and not a cause for concern unless it’s bothersome for the president. He added that there is no reason to think the small polyp that was removed was cancerous, given Biden’s previous medical history.“I would encourage him to continue to get exercise and eat right and take his medications,’’ Linder said.Pursuant to the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Biden signed letters to Sen. Patrick Leahy, who's president pro tempore of the Senate, and to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at 10:10 a.m., saying he would be unable to discharge his duties while under anesthesia, making Harris the acting president. Biden sent them each another letter upon the conclusion of the procedure to resume his duties at 11:35 a.m.“As was the case when President George W. Bush had the same procedure in 2002 and 2007, and following the process set out in the Constitution, President Biden will transfer power to the Vice President for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia,” Psaki said before Biden’s colonoscopy.On Friday afternoon, Biden took part in the annual pardoning of the national Thanksgiving turkey.When Biden took office he brought O’Connor back to the White House to continue serving as his doctor, and O'Connor led a team of experts in conducting Biden's physical exam Friday.Once the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, Biden’s team took intense steps to keep the then-candidate and now-president healthy as the virus raged and took a disproportionate toll among older populations. Biden received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in December 2020 and his second dose just two weeks before taking office. He received a booster dose, which regulators say provides more enduring protection, in late September.Former President Donald Trump, 75, was sharply criticized for releasing only cursory details on his health while running and serving in the White House, including concealing the seriousness of his Covid-19 illness a month before the 2020 presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/checkup-finds-biden-vigorous-kamala-harris-briefly-in-power-101637371243052.html
20-11-2021||World||Beijing Olympics: US considers diplomatic boycott over alleged human rights abuses||President Joe Biden said on Thursday he was considering a US diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, in what would be an attempt to show toughness over China’s rights abuses without impacting US athletes.That is “something we are considering”, Biden told reporters while meeting with Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at the White House. The Beijing Olympics take place next February.Biden’s comments followed a long-awaited video summit with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping late on Monday, during which the two leaders said they wanted to ensure stability and prevent accidental conflicts.The US president is under pressure at home to speak out on China’s human rights abuses, especially in the Xinjiang region where the US government says repression of the Uighur ethnic group qualifies as genocide.China’s foreign ministry on Friday brushed off the rights accusations as “inconsistent with the truth and completely groundless”, calling Washington’s claims a “joke in the eyes of Chinese people”.Lithuania will ‘pay for what it did’: ChinaChina on Friday said Lithuania will “pay for what it did”, a day after the Baltic nation allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in the capital.“Lithuania only has itself to blame, it will have to pay for what it did,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Friday.China’s reaction came after Lithuania allowed Taipei to open a representative office in the capital, Vilnius, ignoring Beijing’s strong opposition. China claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as a breakaway region to be reunified by force if required.Only 15 countries have direct diplomatic ties with Taiwan, prompting China to say those countries violate the “one China” policy under which only the mainland is recognised formally.Agency reports from Taipei quoted the Taiwanese foreign ministry as saying that the opening of the office would “charter a new and promising course” for Taiwan-Lithuania ties.US warns China on action against PhilippinesThe US on Friday accused China of an escalation against the Philippines and warned that an armed attack would invite a US response after an incident in disputed waters.“The United States stands with our ally, the Philippines, in the face of this escalation that directly threatens regional peace and stability,” state department spokesman Ned Price said.(With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-olympics-us-considers-diplomatic-boycott-over-alleged-human-rights-abuses-101637358648975.html

Most stores will close, and cultural events will be cancelled. He initially said all students would have to go back into home schooling.Starting on February 1, the country will also make vaccinations mandatory, public broadcaster ORF reported.“We do not want a fifth wave,” Schallenberg said, according to ORF. “Not do we want a sixth or seventh wave.”Austria had initially introduced a national lockdown only for the unvaccinated that started on Monday, but as virus cases continued to skyrocket the government said it had no choice but to extend it to everyone.“This is very painful,” Schallenberg said.Roughly two-thirds of Austria’s population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe.Its infections are among the highest on the continent, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people.“We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,” Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference.With cold weather setting in across Europe as winter approaches, governments have been forced to consider reimposing unpopular lockdowns. The Netherlands has reimposed a partial lockdown, with bars and restaurants closing at 8pm.Germany may impose lockdown for vaccinatedGermany’s coronavirus situation is so grave that a lockdown, including people who have been vaccinated, cannot be ruled out, the health minister said on Friday. “We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can’t rule anything out,” acting health minister Jens Spahn saidGermany reported 52,970 new coronavirus cases and 201 deaths on Friday, bringing total deaths to 98,739.Russian authorities on Friday reported a record number of deaths for the third day in a row. Russia’s state coronavirus task force reported 1,254 virus deaths, up 1,251 on Thursday and 1,247 on Wednesday.Norwegian officials said on Friday the country is introducing stricter controls at border crossings, requiring everyone to register before entering the country, in a bid to tackle the rise in Covid cases.Travellers from the UK who have gotten their third coronavirus vaccine dose will now be able to prove their status through the National Health Service’s Covid app. The change, effective on Friday, will allow travellers to enter countries including Israel, Croatia and Austria that have set time limits for the vaccines to be valid for travel without quarantining, the UK government said.“We want to make it as easy as possible for people to show their vaccine status if they are travelling abroad,” health and social care secretary Sajid Javid said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/western-europe-battles-covid-surge-101637356818858.html
20-11-2021||World||US House advances Biden's expansive social and environment bill, Senate awaits||US lawmakers voted Friday to elevate President Joe Biden's giant social welfare bill to the Senate, in a major step forward for his vision for a more equitable society that is the centerpiece of his domestic agenda.US lawmakers voted Friday to elevate President Joe Biden's giant social welfare bill to the Senate, in a major step forward for his vision for a more equitable society that is the centerpiece of his domestic agenda.|#+|Build Back Better – Biden's potentially legacy-defining package of education, health care, childcare, and climate reforms – was green-lit by the House four days after the president signed off on the first part of his economic blueprint, a sweeping upgrade of the country's crumbling infrastructure.The $1.8 trillion measure is likely to get a bumpier ride in the upper chamber, with the Democrats' deficit hawks jittery over spiraling inflation – before it gets a final rubber stamp in the House, likely in December or January."We have a Build Back Better bill that is historic, transformative, and larger than anything we have ever done before," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor ahead of the vote."We are building back better... We all agree that we have a moral responsibility to our children, to their future, to pass on the planet in a responsible way. So we are proud to be passing this legislation, under the leadership of President Joe Biden."Pelosi had hoped to vote on the measure late Thursday but Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy halted the action by breaking her record for the longest House floor speech, clocking in at more than eight-and-a-half hours.Under House rules the party leaders are allowed a courtesy "magic minute," meaning they can be recognized to speak for as long as they wish while the rank and file get just 60 seconds.The breakthrough vote in the House came as Biden was set to transfer power to Vice President Kamala Harris while he underwent a colonoscopy under anesthesia as part of a regular health check.Rambling addressMcCarthy finally yielded the floor at 5:11 am after beginning speaking at 8:38 pm Thursday, in a rambling address that appeared as much about pushing talking points to his members as it was an effort to change any minds on the bill.The legislation would provide millions of jobs, according to the White House, although Republicans have characterized it as an example of wildly out-of-control Democratic spending.It will likely be watered down in the upper chamber, however, where Democrats have the narrowest of majorities and moderates are voicing concerns over Biden's spending plans.Annual inflation jumped to 6.2 percent last month, giving Republicans another cudgel to bash Biden with as they bid to retake both chambers of Congress in next year's midterm elections.House Democrats would have lost the party-line vote had there been more than three defectors.In the end only one Democrat -- from a competitive district in Maine --- joined the Republicans in rejecting the bill, boosting the majority party's hopes that members in both chambers can overcome months of infighting to get the package signed into law.The prospect of a vote ahead of next week's Thanksgiving recess had initially looked slim, with a handful of centrist Democrats demanding a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office to clarify the cost of the package before they will agree to vote.That came Thursday evening, with the CBO saying Build Back Better would boost the deficit by $367 billion over 10 years.‘Craptacular mess’This might normally be a problem for the Democrats' fiscal conservatives, but they were largely assuaged by White House officials pointing out that the estimate does not include savings that could be made through tougher taxation enforcement.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement that Build Back Better was "fully paid for," and would help reduce the deficit in the long run via reforms "that ask the wealthiest Americans and large corporations to pay their fair share."Senate insiders expect the bill to be taken up by the upper chamber in late December or possibly January, with more urgent priorities such as avoiding a debt default and a government shutdown expected to take up much of the holiday period.The Senate has been locked in a 50-50 split for one of the longest periods in its history, and, with no votes to spare, every Democrat effectively has a veto on any bill as long as Republicans stick together.Senate progressives are pushing for a national paid family leave program and a bigger expansion of health care benefits, but the latest inflation data could harm those efforts.Senator Ben Sasse led the Senate Republicans' criticism of the bill ahead of the vote, labeling it a “craptacular mess” that will lead to “a million more annual IRS audits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-advances-biden-s-expansive-social-and-environment-bill-senate-awaits-101637334856073.html
20-11-2021||World||China conducted hypersonic weapons test, sent missile around the world: Report||China conducted a hypersonic weapons test in July by sending a missile around the world at more than five times the speed of sound. The details of the test were shared by General John Hyten, the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the United States.“They launched a long-range missile. It went around the world, dropped off a hypersonic glide vehicle that glided all the way back to China, and impacted a target in China,” Hyten, the second highest-ranking American military officer, said while speaking to news agency CBS News.Hyten said that China may one day be able to launch a surprise nuclear attack on the US. He said that the missile may have missed its mark but it was close enough to hitting its target.A report by Financial Times said that the missile missed its target by several kilometres but it was the first time any nation tested a hypersonic missile around the planet. Hypersonic weapons travel more than five times the speed of sound which poses a challenge for radars trying to detect them.Hyten said the missiles are a ‘ first-use weapon' and added that China carried out hundreds of hypersonic tests, while the US has conducted just nine. He also said that the US did not field a hypersonic weapon but China deployed one medium-range hypersonic weapon.China downplayed the claims while confirming the test on October 18. It said that it was a ‘spacecraft and not a missile’. “As we understand, this was a routine test of spacecraft to verify technology of spacecraft's reusability. It is of great significance to reducing the cost of using spacecraft and providing a convenient and cheap way for mankind's two-way transportation in the peaceful use of space. Several companies around the world have conducted similar tests. It's not a missile, but a spacecraft,” Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, was quoted as saying by news agencies earlier last month.The Pentagon earlier this month said that China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-conducted-hypersonic-weapons-test-sent-missile-around-the-world-report-101637324307809.html

While interacting with media here, Madani said, “It’s believed that Laws (Farm Laws) were repealed as polls are close. We think that (CAA-NRC) is concerned with nationality and Muslims will have to bear its brunt. Power of public strongest, so this (CAA) should also be repealed.” He congratulated the farmers who continued their protest, and said, “Similarly, we want the government to roll back the Act that is going to hurt Muslims. They too are citizens of India just like others. If they’re affected, the government should feel it in a similar manner.”Farmers have been protesting the Centre’s three farm laws since they were passed in 2020.Similarly, protests had erupted in parts of the country against the CAA. The CAA allows persecuted minorities belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi, and Christian communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan to avail of Indian citizenship.According to the provisions of the act, people belonging to these communities who arrived in India till December 31, 2014, due to religious persecution in these three countries will not be treated as illegal migrants but will be provided with Indian citizenship.If a person belongs to the aforementioned faiths, from these three countries, does not have proof of birth of parents, they can apply for Indian citizenship after six years of residence in India.President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the legislation on December 12, 2019.The Opposition parties and several groups have protested against the implementation of CAA. CAA’s detractors believe that the law coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise is intended to target the minorities in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-farm-laws-caa-should-be-rolled-back-101637428886842.html

Gehlot convened a meeting of his council of ministers at his residence and the members were asked to tender their resignations to facilitate cabinet rejig. After the meeting, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariywas said, “All the ministers have tendered their resignation as directed by the party.” He added that all the ministers will be going to the state party office on Sunday and then move as per directions from the CM.The clamour for a Cabinet reshuffle had been growing for the past several months, with the Sachin Pilot camp seeking to accommodate supporters of the state’s former deputy chief minister. On Friday, three ministers -- Govind Singh Dotasara, Raghu Sharma and Harish Choudhary -- wrote to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, offering to quit their posts and work for the party. Their resignations were on expected lines as they were holding dual positions – health minister Raghu Sharma is AICC incharge of Gujarat; revenue minister Choudhary is AICC incharge of Punjab; and education minister, Dotasara, is the state party chief. AICC general secretary incharge for Rajasthan Ajay Maken, who arrived in Jaipur on Friday, was also present at the chief minister’s residence. Apart from the Congress MLAs, independents who support the government and MLAs who defected from the BSP to the Congress also have expectations from the reshuffle.

There can be a maximum of 30 members in the council of ministers in the state where the number of MLAs is 200. A minister on condition of anonymity said, “There were nine vacancies, and three submitted resignations yesterday, taking the tally to 12,” he said. Political analyst Manish Godha said asking for resignations from all the ministers means a major reshuffle of departments, promotion from state to cabinet rank, and also the possibility of being dropped from the cabinet. “This reshuffle is different from what Gehlot has done in his previous tenure as this time he has to discuss the changes with the high command. Even today his statement in a meeting saying that only Maken and the high command know what is going to happen in the rejig – this indicates that he does not have a free hand,” Godha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-rajasthan-ministers-resign-pave-way-for-cabinet-reshuffle-101637428830946.html

20-11-2021||India||Bengal starts door-to-door survey to identify those who missed second vaccine dose||The West Bengal government has started a house-to-house survey to identify people who haven’t taken their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in time. There are around 1.8 million such people in the state, officials said. “We have started a house-to-house survey with the help of ASHA worker to identify people who have not taken their second dose. They will be encouraged to take their second dose as it is overdue,” said Ajoy Chakraborty, director of health services in West Bengal. Till date at least 1.8 million people in West Bengal haven’t taken their second dose on time. The maximum number of such cases has been reported from Alipurduar district in north Bengal where around 218,000 cases are overdue followed by 140,000 cases in Hooghly district. In Kolkata around 108,400 people have not taken their second doses. The gap between the first and second dose of the vaccine is 12 weeks in the case of Covishield and four weeks in the case of Covaxin. Almost 90% of doses administered so far in the country are of the first. Two doses of a vaccine are required for adequate protection against severe infection and hospitalisation, especially those caused by mutant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. “Among the people who haven’t taken their second dose a large portion comprise migrant labourers and central force personnel. Several central force personnel who had come to the state during assembly elections took their first dose here. Later they went back. Similarly migrant labourers who had returned to West Bengal took the first dose here and went back to the states where they work,” said Chakraborty. In October, the Union health ministry had written to several states, including West Bengal, which emerged laggards in administering the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, asking them to address the issue on priority. “We have stepped up the drive to administer the second dose. On November 16, while the number of first doses given was 241,568, the number of second doses given was 290,145. In October the number of overdue cases was more than 3.2 million. It has come down now,” said the official. At vaccination centres a separate queue is being maintained for those who are coming for their second dose to make it more hassle-free. Every day West Bengal is registering more than 800 new cases. The daily count of Covid-19 cases has shot up after the festive season. “Covid-19 safety protocols were rampantly flouted during the festive season. Many were not wearing masks, leaving aside social distancing and sanitizing,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, member of the expert committee that was set up in 2020 to advise chief minister Mamata Banerjee on pandemic-related matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-starts-door-to-door-survey-to-identify-those-who-missed-second-vaccine-dose-101637421206305.html

20-11-2021||India||Centre writes to Ladakh, Puducherry as Covid-19 cases see spurt||Owing to a rise in weekly cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), its testing and positivity rate, the Union health and family welfare ministry has written to the administration of the Union territories (UTs) of Ladakh and Puducherry, urging them to adopt pre-emptive action to tackle the situation.In a letter to the principal secretary (health) of Ladakh this week, additional secretary of Union health ministry Arti Ahuja said the Union territory has witnessed a 362% rise in weekly cases — from only 34 cases in the week ending on October 27 to as many as 157 in the one concluding on November 17.“Leh district has exhibited a significant increase of more than 362% in weekly new cases from 35 in the week ending on October 27 to 139 in the week ending on November 17. This is especially concerning given the geographical expanse of the district,” Ahuja wrote in the letter, according to news agency PTI.Also Read | Jammu and Kashmir sees two-fold rise in Covid deaths in NovemberThe government official also noted that the “basic public health strategy” of testing, tracking, treatment, covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination is “not followed rigorously.”“The current trends of decrease in RT-PCR testing, increase in new cases and case positivity if left unchecked may lead to a situation where there is severe strain on the health infrastructure and health workforce,” Ahuja’s letter added.Also Read | Night curfew in Jammu amid rising Covid-19 positivity rateAs far as Puducherry is concerned, the senior government official stated in the letter that the Union territory has recorded a 41.7% rise in weekly cases and the positivity rate has been prominent in multiple districts of the region.Karaikal, Yanam, Mahe and Pondicherry have specifically shown a sharp rise in weekly fresh infections. “All four districts Karaikal (27.45%), Mahe (1.59%), Pondicherry (32.57%) and Yanam (0.59%) have less RT-PCR contribution than the government mandate of 70%,” the PTI report added, quoting Ahuja’s letter.What steps have been suggested to the Puducherry and Ladakh administrations?1. Strict compliance with the basic health strategy, which includes “routine submission of RT-PCR positive samples” from foreign travelers and also from the community for genomic analysis at the designated INSACOG network labs.2. Collection of positive samples from suspected vaccine breakthrough infections, super-spreader events and clusters of cases, which have high mortality and/or morbidity rate, and sending them to labs.3. Maintaining sufficient level of Covid-19 testing for “timely detection of cases” across all districts, especially because the festive event is ongoing along with marriages.4. Prioritising second dose of Covid-19 vaccination and also strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour5. Daily review of Covid-19 cases and fatalities and promptly communicating “necessary corrective measures” to the concerned teams across the UT.6. Consistency in updating information pertaining to Covid-19 should be maintained by all districts of both Ladakh and Puducherry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-writes-to-ladakh-puducherry-as-covid-19-cases-see-spurt-101637419560924.html
20-11-2021||India||Farm unions say won’t end agitation until all demands met||Farm unions on Saturday said they would continue their agitation across states until all their “rightful demands”, including a law that guarantees minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce, were met by the Modi government. The farmers’ resolution comes a day after the Modi government said it would repeal the three farm laws cultivators say will jeopardise their livelihoods. A statement from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella platform for farm unions, said cultivators would gather in Lucknow in thousands for a mahapanchayat on November 22 to demand a legal guarantee on MSP. An MSP is a floor rate for farm produce meant to help avoid distress sale. The SKM also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for skipping any comment on the MSP issue, while announcing his decision on Friday to roll back the farm laws in a nationally televised speech. “While the Prime Minister of India announced his Government’s decision to repeal 3 black farm laws, he chose to remain silent on the pending demands of farmers,” a joint statement of key farm unions said. The SKM also demanded sacking of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni. The minister’s son had been arrested after his vehicle ploughed through farmers returning from a protest in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri. Eight people were killed in the incident. The farm unions said, besides a law on MSPs, they want all cases filed against farmers to be withdrawn unconditionally. Farmers will join in large numbers at all protest sites on the first anniversary of the farmers’ agitation on November 26, the SKM said. The farmers’ demonstrations at toll plazas and near Parliament for the entire duration of the winter session beginning November 29 will be held as planned, the farm unions said. On November 28, farm unions are also slated to hold a massive rally at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan under the banner of Samyukta Shetkari Kamgar Morcha, where over 100 farm and labour organisations will participate. In his speech to the nation on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government would repeal all three agricultural laws enacted last year that had set off tough protests and street battles by tens of thousands of farmers. The laws the government said would be annulled were aimed to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce, allow food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on a written agreement. Farm unions say the legislation would leave them at the mercy of large corporations, leaving them with little bargaining power. The decision to scrap the laws comes ahead of crucial state elections in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous, bellwether state, and Punjab, where farmers are an influential voting bloc. “The Modi Government has refused to acknowledge the high human cost that was imposed on the protestors due to its adamant and egoistic behaviour,” the SKM said in its fresh resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-say-won-t-end-agitation-until-all-demands-met-101637419766066.html
20-11-2021||India||Merely being in love doesn’t count as consent for sex, rules Kerala high court||While hearing a petition of a rape convict, the Kerala high court said that merely being in love with someone cannot be presumed as the victim’s consent for sexual intercourse, according to news agency PTI.In his order, Justice R Narayana Pisharadi said helplessness in the face of compulsion cannot be seen as one’s consent. He added that there is a massive difference between consent and submission, and every consent involves a submission but the converse does not follow.“Exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the significance and the moral effect of the act is required for consent,” PTI reported, citing the court order.The hearing was on an appeal by one Syam Sivan, 26, who was convicted and subsequently sentenced by a trial court under multiple sections of the IPC, including section 376 that deals with rape. According to the PTI report, the court in its order noted that in 2013, Syam took a girl – with whom he was in a relationship with — to Mysuru in Karnataka and had sexual intercourse with her without consent. It also noted that the convict sold all her gold ornaments, took her to Goa and then raped her again, saying he would commit suicide in front of her house if she didn’t go with him.The court further stated that even if on certain occasions, the victim didn’t resist Syam, it cannot be considered as her consent for the sexual intercourse but only a “passive submission…under unavoidable circumstances” since she had “no other option.”In its judgement, the Kerala high court, however, set aside the trial court’s conviction under the POCSO act handed out to the convict as the victim’s age could not be ascertained. However, the order of Justice Pisharadi said the accused’s act clearly comprises offences punishable under Section 366 and 376 of the IPC (Abduction and rape).This judgement by the Kerala high court comes two days after the Supreme Court on Thursday set aside the Bombay high court’s controversial order, which stated skin-to-skin contact was necessary to punish individuals accused of sexually assaulting minors. The high court acquitted a man of sexual assault charges for no ‘skin-to-skin’ contact in the case of groping a 12-year-old child.The apex court, however, said the most significant element to punish an accused under the POCSO Act is “sexual intent” and not “skin-to-skin” contact. It also ordered the accused to surrender within four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/merely-being-in-love-doesn-t-count-as-consent-for-sex-rules-kerala-high-court-101637419057439.html

20-11-2021||India||Rebel Cong MLA says Priyanka Gandhi ‘politicised’ issues in Uttar Pradesh||Rebel Congress MLA Aditi Singh said as far as the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and other issues were concerned, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the grand old party's Uttar Pradesh in-charge, has always “politicised” it. Highlighting that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has launched an investigation into the incident and the Supreme Court has taken cognisance of it, Singh pointed a question at Priyanka Gandhi: “If she doesn't trust these institutions, who does she trust?”As far as other issues are concerned, Singh said, a similar incident was demonstrated with the fiasco over the farm bills. “Priyanka Gandhi had a problem when the bills were brought, she had a problem even after the laws (the farm laws) have been repealed. What does she want? She should say it clearly,” asked Aditi Singh.Aditi Singh said that this sort of thing happens when people only want to politicise a certain matter. “She has now run out of issues to politicise,” the rebel Congress MLA reasoned.Notably, the incidents she is referring to include the violence that erupted in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 when farmers were protesting the visit of Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra's native place. Four agitating farmers were run over by a vehicle while four others, including a journalist, two BJP workers were also killed in the violence that ensued.Priyanka Gandhi took personal stock of the situation and said that she had met the family members of the deceased farmers and that they are in tremendous pain. A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the repeal of the farm laws, Priyanka also urged the premier not to share the stage with Ajay Mishra, Union minister, keeping in mind farmers' interest.She also sought the removal of Mishra from his post over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which his son is accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-cong-mla-says-priyanka-gandhi-politicised-issues-in-uttar-pradesh-101637415142382.html
20-11-2021||India||‘Send your children to the border, then call Pak PM big brother’: Gambhir's dig at Sidhu||Cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir on Saturday criticised Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu over his comments where he called Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan his ‘big brother’.“Send your son or daughter to the border and then call a terrorist state’s head your big brother,” Gambhir said in a tweet using the hashtags ‘spineless’ and ‘disgusting’.Earlier in the day, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday during his visit to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan called the Pakistan prime minister his ‘elder brother’. “Imran Khan is my elder brother. I am greatly honoured. He gave us a lot of love,” Sidhu was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“I am thankful to Imran Khan for taking the first step and on the other side India responded with two steps. I already said that those favouring the corridor would have blessings and those opposing it had no value,” Sidhu said, further adding that both nations should resume trade ties. “ I request Modi sahab and Khan sahab to open the doors. Trade has a $275,000 crore potential,” Sidhu further added.Sidhu’s comments brought widespread condemnation from leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with some leaders asking if Congress leaders see Khan in the same light. The party spokesperson Sambit Patra said Congress considers Islamic State and Boko Haram ideologies to be akin to those of Hindutva but finds ‘bhai jaan’ in Khan. Akali Dal leader Daljit Singh Cheema called Sidhu's comment a ‘publicity stunt’ and said that it should be ignored.Sidhu’s remarks also angered his own party’s parliamentarian Manish Tewari as well. “Imran Khan may be anybody's elder brother but for India he is that cat's paw of Pakistan’s deep state ISI-military combine that drones arms and narcotics into Punjab and sends terrorists on a daily basis across LoC in Jammu and Kashmir. Have we forgotten the martyrdom of our soldiers in Poonch so soon?” Tiwari said in a tweet.Punjab minister Pargat Singh came to Sidhu’s rescue and questioned why the Punjab Congress chief is called a ‘traitor’ desh drohi whenever he visits Pakistan. “When PM Modi goes to Pakistan) he is a 'Desh Premi', when Sidhu visits he is 'Desh Drohi'. Can't I call you a brother? We follow Guru Nanak Dev's philosophy,” Pargat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/send-your-children-to-the-border-then-call-pak-pm-big-brother-gambhir-s-dig-at-sidhu-101637415890076.html

For this, we will hold discussions with the leaders of all political parties so that the proceedings of the House are carried out smoothly,” Birla said on Thursday while addressing the All India Presiding Officers' Conference, where a resolution was also passed under his chairmanship stating there should be no disruption during the presidential address and the motion of thanks.“We have to establish good traditions and conventions inside the legislatures, which will give dignity to our Houses and increase their prestige,” he further added. He also called for strengthening parliamentary committees to ensure ‘accountability of the executive’ and use their suggestions to make government policies more effective.Earlier, similar concerns were echoed by Union minister Anurag Thakur who said that discussions should be held in Parliament following decorum. “Papers can be torn up on the streets, but Parliament is meant for debate. We have to improve the quality of the debate,” Thakur said.The Winter Session, which will be the seventh session of the seventeenth Lok Sabha, will commence on November 29 and may conclude on December 23, according to a House notification. During the Monsoon Session, the opposition protests brought in several adjourned sessions as parties questioned the government over the alleged use of the Pegasus spyware on its leaders and others in the country and also the repeal of farm laws, a demand which the government has now accepted.The opposition, however, may still raise these issues along with issues related to Ladakh faceoff with China, the Rafale fighter jet deal and the ordinances providing for the extension of the terms of Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation chiefs.A report by HT showed that the Monsoon Session saw the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha function for 22% and 28% of their allocated time — lowest since the 2016 Winter Session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-expect-winter-session-to-function-smoothly-lok-sabha-speaker-om-birla-101637413425311.html

So far, there is no call to withdraw it. A decision on this is likely to be taken on Sunday after the SKM's core committee meeting,” Ugrahan said. Farmer leader Sudesh Goyat was sceptical about the repeal of the three laws despite the announcement made by the Prime Minister.“Farmers cannot trust the Centre on farm laws as earlier too they had announced to give one rank one pension (OROP) but it is yet to be done. So, we have decided not to leave the site till these laws are formally repealed in Parliament. Mobilisation of farmers on Delhi borders on November 26 to mark the first anniversary of the agitation will continue,” farmer leader Sudesh Goyat told news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-yet-to-withdraw-daily-tractor-march-to-parliament-during-winter-session-101637404038850.html

We are awaiting his decision and I am hopeful that he will make one by this (Saturday) evening and return Magray's body so his final rites could be performed. But in case he does not take a decision, the situation will compel us to go for protests," Shan told reporters in Ramban.According to the police, Magray was a militant and was killed along with his Pakistani associate and two others. However, Magray's father Abdul Latief refuted the police's claim and appealed to the L-G to ensure justice for the family.On Friday Latief met the deputy commissioner of Ramban seeking the return of his son's body.Additional District Magistrate of Ramban Harbans Lal Sharma on November 17 ordered imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in Magray's Famrote village, along with Sangaldan and Seripura, until further orders.Bodies of Mohammad Altaf Bhat and Mudasir Gul, two civilians killed in the Hyderpora encounter, were handed over to their kin on Thursday night after they were exhumed following protests by family members that they were innocent and not linked to militancy as claimed by the police.Police had initially buried them in the Handwara area of north Kashmir's Kupwara district."We are thankful to the Lt Governor for ordering a (magisterial) probe into the encounter and returning the bodies of two other civilians to their families. Let the government do its job to unveil the truth but let it also return Magray's body. The law is equal for all civilians," Shan said."We have already petitioned the deputy commissioner of Ramban. This (Magray's) family is nationalist, fought militancy and was awarded by the government for bravery besides giving a security cover. It is difficult to think their own son will be declared a terrorist," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderpora-official-fears-protests-if-third-victim-s-body-not-returned-to-kin-101637403499189.html

Urban development minister Bhupendra Singh Singh received the award in New Delhi on Saturday. Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) gave credit to sanitation workers as cleanliness was the biggest challenge during Covid-19.“During the Corona period, the sanitation workers kept the city clean working on sanitization, disposing of medical waste, setting up Covid care centres, covid testing and vaccination centre. The corporation employees properly disposed of medical waste. When the whole city sleeps, the corporation employees clean the city,” said Partibha Pal, commissioner municipal corporation, Indore. Pal also said that the IMC was looking at the pollution by taking care of dust as far as possible. “The roads and streets are being cleaned with machines by sprinkling water to settle the dust to control the air pollution. On every occasion whether it is Diwali or any other public function, sanitation workers made records of cleaning the city within hours,” she added.The major reason behind winning the award is the revival of 21.3 km Kans and 12.4 km Saraswati rivers by processing the sewage waste of 137.28 km. After 41 years, people saw clean rivers, said the commissioner. The 56-Dukan, a famous street for food, has been awarded to serve the cleanest street for food in India.“Now we are focusing on recycling and generating electricity with garbage. As of now, we are earning ₹20 crore from the disposal of garbage, composite fertilizers and CNG. Our focus is to increase the income to ₹100 crore from waste disposal,” said Pal Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan congratulated the public representatives and Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) for winning the title for the fifth time. Madhya Prades received 35 awards in different categories.

20-11-2021||India||Assam to be a ‘laboratory’ for mother tongue-based education in India: Dharmendra Pradhan||Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Saturday said that there are plans to make the state of Assam a “laboratory” for a unique “caste, tribe, and language-based education system”.Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the North-East Education Conclave 2021 in Guwahati, the Union minister said that all the northeastern states together inculcate as many as 180 languages – which makes Assam, a key state in the region ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), prime ground for implementing new educational measures.“The northeastern states have 180 regional languages and we want Assam to become a laboratory for a caste, tribe, language-based education system,” the minister was quoted as saying. “The government of India will prioritise every resource needed for this.”The diversity of languages cannot be witnessed better than in our NE region with about 180 languages being spoken by tribes residing here. The NEP has amplified the potential of language in education. Assam is going to be a laboratory for mother tongue-based education in India. pic.twitter.com/2QetCNkMz2Speaking of the North-East Education Conclave 2021, Pradhan said it is being held under the leadership of the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led Assam government and that multiple officials of the central and state governments alike are to conduct the two-day deliberation.The minister further added a word for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlighting the national education policy (NEP) implemented by the central government. “Prime Minister Modi has made the NEP a big instrument in the 21st-century transformative society,” Pradhan said, moments after inaugurating the programme in the presence of Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the state's education minister Ranoj Pegu, multiple ministers of the northeastern states, and other senior officials of the Assam education department.The Union minister said students are the greatest stakeholders in the national education policy, which was passed last year. “The NEP is focused on developing the desired learning competencies right from pre-primary, equipping students with 21st-century knowledge and skills, and preparing our youth to become global citizens.”Talking of Assam as a case in point, the Union education minister said that this might be the only state in India to spend as much as six per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on education. Moreover, considering the fact that bio-mass-based renewable energy has recently been of value in the northeastern region, the minister said that knowledge of such alternative sources of energy will be an integral part of the students' educational curriculum to expectedly pave the way for broader economic transformation.Assam chief minister Sarma thanked the Union education minister and Prime Minister Modi for their efforts to finalise a roadmap for the implementation of the NEP in the region. The chief minister said that the central policy will provide students with an opportunity to strive for “knowledge beyond their mark sheet”.The two-conclave in Guwahati has been organised by the education department of Assam and the Sankardav Education & Research Foundation to discuss the implementation of the NEP. Multiple officials of the education department, other state and central government officials, and multiple academicians were present at the inauguration ceremony, informed the Assam chief minister's office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-be-a-laboratory-for-mother-tongue-based-education-in-india-dharmendra-pradhan-101637399696469.html

Of these, more than 216.5 million jabs remain unutilized and are still available with the states and union territories, the Union health ministry said on Saturday.The health ministry said that the Union government was committed to amplifying India's vaccine coverage and expanding its scope to the far ends of the country.“In the new phase of the universalization of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the Union Government will procure and supply (free of cost) 75% of the vaccines being produced by the vaccine manufacturers in the country to States and UTs,” the ministry said in a statment.The coronavirus vaccination drive has been ramped up with the help of increased availability of vaccines, its advance visibility to the states and UTs for enabling better planning by them and streamlining the vaccine supply chain, the ministry noted.As part of the nationwide vaccination drive, the government has been supporting the states and UTs by providing them Covid-19 vaccines free of cost, it underlined.Notably, a total of 51,59,931 vaccine doses have been administered in the last 24 hours, taking the country's vaccination coverage above 115.79 crore, as per the ministry's reports till 7am on Saturday.India logged 10,302 new coronavirus cases today to reach 3,44,99,925 in total, while the number of active cases declined to 1,24,868 during the same period.

20-11-2021||India||Following Centre’s directions, IITs start quota-based faculty in senior positions||Following directions from the Centre, the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), for the first time, started advertising quota-based posts for recruitment in senior positions i.e associate professors and professors. The IITs, having autonomy in the recruitment process, were earlier reserving posts while recruiting faculty at the entry-level of assistant professors.According to the previous norms, there was no SC/ST/OBC quota for recruiting at senior positions at the IITs for courses other than humanities and management. At the entry-level also, in case the IITs were unable to find suitable candidates for the reserved posts, they had the authority to de-reserve the post after a year. This has hit the diversity among teachers at the IITs.As per the data shared by the ministry of education in the Parliament in 2018, of the 6,043 faculty members working at the IITs, only 149 were from Scheduled Caste (SC) and 21 from Schedule Tribe (ST). A Parliamentary panel had criticised the poor representation of reserved quota candidates in centrally funded technical institutes last year.In November last year, the ministry had asked the IITs to extend the reservation to senior positions, and the institute had also been prohibited from “de-reserving” the reserved post after a year. As per the central law, government institutes are required to implement a reservation of 27% in teaching staff for OBC candidates, 15% for SC and 7.5% for ST candidates. In August this year, the ministry of education instructed all centrally-funded higher education institutes, such as the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and the National Institutes of Technology (NITs) to fill all the vacancies including reserved ones in “mission mode”.Between September and November, several IITs, including IIT-Bombay, IIT-Delhi, IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Madras, and IIT-BHU, have advertised faculty posts at all the levels inviting applications to fill posts reserved for SC, ST, OBC, EWS, and disabled candidates. “(The) Institute specifically encourages applicants from SC/ST/OBC category as well as persons with disability to apply for these positions,” stated an advertisement published by IIT-D on its website calling applications for faculty positions at the professor and associate professor levels. Similarly, IIT-Kanpur in its advertisement inviting applications for various faculty positions said, “Reservation is applicable as per government of India norms. The institute also encourages applications from qualified women candidates...The reserved category candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.”A senior official at the IIT-D, who wished not to be named, said, “The IITs were already hiring suitable SC/ST/OBC candidates at the higher positions but now that the government has asked IITs to extend the reservation to all faculty posts, the institutes are trying their best to find suitable candidates and fill the positions. The major change this time is the revocation of the de-reservation system. What will happen if we are not able to find meritorious candidates on reserved posts? So far, we were able to de-reserve these positions and now it is not possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/following-centre-s-directions-iits-start-quota-based-faculty-in-senior-positions-101637397865225.html

20-11-2021||India||‘The issue is far from over though farmers feel safer now’: Satyapal Malik||From Raj Bhawan of Meghalaya, Governor Satyapal Malik, who hails from West UP, had been vociferously opposing the contentious farm laws, repeatedly warning the Union government of their repercussions. In an interview to Hindustan Times’ Sunita Aron, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew the laws amid chaos and celebrations, the Governor said the government will have to relent on the farmer’s demand on Minimum Support Price (MSP). Here are the excerpts from the interview. Q: While holding a constitutional position, you have been opposing the government on farms laws? Do you think it’s proper? A: People actually don’t understand constitutional rights and obligations. In no way a constitutional position compels you to seal your lips. Even ex-president Dr Rajendra Prasad, despite holding a constitutional position, opposed Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s Hindu code bill. There are many such instances when Presidents have refused to be a rubber stamp. Thus, there is no restriction even on governors to air their views concerning public welfare. In any way, I was ready to relinquish my post, if so required, to raise a burning issue that harshly impacted the farming community. Q: Are we living in an era of reforms? Then why so much opposition to agriculture reforms when there is also a view that the farm laws would have helped the farmers in the long run? A: No, I come from the same community and fully understand the issues involved. Yeh kisan ki zammen ko hathiyane ka mudda tha ( It was an issue of forcibly capturing the land of farmers). Now, after the withdrawal of farm laws, the farmers will feel safe. Q: Does it seem your voice reached Prime Minister Narendra Modi? A: Yes, I am very thankful to the Prime Minister for taking a decision in the farmer’s interest at an appropriate time. I am equally grateful to farmers, who despite the hardships, kept their year-long agitation peaceful. Q: Finally, the issues are settled, though some farmers are reiterating their demand for legal sanctity to Minimum Support PriceA: The crux of the issue remains unresolved. Legal sanctity to MSP was their main demand and I don’t think farmers would relent or call off their agitation till it is done. Q: MSP was given some time in the late 1960s. Don’t you think some reforms are required over a period of time? A: Despite MSP, farmers still have to do large scale distress selling of their crop. Once MSP is legalized, at least price protection will be guaranteed. Q: You have been in touch with people in power as well as farmers. Will you again initiate dialogue on MSP? A: No, not immediately. Akalmand ko ishara hi kahi hota hai (hints are enough for intelligent people.) The government will have to eventually concede their demand on MSP also. Q: Did the government have the option to give MSP sanctity instead of back rolling the bills? A: Yes, the government had the option and it also knew nothing short of that would be acceptable to farmers. The farmers will not end their strike till they get MSP. Q: Why did the Prime Minister take one year to withdraw the bills? A: As Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi always favoured MSP but after his shift from Gujarat to New Delhi, his views changed. Q: What changed his views? A: I don’t want to define the reasons. Q: Do you think BJP would now harvest votes in the impending elections in UP? A: Yes, to some extent in West UP, as it would temper down the farmer’s anger and animosity against the BJP. In the rest of UP, there are other issues that the party will confront like Hathras, Lakhimpur Khiri violence, et al. Q: Are you planning to return to active politics? A: No, I plan to write books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-issue-is-far-from-over-though-farmers-feel-safer-now-satyapal-malik-101637395524710.html
20-11-2021||India||Varun Gandhi demands compensation for farmers, action against Teni||Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Pilibhit, Varun Gandhi, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider “appropriately strict action” against the Union minister who is connected to the violence that erupted in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 that left eight dead.Gandhi has also urged the PM to consider paying compensation of ₹1 crore to the families of the farmers who died during the year-long protest against the farm laws and sought a statutory guarantee of minimum support price for the farmers.Though Gandhi has not named anyone, his letter refers to the minister of state for home affairs, Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son, Ashish Teni has been named as a prime accused in the case and is in custody.In his letter to the Prime Minister, Gandhi has blamed “provocative” statements made by several senior party colleagues for instigating the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri that left five farmers dead.“It is the result of such statements and the adversarial environment created around the movement that on October 3, five of our farmer brothers were crushed to death by vehicles in Lakhimpur Kheri. This heartbreaking incident is a blemish on our democracy. It is my request to you that appropriately strict action is taken against the union minister who has been connected to this incident so that there is a fair enquiry,” he wrote.He went on to say, “…Democracy runs on constitutionality, discourse and empathy. The famerss expect you to solve their problems in a sensitive and timely manner.”Earlier, the BJP MP shared a video of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where a car is seen running over protestors and demanded action.The BJP MP, who has in the past urged the government to take a lenient view of the agitation, has also sought to drop all “politically motivated false FIRs” that were filed against the farmers who were part of the anti farm law agitation for over a year.“I believe if this decision has been taken earlier, all these innocent lives would not have been lost. It is my humble request to you that while expressing condolences to the families of the farmer brothers and sisters who were martyred in the movement, a compensation of ₹one crore each be announced for them,” he said in the letter.On Friday, Prime Minister Modi announced that the government will set in motion the process of repealing the three farm laws that saw protracted protests by some farmer groups in Punjab, Haryana and parts of UP.Gandhi has also backed the farmers’ demand of making MSP legally binding. “There are more than 85% small and marginal farmers in our country for the empowerment of these farmers we have to ensure that they get remunerative prices for their crops. This movement will not end without the resolution of this demand and there will be widespread anger amongst them, which will continue to emerge in one form or the other,” he said seeking a statutory guarantee of MSP for their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-demands-compensation-for-farmers-action-against-teni-101637394384956.html

20-11-2021||India||‘Did you notice...?’: Chidambaram's ‘only under BJP’ criticism over farm laws||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram targeted the central government for the sudden announcement of the withdrawal of the three contentious farm laws. Referring to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders’ remarks hailing the move, Chidambaram alleged that the announcement was made without holding a Cabinet meeting.“Did you notice that the PM made the announcement without holding a Cabinet meeting? It is only under the BJP that laws are made and unmade without prior Cabinet approval,” the former Union minister wrote on Twitter.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a surprise announcement on Friday morning, said that the central government has decided to repeal the farm laws that had triggered months-long farmers’ protests. The prime minister lamented that the government was unable to convince a “section of farmers” about the benefits of the legislation.While Opposition parties hailed the decision as a victory for farmers, Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh lauded PM Modi for his “statesmanship” and “sensitivity” towards the welfare of farmers. BJP president Jagat Prakash Nadda welcomed the decision saying the prime minister has shown that he has “immense care for our farmers”.“Where were these worthy leaders and their wise advice in the last 15 months?” tweeted Chidambaram.Farm laws repealed: Congress to hold victory rallies across country todayThe hasty passage of the agricultural Bills had drawn criticism from the Opposition MPs who wanted the Bills to be sent to a Parliamentary Committee for scrutiny. After failing to end the deadlock by holding multiple rounds of talks with the farmers, the government finally relented and decide to repeal the laws.Soon after the announcement, Chidambaram said that the decision was impelled by fear of elections rather than a change of policy or heart.“What cannot be achieved by democratic protests can be achieved by the fear of impending elections! PM’s announcement on the withdrawal of the three farm laws is not inspired by a change of policy or a change of heart. It is impelled by fear of elections!” he tweeted on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-you-notice-chidambaram-s-only-under-bjp-criticism-over-farm-laws-101637383647315.html

The Prime Minister is in Uttar Pradesh capital for the DGP conference.“If your intentions are clear don’t share dais with union minister of state for home. Dismiss him,” Gandhi said in her letter to PM Modi...@narendramodi जी अगर देश के किसानों के प्रति आपकी नीयत सचमुच साफ है तो आज अपने केंद्रीय गृह राज्यमंत्री के साथ मंच पर विराजमान मत होईये, उनको बर्खास्त कीजिये।प्रधानमंत्री जी को मेरा पत्र। pic.twitter.com/5XNAmAjmvNAshish Mishra is among the 13 accused in the violence that claimed eight lives on October 3 under the Tikunia police station limits of Lakhimpur Kheri. He was arrested on October 9 and is in jail. All the 13 accused are in judicial custody.A district court on Monday rejected Ashish Mishra's bail petition, saying the investigation is still on in the incident of mowing down of farmers by a vehicle and so the court did not find any genuine reason to release the key accused on bail.Last week, a forensic report confirmed that firing was done from the licensed weapons of Ashish Mishra, his friend Ankit Das and his private gunner Latif alias Kaale but there was no clarity as to when and where the firing was done.An official said that the report was not sufficient to say that the firing was done by the same weapons at the violence site as no one suffered a bullet injury in the incident.The Prime Minister, meanwhile, reached Lucknow after visiting Mahoba and Jhansi on Friday, where he handed over the indigenously developed light combat helicopter (LCH), drones and electronic warfare suite to the three services as part of the Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv at a ceremony.After arriving at the Chaudhary Charan Singh airport, Modi went to the Raj Bhavan and paid floral tributes to the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, according to a statement issued by the Raj Bhavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-asks-pm-modi-to-not-share-dais-with-union-minister-ajay-mishra-101637382677434.html
20-11-2021||India||India to deploy two S-400 systems by early 2022, changes game with China||With the induction of at least two regiments of S-400 air defence systems on north and east borders of India beginning 2022, the Modi government will finally balance the tactical disadvantage faced by the military after PLA’s surprise May 2020 transgressions on 1,597-km Ladakh Line of Control (LAC).According to diplomats based in Moscow, the advance elements of S-400 systems have already started arriving in India with deep penetration radars of the two systems (in sequence) in place next month. The two S-400 systems will be operational by early 2022 to match the Chinese deployment of the same Russian system across the Ladakh and Arunachal LAC. Two Indian military teams, trained in Russia, are ready to operate the S-400 system, which has a reach of nearly 400 km into enemy territory.That India has been able to get two S-400 complexes in a short time is due to very close relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is for this reason that President Vladimir Putin is making second exception this year to step out of his country to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 6. While President Putin has received guests at Black Sea resort of Sochi, the only time he stepped out of Russia was to meet US President Joe Biden on June 16 at Geneva. He has only held virtual summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June this year and will not travel to Beijing despite the two countries having an annual summit format on lines with India. Despite raging Covid conditions, Russia allowed Indian S-400 teams to train and opened manufacturing facilities shut down during spread of coronavirus pandemic in the past two years.When the PLA caught the Indian Army by surprise on north banks of Pangong Tso, Galwan and Gogra-Hot Springs on May 2020, it was quite evident that the Chinese had plans to unilaterally change the LAC by imposing an already rejected 1959 line on Ladakh. The Indian military was pushed on the back foot with the PLA retaining with troops and weapon systems who had come for annual exercises across the Ladakh LAC in 2020 spring.With men of 16 Bihar under Col Santosh Babu showing raw courage against marauding PLA troops at Galwan on June 15, the Modi government moved to correct the disadvantage that the army found itself on Ladakh LAC. First was the induction of T-90 tanks using Chinook helicopters on Ladakh LAC all the way up to Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) sector along with deployment of troops. Second step was the induction of omni-role nuclear capable Rafale fighters into the theatre with long-range air-to-air missiles to give air superiority and land attack cruise missiles. Third step, the most important one, was the brilliantly planned military operation that led to Indian Army occupying heights on south banks of Pangong Tso on August 29-31. With PLA’s Moldo garrison being threatened by Indian Army, the Chinese got the message and the two sides sagaciously decided to dis-engage from both banks of the saltwater lake. However, there was still a tactical mismatch with the Chinese threatening the Indian Air Force with deployed S-400 systems at Ngari Gar Gunsa and Nyingchi air bases in occupied Aksai Chin and across Arunachal Pradesh.With the induction of S-400 systems on Indian soil, the Modi government has a reply to Chinese missiles and air force in case of a worst case scenario. As one system will be deployed in north, it will take care of two fronts in Ladakh as the deep penetration radars of S-400 will be able to pick up any fighter or missile targeting India.While the Chinese and the Indian sides only reiterating their respective positions during the last round of WMCC this month, the Indian S-400 capability will make Beijing realise the futility of keeping forward deployments on the Ladakh and Arunachal LAC. Ensuring peaceful and tranquil LAC is the only way out for both the Asian giants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-deploy-two-s-400-systems-by-early-2022-changes-game-with-china-101637382419359.html

Bhagwat was speaking at an event in Chhattisgarh."We don't have to convert anyone but teach how to live. We were born in the land of Bharat to give such a lesson to the whole world. Our sect makes good human beings without changing anyone's worship system," the RSS chief said."Anyone trying to disturb the tune will be fixed by the rhythm of the country. We need is to move forward together with coordination in order to make India a Vishwa guru," he added.Bhagwat said that they believe that the entire world is a family.The RSS chief is in Chhattisgarh to attend a series of programmes by the members of the organisation.RSS-affiliate Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) had on Friday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to repeal the three farm laws, saying it "seems to be right" to avoid "unwarranted controversies and conflicts".The BKS, however, lashed out at the farmer leaders, saying their "arrogant attitude" to continue with their protest was not beneficial for small farmers.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farm unions, spearheading the agitation against the three agriculture laws, has welcomed the prime minister's decision but said they will wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures.Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said the ongoing anti-farm laws protest will be withdrawn only after the three contentious legislations are repealed in Parliament and legal guarantee on minimum support price for crops made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-have-to-convert-anyone-but-teach-how-to-live-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-101637376224615.html

The event to felicitate the cities, ‘Swachh Amrit Mahotsav’ is being organised by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MOHUA) and would take place at Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital, the ministry said.Further, the event will also pay tribute to sanitation workers by recognising top performing cities under the ‘Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge’, an initiative earlier launched by the ministry to promote mechanised cleaning of sewers and septic tanks and preventing ‘hazardous cleaning’ in which a person enters them.“From surveying 73 major cities in 2016, 4,320 cities have participated in 2021, the 6th edition of Swachh Survekshan which has become the world’s largest urban cleanliness survey,” the ministry said. “The success of this year’s survey can be gauged through the unprecedented number of citizen feedback received this year - over 5 crores, a marked increase from last year’s 1.87 crores. The 2021 edition was conducted in record time of 28 days despite several on-ground challenges owing to the COVID pandemic,” it added.Highlighting the improvements in the performance of several states and Union territories, the ministry said that six states and six UTs have shown an overall improvement, ranging between 5% and 25%, in their overall ground level improvement.The ministry also said that source segregation of garbage has been started at over 1,100 additional cities. Also, close to 1,800 urban local bodies have started extending welfare benefits to sanitation workers. Meanwhile, with 1,500 more cities that have notified the ban on use, sale and storage of non-biodegradable plastic bags, so far 3,000 city administrations have implemented it, the ministry said. “All North East states have shown significant improvement in their citizens’ feedback – yet another testimony to how the Missions is reaching out to every citizen, including in far flung areas,” it added.The cities are usually rated using a star system and this year, 342 cities, an increase from 56 in 2018, would be given certificates under some star rating. This includes nine five-star cities, 166 three-star cities, 167 one-star cities.Hardeep Singh Puri, Union minister of housing and urban affairs, minister of state Kaushal Kishore, chief ministers and urban development ministers, 1,200 guests comprising diplomats, state and city administrators and senior officials, sector partners and brand ambassadors, NGOs and CSOs are scheduled to attend the event.In 2020, Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh, Rajkot and Surat in Gujarat, Mysore in Karnataka, Indore in Madhya Pradesh and Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra were given five-star ratings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swachh-survekshan-2021-president-kovind-to-award-342-cleanest-cities-today-101637371544428.html

Parent Circle, a parenting magazine, said in a statement that people of all ages have started spending more time on their mobile phones and other electronic gadgets since the start of the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), adding that more screen time has become a necessity for families rather than a choice.As part of the campaign, a huge number of participants are "expected to disconnect from their electronic gadgets for one-hour on November 20 - World's Children Day - to spend the time exclusively with their children," said Parent Circle.The magazine has claimed that the initiative, first started in 2019, was a huge success last year as "more than a million parents and over 41,635 schools participating in the event.” It said that the campaign is gaining momentum with over 10 million impressions already on social media.“This year, #GadgetFreeHour is happening on November 20, 2021, with the number of participants set to exceed 50 million," it added.On the occasion of World’s Children Day which is observed to promote “international togetherness, awareness among children worldwide, and improving children's welfare”, the parenting magazine has invited everyone to celebrate the parent-child bond by participating in the #GadgetFreeHour drive between 7.30pm and 8.30pm.Iconic monuments and key parliament buildings including the Rashtrapati Bhavan and Qutub Minar were illuminated with blue lights on the eve of World Children's Day. The blue lighting was a part of Unicef’s #GoBlue campaign to highlight child rights and the impact the Covid-19 pandemic had on children's lives.This year’s theme for World Children’s Day is ‘A better future for every child’.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-million-people-expected-to-observe-gadget-free-hour-on-world-children-s-day-parentcircle-101637365387205.html

Its outreach in India has now expanded to an average of one million children directly and to five million through government partnerships annually.Thanking the international jury and their supporters for the recognition, foundation tweeted: “The Pratham team would like to thank the jury and all our supporters across the globe for recognizing our work! #team #education #development.”The foundation’s Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), with the latest one being released on Wednesday, serves as a model to assess education outcomes and learning deficiencies across 14 countries in three continents. ASER 2021 is based on a survey conducted by the education foundation in 25 states and Union territories. This year, the survey, which covered a total of 76,706 households and 75,234 children between the age group of five to 16 years, said that between 2018 and 2021, government schools saw an increase in the proportion of enrolled students for all ages and grades.The Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development was instituted in the memory of the former prime minister by a trust in her name in 1986. It consists of a monetary award of ₹25 lakh along with a citation. The jury is chaired by former Chief Justice of India, Justice T.S.

Later it was transferred to the CB-CID as he was arrayed as the prime accused. The charge of murder of an employee in his factory, Govindarasu (60), was also incorporated. Following this, he surrendered before a judicial magistrate in Panruti on October 11 and was remanded to judicial custody. He was also subjected to custodial interrogation by police.Ramesh submitted that the substantial portion of investigation was already completed and all the named and unnamed accused of the case were arrested. He had voluntarily surrendered before the court of law and later subjected himself to custodial interrogation. The prime apprehension of the complainant that the post-mortem would not be conducted and documented fairly upon which the entire case hinges upon, was taken care of by the judicial orders passed by the high court. The post-mortem was conducted in the presence of a team of doctors of JIPMER in Puducherry and the representatives of the complainant and properly documented. All preliminary investigation steps have already been duly carried out and under those circumstances, there was no legal or logical necessity for keeping him in judicial custody, he submitted. The employee had committed suicide and his political opponents were attempting to project it as a case of homicide, he contended. As an MP, he has to discharge the democratic functions attached to his office, Ramesh said and claimed he was suffering from acute hypertension and diabetes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-grants-bail-to-dmk-mp-in-murder-case-101637349201780.html
20-11-2021||India||Four children among 9 die in Tamil Nadu as house collapses in downpour||Nine people, including four children, died when a house in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district collapsed on Friday morning due to the heavy rains since Thursday caused by a depression that crossed the coast of north Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in the wee hours between 3am and 4am, officials said. District collector P Kumaravel Pandian said that the house was very old and that it was located along the banks of a river near Pernampet. “Four people resided in this house and as the rains got heavier people from adjacent houses moved to the first floor of this house on Thursday night for shelter,” the collector said. This locality was severely flooded. “The house was already in a dangerous condition because it is old and due to rains, it weakened further and around 7.15 this morning the house collapsed,” the collector said. Among the four children who were crushed to death, three of them are girls. Several others have also been injured in the collapse and are receiving treatment at Gudiyatham Government Hospital and Government Vellore Medical College Hospital in Adukkamparai.Chief minister M K Stalin in a statement announced a financial assistance of ₹5 lakh each to the bereaved families and ₹50,000 each for those undergoing treatment. Besides this tragic accident, no other major damage and loss to life was reported in other parts of the state.“The red alert issued to all the districts is being withdrawn,” S Balachandran, head, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Chennai said at a press conference. The IMD had issued a red alert to 16 districts including Chennai until November 18.In a bulletin, the RMC said that at 11.30 am on Friday, “The Depression over north Tamil Nadu moved west-northwestwards and weakened into a well marked low pressure area over north interior Tamil Nadu and adjoining Karnataka and Rayalaseema.” On Friday the amount of rainfall received in different parts of the state was Chennai- 5cm, Chengalpattu- 6 cm, Villupuram- 22 cm, Tiruvannamalai- 15 cm and the adjacent union territory of Puducherry was also lashed with 19cm. On Friday, the union government released a list of the seven-member team, led by Rajiv Shukla, Joint Secretary and Financial Advisor National Intelligence Grid, Union Ministry of Home Affairs who will be in Tamil Nadu to assess the damage due to the rains.The situation was worse during the previous heavy rains overnight between November 6 and 7 and on November 11 when Chennai received 21 cm and 16 cm respectively and normal life was thrown out of gear. Kanyakumari district was severely flooded after it received 83.96 cm rainfall from October 1 to November 15 while 38.99 cm is the average it receives. From October 1 to November 18, Chennai and Tamil Nadu received 66% and 61% of excess rainfall during this north east monsoon season.

20-11-2021||India||‘It is a responsive govt:’ Karnataka CM Bommai on repeal of three farm laws||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government’s decision to repeal the three controversial farm laws is the “response of a responsive government at the Centre to the demand of the farmers.” “The laws were part of the intent of the Union government to bring reforms in (the) agriculture sector and agri-marketing in accordance with WTO agreement signed during the UPA government. It was the UPA government that prepared the draft of the farm laws. The draft was revised by incorporating suggestions from state governments,” Bommai said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Friday, announced a rollback of the three farm laws at the heart of yearlong protests by farmers. Since November last year, farmers have been protesting along Delhi borders against the three farm laws since they were passed by the central government in 2020. The BJP government in Karnataka implemented the laws in the state, which was met with stiff resistance.“The laws had provisions for farmers to sell their produce directly to buyers. However, farmers largely in Punjab and Haryana were agitating for the continuation of (the) regulated market system,” Bommai said.Reacting to the prime minister’s decision, the Samyukta Horata-Karnataka (SHK), an umbrella organisation of multiple farmer groups in the state, demanded the Bommai-led government, too, must repeal other contentious laws, including amendments to the APMC Act, land and labour reforms and implement minimum support price (MSP).“The Samyukta Horata-Karnataka will continue its protests until the centre ensures MSP, withdraw the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and state government’s land reforms act, APMC Act, anti-cow slaughter amendment, labour reforms, stopping privitisation of public enterprises, control on price rise of essential commodities, compensation for crop damages due to incessant rains, (against) the reduction of milk prices and other demands are met,” the SHK said in a statement on Friday.The opposition in Karnataka also reacted to Modi announcement. “Now that @BJP4India has finally realised their mistake & withdrawn anti-farmer laws. It is time to give justice to the farmers who (were) martyred during the struggle. I urge @PMOIndia to announce ₹25 lakh to the deceased farmers. Farmers have finally got their independence!!” Siddaramaiah said in a post on Twitter.“This is the outcome of democracy!! No matter how strong a dictator is, he will have to finally bow down to people in democracy. Freedom for Farmers!!” he added in another post.“Given the delay in the repeal which led to the loss of precious lives, the government must acknowledge that 700+ farmers who died in this long struggle were martyrs. It must also ensure compensation and government jobs for their family members,” DK Shivakumar, the state Congress president, said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-a-responsive-govt-karnataka-cm-bommai-on-repeal-of-three-farm-laws-101637348951621.html

He said for the first time, the government of Karnataka conducted pre-events in the cities of Mangaluru, Hubballi, and Mysuru in the run-up to the BTS 2021 to promote the concept of industries going beyond Bengaluru. “Tech Summit was held in these clusters with strong participation notwithstanding the pandemic,” he said.The Bengaluru Tech Summit for 2022 is expected to be held between November16-18 next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fintech-task-force-to-be-set-up-karanataka-minister-narayan-at-tech-summit-101637348894282.html
20-11-2021||India||Anti-conversion bill: Bengaluru Archbishop opposes proposed law||Archbishop of Bengaluru Reverend Peter Machado on Friday urged the Basavaraj Bommai-led government not to bring in the proposed anti-conversion bill as it was “undesirable and discriminatory”. “The entire Christian community in Karnataka opposes the proposal of (the) Anti-Conversion Bill in one voice and question(s) the need for such an exercise when sufficient laws and court directives are in place to monitor any aberration of the existing laws,” Machado said. The statements come even as Bommai and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continue to insist on introducing the law that restricts and penalises forcible conversions. Kota Shrinivas Poojari, the minister for Social Welfare, Backward Classes Welfare Department, Dinakar Keshav Shetty, the chairman of the committee and Goolihatti Shekar could not be reached for comment. The issue of forcible conversions revived momentum after BJP legislator Goolihatti Shekar made an appeal to stop the practice to which his mother, he claimed, had also fallen “victim”. He had claimed that people from marginalised communities and even muslims were converted or they were slapped with false charges. He said that around 15,000-20,000 people in his constituency were possibly converted. Shekar had presided over an event in which at least five families “were brought back” into the Hindu fold, including his mother--a practice that is commonly referred to as “Ghar Wapsi”. The Archbishop also asked the government to let go of any attempt to survey churches and missionaries. “The Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare Department of Government of Karnataka have issued an order to conduct a survey of both official and non-official Christian Missionaries and the institutions and establishments functioning in the state. When all the relevant data is already available (through the census) with the government, why do we need yet another futile exercise?” Machado said on Friday in a statement. He said that such an exercise would be detrimental to the peace and harmony of the state. “Why only Christian community is targeted and marked for this arbitrary, fallacious and illogical move? what is the motive that is driving them to do so?” he wrote. The legislative committee on Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare has ordered a survey of authorised and unauthorised churches and their personnel, HT had reported on October 15. The developments come at a time when there has been hate crimes reported from across the state and country with fundamentalist groups mobilising support for such causes to “safeguard” their respective religions. Several other states in the country have introduced laws to prevent forced conversions. There have been allegations, especially against large christian missionaries, who lure weak, oppressed and other people to convert with the promise of monetary and other rewards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anticonversion-bill-bengaluru-archbishop-opposes-proposed-law-101637348893216.html
20-11-2021||India||Poor drainage system and planning to be blamed for flooding in Bengaluru: Experts||Outdated stormwater drains and lack of proper planning are some of the main reasons cited by experts why Bengaluru continues to witness flooding every year after a heavy spell of rain. On Friday as well, several areas were flooded after 80.4 mm rain lashed the city on Thursday night. In October as well, flooding had left a trail of destruction, misery, and suffering for people living in low-lying regions of the city and other places where drains and lakes have overflowed into the homes and basements, residents claim.Experts said that the short term planning can no longer help Bengaluru and complete rehaul in preparedness is needed to tackle changing weather patterns.Urban planner V Ravichandar said unless a change in stormwater drainage is brought about, the situation in the city is going to be difficult. “Our growth is unplanned and rampant. We have occupied several low-lying areas in the city and these areas don’t have a stormwater drain. A relook at the drainage system is much needed now,” he said.Ashwin Mahesh, an urban planning expert, said that a fundamental change is needed in the idea of transporting rainwater through stormwater drains. According to him, the design of the city stormwater drains is wrong. “Water moves faster in a cylindrical space than rectangular space. It is scientifically proven. Except for the TenderSure roads in Bengaluru, we have rectangular drainages. Apart from transporting we should use socking pits to absorb water locally,” he said.With similar rainfall expected for two more days, officials said that the city could witness more flooding. “The rains are predicted to continue for two more days due to the weather system in the Bay of Bengal. After Saturday, the rains are expected to reduce,” said Geeta Agnihotri, director-in-charge of IMD Bengaluru.BBMP control room officials said that so far no tree fall incidents have been reported in the city. On Friday, at least 17 roads in Bengaluru witnessed water logging said the control room officials. According to them, teams have been deployed across all BBMP zones to clear waterlogging and remove fallen trees.According to Indian Meteorological Department, 80.4 mm rain is much above the average rainfall for November 18, which is 2.3 mm. Bengaluru received 1,000 % more rainfall than average in seven days from November 11 to November 17, according to IMD data. The average weekly rainfall in Bengaluru during November is 10.7 mm, but in the last week, the city received 118.1 mm of rain, as per the data.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday chaired a meeting with district administration to review the situation in the state due to incessant rainfall since the last week and also took up relief measures. In a bid to address the issue of flooding, Bommai has proposed that the government will initiate a rehabilitation programme for those living in flood-affected areas in the city.The chief minister has also ordered a survey to identify vulnerable areas and alternate land for those who will be rehabilitated, however, officials in BBMP think it is not practical. “We have to remove people from some of the prime areas of Bengaluru. Yes, these are low-lying areas with a serious problem, but removing all residents and giving compensation is not practical,” said a senior BBMP official who didn’t want to be named.Sharada Iyer, a business consultant and resident of Koramangala, one of the low lying areas in the city said they have not heard from the officials about any rehabilitation plans. “How can the government talk about removing us. This is not a well thought out plan. The government needs to focus on improving the infrastructure, especially the stormwater drains,” she said.On September 15, 2021, the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) had pulled up the agencies for inefficiency in identifying and managing stormwater drains (SWDs) in the city. A performance audit report tabled in the legislative assembly on Wednesday mentioned lack of financial discipline, shoddy mapping of SWDs and tertiary drains, lack of documents related to various works taken up, and failure to clear lake and SWD encroachments.“There were discrepancies between the figures exhibited in the budget estimates and actual expenditure recorded in the cash book. This indicated the lack of reconciliation mechanism and correct reporting of expenditure, and exposes the financial indiscipline reigning in BBMP,” the report said.It also added that out of the 1,988 encroachments identified by BBMP, 1,225 were declared to be removed. However, evictions were incomplete and did not improve the condition of drains.Bengaluru’s stormwater drain network is over 850km. While it’s supposed to channel storm water during the rains and remain empty rest of the year, the reality is different, with the drains filled with sewage and garbage, said Naresh Narasimhan, architect, and urban activist. “I’m also beginning to think there is an intellectual vacuum in the government. There are urban experts, but they are not in governance,” he said.BBMP in response said that under K-100, storm water drains are in the process of getting a facelift as part of the ₹160-crore ‘Citizens Water Way Project’. The project, with a deadline of 10 months, has been envisaged to establish the major drain as a waterway and ecological corridor, and was taken up on the lines of the ‘Sabarmati River Waterfront’ project in Gujarat, said a statement from BBMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poor-drainage-system-and-planning-to-be-blamed-for-flooding-in-bengaluru-experts-101637348833009.html
20-11-2021||India||Political parties look to change narrative in poll-bound Uttarakhand||The decision of the central government to repeal the three controversial farm laws could provided some reprieve to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttarakhand, where it would be battling with opposition Congress to retain power in next February-March assembly elections, according to political experts and local farm leaders.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Friday, announced a rollback of the three farm laws at the heart of yearlong protests by farmers. Since November last year, farmers have been protesting along Delhi borders against the three farm laws since they were passed by the central government in 2020.The imposition of three farm laws was a major issue in Udham Singh Nagar and Haridwar districts, which has sizeable Sikh and Punjabi farmer population, and the ruling BJP had been trying to counter the Congress campaign in the districts.With the BJP getting a cushion against the Congress onslaught, political analysts said that “the decision won’t immediately turn the election tide in favour of ruling BJP, but much will also depend on how the Congress exploit the changed scenario in the state.” They also say that the farmers agitation issue impacts all the nine constituencies of US Nagar district and at least seven of the 11 constituencies of Haridwar district.Political analyst SMA Kazmi, who has been monitoring the state politics for over two decades, said with the PM Narendra Modi’s announcement, the “opposition Congress lost a potent issue for the elections.”“Friday’s development is very significant considering the upcoming elections in the state. The repealing of the three controversial farm laws had definitely caused a dent in the Congress campaign as it has now lost a potent issue which it was raising and had planned to play up in the upcoming elections,” said Kazmi.He said that the party will now have to rethink its strategy on how to exploit the changed scenario now.“The Congress still has chance to exploit it by going among the farmers and speak about the deaths of their fellow farmers during the agitation against the farm laws. It should raise questions against the BJP... of course lot will depend on how the party is able to exploit the development in its favour because there’s a lot of factionalism inside the party,” said Kazmi.Kazmi, however, said there may not be “major and immediate” benefit for the BJP.“If the BJP thinks that it will benefit them in the upcoming polls then they are wrong especially in the US Nagar district which hosts a significant number of Sikhs. It is because the Sikhs won’t forget their demonisation by the BJP leaders who called the farmers Khalistanis, terrorists and other derogatory terms. They will also will also question the BJP on the death of farmers during the agitation,” said Kazmi.Another political commentator Jai Singh Rawat said the BJP may not gain much.“It won’t happen that easily because the BJP is now in backfoot. It will be difficult for their leader now to take credit for the repealing of the laws which they were earlier terming beneficial for the farmers. They will definitely have to chalk out a fresh strategy on how to exploit the issue in their favour,” said Rawat.The farmer leaders welcomed the announcement and said that they won’t end the agitation.Tejinder Virk, national president of Terai Kisan Union, said, “We welcome the move of Centre to repeal it...It is a result of the ultimate sacrifice made by about 700 farmers during the agitation. However, our agitation won’t end with this as we are still waiting for a solution on other issues including MSP and power supply. We will also wait to end the agitation till the farm laws are repealed in the Parliament. Also, our further move will depend on the meeting of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha on Saturday,” said Virk.Congress termed the Centre’s move as a “win of Indianness”. “This is has happened due to the struggle of lakhs of farmers and the sacrifices made by about 700 farmers during the agitation. We don’t believe that the government has done it due to the elections. It has done that due to the resilient fight of our farmers,’ said Ganesh Godiyal, Congress state president.BJP state in charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam said, “He (PM Narendra Modi) had taken decision for the betterment of farmers... but the farmers couldn’t be convinced about the same. So, Modi ji took back the decision and we want to thank him for this decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-repeal-political-parties-look-to-change-narrative-in-poll-bound-uttarakhand-101637348531544.html
20-11-2021||India||Farm laws repeal move could have come earlier, say Lakhimpur victims’ families||Families of two of the four farmers killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3 said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws could have been taken earlier.Four farmers were mowed down by a vehicle during a protest in the Tikunia area of Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh last month. Two of them— 19-year-old Gurvindar of Mohraniya village and 42-year-old Diljeet Singh of Banjaran Tada village — were residents of Bahraich.Gurvindar’s uncle said the farmers had been protesting for the withdrawal of the three farm laws for nearly a year. “This work could have been done earlier.”“Though PM made the announcement, he neither expressed concern over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident nor sought the resignation of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni,” Gurvindar’s uncle added.Union minister Mishra’s son Ashish is one of the accused in the case. He was arrested on October 9 and is currently in jail.The Bahraich-based families also said they wanted the decision to be communicated in writing.Diljeet’s brother Jagjeet Singh said if the government had taken the action earlier, “our family would still have been together”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-repeal-move-could-have-come-earlier-say-lakhimpur-victims-families-101637348299674.html
20-11-2021||India||What lies ahead for the BJP after change of course on farm laws||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on Friday of repealing the three contentious farm laws is seen as an intervention that will blunt the Opposition’s attacks against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the upcoming assembly polls in five states, and prevent a coalition of opposition parties from taking shape. In at least two of these five poll-bound states, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the farm agitation is a burning issue.Party leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity said that while the announcement is unlikely to change the political fortunes of the BJP in Punjab, where the party lacks a strong cadre and leadership, it will help alter the narrative in parts of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand where the agitation has given Opposition ammunition.“The outcome of the recent bypolls in Himachal Pradesh, where the farm agitation is barely visible, has sounded an alarm. The violence that broke out in Lakhimpur Kheri (in UP)… the ground reports from Uttarakhand -- all indicated that the farm agitation could act as glue for anti-government sentiments,” said a BJP leader in Delhi.On record, most BJP leaders deny that the laws would have had a negative fallout in Uttar Pradesh, where it is hoping to return to power with a majority.Vijay Pal Tomar, BJP MP from UP and a former president of the BJP Kisan Morcha, said the decision was based on the “mahual” (atmosphere) that was shaping around the protest sites. He said the government took an overall view of what would be “best in national interest”.But some party leaders conceded that the BJP hopes the repeal will help it recover lost ground in western UP, where its performance on a sizeable number of seats, between 100 and 120, hinges on the farm vote.“There are many issues such as Covid, economy, and the overall dip in employment avenues that the government’s performance is being measured on. Putting an end to the reason for the agitation will help improve public perception,” said the first BJP leader.An MP from western UP was even more candid. “It has been difficult for us to participate in public events; people’s anger was palpable. Hopefully that will change.”In Punjab, where the BJP will be contesting alone for the first time since its break-up with the Shiromani Akali Dal, (SAD) the party is hoping that the decision will pan out favourably for it and its possible new ally, the front floated by former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.SAD’s Naresh Gujral, said it may be too soon to comment on the impact that the announcement could have on political formations in Punjab and whether the BJP stands to benefit. “In a democracy, everybody is free to do what they like. Both (BJP and Singh) are on a weak wicket. So, let’s see how it pans out. Today’s announcement is not an aspirin that you take and the headache goes away immediately. Over 1,000 farmers have lost their lives. It’s been a struggle that has gone on for over a year, so I don’t see making this one announcement will change the entire political scenario.”Another reason cited for the repeal is the security issue flagged by some agencies as well as Singh during his meetings with the PM, home minister, and the National Security Adviser in the Capital in September.According to a BJP leader in Punjab, the party and its ideological mentor the RSS were worried about the influence of secessionists and Khalistan sympathisers on the agitation.“A lot of young people were being influenced by the Khalistani supporters. The agitation became a ground for manipulating anti-India sentiment. Given Punjab’s history with terrorism and its strategic location (proximity to Pakistan), it was imperative to address these concerns,” this person added.The RSS was particularly peeved by the agitation taking the shape of a Sikh versus Hindu conflict. A senior functionary of the RSS said the cadre was instructed to reach out to religious heads and the village elders to drive home the necessity of amity between the Sikhs and the Hindus.Change of tackWhile senior party leaders were quick to point out that the unexpected decision was in line with the party’s stratagem of shaping policy that benefits the masses; the discomfiture of some over the change of tack was visible.After the government made no headway with the farmers following multiple rounds of talks, some in the BJP raised questions about the genesis of the protest; linked it to a larger conspiracy against the government; and raised an alarm over the influx of “anti-national elements” in the agitation.However, after the PM’s outreach to the farmers on Friday, some leaders said the change in stance will be hard to explain during campaigning.“Earlier the line was clear that the laws would benefit 80% of the farmers. The PM himself referred to the protestors as Andolanjeevis,” said a second RSS leader. The RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh was guarded in its response to the decision, while it welcomed the setting up of a committee to deal with the issue of minimum support price, it was not enthused by the government repealing the laws, which it said would not favour farmers in the long run.Another BJP leader, however, said the rollback will not impact the PM’s image or the party’s as the BJP will leverage the decision as manifestation of its pro-people stance. “The Opposition labelled the PM as arrogant, even today the Congress used that term for him; but his apology to a section of farmers on national TV shows that he has his ear to the ground and people’s best interest in mind. There is no dent in his image.”Some BJP leaders are also concerned that Friday’s announcement could throw open the floodgates for similar demands by groups seeking the roll-back of other laws. “The labour code are already facing opposition, there is a chance that the winter session will see the opposition parties amp up their protests over proposed laws,” said the first leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-lies-ahead-for-the-bjp-after-change-of-course-on-farm-laws-101637347872616.html
20-11-2021||India||Opposition to corner government on MSP, fuel in winter session||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on Friday to repeal the three farm laws 14 months after their passage by Parliament was seen by many as a step to cut further political damage but a showdown between government and Opposition legislators is imminent in 10 days’ time when the motion for repeal is moved in the winter session.Opposition parties that entered the fray last year to cash in on the political momentum built by roadside sit-in and “rail roko” protests organised by farmer unions in north India appear to be in no mood to cede the moral high ground to the government when the House sits from November 29 to December 23. The floor strategy will be centred around, retrospectively, highlighting that the problem was of the Centre’s own making and, prospectively, cornering the government on issues of legally guaranteed minimum support prices and heavy tax burden on fuel products, said leaders of the Opposition who did not wish to be named.At least three Opposition MPs maintained that “many uncomfortable questions will be raised” when the acts are brought for withdrawal. According to the rules, the government will have to seek the permission of both Houses of Parliament to repeal the laws.The Trinamool’s Derek O’Brien pointed out that there is “still work to be done in Parliament” and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury demanded that “Parliament whilst repealing the three farm laws must enact MSP as a legal right. Over 750 farmers martyred yet PM expresses no remorse”.Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former party chief Rahul Gandhi indicated that the fight against the BJP over farmers’ welfare will continue. In her statement, Sonia Gandhi said, “The BJP government has continuously attacked the farming community in the last seven years…whether it is the refusal to pay the farmer the cost +50% profit as promised by the Prime Minister, or the huge increase in the cost of diesel and agricultural products, or the attack of three black anti-farming laws.”Rahul, in his letter to the farmers, said, “The struggle is not over yet. Getting remunerative MSP for agricultural produce, ending the controversial Electricity Amendment Act, reducing tax burden on everything used for farming, reducing the unexpected hike in diesel prices and the debt burden are serious issues.”This is the second time that the NDA government has had to backtrack on reforms that affected the farmers. In 2015, after two successive ordinances to make land laws more industry-friendly, PM Modi announced on August 31, 2015 that the law would be allowed to lapse.While the Congress party announced it would celebrate November 20 as “Kisan Vijay Diwas” (farmers’ victory day), the party’s legal expert Abhishek Singhvi questioned, “Why the government didn’t bring an ordinance on Friday to nullify the laws. Are farmers less important than the two agency chiefs?” referring to the recent ordinances providing for extending the terms of the Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation chiefs.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted, “My heartfelt congratulations to every single farmer who fought relentlessly and were not fazed by the cruelty with which BJP treated you. This is YOUR VICTORY!” and the party’s Rajya Sabha floor leader Derek O’Brien said, “Glad the true heroes, the farmers, have still NOT called off their protest. TV monologue will not do. Still work to be done in #Parliament.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-to-corner-government-on-msp-fuel-in-winter-session-101637347571452.html
20-11-2021||India||9 including 4 children die after house collapses in Tamil Nadu's Vellore amid heavy rain||Nine people died including four children when a house in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district collapsed this morning due to the heavy rains since Thursday caused by a depression that crossed the coast of north Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in the wee hours between 3am and 4am on November 19, officials said.District collector P Kumaravel Pandian said that the house was very old and that it was located along the banks of a river near Pernampet. “Four people resided in this house and as the rains got heavier people from adjacent houses moved to the first floor of this house on Thursday night for shelter,” the collector said. This locality was severely flooded.“The house was already in a dangerous condition because it is old and due to rains, it weakened further and around 7.15 this morning the house collapsed,” the collector said. Among the four children who were crushed to death, three of them are girls. Several others have also been injured in the collapse and are receiving treatment at Gudiyatham Government Hospital and Government Vellore Medical College Hospital in Adukkamparai.Chief Minister M K Stalin in a statement announced a financial assistance of ₹five lakh each to the bereaved families and ₹50,000 each for those undergoing treatment.Besides this tragic accident, no other major damage and loss to life was reported in other parts of the state.“The red alert issued to all the districts is being withdrawn,” S Balachandran, head, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Chennai said at a press conference. The IMD had issued a red alert to 16 districts including Chennai until November 18.In a bulletin, the RMC said that at 11.30 am on Friday, “The Depression over north Tamil Nadu moved west-northwestwards and weakened into a well marked low pressure area over north interior Tamil Nadu and adjoining Karnataka and Rayalaseema.” On Friday the amount of rainfall received in different parts of the state was Chennai- 5cm, Chengalpattu- 6 cm, Villupuram- 22 cm, Tiruvannamalai- 15 cm and the adjacent union territory of Puducherry was also lashed with 19cm.On Friday, the union government released a list of the seven-member team, led by Rajiv Shukla, Joint Secretary and Financial Advisor National Intelligence Grid, Union Ministry of Home Affairs who will be in Tamil Nadu to assess the damage due to the rains.The situation was worse during the previous heavy rains overnight between November 6 and 7 and on November 11 when Chennai received 21 cm and 16 cm respectively and normal life was thrown out of gear. Kanyakumari district was severely flooded after it received 83.96 cm rainfall from October 1 to November 15 while 38.99 cm is the average it receives. From October 1 to November 18, Chennai and Tamil Nadu received 66% and 61% of excess rainfall during this north east monsoon season. Due to the damage caused by these rains in which 54 people lost their lives and there has been heavy crop loss in the delta districts, Tamil Nadu on Wednesday sought ₹2629 crore as central aid from union home minister Amit Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-including-4-children-die-after-house-collapses-in-tamil-nadu-s-vellore-amid-heavy-rain-101637346592133.html

20-11-2021||India||Farm laws repealed: 5 ways in which Centre’s move will impact poll dynamics in Punjab||The repeal of three contentious farm laws by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Gurpurab (the 552nd birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev) is imbued with huge symbolism for Punjab which was the epicentre of dogged farm protests for more than a year. The surprise announcement -- a week before one of the most persistent protests against agriculture reforms in the nation’s recent history was to enter its second year with a renewed intensity -- is sure to impact the political dynamics in the poll-bound border state where the assembly election is slated for early next year. Here is how: REPRIEVE FOR BJP The end of the agitation, sustained by the groundswell of sentiment and support in the countryside, comes as a major breather for the party which was facing farmers’ ire on the ground. The farm laws not only led to rupture of its 24-year-old alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal which walked out of the National Democratic Alliance government last year, but also made it the prime target of the agitators’ wrath in rural Punjab. Now, the BJP is expected to leverage Modi’s well-timed gesture, which came two days after the Centre reopening the Kartarpur corridor to Pakistan for Sikh pilgrims, to regain the ground it lost in the Sikh constituency. The shrill politics over the agitation’s human toll of an estimated 700 deaths will cast a shadow on the party’s outreach in the first election that it will be contesting in Punjab without its pre-poll ally Shiromani Akali Dal since 1996. Still, the repeal of the laws may well open up new opportunities for it. CONGRESS UPS THE CREDIT WARThe ruling Congress in Punjab which has consistently opposed the farm laws and passed assembly resolutions rejecting the central legislation twice has been quick to credit the ‘anndata’ ( farmers) for “forcing” the Modi government to relent. Taking the political high ground on the Centre’s climbdown sits well with the party’s electoral objectives: to live down anti-incumbency and garner a slice in the rural vote pie. Not surprisingly, the Channi government, having already announced a string of concessions to farmers and other sections of voters, will now make the roll-back a key plank of its poll pitch in the assembly sweepstakes. Of course, the Aam Aadmi Party and Akalis will be competing with the Congress to milk the issue for all its worth. NEW POLITICAL EQUATIONS ON THE CARDS The repeal of the laws has opened possibilities of new political alignments and alliances in Punjab. It is a major relief for the Shiromani Akali Dal which was smarting under the double whammy of the break-up of its alliance with the BJP and a backlash from its core constituency among the peasantry for having initially supported the Modi government’s ordinances on farm reforms before the Parliament stamped them as the laws. Desperate to be in the reckoning, the Akalis forged an alliance with the BSP leaving 20 of 117 assembly seats to the junior partner. But, the elevation of Charanjit Singh Channi as Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister negated SAD’s caste card . The Akalis can now hope to recover some of the political ground they lost in their traditional bastion of Sikh peasantry. But, the key question in Punjab now is : will the SAD and the BJP warm up to each other and again forge an alliance that once welded the Sikh and Hindu constituencies in an electorally formidable way ? Not before the polls, say Punjab observers. Their reasons: one, the bitter overhang of agitation vis-à-vis BJP will not dissipate in the run-up to elections, two; Akali-bete noire Amarinder Singh has already cozied up to the BJP , and third; SAD has already moved on, firmed up its alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party and even announced seats. All this, however, doesn’t foreclose post-election options in case of a hung assembly. CLEARS THE WAY FOR CAPT-BJP TANGO The repeal of farm laws opens up the window for a poll tie-up between breakaway Congress leader and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who has floated a new party Punjab Lok Congress and hinted at seat sharing with the BJP in case there is a resolution of the farm issues. Though his party is yet to take off, the former two-time CM is counting on his political heft to woo disgruntled Congress leaders and make a common cause with the BJP to dent the party he was pushed out of unceremoniously. “I look forward to working closely with the BJP-led Centre for development of Kisan” Amarinder said in his post-repeal reaction, revealing his gambit. X- FACTOR OF FARM BODIESThe 32-bodies comprising the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, most of them rooted in Punjab, will be in a triumphant mode over the repeal of farm laws. But, will they take the electoral plunge to cash in on their victory? So far, they have ruled out contesting the polls. But, some of the SKM constituents, particularly the Rajewal faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, are known to harbour political ambitions. All political parties will try and co-opt the farm unions who, buoyed by the success of their tenacious agitation, will be an X-factor at the Punjab hustings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-repealed-5-ways-in-which-centre-s-move-will-impact-poll-dynamics-in-punjab-101637347095474.html
20-11-2021||India||2021 GSLV mission failed due to loss of pressure in fuel tank: Isro||The GSLV-F10 launch in August failed due to a small loss in pressure in the cryogenic upper stage of the launch vehicle, according to officials from the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). The space agency is yet to publicly release a summary or the failure analysis report of the mission.“The reason for the GSLV F-10 failure was a 50 millibar reduction in the LH-2 tank pressure,” said Dr V Narayanan, director of Isro’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, during his quality day celebration address at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapurams.The launch of the earth observation satellite EOS-03 aboard the Geostationary Launch Vehicle (GSLV F-10) failed on August 13 after the third stage of the rocket did not ignite due to a “technical anomaly,” the space agency said at the time. Usually, a review of what went wrong is undertaken by a committee after any launch failure.The GSLV is a three-stage rocket, with the first stage using solid fuel, the second stage using liquid fuel, and the third stage using cryogenic fuel – gases stored in liquid form at extremely low temperature – that enhances the carrying capacity of the rocket.In any cryogenic engine – like the one in GSLV that uses liquid oxygen and hydrogen as a fuel – the pressure inside the fuel tank needs to be maintained for a smooth flow of the fuel to the engine, preventing the tank from collapsing. Helium is added to the cryogenic engine as the fuel is used up to maintain pressure. The launch of Chandrayaan-2 in July 2019 was aborted last minute because there was a helium leak in the cryogenic stage that was detected during the pre-flight checks.This was the first major failure of the GSLV vehicle since 2010, when two consecutive malfunctions took place, earning the rocket the epithet “naughty boy”. For Isro, this was the only launch failure since the 2017 PSLV launch when a heat shield that protects the satellite within did not separate.The mission was delayed twice – once in March 2020 when the space agency said that there were technical glitches, and then again in March this year when the second wave of the pandemic hit. The GSLV F10 was only the second mission of 2021, and since the failure, the space agency hasn’t undertaken any launches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2021-gslv-mission-failed-due-to-loss-of-pressure-in-fuel-tank-isro-101637346913901.html
20-11-2021||India||Wankhede runs a bar, violating rules: NCP’s Malik||Continuing with his attack on Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, Maharashtra NCP minister Nawab Malik on Friday said that the officer violated central civil services (conduct) rules 1964 by conducting business despite being in service. Malik said Wankhede holds a hotel liquor license since 1997-98 and is running a bar in Navi Mumbai. It was issued when his father Dnyandev Wankhede was in the state excise department. “Sameer’s father was in the state excise department and he obtained a licence to run a permit room and bar in the name of Sameer. His age at that time was 17 years and 10 months. No licence is issued to a person who has not completed 18 years of age...still his father managed to get the licence in 1997-98. The licence is renewed every time in the name of Wankhede,” Malik told reporters here. “The information was concealed while joining the central government services and afterwards because according to the central civil services (conduct) rules 1964, no central government officer can conduct a business while being in services,” Malik said. Only in 2017, Wankhede declared that he owns the inherited property along with his father, which is a hotel but is on lease, Malik added. However, Wankhede refuted Malik’s allegation and said he had furnished details of his properties to his department and nothing was concealed. “We have nothing to conceal. I have furnished all the details right from the properties I own and income clearly with my department since the day I joined the civil services.”The NCP leader said he will file a complaint with the department of personnel and training (DoPT), state excise department and with all the concerned departments saying that Sameer Wankhede has no right to stay in the central government services. A person from the Wankhede family said his father is looking after the business and not Wankhede. “The hotel was bought by Wankhede’s mother Zaheda Bano in 1995 and she included him as joint owner of the property. He was a minor then. She looked after the business till 2015 and after her death, his father was made joint owner,” said a family member, requesting anonymity.The state minister has been making a slew of allegations against the IRS officer, ranging from forging documents to “lying” about his religion to framing people in ‘bogus’ drugs cases. In the past, Wankhede has denied all allegations made by Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wankhede-runs-a-bar-violating-rules-ncp-s-malik-101637346912814.html
20-11-2021||India||China ties passing through bad patch, says Jaishankar||India-China relations are currently passing through a “particularly bad patch” and India’s interests are better served with a closer relationship with the US and Europe, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Friday. In a reference to the standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Jaishankar said the downturn in ties was due to China’s actions that had violated bilateral pacts, and that he had conveyed to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during recent meetings where New Delhi stands on the relationship with Beijing. “We are going through a particularly bad patch in our relationship because they have taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which they still don’t have a credible explanation and that appears to indicate some rethink about where they want to take our relationship, but that’s for them to answer,” he said at a panel discussion on the theme “Greater power competition: The emerging world order” at the Bloomberg New Economic Forum in Singapore. “I don’t think the Chinese have any doubt on where we stand on our relationship and what’s not gone right with it. I’ve been meeting my counterpart Wang Yi a number of times. As you would’ve experienced, I speak fairly clear, reasonably understandably [and] there is no lack of clarity. So if they want to hear it, I am sure they would have heard it,” Jaishankar said in his reply to a question on whether China was aware of how it had mishandled relations with India. Jaishankar has said in the past that China had offered no credible explanation for the massing of troops on the LAC and the standoff that began in May last year. India has blamed China’s unilateral efforts to change the status quo on the disputed border for the face-off, which resulted in the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975. Twenty Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops were killed in a brutal clash in Galwan Valley in June last year. Though the two sides pulled back frontline troops at Pangong Lake and Gogra after several rounds of talks, there has been no headway in disengagement at other friction points since August. India has also linked the normalisation of overall ties with China to the resolution of the standoff. In response to another question at the discussion, which was also joined by former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and former UK prime minister Tony Blair, Jaishankar said India’s interests are better served “with a much closer relationship with the US, with a much stronger relationship with Europe and the UK, with a...re-energising of our relationship with Asean, especially Singapore”. “I think there’s no question the US has been strategically contracting for some time. Don’t confuse it with the decline of the US, I think that’s ridiculous. But relatively and absolutely, American power or American influence is not what it used to be,” he said. The US is now a “much more flexible partner, much more open to ideas, suggestions, and working arrangements than in the past”, and this reflects a changed world, he pointed out. At the same time, China has been expanding, though the nature of its growing influence is very different from that of the US. “We don’t have a situation where China necessarily replaces the US,” he said. The world is more multipolar now and a lot of countries, including India, have “come much more into play” as part of a rebalancing of power, Jaishankar said. The overall landscape has become “more volatile”, and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad is a good example of countries coming together on a set of concerns or issues, he added. Jaishankar acknowledged that some of the positioning by India is “about China”, and the steps being taken by the country are “partly a hedging strategy” and “partly autonomous partnerships” that are issue-based. The Covid-19 pandemic had accelerated this trend because it had raised questions about the old style of globalisation and highlighted the need for more reliable and resilient supply chains, he said. In this context, he pointed to the Quad initiative to produce and distribute US-developed Covid-19 vaccine made in India with Japan’s financial assistance and Australia’s logistics support. This initiative reflects decentralised globalisation, more resilient supply chains, more trust and transparency, and more flexible combinations producing solutions for a particular challenge, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-ties-passing-through-bad-patch-says-jaishankar-101637346911427.html
20-11-2021||India||Celebration, caution at epicentre of ‘rail roko’ protests in Punjab||When the Gurpurab procession began in Devi Dasspura village on Friday morning, a black flag put up prominently at the front of the cavalcade marked the villagers’ protest against the three farm laws. Less than two hours after the Prime Minister announced the withdrawal of the three laws, the black flag had made way for a white flag.The villagers were, however, in no hurry to alter their medium- and long-term plans against the farm laws.A tractor with half-a-dozen villagers will still leave for the Singhu border next Wednesday, their roster to send a tractor from the village to the protest site every month remains intact.The villagers remain cautious though. “The farm laws were passed in Parliament. The withdrawal will also happen in Parliament, not just on TV,” said Harjinder Singh, a farmer, while attending the festival celebrations at the local gurdwara.Located some 20km from the Golden Temple in Amritsar district, Devi Dasspura village is one of the very first spots to witness protests against the farm laws -- two months before farmers landed at the Delhi borders. It’s proximity to the railway lines made it a popular venue as hundreds of farmers joined a “rail roko” protest on three different occasions.What began as a shirtless protest on the tracks on September 26 last year soon took the shape of a full-fledged protest in which tents were set up on the railway lines and langars were being cooked for hundreds everyday. They hampered the movement of trains on this route for 169 days before packing up. “We began the protest after our memorandums to government officials were ignored. That drew the media’s attention to the farm bill issues,” said Manpreet Singh, the village chief.The village is situated two kilometres from the Grand Trunk Road. A narrow, winding and broken tar road leading to the village is flanked on both sides by ploughed farms, some of which have potatoes, mustard and cauliflower growing on them. Villages said that more than half of the 4,000 residents here are directly or indirectly dependent on farming.On Friday, the railway tracks bore no reminders of the protest, but the excitement due to the fresh development was palpable. The festival only gave the villagers a readymade reason to gather. The news dominated discussions in small and large groups gathered in and around the gurdwara.“It is like we have received a surprise gift,” said Kulwant Kaur, a homemaker belonging to a family of farmers actively involved in the “rail roko” protests.Even as the PM was making the announcement in the morning, the news was spreading like wildfire in the village and beyond.Gursevak Singh, a farmer who usually doesn’t watch news channels, happened to be in front of the TV when the PM appeared on the screen. “He was talking about farmers and Gurpurab. Suddenly my sixth sense was telling me that the laws were going to be repealed,” said Gursevak.Moments later, Gursevak was running to look for his wife. “She needed to know. She was sometimes apprehensive that all our efforts would amount to nothing,” said Gursevak.Harpal Singh, chief of the local gurdwara, knew that a dance by two villagers was to celebrate something more than the annual festival. “They were banging their chests against each other. They appeared mad,” he said.For most villagers, WhatsApp groups of protesters were the primary source of the news. Suddenly, the Gurpurab wishes gave way to congratulatory messages, details of the announcement and images and videos of the PM on TV. Many villagers were overwhelmed by the phone calls, many even from their relatives abroad.“Soon, there were no Gurpurab greetings unaccompanied by congratulatory messages for this victory,” said Kashmir Singh, member of the village panchayat.In no time, villagers were gathered in small groups. Some decided immediately to replace the black flag. Others discussed long-term plans.Among the first ideas was to enhance the prasad menu, but it was quite late for that. They wished the news had come in a day earlier. “But it is well that we don’t over celebrate. The victory has come at a heavy cost. We don’t want to insult the hundreds of farmers who died fighting for this victory. That would be selfish,” said Gursevak.Heavy fireworks, however, were hurriedly scheduled for the evening.When the protests began on the railway lines in September, villagers remember that they had to worry about food only on day one. “By the second day, several groups had taken over the food arrangements. There were protesters from four districts gathering here,” said Baljeet Kaur, another local woman.When the farmers eventually packed up from here, a few left for the Delhi borders while many occupied the toll plazas on GT Road near the village.The attendance, however, was dipping by the day.From as many as 30 villagers at once to just half-a-dozen at Singhu, the head count at the toll plazas sometimes dipped to as few as two.The toll plazas, however, were vibrant on Friday. All dressed in new, bright clothes and feasting on jalebis, the farmers discussed the news which also included lots of rumours. “The PM also called the farm laws ‘kaala kanoon’ (black laws) on TV today,” a farmer told the gathering. No one fact checked him.Be it at the village or at the toll plazas, future plans abound. Some villagers plan to attend a victory parade from Singhu to Punjab while those at the toll plaza speak about using the opportunity to correct other ills plaguing the farming sector. One villager planned to frame his photo at Singhu border protest site as “proof” of his being a part of “history”.“My children can be proud that I was part of a different kind of freedom struggle,” said Gursevak.While the villagers were united in their celebrations, they remained a divided lot when it came to their attitude towards the government. While a few were joyous and spoke about “forgiving” the government, others were unwilling to forget. “This is not a gift given happily. We sacrificed a lot to snatch this gift,” said Harvinder Singh, a local farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-repealed-celebration-caution-at-epicentre-of-rail-roko-protests-in-punjab-101637346857228.html
20-11-2021||India||Government panel approves mining on non-forest land without lease clearance||The Union environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) has decided to approve mining in non-forest land even before forest clearance is granted to allow the activity in contiguous forest land in blocks where mining involves both types of lands, people familiar with the matter said.According to minutes of a FAC meeting dated October 28, which was uploaded on the ministry’s Parivesh website earlier this month and seen by HT, the committee approved commencing of mining in non-forest land but also imposed certain conditions.The panel ruled that plans for mining in non-forest areas of a coal block will not involve any forest area; no component of mining activity in the non-forest land shall have any dependency in the forest area of the same block; such permission in the non-forest area shall not create any obligation or fait accompli with regard to clearances for the forest land involved; and if mining is intended in the forest area of the coal block, no reference of mining already taken up in non-forest area shall be made in such proposals.In case of any violation over forest area, the matter shall be dealt with as per provisions in the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, the panel added.“The minutes are self-explanatory, so I do not want to comment on them,” a FAC member said, seeking anonymity.Experts believe that permitting mining in non-forest land before prior clearance to contiguous forest land could set a wrong precedent.“Mineral extraction and greater privatisation of mining operations, including that of coal, has been at the front and centre of the government’s economic priorities. These policy decisions are neither assessed for their ecological or social justice outcomes, nor are they evaluated for they may exacerbate global climate justice concerns. The changes to environment regulation mirrors this outlook. The present decision needs to be understood as another legal subsidy offered to the mining sector. The mitigation measures and conditions offered legitimise the overturning of precaution which were built in forest diversion procedures. The FAC’s final advice falls short of its own caution. Eventually, this decision, despite all the caveats, will allow for fragmentation of habitats and put undue pressure on regulators to approve forest diversion to protect the investments already carried out,” Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research, said.HT in July had reported that the environment ministry is considering requests by the coal ministry to allow mining in non-forest areas where clearance has not been granted for the entire lease area, which includes forest land. To avoid “fait accompli” situations where mining begins before requisite permissions are granted, the FAC had directed the environment ministry’s regional office to prepare a briefing paper on the inter-dependency of forest and non-forest land where mining involves both land types.The ministry, in its guidelines, says that work on non-forest land should not be started till the final forest clearance (Stage-II approval) of the Centre is granted. In light of the FAC decision, these guidelines are likely to be changed.Environment ministry’s secretary, RP Gupta, however did not agree with FAC’s caution on preventing a ‘fait accompli’ situation. “I don’t agree with the recommendation of FAC. Even though lease area may include forest area, we are under no obligation to grant forest clearance. There can be no fait-accompli. If a project proponent undertakes mining operations in non-forest areas, it is none of our business to stop it and certainly casts no obligation on us to grant forest clearance. If some expenditure of the project proponent becomes infructuous, so be it,” he said.Following the secretary’s observations, the FAC had directed the regional office of Bhopal to prepare a comprehensive briefing paper on an all-India basis on the matter.The regional office recommended that in case of violations, the mining company should forgo a bank guarantee which may be prescribed, for such cases; relevant State Forest Act/Indian Forest Act whatever is relevant for such violation may be made applicable; and a penal compensation provision for violation of guidelines may be prescribed. The office had also recommended that the mining company give an undertaking that it will not claim a fait accompli plea in case of rejection of forest area for diversion.These views were taken into consideration by the FAC before deciding on the matter.At the Glasgow climate change conference earlier this month, India had objected to a draft text of the COP26 decision on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies, suggesting that dependence on coal and fossil fuel subsidies be gradually reduced in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards a just transition.“We are dependent on coal, we probably have to enhance it and we are giving subsidies to poor people to help them have a basic subsistence level. To compare that with general utilisation, 20 times of the kind of energy (used) in some developed countries, is unfair,” a senior government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-panel-approves-mining-on-non-forest-land-without-lease-clearance-101637346853929.html
20-11-2021||India||Farm laws repealed: UP elections key driver behind Centre rethink?||Two politically significant decisions by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) clearly show that west UP continues to remain crucial for translating into reality the party’s slogan, “Ek baar phir, 300 paar.” (One more time; over 300 ). The party hopes to return to power with almost as many seats as it won in 2017 (312 in the 403 seat assembly). First, the party decided that the Braj-Paschim region would be handled by Union home minister Amit Shah. Second, on Friday, the Prime Minister announced the withdrawal of three contentious farm laws.  Shah scripted the BJP’s spectacular victories in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the 2017 Vidhan Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh. The Braj-Paschim zone, as defined by the BJP, has six divisions, each comprising three districts. The party won 115 out of 135 assembly seats in 2017 and 24 of 27 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In all , the BJP won 312 out of 403 seats in 2017 and, along with its allies, 62 of the 80 seats in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.However, a few months before the 2022 assembly polls, the party’s fortunes appeared bleak in an area engulfed by the farm agitation. BJP leaders were facing the wrath of people in villages—many even put up signs stopping their entry.The party’s prospects looked brighter in the other regions such as Kanpur, Gorakhpur, Awadh and Kashi where the party’s national president JP Nadda and Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh are scheduled to conduct booth presidents’ conclaves shortly.It was clear that the BJP could not offset losses in the western part of the state elsewhere. As a senior BJP leader from the area remarked: “If we lose the west, we lose the state. The road to UP and to Delhi goes via west (UP) only.”Many in the party pointed to critical and angry statements from senior Jat leader and Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik, who has consistently and vocally opposed the farm laws.“As a senior Jat leader from the area, Malik knew the sentiments of his clan. He would have never violated discipline that binds him while holding a constitutional position otherwise,” said another party leader who asked not to be named.The farmer’s movement gave life to opposition parties in the region, especially the Rashtriya Lok Dal, whose president Jayant Chaudhary lost the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It also served to remove communal fault lines that emerged in the area after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots.This was worrisome for the BJP, which launched its 2014 campaign from the western part of the state. In the wake of the riots, Narendra Modi, then the prime ministerial candidate promised development, and Yogi Adityanath, then a member of Parliament, promised to protect the people of the area, raising issues such as love jihad. Since then, the region remained the BJP’s stronghold till the farm laws were introduced.Agriculture is the lifeblood of people in the 21 western districts of the state. Prominent politicians in the region came from the farming community and agrarian issues dominated electoral politics till the launch of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Till then, people preferred to be identified as kisan (farmer), and less by their religion or caste—farming being the main occupation of 90% of the populace. Former Prime Minister the late Charan Singh helped in building Majgar, an alliance of Muslim, Ahir, Jat, Gujjar and Rajput voters. Singh died in May 1987. Almost the same time, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad launched a sustained public movement for the liberation of Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya.The 1990s saw the rise of the Bhartiya Kisan Union under Mahendra Singh Tikait amid cries of Jai Sri Ram and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) under the leadership of Kanshi Ram and Mayawati. Farmers supported Tikait on farming related issues but made their own political choices. Majgar, too, collapsed, with the BSP penetrating the strongholds of the Dalits.However, the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 dealt the final blow to farmer unity, dividing them on caste and religious lines with the BJP being the major gainer.It was in this context that the farm laws, and their opposition by farmers in the region, united under the banner of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, became significant.Former MLA Anil Chaudhary (now in the Congress) who had been attending all mahapanchayats called by the farmers said: “In the initial days of the movement, only Jats and a few Gujjar office bearers of BKU were seen on the Ghazipur border. Muslims were few. Later, all castes and communities joined hands under one banner.” However, there were some like Jamshed Zaidi, a political analyst who remain sceptical about this unity. “Will a Jat vote for a Muslim?” he asked.Now, the withdrawal of the farm laws has punctured the Opposition’s plan to reap a harvest in the 2022 assembly elections, although much is still riding on Shah’s ability to assuage the hurt sentiments of the farmers who spent chilly nights under the sky.Shah will soon embark on a rath yatra. He is known for his meticulous poll planning and organisational skills, but this time, his challenge lies elsewhere: Shah will have to wipe tears and gain confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-repealed-up-elections-key-driver-behind-centre-rethink-101637346851421.html
20-11-2021||India||39 feared dead in TN, Andhra rain disaster||At least 30 people were feared to have died when they got washed away in floodwaters from Cheyyeru river as the earthen bund of Annamayya reservoir in Rajampet of Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district was breached after heavy rain and nine people, including four children, died in north Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district in two separate incidents on Friday. The heavy rainfall in north Tamil Nadu districts and south Andhra districts and parts of Rayalaseema since Thursday night was due to a depression that crossed the coast of north Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh between 3am and 4am on November 19, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said. Vellore collector P Kumaravel Pandian said a house destroyed by the flood was very old and located along the banks of a river near Pernampet. “Four people resided in this house and as the rain got heavier people from adjacent houses moved to the first floor of this house on Thursday night for shelter,” the collector said. This locality was severely flooded. “The house was already in a dangerous condition because it is old and due to rain, it weakened further and around 7.15 this morning the house collapsed,” the collector said. Among the four children who were crushed to death, three were girls. Several others have also been injured in the collapse and are receiving treatment at Gudiyatham Government Hospital and Government Vellore Medical College Hospital in Adukkamparai.Flooding in some localities of Bengaluru city was also reported due to continuous rainfall since November 11. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) in a statement said no adverse incident was reported and a few persons from low-lying areas were shifted to shelters as a precautionary measure. However, no flooding was reported in Chennai, which has reported massive water-logging on at least two occasions in the past month.In Andhra Pradesh, Kadapa district authorities confirmed that three bodies – that of a conductor and two passengers of a state-run Road Transport Corporation bus that was stranded in floodwaters from Cheyyeru – were recovered. Unconfirmed reports said 12 bodies were recovered till evening.Apart from the three bodies from the RTC bus, seven dead bodies were recovered at a temple in Gundluru village, and two others in Mandapalli village. “Search operations are on for others who are believed to have been washed away in the floods,” a local revenue official of Rajampet, who did not wish to be named, said.Three RTC buses got stranded in Mandapalli, Akepadu and Nandaluru areas. While many of the passengers were rescued by authorities, three of them, including the bus conductor, were washed away in the floods at Nandaluru.According to state disaster management commissioner K Kanna Babu, the depression in the Bay of Bengal crossed the coast between Chennai and Puducherry around 4am on Friday, and there was heavy to very heavy rain in many parts of Chittoor, Kadapa, and Prakasam districts and Anantapur, along with gales with speeds of 45-65 km per hour.A bulletin from AP State Development Planning Society (APSDPS) showed Peddamandyam in Chittoor district received the highest rainfall of 207mm in the last 36 hours, followed by 187.25mm in Rayachoti in Kadapa, 178.25mm in Nallacheruvu in Anantapur, 172.5mm in Pulivendula of Kadapa and 171mm in Kalakada in Chittoor.In many other areas of Rayalaseema and south Andhra, rainfall ranged from 110mm to 170mm during this period, the APSDPS bulletin said.The temple town of Tirumala-Tirupati, which was completely flooded due to heavy rain on Thursday, is slowly limping back to normal though the area is still receiving rain. Tirupati has received 103mm since 8am on Thursday, the bulletin said.Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which manages the popular Hindu shrine of Lord Venkateshwara on the Tirumala hills, announced in the morning resumption of traffic on one of the two ghat roads that were shut down for the last 24 hours due to landslides and overflowing streams on the hills.But by evening, it again announced closure of the ghat road in order to repair the damaged road. TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Reddy said due to unprecedented rain, boulders and hill rocks had fallen at different points on both ghats. “As a safety measure we have closed both ghats on Thursday evening. The restoration work is going on,” he said. Due to the heavy downpour witnessed on Thursday in Tirupati, the Kapilatheertham torrent was in full flow, forcing the TTD authorities to stall the entry of pilgrims. The gushing waters of Kapila Teertham uprooted three of the temple pillars, Reddy said. He said the exact damage to the temple will be known once rainwater recedes. Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who reviewed the flood situation in the state with senior officials and district collectors through video conference, said he will conduct an aerial survey of the affected areas on Saturday.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up the chief minister and enquired about the flood situation in the state. Modi assured him of all help, an official statement from the chief minister’s office said.A railway track between Rajavaram and Pundluru was washed away at Rajampet, resulting in stranding of the Chennai Express and a couple of other passenger trains. Train services were restored later in the evening. A bridge on Papaghni river at Kamalapuram in Kadapa district caved in, forcing authorities to stop traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/39-feared-dead-in-tn-andhra-rain-disaster-101637346672568.html

20-11-2021||India||PM Modi hands over indigenous LCHs, drones to armed forces in Jhansi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi ceremonially handed over the indigenously developed light combat helicopter (LCH), drones and electronic warfare suite to the three services as part of the Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv at a ceremony in Jhansi on Friday.He said the defence event was the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the defence sector in India. Laying emphasis on gaining self-reliance in defence, the PM said, “India’s identity was that of an importer of arms. Today, the country’s mantra is ‘Make in India, Make for the World’. The country is working to make our armed forces ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant).We are adding the talent of private sector with our defence sector and new start-ups are being given a chance to show their ‘kamaal’ (good work) in this sector.”“The mantra is Make in India—Make for the World,” he said, adding the Ministry of Defence has released a list of 200 military equipment that would be bought from Indian companies to boost Atmanirbhar Bharat.At the ceremony, Modi formally gave light combat helicopter (LCH) designed and developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari, drones and UAVs built by Indian start-ups to Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, and the DRDO-designed and Bharat Electronics Limited-manufactured advanced electronic warfare suite for naval ships to Navy chief Admiral Karambir SinghHe also laid the foundation stone of a ₹ 400 crore plant of Bharat Dynamics Limted, the first unit of the Jhansi node of UP Defence Industrial Corridor that would come up on 183 acres.This initiative would give Jhansi a new recognition, boost MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) in the Bundelkhand region and create job opportunities for the youth, he said.The prime minister said the Bundelkhand region, once known for its valour and courage, would be playing the role of “sarathi’ in the UP Defence Industrial Corridor and would be one of the major centres of India’s defence strength.Referring to the opening of 100 new Sainik schools across the country that he launched from Jhansi, the PM said,“These 100 Sainik Schools will work to put the future of the country in the hands of powerful people.” “Admission of girl students has started in 33 Sainik schools. They will produce daughters like Rani Laxmi Bai to take the responsibility of defence, security and development of the country,” he said.He interacted with 33 newly joined girl students from Sainik Schools, representing all the 33 Sainik Schools in the country.In all, the PM laid the foundation for projects worth ₹3,414 crore in Jhansi. It included an ultra mega solar park worth ₹3000 crore in Garautha, which would produce 600 megawatt of electricity on completion.Modi also launched the National Cadet Corps (NCC) Alumni Association in Jhansi.Besides, the prime minister reached Jhansi Fort and launched the National Programme of Simulation Training for NCC cadets with the aim to scale up simulation training facilities for all three wings of NCC.

20-11-2021||India||Shah calls for better coordination among forces||Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday stressed on better coordination between the state police forces and central agencies and underlined the need for focused action on security-related issues such as Maoist violence and cyber crime.Inaugurating the three-day 56th conference of DGPs (Director General of Police) and IGPs (Inspector General of Police) at the Police Headquarters in Lucknow, Shah appreciated the role played by security forces during the Covid-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also participate in the conference on Saturday.Shah also awarded trophies to three top police stations of the country. The top spot was grabbed by Sadar Bazar police station of New Delhi, followed by Gangapur police station in Odisha and Bhattu Kalan police station in Haryana, stated a press released shared by the UP Police.The home minister also gave away medals for meritorious service to the officers of Intelligence Bureau. In his address, Shah stressed on better coordination between the state police and other central agencies and urged the delegates for timely implementation of suggestions discussed during the conference. He underlined the need to focus on security-related issues, including coastal security, left wing extremism, narcotics trafficking, cyber crime and border area management.Besides, deliberations were held on a wide range of internal security issues, including prison reforms, challenges posed by radicalisation and police training. In the run-up to the conference, various core groups comprising DGPs of different states were formed for holding discussions on key aspects of internal security.This year, for the first time, over 200 officers of different seniorities from various states/UTs were also requested to submit papers on contemporary security issues being deliberated in the conference.The conference is being organised in hybrid mode. DGPs of all states/UTs and DGs of CAPFs will attend the conference for the next two days at UP police headquarters in Lucknow. In addition, about 350 other officers will attend the same through virtual platform from IB offices in various states and UTs.Shah hailed the hybrid format of conference, as directed by the Prime Minister, and observed that this will help in better dissemination and percolation of suggestions at the cutting edge level. He emphasised on reforms at police station and beat level for effective policing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-calls-for-better-coordination-among-forces-101637346557138.html
20-11-2021||India||PM Modi unveils water project in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, targets Opposition||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday dedicated the ₹2,655-crore Arjun Sahayak project to the people of Uttar Pradesh’s Bundelkhand, saying it would end the water woes of farmers in the parched region while accusing the previous state government and other “family-owned” parties of looting the region, its people and resources. “This project will benefit lakhs of farmers. They will get the water they have been waiting for generations in Bundelkhand,” Modi said, while addressing the farmers, hours after making the announcement to repeal the Centre’s three contentious farm laws. Arjun Sahayak is a flagship project of the Uttar Pradesh government, aimed at providing water for drinking and irrigation in Mahoba district. “I discussed this crucial project with the then government several times in 2014. They did not show any interest. It was the lifeline of this region,” he said, adding that the work on the project began under the Yogi Adityanath government in 2017 and was completed in record time. Accusing the previous state government of corruption, Modi said, “Those who kept cutting ribbons in the name of Bundelkhand’s ponds and water bodies for farmers did not allow a single penny to reach them.” “I want to ask those parties, which ruled UP and Delhi, how this naturally gifted region became synonymous with struggles for water to an extent the people did not want to marry off their daughters in this region?” he asked. “They worked for their families, there was corruption and commission, and you (farmers) remained desperate for a single drop of water,” the PM said, alleging that the previous governments handed the region over to the mafia. “Now when the bulldozer is being used against mafia, some people are raising hue and cry. But whatever they may try to do, the development UP and Bundelkhand will not stop,” Modi said. Uttar Pradesh will go to assembly polls early next year. Stating that many water-related projects were underway in the state, Modi said the Yogi Adityanath-led state government found the solution for the Ken-Betwa link in consultation with the stakeholders. The linking would help lakhs of farmers in the days to come, he added. Modi said the challenges were similar to those in Gujarat’s Sardar Sarovar dam project, which has helped in water reaching even the arid areas of Kutch. “I am from Gujarat and I understand your issues. We will replicate the success of Gujarat in Bundelkhand,” Modi said. The PM said his government has taken a number of steps for the welfare of farmers, including providing neem-coated urea, high-yield seeds with low use of water and made record purchase of crops and increased minimum support price. Calling top BJP leaders and government “kainchi-jeevi (those who live for cutting ribbons)”, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav yet again attack BJP governments at the state and the centre over “taking credit for SP government’s projects” and this time it’s over inauguration of Arjun Sahayak irrigation project. Akhilesh in a tweet in Hindi said: “The project that had reached 99% completion in SP government’s time, the BJP government took five years to complete it. But they ran in to take credit for it...”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-unveils-water-project-in-poll-bound-uttar-pradesh-targets-opposition-101637346553683.html
20-11-2021||India||Rajasthan: Three ministers offer to quit posts before cabinet rejig||Days ahead of a Cabinet reshuffle, three Rajasthan ministers on Friday wrote to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, offering to quit their posts and work for the party.A senior leader familiar with the developments said that the cabinet rejig is likely to take place on Sunday or Monday. Addressing reporters here, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken said revenue minister Harish Chaudhary, medical and health minister Dr Raghu Sharma and education minister Govind Singh Dotasra offered to step down from their ministerial posts.“I want to remind that two-three months back, on July 30, I had met all the MLAs here and thereafter had told that some ministers want to work with the party and leave their ministerial post. I am happy to inform that three ministers today wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi and offered their resignation from the post,” Maken said. These three ministers have expressed their desire to work with the party, he added.The resignation of the three ministers came on expected lines as they were holding dual positions. Besides ministerial posts, Choudhary is incharge of poll-bound Punjab while Sharma is overseeing party affairs in Gujarat. Dotasara is the Rajasthan state party chief. “The Congress party respects them. We are glad that there are such promising people who want to work for the party,” Maken, who arrived in Jaipur on Friday evening, said With the three resignations, the number of vacancies in the 30-member council of ministers rose to 12. Prior to this, nine vacancies were pending since July 2020 when deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and two lawmakers loyal to him resigned during a rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. At present, there are 21 ministers in the Rajasthan council of ministers, including the chief minister. Meanwhile, Maken was received by Gehlot, Dotasara, and transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas as he arrived at Jaipur airport, in the evening. The chief minister, who was on a tour to Udaipur, also returned to the capital city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-three-ministers-offer-to-quit-posts-before-cabinet-rejig-101637346372572.html
20-11-2021||India||Farm laws to go after year of protest||New Delhi In a surprise speech to the nation on Friday morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government would repeal three agricultural laws enacted last year that set off protests by tens of thousands of farmers across several states, and on Delhi’s borders.Opposition parties were quick to label the decision a victory for the farmers and a defeat for the government; the protesting farm groups said they plan to hold out for more, including a codification of the price at which the government buys agricultural produce; and analysts pointed to the continuing need to reform agriculture which, in its present form, remains mostly uncompetitive and unremunerative.The decision to scrap the laws comes ahead of crucial state elections in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous state, and Punjab, where farmers are an influential voting bloc.In a nationally televised address to farmers on the birth anniversary of Sikhism’s revered founder, Guru Nanak, the Prime Minister said: “Today, while apologising to the people of the country, I want to say with a pure heart, that maybe there was some shortcoming in our efforts that we could not explain to some of our farmer brothers a truth that was as clear as a flame. Today on Guru Nanak’s birthday, it is not time to blame anyone... Today I have come to tell you, the whole country, that we have decided to withdraw all three agricultural laws.”A sizeable section of the protesting farmers is from Sikh-majority Punjab.“In the Parliament session starting later this month, we will complete the constitutional process to repeal these three agricultural laws,” Modi added, urging protesting farmers to return home to their families.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella platform for farm unions, said it welcomed the move but that the battle was only half won, referring to the farmers’ yet-unmet demand for a law guaranteeing minimum support prices (MSPs) for their produce. MSPs are state-assured floor rates meant to help avoid distress sale.Reacting to the Prime Minister’s announcement, Rakesh Tikait, a key leader behind the protests and a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said: “We are not immediately withdrawing the protests. We will wait and watch to see what actually happens. Also, we want a law on MSP.”Farm unions, largely from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been holding yearlong sit-ins at four sites near Delhi’s borders: Singhu, Ghaziabad, Tikri, Dhansa and also at Shahjahanpur (on the Rajasthan-Haryana border).The farm bodies managed to keep the protests largely apolitical, despite support from many opposition parties. On Friday, these parties congratulated the farmers for their victory.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said the “Country’s ‘annadatas’ (food providers) have made arrogance bow its head through satyagraha”. “Congratulations on this victory against injustice! ‘Jai Hind, Jai Hind ka Kisan’,” Gandhi said.Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee congratulated the farmers for their relentless fight, saying they were not fazed by the “cruelty” of the BJP. “My heartfelt congratulations to every single farmer who fought relentlessly and were not fazed by the cruelty with which @BJP4India treated you. This is YOUR VICTORY! My deepest condolences to everyone who lost their loved ones in this fight. #FarmLaws,” Banerjee tweeted.The Prime Minister said the laws, enacted in September 2020, would have brought long-term benefits and opened up more markets for farmers to sell their produce, but rued that his government could not convince a section of farmers.“Our intent [in passing the laws] was pure,” he added, “but we could not convince some farmers. We tried our best to explain these laws to the farmers. The government was ready to rework these laws.”Farmers were deeply sceptical of the laws they said will leave them at the mercy of big corporations, which could force down prices. They also feared the changes would dismantle a system of state-backed regulated markets which offered assured farm prices.The government saw the laws as helping enlarge the market for farm produce, and also increase the role of the private sector in agriculture.Farm leaders such as Tikait, once supporters of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), began to increasingly target the Modi government’s entire economic agenda, labelling recent moves to divest state-run companies as a “sell-off”.Soon after the announcement on Friday, the SKM said it was preparing to summon its decision-making team. Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a farm leader from Haryana, said preparations to mark a year of the protests on November 26 would continue.Leaders such as Chaduni and Tikait bolstered the farm protests by bringing it out of Punjab and expanding its sphere of influence.The agitation against the three laws to liberalise agricultural trade widened into a full-scale campaign against the BJP by influential farm unions in food-bowl states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.“We have several mahapanchyats (farmers’ rallies) in UP and Haryana. As of now, we will go ahead with them,” Chaduni said.The government held 11 rounds of negotiations, the last on January 22, which failed to resolve the crisis. On January 12, the Supreme Court put a moratorium on the laws, following which the government said it would freeze the law for one-and-half years.“It is a victory for democracy but a partial victory. We had two demands, one [was to] repeal the three laws. Second, give us a legal guarantee of minimum support price, something the prime minister had himself demanded when he was chief minister of Gujarat,” said Yogendra Yadav, one of the main organisers of the protests. “That has not been considered yet. That struggle will go on.”The government in the past has argued the changes will not alter an existing state-backed system of regulated markets which give farmers assured prices, but would boost investments in the farm economy. Nearly half the population in Asia’s third largest economy depends on a farm-derived income.The laws aimed to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce, allow food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreement.The three laws are: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Anil Jaysing Ghanwat, the leader of Shetkari Sangathana, a Maharashtra-based farm organisation, criticised the decision of the government to roll back the farm laws. Ghanwat was one of the members of a Supreme Court-appointment committee to scrutinise the laws.“The move to repeal the laws is unfortunate for farmers and the country because the laws would have given some market freedom to farmers,” Ghanwat said.To calm farmers, Modi on Friday said that the welfare of the farming community would continue to drive his government. “I announce the formation of a committee to promote zero-budgeting-based agriculture, to change crop pattern as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent.” The committee will be represented by officials from the Union government, state governments, farmers, agricultural scientists and economists, he said.On October 2, the protests entered an aggravated phase in UP when a convoy of vehicles belonging to Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra, ploughed through protesters, killing four farmers and four others. The minister’s son has been arrested.“Farmers had sustained their agitation and this created a certain narrative and awareness across the country that injustice was being done. Since it was an autonomous movement, no political party could take credit for it. This created a space for the government to announce withdrawing the laws,” said KK Kailash, who teaches politics at the University of Hyderabad.In his address to the nation, the PM Modi also said it was unfortunate that despite the government’s intentions to strengthen and empower farmers particularly those who have small land holdings, many of them were not convinced about the benefits of the laws.Modi underlined how his government had prioritised welfare of farmers and drafted policies and interventions such as introducing soil health cards, crop insurance and credit cards to empower famers.“The agriculture budget has been increased five times and a ₹1 lakh crore agriculture infrastructure fund has been set up… to empower smaller farmers… 10,000 FPOs have been started and ₹7,000 crore spent on it,” he said.Referring to the contentious laws, he said they were brought in with the intention of giving the country’s farmers more strength and better prices for their crops, apart from more options to sell their produce.“For years, farmers of the country, agricultural experts of the country and farmers’ organizations of the country were continuously making this demand. Earlier also many governments had brainstormed on this. This time also there was discussion in Parliament, brainstorming took place and these laws were brought up. In every nook and corner of the country, many farmers’ organizations welcomed and supported it,” the PM said.“Though it’s a small section of farmers who are protesting, but even then, it is important for us. Agri experts and scientists and progressive farmers have tried, made efforts to make them understand with an open mind the importance of agricultural laws...we tried to keep explaining through various means, personal as well as collective” the PM said.(Smriti Kak Ramachandran contributed to this report)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-to-go-after-year-of-protest-101637340490232.html

People of the state, including that of his own constituency Kuppam, have openly rejected him, the chief minister said after former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu broke down in the Assembly and said he will only enter the Assembly as a chief minister."I have been bearing the insults for the sake of people, but remained calm. Today, they have targeted even my wife. I always lived with honour and for honour. I can take it no more," Chandrababu said as he cried on camera when he was addressing the press meet.Naidu said his wife never entered into politics, not even when Naidu was in power. “Except encouraging me in every step of my life, she never interfered in politics, whether I was in or out of power. Yet they tried to humiliate her,” Naidu said.“I faced several struggles, ups and downs in my life. I witnessed several heated debates in the assembly both when he was in power or in the opposition. But this kind of running down the opposition is unprecedented," Naidu said sobbing.“What is more unfortunate is that the Speaker remained a mute spectator when the ruling party members were hurling abuses, even dragging my wife’s name. He did not even give me an opportunity to speak and make a statement on my decision to stay away from the assembly for the rest of the term. I had to fight for my right,” Naidu said.Calling it a drama, Jagan said, "Yes, Chandrababu Naidu’s condition, and that he is in frustration, is known not only to me, but also to everyone in the state. People of the state have openly rejected him. Even in his own Kuppam constituency, he, unimaginably, faced people’s rejection,”"Chandrababu only seeks to derive political mileage out of everything. It is very unfortunate. His drama was visible to all eyes, though I was not inside the House at the time,” Jagan who later came to the House said.Jagan said his party MLAs did not speak anything about Naidu's family members. "It was Chandrababu himself who spoke about my family members (slain uncle, mother and sister) and there was no reference to his family from our side. The House records clearly prove that," Jagan added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/everyone-knows-chandrababu-is-in-frustration-jagan-on-naidu-s-breakdown-101637337125189.html
20-11-2021||India||PM Modi hands over Light Combat Helicopters to IAF chief||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday handed over the indigenously built light combat helicopters (LCH), developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, to the Indian Air Force chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari. He also handed over indigenously developed drones and UAVs during the ‘Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv’ in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi to the Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane.The initiative is a part of boosting the nation’s self-reliance in the defence sector. During the event, the Prime Minister handed over the Advanced Electronic Warfare suite for naval ships to the Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh. The Advanced Electronic Warfare suite was developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).“For a long time, we were a nation that was a weapons and defence equipment buyer. Today the mantra is ‘Make in India, Make for the world.’ India is now working to make its armed forces self-reliant,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.These projects will make the nation’s defence sector self-reliant will boost employment opportunities for the youth, he said.The Light Combat Helicopters which incorporate advanced technologies and stealth features for effective combat roles are expected to boost India’s ability to remain self-reliant. Earlier, defence secretary Ajay Kumar said the LCH is the only attack helicopter that can land and take off at an altitude of 5,000 m with a considerable load of weapons and fuel.PM Modi laid the foundation stone of a ₹400-crore project to develop the propulsion system of the anti-tank guided missiles by the Bharat Dynamics Limited which is the first project in the Jhansi node of defence industrial corridor created in Uttar Pradesh. He also launched two projects related to the National War Memorial in New Delhi among which was a kiosk that allows visitors to pay floral homage to martyrs through a click of a button.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-hands-over-light-combat-helicopters-to-iaf-chief-101637332112648.html
20-11-2021||India||Naidu breaks down, walks out of Andhra assembly over abusive comments||Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu broke down on Friday as he walked out of the state assembly vowing not to re-enter the House for the rest of its term over the abusive comments ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) members allegedly made about his wife.“I will not attend this assembly hereafter. I will return to the House only after becoming the chief minister,” said Naidu, 71. He fought back tears before walking out of the assembly with folded hands during a debate on the women empowerment on the second day of the assembly’s ongoing winter session.Naidu was unable speak for a few minutes as he covered his face after breaking down while addressing a press conference at his Telegu Desam Party (TDP)’s state headquarters. He said his wife had never been in politics. “Except encouraging me in every step of my life, she never interfered in politics, whether I was in or out of power. Yet they tried to humiliate her,” Naidu said. He added he never felt so much tormented in his 40-year political career. “I faced several struggles, ups and downs in my life. I witnessed several heated debates in the assembly both when he was in power or in the opposition. But this kind of running down the opposition is unprecedented.”Naidu likened the assembly to Kaurava Sabha of epic Mahabharata, where Kauravas humiliated Pandavas by trying to disrobe Draupadi. “What is more unfortunate is that the Speaker remained a mute spectator when the ruling party members were hurling abuses, even dragging my wife’s name. He did not even give me an opportunity to speak and make a statement on my decision to stay away from the assembly for the rest of the term. I had to fight for my right,” he said. He said he has been concerned about safeguarding his dignity and prestige. “I have been facing humiliations for the last two and a half years. When my dignity is compromised, there is no point in attending the assembly. I will take my fight into the people and seek their support. I will return to the assembly only after obtaining the mandate of the people as the chief minister.”Earlier in the day, TDP legislators tried to disrupt YSRCP member Ambati Rambabu’s speech when he was attacking the opposition party. TDP members stormed the podium in protest and demanded an apology from him when Rambabu allegedly made some nasty comments while referring to Naidu’s wife. Other YSRCP members, including ministers Balineni Srinivasa Reddy and Kodali Nani, also rushed to the podium and clashed with the TDP members. Naidu took exception to the YSRCP members behaviour and left the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-breaks-down-walks-out-of-andhra-assembly-over-abusive-comments-101637318170796.html
20-11-2021||India||Four key takeaways from the BJP’s U-turn on farm laws||Faced with a resilient farmers’ agitation for more than a year, the Narendra Modi government has decided to repeal the three contentious farm laws, making it perhaps the biggest political retreat by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since it assumed power in 2014.What are the key takeaways from the latest turn of events surrounding the farmers’ protest? Here are four things that stand out:BJP won’t risk political capital for policy credentialsIt is clear that the farm laws have been repealed with an eye on coming assembly elections, especially the ones in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. While this is clearly the biggest political retreat by the BJP since 2014, it is not the first one. The government had done a U-turn on the issue of amending the Land Acquisition Act when protests erupted across the country during the first term of the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in 2015.The underlying message is clear. The BJP as a party will never risk its political capital to establish its policy credentials. Modi, in his address to the nation on Friday, reiterated the claim that the farm laws were beneficial for farmers and the failure was only on account of making just a small section of farmers see these gains.Also Read: Repeal of farm laws to impact multiple proceedings in Supreme CourtThe retreat will get the BJP a lot of brickbats within the pro-reform lobby, both in India and abroad. Agriculture and labour are the two key sectors where the Modi government was expected to unleash reforms – the ideological consensus within the establishment has existed for a long time – and it stepped on the pedal on these fronts during the Covid-19 pandemic from a position of strength.The latest move is a signal that reforms, even though the BJP claims steadfast commitment to the project, are not worth risking the political fortunes of the party. This is not different from the approach the BJP - perhaps in consultation with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) - adopted vis-a-vis the core Hindtuva agenda during the Vajpayee years.The BJP needed support from parties which were critical of its Hindutva agenda in the 1990s and it never jeopardised its shot at capturing political power by insisting on those issues back then. Even the BJP’s earlier avatar, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, was pragmatic. It worked with even the Communists to weaken the Congress in the late 1960s and the period before and after the Emergency.Through this move, the BJP has underlined its political pragmatism. To be sure, it remains to be seen whether the BJP is able to minimise its political losses on account of the protests.Right’s political pragmatism is in sharp contrast to the lack of it in the LeftThe biggest example to prove this point is the conduct of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) in the aftermath of the Singur and Nandigram protests in West Bengal. There were enough signals that the party was losing ground much before the 34-year-old Left Front government was dislodged in 2011. Yet, the CPI (M) leadership in the state refused to let go of its stubbornness on the issue and has continued to defend land acquisition even after it lost power.While one might argue that Communist parties hardly matter in Indian politics outside Kerala, the atrophying of the Left has been a huge boost for the rightward shift in Indian polity.Invoking class hurts the BJP, culture and liberalism do notThe biggest success of the farmers’ movement was in establishing a narrative that the farm laws were not just anti-farmer but also pro big-business. The protest against amendments to the land acquisition law in the first term of the Modi government also did the same thing, best captured in Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s barb of “suit-boot ki sarkar” against the government.That the BJP has finally backtracked on both issues shows that it fears being portrayed as pro big-business. This is hardly the case when it comes to attacks that target the BJP over its Hindutva politics. The fate of the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, best captured in the Shaheen Bagh protests in Delhi or the lack of any political challenge to the BJP after the annulment of Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir is proof of this fact.While movements such as these can claim a moral high ground, they have hardly inflicted any political damage on the BJP. This offers a useful realpolitik lesson for the Opposition. It is better to challenge the BJP by invoking class issues in at least the medium term.The limits of Mandal/Bahujan politics in today’s IndiaThe advent of Mandal-based parties and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) coincided with the weakening of class-based movements, especially in north India. No one can deny the fact that the rise in Other Backward Class (OBC) and Dalit assertion broke upper-caste hegemony and associated oppressive structures in these regions.While Mandal was an effective weapon against “mandir” (the BJP) in the early 1990s and 2000s, its political efficacy against the BJP has increasingly come under question in recent years. The biggest proof of this came in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, when the BJP trounced even an alliance of the Samajwadi Party and the BSP.The farmers’ protest was unique because it was perhaps the first time in many decades that dominant castes such as Jat Sikhs and Jats led a movement against an all-powerful regime.The fact that they managed to sustain the struggle and also achieve victory is a good occasion to ask whether an exclusionary Mandal/Bahujan politics has run its course in challenging today’s BJP. This question becomes even more pertinent when seen in the context of the BJP having an advantage among non-dominant subaltern ranks in most states.Of course, the fortunes of any non-Mandal political strategy against the BJP cannot seek a restoration of the upper-caste hegemony that existed in the 1950s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-key-takeaways-from-the-bjp-s-u-turn-on-farm-laws-101637315647896.html
20-11-2021||India||‘Golden day in India’s history, victory for democracy’: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the protests by farmers against the three farm laws for over a year is a lesson on how to struggle while calling the Centre’s decision to repeal the legislation as historic as India’s Independence Day. He added the move has immortalised the sacrifices of over 700 farmers, who died during the agitation against the laws.“Today is a golden day in India’s history. It is like Independence Day and Republic Day. Today the central government had to bow down before the farmers’ movement and to repeal all three black farm laws. This is not just a win for the farmers; it is the victory of democracy. The farmers have made every government realise that in a democracy, they have to listen to the people. Governments have to bow down to the people. Arrogance would not work,” said Kejriwal hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his government will repeal the laws.“Today’s day is a lesson for our country’s children and the youth that no matter how difficult and long a struggle is, if we fight peacefully and with the right intentions, there will be success.” Kejriwal said the farmers’ struggle united the nation as everyone, including labourers, women, traders, youth and shopkeepers, participated in it. “From Punjab to Uttar Pradesh and from Bengal to Kerala, the entire nation stood up for our farmers. Even people outside the country supported the movement. People rose above caste and religion to join the fight and in the end the Centre had to bow down before them.”Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has supported the farmer protests, which began in Punjab, where the party emerged as a significant force in 2017 elections. He visited the farmer protest site at the Singhu border on December 7 last year to review the arrangements made there. On December 8, when the protesting farmers called for a Bharat Bandh, Kejriwal said he wanted to visit Singhu but was put under “house arrest”. On December 27, he visited Singhu again to participate in a cultural event organised by the Delhi government. After that in February this year, he addressed a farmer gathering in Meerut. Kejriwal criticised the Centre after a convoy of cars, including one belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra, ran over farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. The violence that the mowing down of the farmers triggered left eight people dead.Kejriwal on Friday criticised the Centre for the delay in repealing the farm laws and added it tried every means to end the farmers’ protest. “The Centre, its agencies and the entire system tried hard to end their protests. They called our farmers terrorists, (separatist) Khalistanis and anti-nationals. They tried everything to break their grit. This was a freedom struggle for the farmers. Even water cannons dried out, batons failed... Still the Centre could not break their confidence and spirit.”Kejriwal referred to the death of over 700 farmers during the agitation and added this could have been avoided. “Their lives could have been saved if these laws were repealed earlier. Our farmer brothers and sisters would not have had to brave the biting cold and the sweltering heat, had this happened earlier. So many families were destroyed. There would hardly be a movement this long and massive in world history.”Kejriwal’s deputy, Manish Sisodia, also congratulated the farmers. “Your one year long peaceful movement has forced the government to bow down. The central government had to bow down before the martyrdom of hundreds of farmers. The government should also seek apology from families whose members have passed away during this farmers’ movement,” Sisodia tweeted.AAP leader Sanjay Singh called the move to repeal the farm laws a win of farmers over the Centre’s wrongdoings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/golden-day-in-india-s-history-victory-for-democracy-kejriwal-on-repeal-of-farm-laws-101637315289190.html
20-11-2021||India||‘Repeal of farm laws a win for opposition’: Jayant Chaudhary||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision to repeal the farm laws, many linked the move to attempts to reduce the impact of the farmer agitation against the legislation on assembly elections in states such as Uttar Pradesh. Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)’s Jayant Chaudhary, an opposition leader from Western Uttar Pradesh where the farmers play a key role in electoral outcomes, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the impact of the move. Edited excerpts:How do you respond to the decision?It is a good development for the farming community. They have shown a lot of courage by asking some hard questions to the government throughout the last year in a very disciplined and sustained agitation. So, it does send a message to the farmers that in a democracy they are entitled to agitate. They are well within their rights to demand. This is a moment of reflection for all of those who kept claiming that the laws are in favour of the agricultural sector and farmers because today after a year, the government has retraced its steps under widespread agitation.Many say it is not about Punjab, but Western Uttar Pradesh that forced the government’s hand...I think it was a very pervasive issue. The emotional connect is there with every family, every household in Uttar Pradesh, not just western Uttar Pradesh. At a larger level, throughout the country, people were watching the outcome of this. So, I think yes, it is feedback which has reached the highest level of the government and has caused this delayed reaction. There is no doubt.What do you think the impact is going to be?Uttar Pradesh elections are very important for the nation’s politics. They will send a message for what is to come in 2024 (national polls) and of course we are talking about India’s largest state. ...our nation’s trajectory is decided by the voters of Uttar Pradesh. The message has reached people that somewhere Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s thinking was wrong. They do not have an affinity with the farmers. The minister from Uttar Pradesh (Ajay Mishra whose son is an accused in the violence that was triggered after a car ran over protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri ) is still a member of the Cabinet. The farmer distress, sugar cane dues or price rise, electricity or diesel costs or the unavailability of fertilisers, the issue of MSP (minimum support prices remain). Paddy has been procured at less than half of what the MSP is. So, these issues do remain. So, in a sense, they are trying to do some damage control but it is not going to give them a victory. I think the momentum is with the opposition and the people who have been very aggressive. RLD has its own role in taking the message of the farmers to other parts. I think today’s decision is going to help us.Do you think this will help the BJP regain the lost ground?It will actually help us. This is a hard-fought win and I think today all those who were associated with the agitation feel vindicated. It is going to aid us, not them. It is a win for the opposition. All those who opposed these laws, all those who stood on the streets for one year, all those who expressed solidarity with the farmers, it is their victory.Will it help the opposition electorally and will they come together to reap the benefits?We were working on creating a viable alternative to the BJP and a strong opposition platform. We will go forward in that direction. BJP’s propaganda will now try and spin it. They will say that when the laws were there, it was supposed to help the BJP to win over the farmers because it was such a massive reform. Now, when the laws are not there, they are saying it is a win for BJP. They have had to submit to popular opinion. Within the opposition, Samajwadi Party has a credible base across the state. We are in conversation with them.How will you pivot your messaging right now?These laws were not going to solve any problems for the farmers. They in fact created problems. Over the last one year, people have had to suffer because of these laws. Now that they have been taken back, it is not going to bring some great gift either. In a sense, we have lost one year. One year of failed reforms, of failed policies, the distress has not been alleviated. Those are the issues we will take to the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-of-farm-laws-a-win-for-opposition-jayant-chaudhary-101637313249152.html
20-11-2021||India||Repeal of farm laws to impact multiple proceedings in Supreme Court||The decision by the union government to repeal the three farm laws could bring the curtains down on multiple proceedings in the Supreme Court, dealing not just with the constitutional validity of the laws, but on petitions filed by citizens demanding the right of way, and one by a farm union seeking permission to hold a peaceful protest in New Delhi.There is one set of cases pending before the Supreme Court where the three laws are under challenge. Another set of petitions supports the three laws. In the third set of cases, multiple individuals have approached the top court seeking to resolve traffic hassles and over citizens’ right to movement that has been affected due to the farmers’ protest.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave who represented the farm unions in the top court said, “Once the laws are repealed, the Supreme Court will pass orders declaring the petitions to be infructuous.”He expressed happiness over the decision taken by the government, saying, “It is because the farmers stood so strongly against the laws, the government was forced to bend backwards. The determination shown by our farmers will strengthen our democracy.”Also Read: Chaduni and Tikait: Firebrands of farm agitationThe decision to repeal the farm laws has not gone down well among certain sections of the farming community. Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana, also a member of an SC-appointed committee examining the farm laws, called the move “unfortunate”, saying it is not in favour of either farmers or the country.“The old laws had exploited the farmers by imposing a lot of restrictions on them by pulling down prices of agricultural produce using weapons such as export ban and stock limit. Agitating farmers were misled by their leaders that the minimum support price will go and their land will be taken away by companies. The government did not do its job properly to convince the farmers about the reality,” Ghanwat said.He said the government’s rollback decision was “political” and aimed at winning state elections in the coming months.In September 2020, after Parliament passed the three farm laws – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act - farmers began their stir demanding a rollback of all three legislations that were seen as anti-farmer.Around the same time, farmer organisations started consulting lawyers, seeking to find ways to challenge the three laws.Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress vice-president Rakesh Vaishnav and five other farm leaders were among the first few to approach the Supreme Court around September-end last year to question the laws.Political parties trooped in to support the farmers as MP Manoj Jha from Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress MP TN Prathapan and DMK MP Tiruchi Siva filed separate petitions over the laws. The petitions were taken up in October 2020 on which notices were issued.Later, several farm unions such as Bhartiya Kisan Party, Madhya Pradesh farmer leader DP Dhakad, National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Sangam state president P Ayyakannu and lawyer ML Sharma also joined in.A significant turn in the proceedings happened on January 12 when the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the laws and formed a committee of experts to consider the grievances of the protesting farmers and recommend amendments to the laws.This committee comprising Pramod Kumar Joshi, agricultural economist and director for South Asia at International Food Policy Research Institute, Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and ex-chairman at Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Ghanwat submitted its report in a sealed cover in March. The Supreme Court is yet to consider the report as the matter has since not come up for hearing.In March this year, a Noida-based resident approached the Supreme Court citing that the farmers’ protest made commuting between New Delhi and NCR townships a nightmare.The Supreme Court took up the issue with the Centre and the governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to work out a plan to resolve the issue. The SC said that farmers had the right to protest but they can’t be blocking roads.In October, another bench of the top court took a diametrically opposite view when it said that farmers cannot be allowed to protest when they have decided to approach the court.The Supreme Court was dealing with a petition filed by Kisan Mahapanchayat demanding permission to hold “satyagraha” in the Capital to urge the Centre to roll back the three farm laws.Incidentally, the farmers’ body was also a party to other proceedings challenging the farm laws. The Supreme Court sought assistance of the attorney general on whether the farmers were justified in continuing to protest having also approached a constitutional court for redress of their grievances.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who represents farmer unions in proceedings before the Supreme Court, said in a tweet, “The prime minister’s announcement to repeal the three farm laws is a tribute to the resolute determination and struggle of our farmers who sat on the borders of Delhi for one year suffering enormous hardship. The government caved in only after realising its electoral impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-of-farm-laws-to-impact-multiple-proceedings-in-supreme-court-101637313067827.html
20-11-2021||India||Chaduni and Tikait: Firebrands of farm agitation||The protests that led Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce his government will scrap three farm laws would not have been possible without the groundswell of support whipped up by two of the agitation’s unlikely leaders, Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Rakesh Tikait. Chaduni took the agitation outside the confines of Punjab to his home state Haryana, which paved the way for farmers to reach Delhi’s borders. Tikait planted the movement firmly in the political bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh.A firebrand, Chaduni organised one of the first meetings on September 10, 2020, in Haryana’s Pipli village to protest the three laws. The next milestone came when the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a coalition of over 200 farmer unions, called for a march toward Delhi on November 26-27.The laws aimed to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce by setting up free markets, allowed food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and laid down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreement.Farmers maintained these changes will leave them at the mercy of big corporations, who would be in a position to dictate low prices.In Punjab, the movement was led by leaders such as B.S. Rajewal and Satvir Singh, but Chaduni was the one who built a movement in Haryana, said Kakkaji, a farm leader.Gurnam Singh ChaduniChaduni was among a handful of leaders who was part of the decision to forge a larger alliance at a meeting at Delhi’s Gurdwara Rakab Ganj. The meeting was attended by farm union leaders, including VM Singh, a former convenor of the AIKSCC, 78-year-old Balbir Singh Rajewal, a veteran farmer leader from Punjab, and Chaduni, who was the face of the farmers’ agitation in Haryana.“It was Chaduni who went from village to village, day and night, and explained the need to make the agitation bigger and bigger. This was after it was clear that thousands of farmers would move to Delhi,” said Sandeep Topra, an aide to Chaduni.Chaduni contested the 2019 Assembly election from Ladwa constituency in Haryana’s Kurukshetra region, campaigning on a mix of farmers’ issues and matters of local development, but lost. His wife, Balwinder Kaur, also fought and lost the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as an Aam Aadmi Party candidate.Chaduni’s native village, Charuni Jattan, lies in the Shahbad area of Kurukshetra district. His derives his surname from his native village, a customary practice. Chaduni is an iconoclast. In the middle of the march to Delhi on November 25, 2020, farm unions decided unanimously to sit peacefully on the Punjab-Haryana border due to resistance from the government and a crackdown by Haryana police. Chaduni gave a war cry, defied the sit-in plan, and instead pulled apart barricades in Ambala to reach Delhi with thousands of followers.“These laws will break the backbone of farmers. They will lead to distress sale of farm produce and make us bow to big corporations,” Chaduni told HT at the time.After thousands of farmers reached the borders of Delhi on November 27 last year, the Union government asked the protestors to move to Burari, a designated site on Delhi’s outskirts before talks on the demands could begin.Chaduni opposed it, likening Burari to an open jail. He is described as a fearless farm leader adept at winning street battles on farmers’ issues. “It is a victory of all farmers and it took the ultimate sacrifices of more than 600 farmers who lost their lives in this agitation,” Chaduni said.Rakesh TikaitWhen, after months of peaceful protests, hundreds of farmers marched to the Red Fort and clashed with police in the Capital on January 26 in a tractor rally that went completely out of hand, farm unions feared the violent episode could spell the end of their movement. Instead, Tikait, a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, an influential farmers’ organisation, entrenched the protests firmly in his home turf, the politically crucial sugarcane belt of western Uttar Pradesh. Tikait began holding a series of “kisan mahapanchayats” or rural conclaves, which are respected village institutions of the landed Jat community where social decisions taken by elders are binding.Over 100,000 farmers have camped in five makeshift camps at key border points of Delhi. A turning point came on the night of January 28 this year, when news began to spread that authorities in Uttar Pradesh would descend on Ghazipur , a protest camp on Delhi’s border, to vacate it. The site was under the supervision of Tikait, an influential Jat farm leader from western Uttar Pradesh. Tikait cried before TV cameras, saying he would rather die than give in, which steeled the resolve of the Jats, a community that had benefited from the Green Revolution of the 1970s.The Tikaits belong to the Baliyan khap, a dominant clan among the Jats, most of whom are sugarcane growers. They voted overwhelmingly for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in past elections. This sugarcane belt was the ground zero of the deadly Hindu Jat-Muslim clashes in 2013, which helped the BJP politically. That religious divide is now seen to be cementing. A mahapanchayat in Bhainswal organised on February 5 saw heavy participation of Muslims.Tikait has built a campaign against the entire gamut of the Modi government’s economic reforms, calling them as anti-people and pro-corporations.“We will not rest till a law on MSP (minimum support prices) is passed by the government,” Tikait said. Tikait was instrumental in organising Jats as well as other communities through mahapanchayats (rural conclaves), which was his main strategy, said Ashutosh, the president of Kisan Mazdoor Jagran Manch, a farm outfit in UP’s Dadri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chaduni-and-tikait-firebrands-of-farm-agitation-101637310188524.html
20-11-2021||India||Unions cheer, but still want a law for MSP||Farm unions on Friday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to roll back three agricultural laws they had been opposing for a year, but the government has to now contend with a tougher demand – a law guaranteeing minimum support prices or MSP to cultivators for their produce.“It is the victory of millions of farmers who did not give up. It is a victory for democracy but a partial victory. We had two demands, one (was to) repeal the three laws. Second, give us a legal guarantee of minimum support price, something the prime minister had himself demanded when he was chief minister of Gujarat. That has not been considered yet. That struggle will go on,” said Yogendra Yadav, a key leader of the farmers’ movement.Rakesh Tikait, a prominent farm leader from Uttar Pradesh who was in Maharashtra’s Palghar for an event when Modi made the announcement, said it wasn’t time yet to end their yearlong protest.“We are not withdrawing the protests. We will wait and watch to see what happens. Also, we want a law on MSP (minimum support prices),” he said.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions protesting the laws, is preparing to go ahead with planned mahapanchayats in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The reforms Modi said his government would rescind aimed to allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside regulated markets, called mandis, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming.Farmers feared the new economic agenda could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSP) and would leave them at the mercy of private buyers.The government has insisted it will still buy staples at MSP, but farmers have demanded a law that prohibits purchase of major farm produce below state-set minimum prices.MSPs, which began with the Green Revolution, are set such that they offer 50% returns over cost but mainly benefit paddy and wheat growers because the government procures only these two commodities in sufficiently large quantities.Indian farmers receive lower-than-international prices for much of their produce because of increasing costs of cultivation, inadequate markets and the government’s policy to keep food prices low.This has worsened agriculture’s terms of trade, measured as a ratio of prices of agri products to prices of manufactured items. The crisis, therefore, is not one of low production, but of low prices.An MSP is an important policy tool that helped achieve food self-sufficiency because it gave farmers assured prices. It is an important price signal, but does not have statutory backing.While the government announces MSP for 23 major crops, setting them at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation to account for inflation, analysts say a blanket law mandating that no trader can buy any farm commodity below this threshold price could be tough to implement.“The demand for a law on MSP will elicit a bigger response from farmers now because it will be a direct step towards higher income. It involves huge central expenditure and this will be a bigger problem for the Modi government,” said Sudhir Panwar, a professor at Lucknow University.The most immediate impact of such a law will be higher food inflation.Every percentage point increase in MSPs leads to a 15-basis point increase in inflation, according to Nomura economist Sonal Varma. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Economists say an MSP mechanism that ignores dynamics such as demand and global prices, creates distortions. If it is not profitable for private traders to buy at federally fixed MSP, when demand is low, then the private sector will simply exit the markets. In such a scenario, the government simply cannot be a monopoly buyer of all produce.The government already procures staggering quantities of surplus rice and wheat, which have become unmanageable. The government on average holds at least 70 million tonnes of rice and wheat in federal stocks, whereas food security norms require reserves of 41.1 million tonnes as of July and 30.7 million tonnes as of October each year.If MSP is made mandatory, then India’s agricultural exports could become non-competitive because the government’s assured prices are way higher than both domestic and international market prices. No trader would want to buy at a higher price and export at a lower rate.According to economist Ashok Gulati, the cost of procuring, storing and distributing rice to the poor comes to about ₹37 a kg. For wheat, it is around ₹27 a kg. The cost to company (CTC) of labour of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) is six to eight times higher than private labour. Therefore, market prices of rice and wheat are much lower than what it costs FCI to buy them.But the MSP policy benefits farmers only in a handful of states. The 70th round of National Sample Survey showed only 13.5% of paddy growers and 16.2% of wheat growers actually received MSPs.While MSPs have incentivised foodgrains over other crops, they have given rise to serious imbalances of water and land resources and shifted land away from crops, such as pulses and oilseeds, necessitating costly imports. Also, MSPs, as administered prices, tend to distort market prices. They often ignore the demand side, international prices, export competitiveness and ecological impacts of crops such as paddy.This also means surplus stocks can’t be exported without a subsidy, which invites World Trade Organisation’s objections. WTO rules cap government procurement for subsidized food programmes by developing countries at 10% of the total value of agricultural production based on 1986-88 prices in dollar terms.“Support to farmers can never be in question. But support in the form of MSP, which is market-distorting, raises questions, such as ‘whether can we move to other ways of supporting farmers that cause less collateral damage,” said Pravesh Sharma, a fellow at New Delhi’s Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-scrap-agri-laws-but-farm-protests-to-continue-101637304667046.html
20-11-2021||India||‘It’s a beginning’: Tikait says won’t return until laws repealed in Parliament||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement saying the government will withdraw the three farm laws enacted last year is just a beginning and the protesting farmers will return to their homes only after Parliament approves the roll back, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said on Friday.Tikait, who emerged as a key face of the agitation the legislation, said multiple issues including the legislation for Minimum Support Price (MSP) remain pending. He added Modi did not speak about this and reiterated they will return from the protest sites only when all their demands are met. Tikait said farmers would not take announcements seriously until Parliament approves the repeal.He added a meeting of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of farmers spearheading the protests, will be convened on Friday to discuss and review the development. “Further course of action will be decided accordingly,” said Tikait. He added over 600 farmers have sacrificed their lives to strengthen and carry forward the movement against the laws. “...we need to honour their sacrifice while taking any decision,” he told HT over the phone.In a tweet in Hindi, Tikait said, “The agitation will not be taken back. We will wait for the day when the farm laws will be scrapped in the Parliament. Along with the MSP, the government should also discuss other issues of farmers.”Thousands of farmers have been campaigning at Delhi’s borders seeking the repeal of the three laws enacted in September 2020 to liberalise agricultural trade. They maintained the laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations, who will dictate prices and wean them off state support. The government argued the laws will alter an existing state-backed market system and free up farm trade, boost investments in the farm economy and raise incomes.The protests broadened into a larger movement against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-a-beginning-tikait-says-farmers-won-t-return-until-decision-is-passed-by-parliament-101637296927926.html
20-11-2021||Today's||How LK Advani and Jaswant Singh saw Jinnah||Last Saturday, at a rally in Azamgarh, home minister Amit Shah asked the gathering: “Does anyone feel Jinnah is great?” Then, without a pause, he answered his own question: “No one”. I’m afraid he is wrong. I have no doubt millions of our countrymen would want to say yes — even if few, in today’s circumstances, would do so publicly. But I shall write about two who did say it publicly. They are revered former leaders of the minister’s party. It would be salutary to recall their view of Jinnah.

20-11-2021||Today's||PM Modi showed magnanimity and political sagacity by withdrawing farm laws||Prime Minister Modi, in his address to the nation, announced the withdrawal of the three contentious farm laws and apologised to all those who had suffered because of the same. Farmers, basically from the states of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been agitating for the past one year demanding the withdrawal of the three farm laws. The farmers have been organizing dharna on all the roads leading to the national capital, Delhi and repeated attempts by the central government to resolve the issue amicably failed to bear any fruit as the farmers wanted the rescinding of the three farm laws as a precondition for any fruitful talks to solve the problems faced by the farmers.Although the operation of these farm laws were put on hold by the apex court long ago but that did not lead to any reconciliation between the government and the agitating farmers. The government always maintained that it is willing to discuss everything except scrapping of the three farm laws. It seemed that the government was in no mood to take back these farm laws ,come what may. From time to time, those in favor of these farm laws argued that the reforms driven image of the Modi government will take a beating if it succumbs to the pressure mounted by agitating farmers. It was also said that these farm laws were going to revolutionize the Agri sector and benefit the farmers immensely. But the agitating farmers were not convinced and presented their side quite forcefully resulting in a long stalemate between the two sides. Finally today the PM announced the withdrawal of the three farm laws and said that although his government had promulgated the farm laws only in the interest of farmers and he sincerely believed that these laws were going to change farmers lives for the better but unfortunately the government failed to convince the farmers community at large regarding the benefits of the these farm laws. In his address, he apologised to all those who suffered due to this. He also announced setting up of a committee consisting of the representatives of central government, state governments, agriculture experts, farmers representatives etc to look into the other specific issues raised by the farmers. He promised the farmers that he will do everything possible to make their lives better and prosperous.Undoubtedly the central government had been debating, for decades, to address some of the core issues concerning the farm sector and many committees and Agri experts had made recommendations along the lines of the three contentious farm laws. There are many who want more policy reforms to liberalize the farm produce marketing sector further but there are many who argue for "no entry" for corporations. Policy framing in any sector has to balance between the two competing demands with primacy on growth and prosperity. But when a vocal section of the population expresses serious reservations about any policy initiative and goes on agitating unrelentingly for months, the government has to heed the voices emanating from protest sites.Democracy is all about elected governments bowing down to people’s wishes and in that sense the decision taken by PM Modi is praiseworthy as he openly acknowledged the fact that farmers were not convinced by the arguments put forth by his government. Hence he bowed to the wishes of the people and has withdrawn the three farm laws.In any parliamentary democracy, every political outfit always takes decisions with an eyes on electoral gains. The same logic is behind the withdrawal of the farm laws. With elections looming large on the horizon in important states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand etc, the cost-benefit analysis of the decisions had to be worked out by the Modi government. So political compulsions must have played a major role in this decision. This decision is going to pay dividends in these important states going to polls and will lead to realignment of various parties in the fray. In Punjab, this will remove the main irritant between the two oldest allies and has the potential of changing the electoral prospects of contesting parties.There is a lesson to be learned from this for all political dispensations. Nothing is above the people’s will and decision makers should always keep their eyes and ears open to listen to the masses. No policy description is sacrosanct and experts advice should always be weighed against people’s perception. In this regard, it can be said that the Prime Minister acted wisely in not only bowing to the people’s wishes but also acted magnanimously by apologising to those who suffered because of this decision. Those who show the courage to accept mistakes and make corrections need to be applauded- irrespective of the reason behind their actions. Magnanimity is what is needed in every public authority universally.The author is former fertiliser secretary, Government of India.

20-11-2021||Editorials||The repeal of farm laws||On Friday, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi announced that the government would pilot the repeal of farm laws. This is undoubtedly a setback for the ruling dispensation, given that the PM had invested tremendous political capital in supporting the laws despite a sustained agitation against the move. But Mr Modi candidly acknowledged that the government had failed to convince a segment of the farmers about the value of the laws. Electoral imperatives — especially the upcoming polls in Punjab, and more importantly, Uttar Pradesh — appear to have played a key role in the decision. And the Bharatiya Janata Party probably calculated that the political costs of staying the course with the laws were greater than the costs that came with a rollback.
