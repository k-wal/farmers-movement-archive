11-11-2021||Lucknow||Dudhwa National Park to open for tourists from November 15||The world-renowned Dudhwa National Park (DNP) is set to open for tourism on November 15.The park was initially scheduled to open from November 1, however, the untimely heavy rains, unprecedented discharge of 533000 cusecs water into Sharda river from Banbasa barrage and flooded Mohana and Suheli rivers passing through Dudhwa National Park disturbed the schedule.The floods and rains left all the forest ranges of DNP heavily water-logged and park routes damaged due to which authorities deferred the opening of tourist season from November 1 till the situations improved.Field director of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR) Sanjay Kumar Pathak said, “As per government directives, the Dudhwa National Park would now be open for tourists from November 15.”However, he added that due to heavy water-logging still prevailing in Sathiyana, the area would not be allowed for tourist activities till further instructions.“Also, the tourists wishing to visit rhino area in south Sunaripur range would have to wait for a few days more as the rhino area is still swampy and not fit for elephant movements,” he added.Pathak said, “Elderly persons over 60 years of age would have to produce their vaccination certificates on entering the Dudhwa National park auspices while other tourists between 18 to 60 years of age may be required to produce their vaccination certificates on demand.”He further added, “Every tourist must have to follow Covid protocols while visiting the park. Dudhwa is ready to greet all its visitors with all its wild glory, nature’s treasure and rich flora and fauna.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dudhwa-national-park-to-open-for-tourists-from-november-15-101636653819802.html

11-11-2021||Pune||Pune city temperature continue to drop: 10.9 degrees Celsius on Thursday||PUNE: Since November 7, Pune has seen a drastic drop in minimum temperatures. While the minimum temperature at Shivajinagar on November 7 was 20.6 degrees Celsius, Thursday saw a further decline to 10.9 degree Celsius reporting the coldest day of the season so far. With this, Pune became the coldest city in the state for the second time this week, according to the weather department.On Thursday, Pashan reported a minimum temperature of 11.5 degree Celsius; Lohegaon 13.9 degree Celsius; Chinchwad and Lavale 17 degree Celsius; and Magarpatta 17.8 degree Celsius. Night temperature is likely to increase from November 13, as per officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).On the dip in temperature, Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting department of IMD Pune, said that the northern winds penetrating the state have resulted in a drop in temperature. “Earlier, the winds were northerly, then the wind pattern was north-eastern and then the wind pattern changed to easterly. And cooler winds from the north have resulted in a gradual drop in night temperature not just in Pune city but across the state. There is also less moisture in the air as of now and no cloudy weather. Because of this, heat escapes and so, the temperature has dropped,” Kashyapi said. In the next few days, some parts of the state may witness rainfall.“As there is an incursion of moisture in the state, beginning November 12, we have issued rainfall alerts for various parts. And so with more moisture, the temperature may also see a rise in the next few days,” he said. The weather department has forecast light rainfall along with thunderstorms and lightning in parts of the city till November 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-city-temperature-continue-to-drop-10-9-degrees-celsius-on-thursday-101636653220374.html
11-11-2021||Mumbai||Redrawing ward boundaries a herculean task before BMC to avoid delay in holding elections||A day after Maharashtra cabinet’s decision to increase Mumbai civic body’s strength from 227 to 236 members, the State Election Commission (SEC) said a delay in redrawing ward boundaries may result in deferment of elections slated for early 2022. With less than three months to the BMC elections, civic authorities on Thursday said electoral wards are most likely to increase in Mumbai’s suburbs, bases on population density. The civic body’s election department has been tasked with redrawing the boundaries. BMC said it will divide Mumbai’s population with 236 to determine the population requirement per ward before boundaries are redrawn. A plus or minus 10% difference in this figure will be accepted as the number of voters per ward. If any present electoral ward is beyond the above figure, geographical parts of it will be extracted to add to a new ward. This will likely have a ripple effect on all or neighbouring electoral wards.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and the officer in-charge of preparations for the upcoming elections, said, “After we have determined how many voters per ward is feasible, we might find that the population density of some existing wards is within this limit. In such a case, it may not require any change. If any ward has a population exceeding this limit, we will extract some areas from the ward to create new electoral wards. The process will start soon.”Civic authorities said this process will not delay the elections, and is likely to be completed within the stipulated time. An SEC officer said, “To hold the elections in time, we will have to announce them between January 1 and 10. If demarcation notification is issued by end of November and the suggestion/objections invited in two weeks after that, we could still hold the elections as per the schedule. It is now up to the BMC to complete the process in the stipulated time. All other municipal corporations have begun the process and are expected to complete it within the deadline.” The BMC currently has 227 elected representatives (called corporators) across 24 administrative wards formed on the basis of the 2011 census. The 2021 census was delayed on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. A delimitation process is undertaken to ensure that all electoral wards largely have the same amount of population.Once the boundaries for 236 wards are prepared, the data will be sent to SEC, which will then invite suggestions and objections.However, corporators are concerned at the time available for election campaigns. Prabhakar Shinde, BJP leader in BMC said, “This is a clear indication that Shiv Sena is afraid of losing its hold over the civic body, as such an impactful decision has been taken on such short notice. Voters will also be confused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/redrawing-ward-boundaries-a-herculean-task-before-bmc-to-avoid-delay-in-holding-elections-101636653159711.html

In two separate cases, the police have recovered 100kg poppy from their possession which they had concealed in a custom-made compartment in trucks. The arrested accused are Amanjot Singh, 25, of Deharka in Jagraon; Ravinder Singh, 19, of Kapure village and Mandeep Singh, 38, of Jalalabad village in Moga district. Amanjot is a civil engineering diploma holder. Ludhiana police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said a team of the CIA staff-1 had stopped a truck near Bilga T-point following a tip-off and arrested Ravinder and Mandeep while seizing 40kg poppy husk hidden in a tool box. A case under sections 15, 25, 29, 61 and 85 of the NDPS Act has been registered against them at the Sahnewal police station, he added. He further said that another team of CIA staff-1 arrested Amanjot Singh, from whom 60kg poppy husk was recovered, which was also hidden in a toolbox. An FIR under similar charges has been registered against him. Amanjot is also the owner of this truck, the police chief said. Bhullar said Mandeep had been driving trucks for the past 15 years. Ravinder Singh is his cousin, he added. Mandeep and Amanjot used to smuggle poppy husk from Jharkhand during their routine travels to the state.

The anti-money laundering agency started raids on Thursday morning after an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) was registered by ED zone-2 office. ED detained two people in connection with the case in Mulshi, Pune. The duo, whose names have been withheld, has been brought to Mumbai for questioning. If their roles are established in the alleged crime, they would be placed under arrest and produced before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court.The value of the fraudulent deal involving Tabut Inam Endowment Trust is ₹7.7 crore, as per police. Reacting on the development, state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said the scam that came to light in Pune is not an isolated case and the state Waqf Board is ready to provide details of 30,000 trusts registered under them, which can be probed by the central agency.Earlier, the Bund Garden police had lodged a first information report (FIR) against Imtiaz Shaikh and Chand Mulani, both of whom were arrested on charges of impersonating the trust’s president and secretary, respectively. Shaikh and Mulani had allegedly submitted a forged document of the state Waqf Board, showing its consent to their appointment, after which the collector’s office released an amount of money to them instead of the trust members. The FIR stated that the trust, which is registered with the Waqf Board, owns eight hectares in Maan village of Mulshi taluka. The government was scheduled to give compensation of ₹9.64 crore to the trust and accordingly released ₹7.7 crore. The trust later complained to the Waqf – the Muslim charity board – that it had not received any compensation from the state. During an inquiry by deputy collector (land acquisition), it was revealed that Shaikh and Mulani, had submitted fake documents and claimed the money. The Pune regional officer of Waqf Board, Khusro Khan, lodged a complaint in this regard, following which Shaikh and Mulani were arrested.Malik said the wakf board has registered a total of seven FIRs that includes two in Beed and one each in Thane, Parbhani, Jalna and Aurangabad. In one of the cases in Beed, a deputy collector-rank official was also arrested by the police. ED can take over all the seven cases and start a probe against the 30,000 trusts registered with the board,” the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister said.Malik said that his department has taken a “clean-up drive” ever since he took charge as minister. “Ever since I got the charge [of the minority affairs ministry], a clean-up drive has been started in the department. We are not sparring government officers; a few old members of the Waqf Board will also be brought to justice. We have decided to make the functioning of the board fully transparent by making it digital. The state information technology department has formed a portal which will be started soon,” Malik said in a media briefing on Thursday.“Many news channels are claiming that ED has entered the scene and will reach my residence and that I would be in trouble. I welcome ED if they come after informing in advance. The state government and wakf board are ready to provide all the cooperation to the central agency. But if ED believes that it will be used to defame me, then it is their misunderstanding. Nawab Malik cannot be threatened and my image can’t be tarnished because I have started the fight against the injustice of framing of innocents,” he added.

11-11-2021||Pune||State’s new policy has neera repackaged as health elixir||PUNE: Fans of neera will soon be able to enjoy it in packaged form as the state government has decided to sell the natural health drink in packed bottles and pouches under the new policy. Neera is obtained by slicing the spathes of coconut, sago, and Palmyra (Borassus Flabellifer L.) palm and scraping the tender-most part just below the crown. The government has also decided to introduce geo-tagging of trees and establish a computerised system to keep tabs on the collection, transportation and sale of neera to control adulteration.During summers in Pune, the sale of neera goes up to 2,500 to 3,000 litres per day but this year it plummeted to 1,500 litre per day due to the lockdown. According to the state excise department, there are 500 neera outlets in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad with Pune, Solapur, Mumbai and Nashik being producers of the drink. These regions also see greater sales as neera has a shelf-life of only 24 hours due to which it cannot be transported to other parts of the state.Now however, the state has permitted the transport and sale of neera after proper processing and preservation in packed bottles and pouches. On November 9 this year, the state government drafted a new policy for neera plantation, production, processing and sale in order to stabilise the industry. According to the new policy, both individual and cooperative societies can get licenses for the production, processing and sale of neera . Earlier, it was mandatory for farmers to form a cooperative society to get such license. The period for renewal of the license, too, has increased from one year to five years. The state government has allowed the processing of neera where the pack must be preserved at below 4 degree Celsius temperature to increase shelf-life, and selling the drink in bottles and pouches. The state has directed individuals and cooperative societies to take necessary precautions so that neera does not get transformed into toddy which is an alcoholic drink. In such cases, the state excise department will cancel the license of the individual/society. The state will provide online licenses to interested persons/societies/parties.Ramesh Bhandari, legal advisor and former president of the Neera Utpadak Cooperative Society, said, “The state is aiming at the privatisation of the neera industry. The intention is good to control adulteration but chances of adulteration will increase with opening up of the market to other players. A part of the industry is going through a rough patch as there is lack of plantation, production, skilled labour for tapping trees and collecting neera . Production is low while the demand is high. At present, the society sells 1,000 to 2,000 litre per day during winter. Sales will go up in the summer to 2,500 to 3,000 litre.”Santosh Zagade, superintendent of police of the state excise department, said, “It is the first time that the state government has allowed selling neera in packed bottles and pouches. The state is trying to boost the neera industry. As regards the selling price, the government will soon issue orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/states-new-policy-has-neera-repackaged-as-health-elixir-101636652319576.html

The 44-year-old victim, a widow, has alleged that she was ‘raped’ by MLA Bains multiple times, and had been protesting for eight months prior to the registration of the FIR. The charge-sheet names Bains, his brothers — Karamjit Singh and Paramjit Singh — and four others — Baljinder Kaur, Jasbir Kaur, Sukhchain Singh and Gogi Sharma PA. The charge-sheet has been filed under Sections 376 (rape), 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (sexual harassment), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (conspiracy) of the IPC. The next date of hearing is November 18.The victim has also alleged that the MLA and his men had promised to help her in a property dispute, but started exploiting her sexually instead. After the police failed to register a case initially, the woman had moved court. In his July 7 order, additional chief judicial magistrate Harsimranjit Singh had said: “Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures. The unsuspecting victim is a hapless woman...with the first responder, police agency having turned a blind eye to her hideous abuse, she knocked the door of the court. The real cause of concern is whether a miserable and poor victim of sexual exploitation be expected to get justice by lodging the private complaint and collecting evidence from a place alien to her and against the perpetrators who are powerful and resourceful. In case the directions for registering of case is not made, the entire case of complainant would crumble and it would tantamount to failure of justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-file-charge-sheet-against-mla-bains-in-rape-case-101636650039665.html

11-11-2021||Lucknow||UP ATS arrests two key members of int’l human trafficking racket||In a major breakthrough, the UP Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on Wednesday arrested two key members of an international racket allegedly involved in human trafficking from Bangladesh and Myanmar to European, Gulf and South-east Asian countries on Indian identities, said UP police additional director general (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar here on Thursday.He said the arrested duo were identified as Sameer Mandal, 45, of 24 Pargana district, West Bengal, and Vikram Singh of Hoshiarpur in Punjab. He said Mandal was arrested from his hideout in West Bengal, while Vikram Singh was arrested from his hideout in Ghaziabad. The ADG said the questioning of the two accused revealed that they were part of an international network of human traffickers operating from South Africa and London.He said Sameer Mandal was in direct contact with a Bangladeshi national Saeed, who is now settled in South Africa, and got Bangladeshi contacts from him of those interested in travelling to different countries for employment and other works. Vikram Singh used to help Sameer Mandal through his contact one Gurpreet Singh based in London, he added.Another ATS official said Sameer Mandal is in grains transportation business which is spread from West Bengal to Bangladesh. He said Mandal is involved in human trafficking racket in the garb of his transportation business. He was in touch with Mithun Mandal, who along with three others, was arrested in Varanasi on October 26 in the same case. He said Mithun’s brother Ratan Mandal also ran a tour and travel agency in West Bengal. Along with Mithun Mandal, three others identified as Bangladeshi nationals Shaoan Ahmed, 25, Mominur Islam, 24, and Mehndi Hasan, 23, were arrested earlier.The official said Sameer also revealed that he used to keep illegal Bangladeshi immigrants at his brother Subash Mandal’s house for some time till their Indian documents were prepared. He said one Bangladeshi national Jahangir helped them making illegal immigrants cross over to India and got their Indian documents prepared through his other contacts in West Bengal. He said the traffickers helped Bangladeshi national get Hindu names and Indian passports by preparing their fake address proofs like Aadhaar and voter ID cards. He said the Bangladeshi nationals were later sent to different countries as Indian nationals.He said the custody remand of all accused would be sought from the competent court to interrogate them further to extract details about other people involved in this international human trafficking racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-ats-arrests-two-key-members-of-int-l-human-trafficking-racket-101636649199379.html
11-11-2021||Mumbai||Four students, two professors from IIT-Bombay win $250,000 XPrize grant||A team of four students and two professors from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) has won a grant worth US$250,000 (approximately ₹1.85 crore) for developing a new tri-modular technology for low-cost, efficient capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from point sources of emission and transforming them into salts. The grant comes from XPRIZE Foundation in collaboration with the Elon Musk Foundation. The announcement was made on Thursday at the Sustainable Innovation Forum at COP-26 in Glasgow. The team of students—Srinath Iyer (PhD student), Anwesha Banerjee (PhD student), Srushti Bhamare (BTech+MTech student) and Shubham Kumar (Junior Research fellow-Earth Science) are the only single institute team from India to have won this award. XPRIZE and the Musk Foundation announced a grant of US$100 million (approximately ₹745 crore) in April this year for anyone who can come up with sustainable technology for carbon removal from the atmosphere, ocean, land, etc. Of this, US$5 million (approximately ₹37 crore) was a student award where participants have won under two categories. “Our suggestion on capturing carbon dioxide at its source (in industries) and then turning it into carbonate salts with potential future usage to once again use it in a way that it does not enter the atmosphere as gaseous CO2, has won us this recognition,” said professor Vikram Vishal, department of earth sciences and Interdisciplinary Programme in Climate Studies (IDPCS) at the institute, and one of the two mentors part of this project. This four-year global competition invited innovators and teams to create and demonstrate solutions that can pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or oceans. To win the grand prize, teams had to demonstrate a working solution at a scale of at least 1000 tonnes removed per year and show a pathway to achieving a scale of gigatons per year in future, as validated by a third party. “It is now an undisputed fact among the scientists that nearly 1.1 degree Celsius rise in Earth temperature has happened due to rise in CO2 levels post industrialisation. Some of the main sectors contributing to this have been power, petroleum, steel, fertilisers, and cement industries. Our idea can be incorporated in the existing industries to cap CO2 emission at its source,” said professor Arnab Dutta, department of chemistry & (IDPCS), and another mentor. As part of their research, the team conceptualised the idea and conducted an internal assessment before submitting their project on paper with scientific justification supporting the concept. “We are creating almost 40 gigatons of CO2 per year all over the world at present, and a little less than 7% of this is coming from India. Our suggestion is to not only capture this CO2 emitted by industries but also turn it into other commercially viable chemicals in industries ensuring a financial benefit to them while implementing this unique CO2 management program,” added Dutta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/four-students-two-professors-from-iit-bombay-wins-250-000-xprize-grant-101636648959369.html

11-11-2021||Mumbai||First time this season: Minimum temperature dips below 20 degrees Celsius in Mumbai||The onset of winter in the city became more pronounced on Thursday, with minimum nighttime temperature falling below the 20 degrees Celsius mark for the first time this season — settling at 19.8 degrees Celsius. This was down from 21.4 degrees Celsius a day earlier, and 23.4 degrees Celsius on Monday. A minimum temperature in the city have remained below normal for the past two days, and is likely to stay below normal through the weekend, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials have said. This is as per data from the IMD observatory in Santacruz, taken as representative of Mumbai. Colaba in south Mumbai, on the other hand, remained relatively warmer with a minimum temperature at 22.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday. As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, thunderstorms coupled with light showers could occur early next week. “There is a depression which is moving northwest and will emerge as a low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea. Due to changing wind patterns and availability of moisture, there will be increased convection with a chance of thunderstorms and this will bring down temperatures further,” said a meteorologist with IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. These showers will be felt not only in Mumbai city and suburbs but also in parts of Thane, Kalyan, Panvel and the larger MMR region. Air quality in the city, meanwhile, has remained in the ‘moderate’ category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin — settling at 174 on Thursday. This was up from 164 the day prior, also in the ‘moderate’ category, which cautions against “breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases”. PM2.5 (small respirable particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, or a hundred times thinner than a human hair) were observed to be the most prominent pollutant in the city, as per the CPCB. “If it rains next week there may be some relief from air pollution, but it will be short-lived. Temperatures will reduce due to the rains and this will again cause a spike in pollution,” said IMD official cited above. The maximum daytime temperature on Thursday, meanwhile, settled at 34.5 degrees Celsius (one degree above normal) and is expected to remain thereabouts for the next week, forecasts suggest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/first-time-this-season-minimum-temperature-dips-below-20-degrees-celsius-in-mumbai-101636647699258.html

While after a meeting with the state transport minister Anil Parab later in the day, the private tourist buses association members were ensured about the safety of buses and also police protection at the ST stands.“Yesterday (on Wednesday) when we started our bus operations across the state at ST stands, we were ensured about the safety of our buses and staff. A total of 2,000 private tourist buses were given to the state government to transport passengers who were stranded by the ongoing MSRTC workers protest. But in the night, we got to know that ten of our buses in various districts were vandalised and even not allowed to go inside the ST stands. So, we decided to stop the bus operations from today morning,” said Baba Shinde, president of Maharashtra Transport Vehicle Owners and Drivers Association.While in the afternoon a meeting was called between Parab and association members in which safety of the private buses, allowing them inside the ST stands and giving police protection was discussed.“So, to ensure the safety of our staff a meeting was held with state transport minister. We are ready to run the buses but cannot compromise the safety of our staff, so he instructed the state police department to provide safety at all the ST stands. So, we have restarted operations across the state,” added Shinde.Parab said, “I am in continuous dialogue with our protesting MSRTC workers and we are trying to find a solution on the issue. To provide alternate transport service to our passengers on behalf of the state government we decided to allow operations of private tours and other buses. When these buses are doing transporting work, I would ensure their safety and personally instruct the police department to provide necessary protection at the ST stands and wherever necessary. Even our officials are appointed on duty at all the depots.”Meanwhile, a heavy rush of passengers was seen at the Swargate, Wakdewadi and other ST stands in the Pune division.

11-11-2021||Mumbai||Worli fisherfolk assured of meeting with Maharashtra CM, environment minister||Maharashtra cabinet minister for fisheries, Aslam Shaikh, on Thursday visited Cleveland Bunder in Mumbai’s Worli Koliwada to meet the fisherfolk who are protesting against the construction of an interchange to connect the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) coastal road with the Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL). Speaking to HT, Shaikh said he will soon organise a meeting of Koli community leaders with chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray – who is also the legislator from Worli – so that the fisherfolk can discuss their concerns with them directly.“CM and the environment minister are not available currently, but I will arrange a meeting with them within the next four-five days, so that the fisherfolk can share their concerns directly. I have met the fisherfolk today and understood their problems first hand. While the coastal road project is important, all the stakeholders concerned need to be made equal participants in the process and no hardships should come on the fisherfolk,” Shaikh said on Thursday.Nitesh Patil, president of Worli Koliwada Nakhava Matsyavyavsay Sahasaki Society (WKNMSS), who has been leading the protests over the past two weeks, presented Shaikh with a letter detailing their demands for a redesign of the interchange. The civic body plans to construct two connecting bridges between the south-end of BWSL and the north end of coastal road as part of a link that will allow traffic to flow seamlessly between the two structures. The fisherfolk said the interchange will run parallel to Cleveland Bunder and severely constrict the only navigational route available to boats.In Thursday’s letter, a copy of which is with HT, the fisherfolk wrote, “The current situation is BMC’s fault as they didn’t consult us during the early stages of the project and have consistently refused to meet us despite our requests for the past three years. It is still not too late to make the necessary design change. We will continue our agitation till our demand for the navigation route is met.” “We hope that as the fisheries minister you will take cognisance of our demands and take the necessary steps to change the design of the interchange at Cleveland Bunder by increasing the distance between the two pillars to 200 metres to provide us with an adequate navigation span to facilitate unhindered and safe access to our fishing grounds and the open sea,” the letter added. As per current specifications, fishing boats will have to pass through two more, successive spans with a distance of 60 metres, which the fisherfolk said is insufficient.Over 100 fishing boats from Worli Koliwada have been staging a sit-in in the alignment of the interchange since October 30, halting the project’s construction work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/worli-fisherfolk-assured-of-meeting-with-maharashtra-cm-environment-minister-101636646860728.html
11-11-2021||Pune||National Achievement Survey to be conducted at 236 schools in Pune||PUNE Overcoming all odds, teachers from schools across the Pune district are fully prepared to conduct the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 today (November 12). The exam is organised by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and at least 236 schools from the city will participate in the survey that will assess students.The exam is a sample-based survey to assess students from Class 3, Class 5, Class 8 and Class 10 every three years.Teachers who are working as field instructors and observers noted that they faced a lot of issues with respect to obtaining the exam material ahead of the state transport strike.Initially, there were challenges of downloading the letter of appointment which allocated the required duties of the teachers. Later, many teachers who were observers and field instructors were allocated the schools as far as 90 km in the Pune district itself.Speaking about the issues, a teacher from Daund, on the condition of anonymity, noted that he had to collect the exam material on November 12 morning around 6 am and return to the exam centre allocated to him by 7:30 am the same morning.“The distance is a problem and so is the time. Travelling from Daund to Pune for collecting exam material and then returning to the centre was not feasible. After the exam, we again have to submit the answers the same day by 4 pm at a school in Kondhwa. In the midst of this, there is a strike which has forced many of us to use private transports like rickshaws,” said the teacher.Another teacher, who does not wish to be named said that while she lives in Daund, and her centre is at Bhor.“There is no public transport and I am forced to use my private vehicle for this long journey,” said the teacher.Another teacher from Junnar noted that the school allocated to him is in Pune city and he has to travel from his place of residence to conduct the exam.“It is difficult to commute while the strike is ongoing.

11-11-2021||Pune||Schools in Maharashtra focusing on bringing back students to offline learning||PUNE: With schools reopening after Diwali holidays in most parts of Maharashtra, the state education department has decided to focus on two major issues namely, mobile de-addiction of students to reintroduce them to normal offline learning and remediation teaching in which weak students will be given extra classes.Dinkar Temkar, state director of the education department, said, “There is good response to schools which have started offline classes prior to Diwali vacations, but one thing majorly noted is that students are addicted to online teaching. So, it is important to reduce their mobile or laptop addiction and engage them in offline studies through various teaching and fun activities and games.”“Another important process that we are focusing on is ‘remediation teaching’ under which extra classes will be taken for those students who are weak in studies. In the last several months, the connection with books, reading and writing habits has reduced amongst students. So, it is necessary to develop their studying habits and reintroduce them to the normal offline learning experience. Accordingly, instructions have been given to all district-wise education department officials and further to teachers,” Temkar said.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all schools were closed for almost two years during which, students right from the kindergarten to post-graduate level were exposed to online teaching. They are now so much addicted to online learning that it is becoming difficult to bring them back to the normal offline teaching mode.Even teachers are worried about the students’ mobile phone addiction. Swati Chitraw, a primary school teacher, said, “In our class, there are 20 students out of which currently only eight students have resumed offline classes. Other students and even their parents are demanding that online classes be continued; it has become like an addiction for them. The Covid pandemic will go away someday and we need to return to the normal education system. Even parents should understand this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/schools-in-maharashtra-focusing-on-bringing-back-students-to-offline-learning-101636646619141.html

11-11-2021||Mumbai||High court questions Mumbai top cop on inaction on couple’s threat complaint due to inter-caste marriage||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday pulled up Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale for not taking action against people who had forcefully taken away a woman from their community to Gujarat as she had entered into an inter-caste marriage. Nagrale, who appeared before the court, through video conference assured the court that the wrongdoers would be punished and round-the-clock protection would be provided to the couple, her in-laws and witnesses to the marriage, as they had received death threats from the community members. The court observed that if such things were happening in cities, it could not imagine what must be happening in the interiors.A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing the petition of Shivani Balsara and others, was informed by advocate Pranav Badheka that the woman belonged to the Ahir community from Chaubri taluka in Bhachau, Gujarat, and the second petitioner was her first husband and was a Brahmin. The court was informed that after the duo got married the Ahir community, led by the sarpanch and head, had opposed the inter-caste marriage, gave death threats to the couple and also assaulted the husband’s father. The petition stated that though a complaint was lodged with Mumbai Police in August, no action was taken, hence the petition was filed seeking police protection for the couple as well as the husband’s family and witnesses. The petition also sought orders restraining Bhachau police or any other police of Gujarat from summoning the couple or the husband’s family. The incident started in February 2020 when Shivani and Yash eloped from their village and came to Mumbai, however, Shivani was taken back by her family in March. She was forced to file a complaint against Yash. Yash was arrested and spent 4.5 months in jail. In December 2020 when Shivani returned to Mumbai with her family, she married Yash.Yash received threat calls and he lodged a complaint with the Powai police. On December 29, some members of the community convinced Shivani to go back to the village to end the unrest due to the inter-caste marriage, to which she agreed. However, at the village, she was tortured, threatened, assaulted and forced to file a false complaint against Yash with Bhachau police. In April 2021, Shivani managed to speak to Yash on the phone and narrated her plight. Yash filed a police complaint in Powai and a habeas corpus petition in HC. However, in the HC hearing held through VC, Shivani who was under duress by her father, brother and other community members told the court that she was in Gujarat of her own volition and did not want to be with Yash. In May itself Shivani was forced to marry a man from the Ahir community. The man raped and assaulted her when she objected. Shivani managed to flee from the village and reached Mumbai in August and lodged a complaint with the Powai police. However, no action was taken and hence she and Yash filed the petition. When the petition came up for hearing on Thursday morning, when the bench was informed of the inaction by the police on the August complaint the court directed the Mumbai Police commissioner Nagrale to be present in the afternoon.The court asked Nagrale, “With great difficulty, she came back to Mumbai. What if anything happens to her husband? Why is no action taken when there is a complaint by a woman? The father of the boy was beaten up when her second husband came. This complaint may not be by a lawyer, but it is by a citizen.” Nagrale responded stating that the episode had several stories, first marriage, then second marriage and the second husband’s complaint. However, when the court sought to know as to why there was no sensitivity to such an issue, Nagrale assured that immediate action would be taken. The court observed, “If such a thing is happening in cities then we cannot imagine what must be happening in the interiors. And why was there no protection to the girl when she complained? We want action against wrongdoers, not just security. Any person cannot come to Mumbai and threaten a woman. We need to take action.”Nagrale then assured the bench that there was no political pressure and officers would be deputed for protection. Thereafter, the court asked the investigating officer to conduct a thorough probe and directed the respondent sarpanch, head of community and others to file affidavits, and posted a hearing of the petition to Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-court-questions-mumbai-top-cop-on-inaction-on-couple-s-threat-complaint-due-to-inter-caste-marriage-101636645949456.html
11-11-2021||Mumbai||Sakinaka rape and murder: Mumbai court frames charges, trial to begin soon||The Dindoshi sessions court on Thursday completed the framing of charges in the Sakinaka rape and murder case. The court is likely to start the trial soon, after going through the necessary documents.The accused, Mohan Chouhan, was charged under sections 302 (murder), 376 (A) (committing an offence of rape and inflicting injury which causes the woman to be in a persistent vegetative state), 376 (2) (m) (causing grievous bodily harm or endangering the life of a woman while committing rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as well as relevant sections of the Maharashtra Police Act and the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.The prosecution, through senior advocate Raja Thakare and advocate Mahesh Mule, had submitted draft charges, based on which additional sessions judge HC Shende framed the offences against Chouhan, 45. The prosecution on Thursday also submitted a list of the witnesses to be examined, along with other forensic documents, before the court.According to the police, the 32-year-old victim had met Chouhan on September 10 at Kherani Road in Sakinaka around 3am. A CCTV camera had captured Chouhan assaulting the victim and later pulling her towards a standing tempo, where he allegedly sexually assaulted her and left her severely injured. A watchman, who saw the woman in an injured state, informed the police, following which she was rushed to Rajawadi Hospital, Ghatkopar. She died in the hospital a day later.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, after a high-level meeting with senior police officers, had directed that the state home department appoint a special public prosecutor and fast track the case. Following the incident, Mumbai Police had formed a special investigating team (SIT), headed by officer Jyotsna Rasam, which had submitted a 346-page charge sheet in 18 days’ time. In the charge sheet, the police had said that Chouhan and the victim knew each other and that the accused was angry at the woman as she had gone out of the town for 15-20 days without informing him.The SIT had recorded the statements of 77 witnesses in a short period of time. The police said the watchman had identified the accused during the identification parade that was carried out recently, which further strengthened the prosecution’s case.In the last hearing, the court had provided Chouhan with legal aid and had appointed Kalpana Waskar as his counsel.The incident had sparked a massive outrage in the city. Mumbai Police has formed Nirbhaya teams at every police station level to maintain a list of sexual offenders from the past five years’ data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sakinaka-rape-and-murder-mumbai-court-frames-charges-trial-to-begin-soon-101636645769029.html

Sail was accompanied by his lawyer Hemant Ingle and was questioned for almost four hours. The SIT was formed on November 5 and headed by deputy director general Sanjay Singh to investigate the recent cruise drug bust case and five other cases including that of Sameer Khan, son-law of NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik. The SIT wanted to verify about ‘punch’ (witness) statement as he earlier claimed that his signature was taken on blank pages by NCB officials as per the instruction of zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Sail’s lawyer told the media there is no change in the statement his client had given to the media earlier. Ingle added, “As per the statement given by Sail to police, KP Gosavi (another independent witness in the cruise drug case) had saved Sail’s mobile number as SW (Sameer Wankhede). Gosavi had even instructed Sail to call him when he would be talking to (actor) Shah Rukh Khan’s manager Pooja Dadlani, so he could show her that he was talking to Sameer Wankhede.” Sail also said in his statement that KP Gosavi was also in touch with Sameer Wankhede.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-ship-drug-raid-prabhakar-sail-questioned-by-ncb-sit-101636644987346.html
11-11-2021||Patna||Hooch deaths: 823 arrested in 48 hours||In a major crackdown in the wake of the hooch tragedies that have left 41 people dead in Bihar since Diwali, 823 people have been arrested in the last 48 hours in raids at more than 1,300 locations in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Gopalganj, West Champaran and East Champaran districts, police said.In Muzaffarpur, police have arrested 400 people, including five candidates of panchayat samiti, and busted three rebottling units. “We have registered 150 FIRs (first information report) with the 40 police stations and nabbed 400 people involved in making and supplying spurious liquor,” Muzaffarpur’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Jayant Kant said. On October 29, six people had died while some others fell ill after consuming suspected spurious liquor at Rupauli village under Saraiya police station of Muzaffarpur. Among the four people arrested in this connection is a newly elected ward member Amit Kumar, who allegedly organised the liquor party. Int the second incident, a liquor party organised in the house of a mukhia candidate ended up claiming six lives. The incident occurred at Manipur-Narottam panchayat under Kanti police station ahead of panchayat election scheduled for November 15. In Gopalganj district, where 13 people died in a hooch tragedy in Mohmmedpur police station area, police have arrested 275 people and registered 105 FIRs, besides seizing 34 vehicles. “After the incident, several raids were conducted and 11 people involved in hooch tragedy have been arrested,” said Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar. In Samastipur, where at least seven people, including a BSF jawan and an army jawan died, the police have arrested 65 people and lodged 32 FIRs so far. In East Champaran, police have lodged 83 FIRs after the arrest of 92 people and recovered 11,000 litres of liquor including 8,000 litres of spirit, said SP Navin Chandra Jha. West Champaran SP Upendra Nath Verma said police have carried out raids at 493 locations and nabbed 161 people in the district where 14 people have died of suspected hooch consumption in November so far.Change in modus operandiPolice sources said those involved in making illicit liquor have begun mixing sedative tablets with spirits, a reason why it is leading to poisoning and other health problems. Another new worry, say police sources, is mushrooming of localised spurious liquor units since smuggling IMFL (Indian made foreign liquor) bottles from states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal and Nepal has become increasingly difficult. As per latest police records, 6,852 smugglers from Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal have been arrested in last five years since Prohibition was enforced in Bihar in April 2016. Political crossfireLeader of Opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, described the recent hooch tragedies as “organised killings” and asked if it was not true that liquor was being supplied through police stations. “What is the result of thousands of meetings to review the impact of prohibition when this is the ground reality? Under whose patronage the liquor mafia is getting by so emboldened,” he asked through his tweet. Congress MLC and spokesman Premchandra Mishra, too, has been questioning the policy. “It is no more time to review prohibition. Time has come to have a rethink on it, as so many deaths have amply proved that checking smuggling is not this government’s cup of tea. People’s life is precious,” he said. However, chief minister Nitish Kumar has maintained that Prohibition in the state was imposed after the unanimous decision of the state legislature and that all should work to make it successful. After the latest hooch tragedies, the chief minister had said he would hold a review meeting on November 16 . Major hooch tragedies in Bihar Aug 15, 2016: 19 people had die in Gopalganj, 21 policemen, including an SHO, dismissed from the job. In March 5 this year, a district court awarded death penalty to nine people and life sentences to four women in the case.March 31, 2021: In Nawada, 16 people, including a teenager, die after Holi. Police arrest 20 people, including two women. Five officials, including an SHO and an excise sub-inspector, suspended. July 2021: 16 people die in Lauriya and Ramnagar police stations areas of West Champaran.November 2012: In West Champaran, 14 people die under Nautan police station limits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/hooch-deaths-823-arrested-in-48-hours-101636644267222.html

However, there were many who decided not to visit crowed ghats and instead made temporary ponds on the rooftops of their houses to offer ‘arghya’.Chief minister Nitish Kumar also took part in the Chhath festivities at his official residence. “It was heartening to see that people have turned out in such large numbers at the ghats. This familiar sight we could not see last year because of Corona”, the CM said on Wednesday after he surveyed the ghats .. Besides the common people, several inmates across the state including one Nigerian and a Bangladeshi woman performed Chhath Puja. While the Nigerian inmate, Yugwum Sinachi performed the puja at Saheed Kudiraam Bose jail, the Bangladeshi woman, Reena Khatoon, performed the puja at Siwan jail along with 20 inmates. “Around 200 inmates performed Chhath Puja inside the jail including one Nigerian inmate and one Bangladeshi woman.

A social activist, he also worked to prevent child marriages and child labour. According to the citation, he prevented 450 child marriages and got 950 child labourers admitted to schools. Besides, he kept 850 children suffering from malnutrition under his care so that they could regain their health and pursue education. Many of the Musahar children went on to complete their higher secondary and graduation. Maulana Abul KalamAzad Shiksha Puruskar was instituted in 2007 and carries ₹2.5-lakh prize money. Bihar was the first state to announce the celebration of the birth anniversary of India’s firth Education Minister Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad as Shiksha Diwas in 2006. From 2007, the government instituted the award to recognize the significant contributions being made in the field of education. “The contribution of Maulana Azad is huge. He was also the Congress president. He was the one who exhorted minorities not to leave India when the situation due to partition had turned very difficult. We wanted his birthday to be celebrated at the national level and we also wrote to the Centre in this regard. The Centre accepted it and from 2008 it is being celebrated at the national level on Maulana Azad’s birth anniversary,” said the CM, while talking to reporters after the brief function. Kumar said that the Shiksha Diwas function was usually a big event, but it had been scaled down due to Covid. With the Covid situation improving and things under control in the state, it will again get back to its old scale and grandeur. The objective behind this function is to let the younger generation know about the life and work of Maulana Azad,” he added. Apart from the CM, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, health minister Mangal Pandey, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar and a host of others participated in the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-presents-bihar-s-highest-edu-award-to-doc-turned-social-activist-101636644207101.html
11-11-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik, Devendra Fadnavis kin send legal notices to each other for defamation||Matters came to a head on Thursday between Maharashtra minister of minority affairs Nawab Malik of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and former chief minister and leader of opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) when their respective family members sent legal notices to each other for defamation. Malik’s daughter, Nilofer Malik Khan, sent a legal notice to Fadnavis while, Fadnavis’ wife Amruta Fadnavis sent one to Malik. Khan sent a legal notice seeking an apology for Fadnavis’s claims about her husband Sameer Khan. Fadnavis alleged earlier this week that Sameer was in possession of 200 kg of ganja when the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) raided his home in January this year. Nilofer asked for an apology, failing which, she contended, she will demand ₹5 crore as damages for “mental torture, agony, financial loss and injury.” In response, Amruta Fadnavis demanded deletion of the defamatory tweets against her husband within 48 hours with an unconditional apology or face the criminal and civil suits. Amruta slapped the notice in response to Malik’s allegations about Fadnavis’ alleged connections with drug peddlers and an accused arrested in a drugs case. The legal notice sent to Fadnavis reads, “The charge sheet filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau does not support even a single allegation levied by you. The panchnama dated 14/01/2021 clearly says that the house was searched and no contraband/suspicious substance was found in my client’s house or under his possession. But from which source you obtained such false, frivolous and baseless report is better known to you.” It adds: “That my client is demanding damages amounting to ₹5 crore on account of mental torture, agony, financial loss and injury inflicted to his reputation and honour due to the statements which you made in the news telecast, viz. ABP News.” In a tweet, Nilofer said, “False accusations ruin lives. Before one accuses or condemns, they must know what they are talking about. This defamation notice is for the false claims and statements which Devendra Fadnavis levelled against my family. We will not back down.” Malik said in response to the Fadnavis notice, “She has a right to file a case and I have the right to fight it out legally.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-devendra-fadnavis-kin-send-legal-notices-to-each-other-for-defamation-101636644087152.html

Farmers raised slogans against the BJP-led Central government and threatened to intensify their agitation if their demands are not met in the coming days. The farmers also criticised the Centre government for not releasing compensation due to farmers, whose land is situated across the barbed-wire fence, for the past five years.Addressing the protesters, comrade Ratan Singh Randhawa said, “The BJP government has been trying to spread terror among the people. By increasing the jurisdiction of the BSF from 15 km to 50 km, the Centre has taken possession of half of the Punjab state. Implementation of law and order is a state subject. The people of Punjab will never allow the action of the Centre government.”Comrade Amarpal Singh Asal said, “The Centre should focus on the 15-km jurisdiction to curb the smuggling bid from across the border and release compensation of the border farmers. Farmers face difficulties in just accessing their fields across the fence.” The farmers handed over a memorandum to BSF’s assistant commandant Karampal Singh and naib tehsildar Jaswinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/border-farmers-protest-outside-bsf-hqs-in-amritsar-101636642647034.html
11-11-2021||Other||{ ₹20,000cr Faridkot royal property dispute} Daughter files plea in court against police move to cancel will forgery FIR||Faridkot In a dispute over royal property valued at ₹20,000 crore, the only surviving daughter, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, 87, of the last ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Faridkot has filled an application in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) on Thursday. In her plea, she has opposed the cancellation report that the police have filed on a First Information Report (FIR) in which 23 members and employees of the Mahrawal Khewaji Trust were accused of forging the Maharaja’s will.This FIR was lodged in August 2020, after the Punjab and Haryana high court ruled that the will of the last ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Faridkot, Harinder Singh Brar, was forged in favour of the Maharwal Khewaji Trust in 1982. Later, a case of fraud was registered against the 23 trust members, including chairman Jai Chand Mehtab, who is also the son of her elder sister, Deepinder Kaur, and a prince of the erstwhile royal family of West Bengal. The erstwhile ruler’s granddaughter and Mehtab’s sister, Nisha D Kher, who is the vice-chairperson of the trust, was also named in the FIR. The trust has challenged the high court order in the Supreme Court, where it is pending.About a year after the registration of the FIR, the police had approached the court on June 2 and sought the cancellation of the FIR. In her affidavit through her daughter in the CJM’s court, Amrit, has opposed the cancellation report filled by the police claiming that FIR had been registered on true and real facts and on the findings of the high court regarding forgery of Maharaja’s will and the plundering of royal estate. She also prays in her plea that the cancellation report moved by Faridkot police may be ordered to be rejected and investigation agency directed for re-investigation in view of the findings of the Punjab and Haryana high court judgment. The high court had upheld a Chandigarh court’s order last year, awarding majority share in the ₹20,000-crore property of Brar to his two daughters — Amrit Kaur and Deepinder Kaur. The court held that descendents of Manjit Inder Singh, the last ruler’s brother, would get their mother Mohinder Kaur’s share.On the will at the centre of the dispute, the court had observed that the trustees conspired to create the will to usurp the property. “The will is proved to be forged, fictitious, fabricated and shrouded with suspicious circumstances,” the court order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/20000cr-faridkot-royal-property-dispute-daughter-files-plea-in-court-against-police-move-to-cancel-will-forgery-fir-101636641986944.html

In Maharashtra, nearly 52 lakh doses are currently in the private sector hospitals and most hospitals fear that the vaccines may expire due to the low demand. The Serum Institute of India’s (SII) Covishield has a shelf life of nine months. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin had a shelf life of six months, but it has now been extended to 12 months. Private hospitals were allowed to procure vaccines directly from the manufactures from May this year. Most hospitals, therefore, have vaccine stocks likely to expire between February and April 2022. “But with the demand for paid vaccination gone down, some of the doses available with us can be utilised as boosters,” said Dr Joy Chakraborty, chief operating officer (COO) of the PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim and president of AHPI’s Maharashtra and Goa chapter. AHPI represents the majority of healthcare providers in the country and it has been in a constant dialogue with the government over the past several weeks about vaccine stocks. “We have put forward a proposal to the government to consider allowing a third dose for healthcare workers and those with comorbid conditions or compromised immunity,” he said. According to Dr Chakraborty, PD Hinduja currently has a stock of 19,000 doses which will expire in April 2022. But the hospital has recorded a 90% drop in its daily vaccinations. From an average of 2,300 to 2,400 shots administered daily in June, the numbers have dropped to 200 per day now. Most private hospitals have witnessed this decline after vaccine stocks in government centres became abundantly available. A doctor said that private hospitals indulged in panic buying during the months of May, June and July, not realising that the public sector had started receiving stocks smoothly. Over the months, the public sector also added more centres, which helped decentralisation. The cost of one dose of the vaccine ranges from ₹780 to ₹1,400 in the private sector. “People who were willing to pay for the jabs have already taken them,” said Dr Prince Surana, chief executive of Mumbai’s Surana Group of Hospitals that were administering an average of 1,500 doses between June and July and the numbers have now dropped to 300 per day. “Now, people mostly prefer going to the public centres as the crowd had reduced,” he said. A small group of doctors had approached SII as well as the state government to discuss the possibility of buying back the stocks from them. “But the buyback option was shot down questioning the manner in which private hospitals may have stored the stocks,” said a doctor who had participated in the dialogue. Dr Archana Patil, head of the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) Maharashtra said the state government can’t do much on this issue. “The private hospitals should tie-up for corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in districts across the state to exhaust their stocks. They should not allow the stocks to get wasted at any cost,” she said. National Covid-19 task force member Dr Subash Salunkhe agreed. “It will be criminal negligence if any of the stocks are wasted. Private hospitals should bear the loss, but tie-up with smaller districts or companies and carry out free vaccinations, if needed. They should figure out ways in which their vaccines could be directed to areas with low vaccination coverage,” said Salunkhe, who is also a former advisor to Maharashtra on Covid-19. Salunkhe believes that the Centre must allow a third dose for the healthcare workers and immunocompromised citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/private-hospitals-urge-for-covid-booster-shots-buyback-to-clear-vaccine-stock-101636641387179.html

Divisional railway manager (DRM) Dr Seema Sharma; senior divisional commercial manager Chetan Taneja; senior divisional engineer Abhinav Garg and station director Ashok Salaria were among the other senior officials presented in the meeting. Malik said that when he became MP in 2016, Amritsar railway station was in a decrepit state where there was no system of clean drinking water, clean toilets and even escalators remained non-functional. Malik added that with support from Prime Minister Narendra Modi; former Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, Piyush Goyal and now Ashwani Vaishnav, the Amritsar Railway Station will be a role model for all stations across the country. “Development work has been done at ₹500 crore, and another ₹300 crore will be spent on the facade of the station, under the Public Private Partnership Model (PPP) model. We have also built the Chheharta railway station ar ₹60 crore. To connect the inner city with the civil line, a rail bridge has been built on the Bhandari bridge,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/malik-takes-stock-of-amritsar-railway-station-redevelopment-101636641267101.html

I want to ask why the AAP is not giving command in the hands of Punjabis, who were born on a historic land. They have not selected any leader from Punjab. Previously, the AAP appointed a leader from Uttar Prades as in-charge, and now men from Delhi are in-charges,” Bhattal claimed. Bhattal, who addressed the media at the PWD Rest House, praised Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government for its ‘speedy decisions’ on development, but claimed that progress was slow during the tenure of Capt Amarinder Singh.“I used to say Amarinder is my big brother and Navjot Singh Sidhu is my younger brother. Amarinder, however, has changed his stance, but I am still standing on my principles. When Amarinder visited my residence, I advised him to meet Sonia Gandhi, but he quit the party,” she claimed.The former Lehra MLA said she had never left her constituency over the past several years, and had nurtured it well. “Now, it is up to the Congress party to decide whether I or my son Rahul Inder will contest from the Lehra segment in 2022 state assembly polls,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-modi-not-men-of-principles-bhattal-101636640738186.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Common dialect, a bond that survived Partition||Eighteen years ago, one of my friends who was a movie producer arranged a week-long singing tour by the then famous singer, Kumar Sanu, to Malaysia, and he invited me along to cover it as a journalist. We were put up at a splendid property in the Genting Highlands Resorts situated on the peak of Mount Ulu Kali with a few seven-star hotels and a casino in the area. On the first night, dinner was planned at a fine restaurant. The ambience was perfect, and a youngster was singing ghazals and songs for the entertainment of the diners. On spotting Kumar Sanu in the restaurant, the young singer was thrilled and started singing several of his songs as a tribute. During a break in between songs, the singer approached us and sought Sanu’s permission to join us. He took up a seat that was vacant next to me and started talking animatedly with Sanu. After a while, with all five of us at the table enjoying a few good laughs, the singer turned to me and politely enquired about my hometown. Knowing well that he was from Pakistan and concluding, therefore, that he may not be familiar with the interiors of India, I replied that I was from Delhi. “Proper Delhi?” he said. So, I elaborated that I was from a town called Kurukshetra 160km north of Delhi. I sensed that the singer had something more on his mind. A little later, he again enquired if I had been born in Kurukshetra, to which I replied in the negative and explained that I was, in fact, born in Eminabad, which is now in Pakistan. A radiant smile appeared on his face and he exclaimed, “Oh! Mein eho hi toh ab tak janna chah rah tha (That’s what I wanted to figure out).” I was puzzled by his response, but it became clearer as he continued. With great excitement, he informed me that he was from Kamoke, a town close to Eminabad. He explained that there were some aspects of my speech that reminded him of his hometown, which was why he was keen to establish the link. Surprised, I asked him how it was possible as I was all of two years old when my parents shifted from Eminabad after the Partition. Ever since, I’ve been talking in Hindi with a smattering of Punjabi. The singer enumerated several words uttered by me in the past few minutes of our interaction that were typical of the Punjabi-speaking people around Eminabad. A newfound kinship was established through this shared past. The singer described how my birthplace had transformed since Partition. He mentioned that a national express highway passed through the area now, and that land prices had increased exponentially. I let him know that my family had a thriving business and industrial establishment at Kamoke Mandi prior to the Partition. He offered to show me around the area if I were to visit my birthplace. For the next six days, the singer made it a point to meet us at least once a day, and he would regularly bring up our old bond. Though I’ve forgotten his name and contact details, the incident still evokes strong emotions when I recall it. Clearly, language is a shared bond, and the fact that one’s dialect can trace one’s origin back to the birthplace so much later in life, is quite a humbling revelation. We are all products of our environment – the more we are allowed to explore beyond man-made borders, the more we are likely to find common ground; this is even more important now, in these Covid times, when we are being pushed to isolation and distant lives. vijaysabharwal@yahoo.com The writer is a Kurukshetra-based veteran journalist and social activist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/common-dialect-a-bond-that-survived-partition-101636640607119.html

Among these, 13,500 (33%) confirmed that they had taken their second dose under a different mobile number. The remaining who haven’t taken the second dose yet gave health reasons or claimed to be outstation.The 85,897 pending beneficiaries are due for the second dose from 85-147 days of which three are due for the second dose since 147 days.“The beneficiaries who took their first dose ideally should not have any hesitation in taking the second dose. Yet, we would soon be initiating a door-to-door drive for the second dose. With slums, we are confident that the door-to-door initiative would be successful,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.The civic body also plans to have vaccination drives at railway stations. “Currently we have 20 buses that are stationed at markets for the vaccination drive. Each bus goes to three or four locations daily for vaccination and it is getting a good response. Each bus is able to vaccinate around 100 people daily. Looking at the response we have received in markets, we plan to start similar initiatives outside railway stations too,” Bangar added.Even as the state had given a target of 11.07 lakh for the vaccination, NMMC has vaccinated 11.32 people with the first dose and 6.44 lakh with the second dose.“We are also planning to get in touch with the state government to make changes in the software and make it mandatory to link Aadhaar card of all the beneficiaries so that the status of vaccination of all the beneficiaries is updated correctly,” Bangar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/135k-in-navi-mumbai-confirm-taking-2nd-vaccination-against-covid-under-different-mobile-number-101636638626674.html

Similarly, around 4.01 lakh who have taken the first jab are yet to take their second dose.Out of all the age groups, KDMC claimed that the vaccination per cent is the highest in the 18-45 years age group wherein more than 91.35% of the eligible population in this category has taken the first dose out of the listed 5.77 lakh beneficiaries.Meanwhile 42.01% of this age group has taken their second dose.“The vaccination among the 18-45 years age group has improved in recent days with the introduction of vaccination in colleges for students. We are on the verge of reaching 100% of the first dose for this age group category,” said an officer of the health department, KDMC.Out of the overall total 13.59 lakh listed population, the civic body has so far managed to vaccinate 67.68% with the first dose and 38.15% with the second. While the young population is the most to be vaccinated in the KDMC limits, the vaccination among senior citizens is comparatively less.As per the KDMC records, only 44.27% has been vaccinated with the first dose and 32.66% with second dose in the 60 years and above category.“There is a need to hold a separate camp for senior citizens in all the wards of Kalyan-Dombivli so that most of the senior citizens are vaccinated. They are more vulnerable to the infection and have various other illnesses,” said Dattatray Marathe, president of senior citizen association, Kalyan (E).Recently, the KDMC has started a door-to-door survey in the city to get data on the number of people vaccinated with the first and second doses and those not jabbed with even the first dose. The health workers are also checking if there are beneficiaries who have taken the first dose and are due for the second.“Since the vaccines are available in a good amount now compared to earlier, we have started the door-to-door survey to reach out to people who are not coming to the centres for their vaccination. Meanwhile, they are also contacting residents through the CoWIN app and inquiring,” said Ganesh Doiphode, in-charge of Covid vaccination in KDMC.“Not just checking on the residents, the team is also counselling those residents who are reluctant on taking the dose. Educating and spreading awareness is also a part of this survey taken up by the civic body since the start of this month. The survey will give us an idea of how many are remaining for the first and second doses. In a month, we will get a picture of the same and accordingly we can take up the necessary steps,” added Doiphode.Yogidham Kajal Makhija, a 35-year-old resident of Kalyan (W), said, “As of now, there is no survey happening in big housing societies by the civic body. There are many senior citizens in these buildings who have not taken their jab. The civic body should have a count of them and make sure they are vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/more-than-4-39l-residents-in-kalyan-dombivli-yet-to-get-first-vaccination-against-covid-101636634131039.html

This was India’s biggest ever contingent to the Paralympic Games.Yogi announced that UP’s first Sports University would be established in Meerut and its construction work would begin soon. “It will be named after great hockey player Major Dhyan Chand,” he said.Appreciating the growth of the sports goods manufacturing sector under the One District, One Product’ (ODOP) scheme of the government, Yogi said Meerut had taken a leap in this sector. The ODOP scheme was launched in 2018 with a vision to give special identity to districts and linking them with jobs creation.He appreciated the efforts of the paralympians who won medals in Tokyo, braving odd conditions during the pandemic. He made a special mention of Noida district magistrate Suhas LY, saying: “I posted him in Noida during the pandemic and he did exemplary work in controlling Covid and also worked hard on his sports skills to win a medal at the Tokyo paralympics.”The chief minister announced a promotion along with a cash prize of ₹4 crore for his achievements.Sharing changes made in the state’s sports policy to benefit sportspersons, Yogi Adityanath shared that medallist paralympians from across the country had been invited for the felicitation.

The commuters on these routes faced a lot of troubles when MSRTC started the strike on October 28.Yogesh Kaduskar, general manager of NMMT, said, “Taking the inconveniences of the commuters into consideration, we are now running 30 extra buses on those routes. These buses are doing around 80 trips a day to ensure that the commuters travelling to those places do not face any problem. We will continue with this service till MSRTC calls off the strike.”The commuters, however, complain that despite these extra buses, the frequency is not up to the expectations. Sudheer Salvi, a 51-year-old Nerul resident, said, “Earlier, for travelling from Navi Mumbai to Mumbai on Sion-Panvel Highway, the buses were available every 15-20 minutes (due to MSRTC’s Panvel-Dadar route). Now we have to wait up to 45 minutes to board an NMMT bus to go to Dadar.”Because of the MSRTC strike, NMMT’s other buses going to Mumbai are also receiving a relatively better response. “We have regular buses going to Bandra, Borivali, World Trade Centre, Andheri and Mulund among others. As ST buses are now absent on the roads, more people are boarding our buses to commute locally,” another NMMT official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-municipal-transport-operates-30-extra-buses-as-msrtc-strikes-101636632330554.html

The residents suspected the polluted water of the lake to be the cause for this.Even as the PCMC officials did not reveal the quantity of the dead fish, the residents said it would be around 20kg. Among the dead fish were Jitada (Indian sea bass), Mogra (catfish), Bombil (Bombay duck) and Bangada (Mackerel). Manish Shirke, a 45-year-old activist from Panvel, said, “Some people from this area throw their household garbage, nirmalya, plastic, thermocol sheets, etc. into the lake. Several vegetable and fruit vendors from the nearby markets are also often spotted throwing their waste there. Due to these actions, the lake water has turned very dirty. However, the PCMC officials have taken no efforts to clean it for the past several years.”Bhupen Patil, a 53-year-old resident, said, “The lake is at the heart of the city and it would not be easy for anyone to mix chemicals with the water. We suspect the fish died due to the polluted water caused by the garbage. The authorities concerned should take this matter seriously and clean all the dirty lakes in the city.”A senior PCMC official said, “We will clean that lake and the work will be started within a few days. We have also coordinated with the officials from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to check the pollution levels and they will come and do the needful soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/a-large-number-of-fish-found-dead-in-krushnale-lake-in-panvel-101636629746143.html

Everybody was scared of dead rats and policemen.Ragho Sakharam Nijsure was 25 when three of his siblings died of the plague leaving their wives and children behind. He now had a family of twenty to take care of. The printing press he worked at had to be shut due to the epidemic. Nijsure, like everybody else, did not know what to do.Perhaps it was this desperation that made him seek a job in a bakery. Working in a bakery, touching bread, and biscuits were considered taboo among many castes of the Hindu religion. The workers in bakeries were almost always Muslims, Parsees, or Anglo-Indians. Aware of the consequences of working in a bakery, Nijsure must have kept his new job hidden from his family, friends, and neighbours. When hunger gets inside you, nothing else can.Nijsure features in an eight-line report published on December 12, 1901, in the newspaper “Jnanaprakash”. It mentions that he worked in a “bhiskutacha karkhana” (biscuit factory) on Sholapur road while omitting the name of the factory.There were two bakeries on Sholapur road – the Government Steam Bakery and Nazareth’s Bakery.The Government Steam Bakery was started in the late 1850s. All the bread and biscuit needed for the British troops stationed at Poona, Kirkee, Bombay, and Ahmednagar were made in this bakehouse.The bread was made at first from “first sort” flour received from Calcutta and Bombay, and subsequently with a portion of Trieste flour, which improved the quality. Biscuits were issued to the troops every week. It was of excellent quality. Bakery products were also supplied from Poona to troops going overseas. “The Record of the Expedition to Abyssinia - 1878” notes that (the biscuit) “kept good for a long time, and was never flinty.” Toddy was used when the bakery started its operations. Around 1890, toddy became dearer, being sold at five annas per measure. It was then replaced by yeast prepared from potatoes and hop flowers.The potatoes were boiled; their skins peeled off and then squeezed into a mass. The mass together with hop flowers was boiled again. A definite quantity of flour was added to the decoction thus got and the whole mixture was allowed to stand till evening. Then it was added to the flour which was to be made into bread.However, the use of yeast thus prepared was limited. Yeast powder or baking powder was not used. The Government Bakery preferred using malt and used yeast rarely.It was rumoured among the Hindu community in Poona city that yeast was actually powdered animal bones. This ensured that they stayed away from bread. Major Rennie, R. A. M. C, in 1870, suggested bread as a vehicle for infection, the native flour being contaminated in kneading, and not heated enough in baking to destroy germs lodged in the centre of the dough. A few cases were recorded by him to support his claim.It was therefore recommended that all bread for the troops should be made in a commissariat bakery, under proper sanitary supervision. The Government thought that it would be most advantageous if the cakes, pastry, and biscuits sold in the coffee-shop and temperance-room in the Cantonment could also be made in the Government bakery, instead of local European bakeries, or in some native bakehouse in the purlieus of the bazaar, “whence they arrived heavy, sodden, and indigestible, and possibly also containing germs of disease in the active state.”In order to achieve this, the Government Steam Bakery installed advanced machinery to make flour and bake cakes and biscuits. The person responsible for this was Joshua Alfred Alexander Turner. Born at Poona on August 10, 1848, he started working in the Royal Gun-Carriage Factory at the age of 15. He later worked in the Mint at Bombay and assisted in the erection of engines, boilers, and machinery, for the new Mint there. He was next in the service of Messrs. W. Nicol and Co., Bombay, assisting in the erection of engines, boilers, cotton-presses, etc. He was then appointed assistant engineer in the Government Mills and Steam Bakery at Poona, and afterwards became head engineer, and ultimately superintendent and engineer of these mills, and inspector of commissariat mills and bakeries. Before Turner retired, he had made sure that the Government Steam Bakery was one of the best in India.However, the products baked in this bakery were largely consumed by the soldiers. Whatever little was left was made available to the common public.To counter this, the Cantonment Magistrate, Colonel La Touché, encouraged a European baker to open a steam-bakery, “whence clean and good bread, flour, and biscuits may be had at lower rates than obtained in the dirty Portuguese hovels of the bazaar”. This was reported in “The Bombay Gazette” on June 10, 1885. The correspondent felt that it was inexplicable that “Poona bread should hitherto have been dearer and inferior to that of Bombay, Poona being a centre of the wheat-producing districts.”“Bombay has had its steam flour mills and European bakeries for years, and we are now equal to Bombay in respect at any rate of the staff of life supply”, the correspondent wrote.The new bakery too was situated on Sholapur road, a capital site for such a factory, being near the waterworks and in an airy and clean part of the Cantonment. The buildings of the new bakery were fitted with “English machinery, including the modern contrivances for converting wheat into flour and flour into bread in the most cleanly and speedy manner possible.”This new bakery mentioned in the report was in all probability Nazareth’s Bakery.Nijsure must have worked in one of these bakeries. The report in “Jnanaprakash” mentions that his friends came to know of his secret when they found his “health certificate.”It could be surmised that at least a few bakeries in Poona were in an unsatisfactory condition. To prevent the spread of contagious diseases through the workmen of the bakeries, a condition was introduced in 1885 by which all workmen in the bakeries should obtain medical certificates as to health. Certificates, however, were not obtained for all the workmen in some of the bakeries. In those places, there were always a set of men under the pay and control of the proprietor or manager of the bakery, who baked bread, while there were other men who hired the oven of the bakery during certain hours.The latter class, as a rule, had no medical certificates, nor did they wear aprons while at work. They worked in the bakery generally during nights. To put an end to this practice, it was proposed the inspectors visited the bake-houses during nights.Nijsure carried a “health certificate”, which meant he was directly employed by the proprietor. But it landed him in trouble. He was asked to pay a fine of ₹100 by a local priest for touching the bread. I do not know if he paid the fine. It didn’t matter if he paid or not. He and his family would likely have been outcasted anyway.“Jnanaprakash” does not mention Nijsure again. I hope he survived in this city.Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast.

11-11-2021||Patna||Bihar health dept botches up age cap for appointment of IGIMS director||The Bihar health department has made a mistake in fixing the qualifying upper age limit and that of completion of tenure while issuing an advertisement for the post of the director at Patna’s Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), an autonomous institution under the government of Bihar, people privy to it in the department said. The department, while prescribing age relaxation from 60 to 65 years in case of re-employment of government servants, has allegedly overlooked changing the age criteria for “tenure of post” in the advertisement. “…the director shall hold office for the term of five years from the date on which s/he enters upon his/her office (till) s/he attains the age of sixty-five years, whichever is earlier,” reads the advertisement. The qualifying upper age limit, however, mentioned in the advertisement, remains 60 years, “relaxable for government servants or specially qualified and experienced candidates,” says the advertisement. It further says, “A government servant in the service can be appointed on deputation on foreign service terms up to a period of five years. Retired government servant can be re-employed. (Upper age limit relaxed up to 65 years in this case).” Officials said the advertisement was fallacious. “How can the qualifying upper age limit on relaxation in case of re-employment of retired government servant, and the maximum age bar against tenure be the same?” a senior officer in the health department pointed out to HT. Sample this. In this case, Dr Nihar Ranjan Biswas, director, IGIMS, completes his term at the IGIMS on February 25, next year, while he attains the age of superannuation of 65 years in May 2022. Given the present eligibility criteria in the advertisement, Dr Biswas can re-apply for the director’s post, but will be eligible to serve the institute only for a few months, if selected, till he turns 65 years of age in May. “The government should have either increased the tenure of director’s post beyond 65 years of age or kept the qualifying upper age bar lower than 65 years to allow an experienced incumbent a reasonable time to perform. Instead, it hasn’t changed the tenure age cap of 65 years while allowing age relaxation up to 65 years for retired government servants seeking re-employment,” said the officer quoted above. The ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) has raised the qualifying age bar from 62 years, prescribed for the director earlier, to 67 years, and also the tenure age bar from 65 to 70 years while issuing an advertisement for the post of executive director (ED) at each of the seven new AIIMS at Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Rishikesh (Uttarakhand), Guwahati (Assam), Awantipora (Jammu & Kashmir), Patna and Darbhanga (both in Bihar). The health ministry had issued the advertisement for executive directors of seven AIIMS in April. The state health department issued the advertisement for director of IGIMS in October, but did not make the necessary changes. The IGIMS rules are based on the premise of AIIMS-Delhi. The last date for submission of application by candidates is November 15. “The health department can still do a course correction by making necessary amendment to the advertisement and increasing the tenure age cap to 70 years, as done by the Central government for executive directors of the seven new AIIMS,” said another officer. Senior state health officers did not respond when contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-health-dept-botches-up-age-cap-for-appointment-of-igims-director-101636627827660.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||BSF jurisdiction: Amarinder asks Punjab govt not to politicise national security||Rejecting the Punjab government resolution moved in the Vidhan Sabha on Thursday against the Centre’s move to extend the operational jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) from 15km to 50km, former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh asked the state government not to politicise the issue of national security for petty partisan motives. Also read: BSF jurisdiction: Punjab assembly unanimously passes resolution against Centre’s move“The operational jurisdiction of the BSF concerns national security and not law and order in the state, which the current powers that be in Punjab are apparently not able to understand,” he said in a statement issued in Chandigarh. Capt Amarinder Singh said that it was sad that the government was trying to politicise an issue that concerns national security and all border states, including Punjab. Needed to counter Pakistani drones He said that it’s not only Punjab but states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and others where the BSF jurisdiction is 50km inside the international border. The former chief minister added that Pakistan is using sophisticated technology and highly improvised drones with a range of 30km, so it is important that the BSF gets more operational jurisdiction. “Extending the operational jurisdiction of the BSF neither infringes upon the federal authority of the state, nor questions the competence of the state police in maintaining law and order, as some vested political interests are trying to make out,” he said. Difference between law and order and national security He said that there is a huge difference between law and order and national security. “Unfortunately, people playing up the issue are unable to make out the difference between law and order and national security,” he said, adding, “The BSF like Punjab Police is our own force and not any external or foreign force coming to occupy our land.” Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Thursday moved a resolution in the Vidhan Sabha’s special session, demanding the withdrawal of the Union home ministry’s directive that increases the BSF jurisdiction. Randhawa termed it an expression of distrust towards the state police and people of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-jurisdiction-amarinder-asks-punjab-govt-not-to-politicise-national-security-101636627825526.html
11-11-2021||Mumbai||Close to half of Dharavi’s targeted population fully vaccinated against Covid-19||About 45-50% of Dharavi’s population that was targeted for Covid-19 vaccination, comprising residents aged 18 years and above, has been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease, according to Mumbai’s Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Authorities, however, said it is difficult to know the exact number of people in Dharavi who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.Door-to-door surveys conducted by the civic body’s health officials are only giving ballpark estimates. Dharavi has a total population of around 445,000 as per the 2011 census, which includes. The BMC’s door-to-door surveys in Dharavi conducted for pulse polio or for the “My Family, My Responsibility” campaign showed that the total population of the area could be higher than the 2011 census estimation by about 50,000-60,000. Also Read: Dharavi records zero fresh Covid-19 cases on six days in OctoberA senior civic official from the G North ward said, “It is possible to only estimate… the population of Dharavi as we also have a large number of floating population in the area, who come in daily or weekly. Also, some of them who are not residents of Dharavi choose to get vaccinated at an NGO-operated health post or CSR-organised camps.” There are two municipal vaccination centres in Dharavi. A private hospital and a bank have been operating camps under CSR, and pledged to vaccinate 100,000 beneficiaries with the first dose and another 100,000 with the second dose. “Those who get vaccinated at these camps do not get counted in our total vaccination figures,” the official said. So far, 50,908 people have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 at municipal vaccination centres, with 127,985 having taken the first dose. In April and March, the BMC saw a slow response to Covid-19 vaccination among the residents of Dharavi. Many were unaware about the documents required for a jab, and several residents didn’t have the necessary papers. “[But] now there is more awareness about taking the vaccine. Also, fear surrounding the issue [of vaccination] has gone down. Moreover, the vaccine has become compulsory in many services and for accessing some markets. So, the vaccination drive has taken off well since July,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/close-to-half-of-dharavi-s-targeted-population-fully-vaccinated-against-covid19-101636627345571.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt passes resolution against Centre’s farm laws||The Punjab assembly passed a resolution against the Centre’s three farm laws during the special session of the state assembly in Chandigarh on Thursday. Punjab agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha moved the resolution that was followed by a debate marred by four adjournments, totalling an hour after chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi passed remarks against Shiromani Akali Dal leader and former revenue minister Bikram Singh Majithia. During the debate, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu blamed the Shiromani Akali Dal for the three laws and said the beginning was made by then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal by notifying the Contract Farming Act, 2013. Sidhu sought the abolition of the Act passed during the Akali-BJP government’s tenure, terming it anti-farmer. Also read: BSF jurisdiction: Punjab assembly unanimously passes resolution against Centre’s moveLeader of opposition in the assembly, Harpal Singh Cheema of the Aam Aadmi Party, also accused the Akalis of supporting the farm laws. Even after these laws were framed, he said, SAD president Sukhbir Badal, former CM Parkash Singh Badal and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal supported the laws and only snapped ties with the BJP when farmers were opposed to the laws and started the protest. Farmers have been protesting since November 26 last year against the three farm laws, namely the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Farmer leaders and the Centre have held several rounds of talks but the impasse remains. Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa asked the Aam Aadmi Party MLAs to join the Congress in condemning the Akalis for walking out when the resolution against the three farm laws was introduced. Capt comes in for rare praise from bête noire Sidhu praised former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for introducing the Termination of Water Treaties Act in 2004 to safeguard Punjab’s interest. He said the minimum support price (MSP), Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC), and public distribution system (PDS) were introduced during the Congress government’s tenures. Sidhu also praised Capt Amarinder Singh on steps taken for farm debt waiver in the state. House adjourned four times over CM’s remark against MajithiaConcluding the debate on the resolution on the three farm laws, chief minister Channi accused Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia of corruption and smuggling. This led to a vociferous protest from Majithia and other Akali MLAs, who entered into the well of the House, objecting to Channi’s remarks. A heated exchange ensued between Akali and Congress MLAs. The House was adjourned for four times to restore order. Deputy speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti extended the adjournment by 15 minutes while Akali and Congress MLAs were called for a separate meeting.Meanwhile, Sidhu claimed that the Akalis were deliberately creating a ruckus in the House to cover their failures on the farm laws.Akalis demand CM apologise to Majithia; barred from HouseWhen the House resumed after almost an hour’s adjournment, Adampur Akali MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu said Channi had diverted the attention of the House from the debate on the three farm laws and should apologise to Majithia.Leader of opposition Harpal Cheema said Channi had no right to speak ill of any MLA and asked why the special task force report on drug smuggling had not been made public. Even after the resolution was passed, Akali MLAs continued to protest against Channi and were adamant that he apologise. The House was adjourned yet again and the protesting Akali MLAs were barred from attending the House proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-govt-moves-resolution-against-centre-s-farm-laws-in-punjab-assembly-101636625305055.html

Sameer Wankhede, caught in a firestorm since last month over the drugs bust case involving actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, had lodged a complaint with the commission against Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik. The inquiry is being conducted by assistant commissioner of police (ACP)-level officers who have recorded Sameer Wankhede’s statement.A senior police officer confirmed the development and said Mumbai police recorded Sameer Wankhede’s statement last week and may record the officer’s statement again, if required.The inquiry is being conducted by ACP Rekha Bhavre of Mumbai’s Borivali division. Sameer Wankhede’s complaint was lodged with the Goregaon police. But as the ACP post of the Goregaon division was vacant at that time, the ACP of Borivali division was tasked to take up the matter.Also Read: SRK’s manager to be summoned again, say cops as Pooja Dadlani skips questioningComplaints received under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act are investigated by an ACP rank officer, according to legal provisions.Sameer Wankhede has faced a series of allegations levelled against him by minister Nawab Malik since last month in connection with the drugs bust case. Malik made the allegations via press conferences and Twitter posts. In his complaint to the SC commission, Sameer Wankhede raised objections to words such as “bogus” that Nawab Malik allegedly used while referring to his family. Sameer Wankhede had trashed all the allegations, saying Malik targeted his family and went personal in his attacks. The top NCB officer also visited New Delhi and met the SC commission’s chief, submitting documents related to his first marriage and subsequent divorce, in the context of some allegations made by Nawab Malik.Following Sameer Wankhede’s complaint, the national commission had issued a notice to the Maharashtra government on October 29, asking it to submit a report within seven days.A police officer, who wished not to be named, said, “We are looking into the complaint. All the allegations… are being looked into. Statements of other witnesses are also being recorded. If we can make out a cognisable offence… a First Information Report (FIR) would be registered and an investigation would commence. A report of the findings of the police enquiry would also be sent to the commission.”Earlier, Yasmeen Wankhede, Sameer Wankhede’s sister, filed a complaint at Oshiwara police, seeking the registration of an FIR against Malik for allegedly defaming her.Sameer Wankhede’s aunt Gunfabai Gangadhar Bhalerao also filed a case against Malik in Aurangabad under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.Some of Sameer Wankhede’s family members and relatives have lodged complaints at Washim and Goregaon police stations in Mumbai.The NCB’s special enquiry team (SET), which is carrying out a departmental vigilance probe, has also recorded Sameer Wankhede’s statement. The SET was constituted after one of the “panch witnesses” of the drugs bust case, Prabhakar Sail, alleged in an affidavit that he overheard his former employer Kiran Gosavi, also a witness in the case, talking to a person about “settling the matter” for ₹18 crore and that Sameer Wankhede would need to be paid ₹8 crore.Mumbai police also formed an SET to look into the allegations made by Sail and have recorded statements of more than 15 individuals. The SET has summoned Shah Rukh Khan’s manager Pooja Dadlani and waiting for her to be present before the cops so that her statement could be recorded. She skipped the summons citing health issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-start-inquiry-into-sameer-wankhede-s-complaint-101636620204566.html

The police said that Altaf was accused of eloping with a minor Hindu girl and strangled himself in the washroom of the lockup.However, Altaf's family members alleged that he was killed by the police.Taking to Twitter, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati said the death of another youth in police custody is very shameful and sad."The government should give strict punishment to the culprits by conducting a high-level inquiry into the incident and also help the victim's family,” Mayawati said. कासगंज में पुलिस कस्टडी में एक और युवक की मौत अति-दुखद व शर्मनाक। सरकार घटना की उच्चस्तरीय जाँच कराकर दोषियों को सख़्त सजा दे तथा पीड़ित परिवार की मदद भी करे। यूपी सरकार आएदिन कस्टडी में मौत रोकने व पुलिस को जनता की रक्षक बनाने में विफल साबित हो रही है यह अति-चिन्ता की बात।She added that it was a matter of great concern that the state government was proving to be a failure in preventing deaths in custody.Five police personnel have been suspended for their negligence in the Kasganj case.On Wednesday, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) too lambasted the state government over Tuesday's incident.SP chief Akhilesh Yadav claimed Altaf's death as suspicious and that the suspension of police personnel is a mere eyewash. "In this case, a judicial probe should be held to generate confidence in the police in the BJP regime," Yadav tweeted.Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi cited other cases of custodial deaths in Uttar Pradesh and said the law and order situation is in complete disarray under the Bharatiya Janata Party's rule."Is there anything called human rights left in Uttar Pradesh?"

11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Increasing BSF jurisdiction shows distrust towards Punjab Police: Deputy CM||Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who holds the home portfolio, on Thursday moved a resolution, demanding the withdrawal of the Union home ministry’s directive that increases the Border Security Force’s (BSF) jurisdiction from 15km to 50km in the state. Also read: Punjab assembly: AAP, Akali MLAs protest, want special session extendedRandhawa termed the Centre’s move an attack on the federal structure and an expression of distrust towards the state police and the people of Punjab. He said the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government in Punjab will challenge the notification in the Punjab and Haryana high court. The resolution moved by Randhawa said: “Punjab is a land of martyrs and the brave. Punjabis have made exemplary sacrifices in the freedom struggle and later on in the wars of 1962, 1965, 1971 and 1999 and received gallantry awards. Punjab Police is a unique patriotic force that has contributed in maintaining the unity and integrity of the country. According to the Constitution, maintaining law and order is the responsibility of the state government and for this purpose the government of Punjab is fully competent.” He said: “The decision of extending the jurisdiction of BSF from 15km to 50km by the Union government is an expression of distrust towards the state police and the people of Punjab. This is their insult, too. The Union government should have consulted the state government before taking such a major decision. The law and order situation in Punjab is totally under control. Extending the jurisdiction of BSF is symbolic of petty politics. All parties of Punjab have unanimously condemned this decision and demanded the Centre withdraw the October 11order issued by the ministry of home affairs, Government of India. Therefore, the Punjab Vidhan Sabha unanimously resolves that a resolution rejecting the notification of the central government in this regard may be passed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/increasing-bsf-jurisdiction-shows-distrust-towards-punjab-police-deputy-cm-101636613245169.html

We have eyewitnesses, but he is [still] not getting bail.” The hearing of Ali’s bail petition at the high court had earlier been deferred due to various reasons after a sessions court rejected the bail plea on September 4.Hashmi said that he wouldn’t comment on judiciary proceedings, but the police and government counsel were trying to delay the matter.The government counsel Aditya Garg said, “Hearings can get deferred due to many reasons, it’s not an unusual thing.

A video went was widely shared on social media where a few people were seen stopping Mann’s SUV in the middle of the road and then jumping on its bonnet. Later, they were seen in another video smashing the vehicle with lathis in a market.Akali leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal was in Ferozepur city on Wednesday to hold a series of party programmes. SKM activists, led by Harnek Singh Mehma, the district president of the Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda) had gathered to protest Harsimrat’s scheduled visit.Mehma said a delegation of farmers wanted to meet Harsimrat to raise questions related to the welfare of the agrarian community. “As we gathered, SAD leaders tried to hit us deliberately. In an attempt to save ourselves, I and a few others jumped on the bonnet of Mann’s car that dragged us to a distance. At least seven rounds were fired but we survived,” Mehma claimed while addressing the media.Denying the charges, Mann said a group of protesters led by Mehma attacked his SUV. “My vehicle was following the convoy of Harsimrat. Since I was trailing, the mob started smashing my vehicle and several rounds were fired. My personal security officer, a Punjab Police constable, had to open fire in the air in self-defence,” Mann claimed.Ferozepur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harmandeep Singh Hans said: “This is a serious matter and I am personally looking into all aspects. It is premature to comment on the use of firearms by either side or a PSO attached with the Akali leader.

11-11-2021||Lucknow||Eye on UP polls, Priyanka Gandhi to launch ‘padayatra’ in Lucknow today||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will on Thursday take out a ‘padyatra’ (foot march) across various parts of Lucknow as part of the grand old party's ‘Pragati Yatra’ launched last month in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. The foot march today is scheduled to begin at the Badi Kaliji temple in the Chowk area and end at the Dargah Hazrat Abbas after cutting through the Old City.According to a letter that the local Congress committee in Lucknow issued for the people of the city, the padyatra aims to raise awareness regarding the party's electoral promises, especially in the interest of women and public welfare.The route chosen for Priyanka Gandhi's foot march is seen as politically significant; according to Congress, it is intended to play on the "secular" chord of a Lucknow long past to propagate the party's idea of a nation. As per a report citing Ajay Kumar Lallu, the UP Congress chief, the padyatra on Thursday is aimed at reminding people that the thread which binds India is a shared legacy “above the realms of caste and religion”.Priyanka Gandhi has been active in campaigning for the party in Uttar Pradesh, ahead of the state assembly polls next year. She has taken the lead during Congress protests over a host of issues in the recent months, including the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, and issues of farmers, labourers and traders. On Wednesday, she also slammed the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly attacking Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) workers in Shahjahanpur.Uttar Pradesh is scheduled to go for assembly polls early next year.In the 2017 UP Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had secured 312 seats in the elections for the 403-member House. Samajwadi Party (SP) had bagged 47 seats, BSP had won 19 while Congress had bagged seven seats in the last Assembly polls in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/eye-on-up-polls-priyanka-gandhi-to-launch-padayatra-in-lucknow-today-101636588405647.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Substandard living conditions irk voters of ward 3||On election day, voters in ward number 3, will go for a candidate who resolves the ever-increasing parking problem, works towards improving sanitation levels and upgrading the sewage system.After the reorganisation of wards, most areas of the erstwhile ward 19, are now the constituents of the Ward 3. It includes Sector 26, Sector 26-E, EWS Colony, Bapu Dham Colony Phase 1, 2 and 3, Police Line (Sector 26) and Madrasi Colony (Sector 26). Transport area has been excluded from the new ward.At the centre of the ward is one of the oldest clusters of housing created for economically weaker sections (EWS) of the society – the Bapu Dham Colony phases 1, 2 and 3. Created more than 40 years ago, the colony has expanded over the year in different phases. The area came into limelight last year when it became the city’s epicentre of Covid pandemic.“At the time of its inception, in fact even a decade ago, nobody visualised that people would face car parking problems. Even the planners didn’t earmark parking space in EWS housing. But now the situation has changed dramatically --for the worse,” said Harish Kumar, a local resident who runs a taxi. Residents complain the “community parking” space in the community centre is not enough. It only provides space for 30-40 cars, and so most of the cars are parked either on the roadside or in small parks and there is no space left even for emergency vehicles to reach the interiors of the area, say residents.An older problem for the area is the sewerage system. “The sewerage system was recently re-laid. But in areas like phase 2 and 3, the sewage overflows and leakages still remain. Either the MC didn’t complete the job systematically or the material used was substandard,” said Prakash Singh, a resident who works in a factory in Baddi.Health infrastructure also needs improvements in the area, say residents. Akash Shankar, an engineer and social activist, said, “There is a dispensary in the mandi but for the large population of the area, it is inadequate. A health centre with better facility is required here.”A visit to the area indicates roads in most areas and outer parks are in relatively good shape. Though residents inform that these improvements have happened only in the last four or five months. The general sanitation and garbage collection system, say residents, leave much to be desired. Yogesh Arora, running a wholesale business in vegetable and fruits, says, “MC garbage vans do come but the numbers are highly inadequate. People end up dumping their garbage in the open. Cleanliness should also be done more comprehensively in the area.” In the last elections, Dalip Sharma won as an independent candidate though later he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party.Yanki Kaliya, from opposition Congress party and a resident of Madrasi Colony, said, “There is space available for additional parking but nothing was done on this. No major projects have come up. Other colonies have new community centres, sports complex, etc but here we have nothing.”Sharma, said, “We have resolved most of the issues related to roads, sewage, parks and sanitation in the last five years.” On the parking problems, he said, “Earlier, there was no such problem, it has cropped up only recently. We will provide solution to it too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-substandard-living-conditions-irk-voters-of-ward-3-101636588948085.html

11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers, SKM should form a political party: Haryana Democratic Front general secy Chitra||Haryana Democratic Front’s general secretary Chitra Sarwara on Wednesday said that to solve the impasse over three contentious agricultural laws, the protesting farmers and their umbrella body Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) should form a political party. “I think that the formation of farm laws is a result of politics, so the solution has to be political too. They (farmers) have to show their power politically. We’ve seen this recently during the bypolls, when the ruling BJP lost in many regions and the fuel prices were slashed drastically,” she told the media on the sidelines of the party’s second foundation day celebrations in Ambala Cantonment. However, party’s founder and her father Nirmal Singh differed from the statement and said that this is her personal opinion. But we will always support the farmers, he added. The HDF also passed a resolution to support the farmers’ cause. Nirmal Singh’s native village Mohra, his stronghold, has also been the centre of the farmers’ agitation and seen maximum participation in the protests. Most of the senior leaders of farm unions and activists belong to the same region. Nirmal and his daughter, considered close to the Hoodas, parted ways from the Congress just before the 2019 assembly elections on being denied party ticket. Both contested unsuccessfully as Independents. However, the party lost its first test after its formation when its mayoral candidate Amisha Chawla lost security deposits and the candidates could only win two out of 20 wards in the 2020 municipal elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-skm-should-form-a-political-party-haryana-democratic-front-general-secy-chitra-101636585702596.html

11-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Sudama, at Turkman||The legendary Sudama of the ancient age was an impoverished childhood friend of Lord Krishna. He didn’t have enough money to feed his children. But the Sudama in contemporary Delhi is well endowed with namkeens, biscuits, barfis, toffees, rusks, and many varieties of mouth freshener. The pavement kiosk bearing this celebrated name is even more rich in its GPS. It stands directly across the road from Turkman Gate, one of the only five surviving gateways of the Walled City of Delhi. Its rear faces the historic Ramlila Maidan.Nonetheless, the shop occupies a very little place in the world. The green-painted tin cabin looks like a papier-mâché artefact. Inside, sits the gentle owner as tightly as a pea in its pod. Everyone calls him fondly as Bhai Sudama.This evening the traffic is chaotic beyond belief. The air is numb with the cacophony of car horns. Cocooned in calmness, Sudama (the shop) is exuding friendly indifference to the surrounding bedlam. A dozen men—area’s rickshaw pullers and labourers—are gathered about the stall. Sitting quietly on their haunches, each person is holding either a barfi or a biscuit.Ensconced within his beloved kiosk, Bhai Sudama is feeling too bashful to talk of the tiny landmark that heroically holds its own in this neighbourhood of famous landmarks (Haj Manzil, Delhi Stock Exchange, Faiz Elahi Mosque, Ramlila Maidan, Holy Trinity Church and of course the Turkman Gate). “I opened it more than 20 years ago, no… may be 30 years,” he laughs, shaking his head, surprised by his confusion about the timeline.Moments later, he silently shifts on his cramped seat to “adjust” Muhammed Shamshul, a “lorrie driver” and a stall regular. Both men start to talk about the forthcoming wedding of Bhai Sudama’s daughter that will take place in his village in Madhubani, Bihar. The chitchat gradually shifts to gossiping about the personalities of Turkman Gate locality. These are no idle moments, though. Bhai Sudama is simultaneously handling ”hurry-hurry” customers who are continually showing up at the counter—one of them desperately wants a change of ₹500 (he is obliged).By now the sun has dipped behind the Civic Center, the multi-storey that stands on the other side of the Ramlila Maidan. The sky swiftly blackens. Bhai Sudama turns on the lamp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-sudama-at-turkman-101636584560946.html

The revenues will be shared between the Chandigarh administration and municipal corporation in 70:30 ratio. Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (CREST) will implement the project. “The 2MWp floating special purpose vehicle (SPV) floating power plant will generate 28 lakh units per annum and would be set up under the CAPEX mode where all the expenditure will be borne by the CREST,” stated a report submitted to the MC by the society. The proposal for the same will be submitted before the MC General House for its approval on November 12. Notably, an agenda for the same was brought before the MC House on August 30 also, but the House had sought more details from the CREST. In response, the CREST has submitted that the revenue share plan was decided by the UT finance department in 2015 for allowing use of MC building. “Therefore, same model has been proposed for floating SPV between MC and CREST for setting up floating solar power plant to be installed at raw water tank number 7 and 8 at Sector 39 water works,” the CREST has informed the MC. The cleaning, it said, can be done by shifting the power plan to one side of the tank as “panels are floating in nature or by dismantling them in case the tank is completely emptied”. Panels can be reinstalled later. “The floating power plant will be installed in such a manner that it can be shifted in any corner during maintenance,” said the CREST’s fresh submission to MC states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-floating-solar-power-plant-mc-house-to-take-call-this-friday-101636585162802.html

Police said they recovered 1,873 grams of fine quality Canadian marijuana from the three men, adding that unlike the marijuana grown in India, imported marijuana is costlier.The darknet or dark web is a network within the internet which is not accessible through search engines. Over the past few years, criminals are increasingly using the darknet to smuggle drugs and weapons, police said.Joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar pegged the value of the seized contraband at ₹35 lakh. “The consignment was ordered on the darknet and payment was made in bitcoins. The selling price of the seized consignment is approximately ₹40,000-50,000 per ounce (28 grams), depending upon the paying capacity of the buyer. In the USA, it goes for about $600 per ounce,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-nabbed-for-using-darknet-to-import-marijuana-101636582853880.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||High court asks tribunal to decide on route permit disputes of Punjab transporters||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday referred to the state transport appellate tribunal the petitions on route permit disputes between the Punjab government and private transporters. The court was dealing with a bunch of petitions, including some filed by the state government, in which the tribunal’s stay order was challenged. “In all the appeals, an identical issue is involved. Therefore, it is appropriate for the tribunal to decide the lead case positively within a period of 15 days,” the bench of Justice Anil Kshetarpal said while disposing of the pleas. The court said that all the counsels would be allowed to assist the tribunal so that the issue is decided in the lead case to facilitate expeditious disposal of the remaining cases. The parties through their counsels were directed to appear before the tribunal on November 11 to work out the modalities of procedure to be followed at the time of hearing, the bench said. The Punjab transport commissioner had cancelled the extension of the original permits beyond 24 km to a large number of transporters in the state. One such order was passed on October 18, cancelling the extension with an immediate effect. The transporter concerned had approached the tribunal on November 1 against the decision and the latter stayed the October 18 order. Following this, other transporters too had obtained stay orders on November 3 from the tribunal. The government had challenged the November 1 order in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-asks-tribunal-to-decide-on-route-permit-disputes-of-punjab-transporters-101636582702384.html

11-11-2021||Bhopal||Parents accuse Bhopal hospital of ‘hiding truth’||Ankush Yadav’s twin daughters were born on October 8, within seven months of his wife Ranjana‘s pregnancy. The couple knew they would face hardships and the children battled to tide over health problems that are often associated with premature births.On Monday, the girls died within 16 hours of being admitted to the childcare ward at Kamla Nehru Hospital -- where a fire on Monday claimed the lives of at least four newborns. One of Yadav’s daughters is among those in the fire deaths count -- the other, hospital authorities say, died due to “medical conditions” (like seven other children in the ward since the fire broke out at 8.30 pm on Monday).Yadav, however, alleged that both the girls were killed in the blaze. “If what the hospital people are saying is true, I should have been allowed to see my other child. I was given the bodies of my twins in boxes,” said the vegetable seller in Bhopal.Ankush said that he was at the nearby pharmacy, purchasing an injection, when the fire broke out. He was allowed to enter the hospital at around 2 am, and later informed that her one child died because of fire, and the condition of the other was serious. On Tuesday morning, one of the bodies was handed to him in a box; and that night, the other’s.“I have not shared the news with my wife as she would not be able to bear the pain of the loss,” he said.On Wednesday, the hospital administration said that a total of eight newborns, who were “saved” in the fire in the SNCU on Monday night, died due to other medical complications.These eight deaths are more than twice the average deaths reported at SNCU ward over a 36-hour period -- about two a day due to various complications, according to hospital records.Arvind Mishra, an activist working on health issues in Bhopal, said the neonatal deaths in MP is highest in India quoting a report of Sample Registration Survey (2018), which said the rate is neonatal deaths per lakh in Madhya Pradesh was 35.According to a national health mission, out of total admission, 11.5% newborns die at SNCU.“It is hard to understand that out of 40, eight i.e., 20%, newborns died due to medical complications in Kamla Nehru Hospital after the fire. The hospital should clear the actual cause of deaths,” he said.The fire at the broke out at the child intensive care unit reportedly due to a short-circuit in a ventilator machine. At the time of fire, there were 40 children in the ward that can house 60 newborns.The eight floor building of Kamla Nehru Hospital is a part of Hamidia Hospital, the biggest government hospital in Bhopal, and didn’t had a fire clearance for the past 15 years. Officials admitted that no fire safety audit of the building was done in the last five years.After the incident the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC), under which the fire department comes, sought fire safety report from the hospital authorities. “We are going to review fire safety in all government hospitals,” said state health minister Vishwas Sarang.Even after the tragedy, the tussle between parents and the hospital continues.Seeta Vishwakarma, a resident of Bagsewaniya , in Bhopal, said the doctors told her that her two-day-old baby was absolutely fine after the fire. “But on Tuesday afternoon, they handed over her body to us.”Rahul Prajapati, a resident of Bhopal’s New Jail Road, said he was finding it hard to trust the hospital’s version. “The doctor said on Tuesday that the condition of the baby is serious, and they asked me to arrange blood. But later, a nurse informed that I lost my baby. I don’t know whether the death of my child is natural or not, but I lost trust in the government hospital.”Two parents refused to take the bodies, and demanded DNA tests to ascertain if the children were really theirs.The hospital insists these deaths were not related to the fire.“On Monday between 8pm to 12 midnight, we lost four babies [due to the fire]. But from Tuesday till 12 noon Wednesday, we lost eight more children due to other medical complications, and their death has nothing to do with fire,”said Dr Jyotsana Shrivasatava, head of the hospital’s paediatrics department.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday held a meeting with health department officials, and dean of Gandhi Medical College, Dr Jitendra Shukla, hospital superintendent, Dr Lokendra Dave, and hospital director, Dr KK Dubey, were removed; and a deputy engineer of Capital Project Administration (CPA), Awadesh Bhadoria, was suspended.

11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana industrialists take round the ‘begging bowl’ to protest inflation||Out on the roads to protest against inflation, particularly the rising price of raw material, industrialists shook begging bowls in front of commuters outside the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) office at Gill Road on Wednesday. As the indefinite protest against soaring prices entered the nineth day, owners of industrial units accused the Union government of only listening to the big corporate houses. The protesters said that the funds collected during the symbolic protest will be transferred to the Union government to draw its attention to the plight of small industries. Representatives of different industrial sectors, including bicycle, hosiery, auto parts, and textile, have demanded the formation of a regulatory commission to control the rising prices of raw material. Former UCPMA vice-president Inderjit Navyug said, “The Union government is turning a blind eye towards the problems of the industry. Steel prices have doubled over the last two years. We have already suffered due to the pandemic, and the rising prices of raw material is further taking a toll on us. Many units are on the brink of collapse, which will also lead to large-scale unemployment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-industrialists-take-round-the-begging-bowl-to-protest-inflation-101636578444922.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Alternative land rights on anvil for moving occupants of unauthorised constructions||In order to remove unauthorised constructions in Chandigarh villages, the UT administration is considering giving alternative land development rights to people living in such constructions.Stating that the situation in city’s villages are too complicated because of large-scale illegal constructions, and limitations imposed by the Chandigarh Master Plan (CMP), UT adviser Dharam Pal, said, “As per the CMP, we cannot have constructions in green zones. So, we will have to remove all illegal constructions on such land.”For removing such unauthorised constructions, the administration is exploring different options under the proposed land-pooling policy. On Wednesday, the adviser held a high-level meeting on the issue.In the meeting, the final contours of the policy were discussed and Pal directed officials to formulate a draft proposal and put in the public domain for taking their suggestions.“One of the options under the land-pooling policy is to give alternative land development rights for people to move to other locations. This will allow us to give alternative housing options to them. This will also allow us to remove all unauthorised constructions in villages,” said Pal.Challenges galoreBut the road ahead for land pooling policy is not going to be an easy one. “In neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, where large tracts of contiguous lands are available, it is much easier to implement a land-pooling policy. But in UT, there are a lot of haphazard constructions within lal dora and outside it,” said Pal.Also, administration cannot go against the master plan. “Other option is bringing amendments in master plan, which will be a very lengthy and time-consuming process,” added Pal.Notably, the Punjab New Capital Periphery Control Act also restricts constructions in the periphery of around 16km (controlled area) of the city. Punjab and Haryana high court too has imposed restrictions on construction for protection of Sukhna Catchment Area within which many of city’s villages are located. Pilot village For overcoming such challenges, the administration is now planning to introduce the land-pooling policy in phases. As per the current administration’s thinking, the policy will be first introduced in villages, and if successful then it will be implemented parallelly in other villages too.The regularisation of the illegal construction and extension of the lal dora has been a long-standing demand of village residents, which has found strong support among all political parties.The administration has earlier ruled out extension of the lal dora, but is exploring ways to develop villages so that these constructions can be removed and alternatives be given to people living in these constructions.For this purpose, along with land-pooling policy, the administration has also started working on comprehensive village development plan as mandated by the CMP.The administration has roped in the Indian Institute of Human Settlement (IISH), Bengaluru, to formulate a land pooling and aggregation policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-alternative-land-rights-on-anvil-for-moving-occupants-of-unauthorised-constructions-101636577782257.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||‘Chronic drug addict’ behind 30 vehicle thefts in Ludhiana||In a major breakthrough, the police have arrested a “chronic drug addict” who was responsible for around 30 vehicle-lifting incidents across the city, many of which took place at the civil hospital parking lot where he was formerly employed, on Wednesday. Twenty-three stolen vehicles, including 12 motorcycles and 11 scooters, have been recovered from the accused, Billa alias Laddu, who was arrested from the area under the Division-2 police on the basis of a tipoff. Investigating officer Rajwant Singh said, “So far, the accused has admitted to committing 30 thefts. There may be more, but Billa is unable to recall them as most were carried out under the influence of drugs.” Billa, who worked for a parking contractor at the civil hospital for five years, says he started living at the hospital after his parents’ death. It was there that he developed a drug habit and also learnt how to unlock scooters and motorcycles. It was to fund his drug habit that he started stealing vehicles. However, after the contractor started receiving multiple complaints of vehicle theft from the lot, he was sacked. Chucked out of his job, he started living on the footpath and started keeping an eye on scooters and bikes parked near the park, busy marketplaces and outside temples and gurdwaras.Would borrow money against stolen vehicles Rajwant said the accused, who suffers from a severe infection in his legs, would borrow money from people purportedly to seek treatment against the two-wheelers. “After stealing the vehicle, he would roam the city and borrow money from people on the pretext of getting treatment for his leg. In lieu of the borrowed amount, he would lend the stolen scooter or motorcycle. However, instead of getting treatment, Billa would buy drugs,” says Rajwant. Some of the stolen vehicles were recovered from a parking lot outside the Shamshanghat on Dholewal Road near the Military Cantonment,” said Rajwant.The accused was presented before the court on Wednesday and further sent to police remand. Rajwant Singh stated that currently they were probing the matter further. Cops are also trying to zero-in on the person supplying drugs to the accused and whether he had accomplices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chronic-drug-addict-behind-30-vehicle-thefts-in-ludhiana-101636577722902.html
11-11-2021||Lucknow||After ballistics report, SIT focuses on accused’s location||Officials probing the Lakhimpur Kheri incident are trying to establish the presence of the three accused, Ashish Mishra, his friend Ankit Das and his private gunner Latif, at the spot of the violence after a forensic report confirmed that shots were fired from their licensed weapons, said a member of the special investigation team (SIT) on Wednesday.The official said investigators were looking into the cell phone locations and call details report of the three accused, who are currently in jail. He said the SIT had also found some unclaimed mobile phones from the site and sent them for further examination.He said the ballistics report of the three weapons—a rifle, a repeater gun, and a pistol belonging to three accused— confirmed that firing was done from these weapons in recent times.But he added that there was no clarity on when and where the firing was done.He said the ballistic report was not sufficient to say firing was done by the same weapons at the site of the violence. He said the post-mortem examination of the four farmers, who died in the incident, had ruled out bullet injuries.He also said the ballistic report of one more weapon recovered from another co-accused, Satya Prakash Tripathi, was awaited.“Although Ankit Das and his gunner Latif had mentioned in their statements that they fired in the air to escape from the spot when the mob attacked them after a convoy of cars ran over a group of protesting farmers, Ashish Mishra had maintained that he was not present at the violence site,” he said.The SIT had recovered the weapons from Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das, and Latif days after the violence. Ashish Mishra is the son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’.Ashish Mishra, who has maintained he was not present at the site of the violence, was arrested on October 9. Das and Latif were taken into custody five days later.The farmers alleged there was firing during the violence and that a farmer from Bahraich died of a bullet wound. But two post-mortem examinations of the farmer ruled out bullet injuries.The post-mortem reports of the eight, who were killed in the incident, concluded they died of shock, excessive bleeding, and haemorrhage caused by ante-mortem injuries and that none of them received bullet injuries.Four farmers, three Bharatiya Janata Party workers, and a journalist were killed in the violence in the Tikunia area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3.Farmers say a car belonging to Mishra ran them over while the accused blame farmers for torching vehicles and killing three people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-ballistics-report-sit-focuses-on-accused-s-location-101636577426676.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana road cave-ins: MC to use tech to detect chinks in sewer lines||After facing a barrage of criticism over the Deep Nagar road cave-in, in which a woman and two schoolchildren had a close shave, the municipal corporation has finally decided to check the condition of the four-decade-old sewer lines crisscrossing the city’s underground. Ground penetrating radar will be used to check vulnerable points such as Deep Nagar, Dugri phase 2, Kaka Marriage Palace Road, Model Town Extension, and Fountain Chowk among other areas where cave-ins are frequently reported. This will allow the authorities to assess the state of the sewer lines without digging up the roads. So far, the MC officials had been claiming that it is not possible to locate leakages in underground pipelines. The MC had also proposed to replace the old sewer lines under the Smart City Mission. However, the project, which was to cost around ₹ 80 crore, is yet to see the light of the day. Officials say damage to the brick-sewer lines causes leakage, which in turn causes soil erosion and ultimately the caving-in of portions of roads. The municipal corporation has been blaming the laying of underground wires for damage to the brick sewers. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “Additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal is exploring options to assess the condition of sewer lines without digging up the area. Any hollow portions beneath the road will be identified and corrective measures will be taken. The matter was also discussed in the meeting of the MC’s finance and contracts committee (F and CC) on November 8. It will be difficult to identify leakages below the roads across the city, but the MC will cover the areas where cave-in incidents have been frequently reported.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-road-cave-ins-mc-to-use-tech-to-detect-chinks-in-sewer-lines-101636577362567.html

The worst-hit in the tricity, Mohali has witnessed as many as 33 dengue deaths in the past forty-one days.The latest victims of the viral infection include a 65-year-old man of Phase-7 who was admitted at IVY hospital in Sector 71; and a 45-year-old woman of Phase-10 who was undergoing treatment at Sohana hospital.Of the total 35 deaths this year, 29 were logged in October alone, followed by four in November. Two people had succumbed in September. This is the highest toll since 2018 when eight people had died. In 2019 and 2020, only one fatality each was confirmed.However, Chandigarh and Panchkula recorded no new fatality on Wednesday, keeping this year’s death tally at 3 and 1 respectively.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur said, “Though there has been a drop in the number of cases over the past few days, the maximum cases are being reported from urban areas of Dera Bassi, Kharar, Phase-7, Phase-10, and 3B1.”She further said, “When our team visited these places, it was found that there was a lot of plastic waste such as carry bags, empty bottles, disposable glasses scattered, and stagnant water in various places in the villages. Plastic waste is the most suitable place for breeding mosquitoes as empty bottles, glasses and other items collect rainwater in which it is natural for mosquitoes to breed.” Arrangements were made by the health department to carry out anti-larvae spray, she added.Mohinder Pal Singh, president, residents’ welfare and development, Sector 79, said, “Fogging is not done on regular basis and at several construction sites in Mohali, water can be seen accumulated, which become a breeding mosquitoes.”119 more infected in tricityMeanwhile on Wednesday, the health authorities confirmed 119 fresh dengue infections in the tricity, with Mohali reporting 69 cases, followed by 26 in Chandigarh and 24 in Panchkula. The UT has so far recorded 1,133 dengue cases, of which 244 surfaced in November. Of the fresh cases on Wednesday, maximum cases were reported from Manimajra and Hallomajra. Mohali’s dengue count has now gone up to 3,437 while Panchkula’s case tally stands at 751.In Panchkula, the hospitals are flooded with suspected cases of dengue as there were 114 suspected cases of dengue till date, including 65 in government hospitals and 49 in private hospitals. Forty-nine suspected as well as confirmed cases of dengue are admitted in private hospitals, 65 patients in Government Hospital, Sector 6.As per the authorities, indoor fogging has been done in and surrounding areas from where confirmed dengue cases have been reported. These include Sectors 4,6,10, 14, 12-A, 25, 28, and other rural areas such as Mankiyan, Billa, Kheri, Bagwali, Jalauly villages and Sector 26.Meanwhile, Dr Suman Singh, director health services, Chandigarh, said, “The cases have started dipping in UT and admissions in government and private hospitals are improving. Now, less people are complaining about fever in OPDs.”‘Authorities need to step up preventive measures’“Though the temperature is falling in the tricity, the afternoon hours still have suitable temperature for the mosquitoes to breed. Besides temperature, other elements also contribute to the dengue outbreak. Water accumulation near construction sites, which are usually ignored during checking, result in more breeding,” said Dr Sonu Goel, professor, department of community medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER.He further added, “The health authorities are not doing intensive fogging in affected areas, even though they have mapped the localities. Also, people should participate in controlling the outbreak by ensuring cleanliness at their homes and localities and by allowing health teams to inspect their houses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-snuffs-out-two-lives-in-mohali-119-new-cases-in-chandigarh-tricity-area-101636577182270.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab transport department saw rise of ₹1 crore in daily revenue in October: Minister Warring||Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Wednesday claimed that the department witnessed an increase of ₹1 crore in its daily revenues in October. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, Warring said the department generated ₹31 crore extra revenue from October 1 to October 31. “It signifies the massive potential of the department. This shows how Akalis were plundering Punjab by keeping it bereft of these financial resources for their illicit gains. If we can achieve this, why could not Akalis do it,” asked Warring, castigating Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal for running a “mafia” to ravage Punjab like Ahmad Abdali did. Warring said even Abdali would have felt belittled by the deeds committed by the Badals and their ilk. “Had this rate of revenue generation been maintained, Punjab would have been richer by ₹5200 crore in the last 14 years, which would have been utilised for the state’s progress and prosperity. Our transport fleet would have another 24,000 buses and more than 50,000 people would have got jobs had the Akalis not looted people of Punjab,” the minister claimed. Claiming that the department was committed to crack down on every illegal operator, Warring said the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) revenue had gone up to ₹54.74 crore in October against ₹39.01 crore in September, while the Punjab Roadways cloaked ₹49.57 crore in October against ₹34.15 crore a month before. Emphasising the success of measures initiated by the department, including implementation of the Justice Surya Kant judgement to weed out invalid and illegally run permit holders, Warring said that several vehicles were impounded in last one month. The minister said 50% of the daily illicit income generated by private transporters belonged to the Badals and 30% to their associate companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-transport-department-saw-rise-of-rs-1-crore-in-daily-revenue-in-october-minister-warring-101636576882616.html

Darpan Ahluwalia (27), an MBBS degree holder from the Government Medical College, Patiala, and who hails from Mohali, is only the sixth woman to lead the parade at the academy that has trained 73 batches of IPS officers so far. National security advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval would be present during the passing out parade of 132 IPS probationers, including 27 women, three of whom are of Punjab cadre. Darpan’s father Gurinder Singh Walia is a retired joint director from the Punjab animal husbandry department. The 27-year-old is also the overall topper of the basic course phase-1 training that include indoor and outdoor courses. She also bagged the Martyr KS Vyas Trophy for internal security, public order and field crafts and tactics, said her father. The first preference of Darpan, who scored 80th all india rank (AIR) in the UPSC examination, was IPS. Besides, she was running an NGO that organised breast cancer screening camps. Darpan says she was inspired by her grandfather who served in the Punjab Police. “I used to hear a lot from him about how the police can impact society. Moreover, in this role, I will be more approachable to woman and can better serve them,” she said over phone from Hyderabad. The most fascinating part of her training, she said, was her experience of interacting with trafficking survivors. “I feel proud that I will be commanding the parade. Our batch will join as ASP probationers after the passing out,” she said. Gurpeet Kaur Deo of the 1993 batch, who was the first woman Punjab-cadre IPS officer, is posted as additional director general of police (ADGP) at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-first-punjab-cadre-woman-ips-officer-to-lead-national-police-academy-passing-out-parade-101636576342417.html
11-11-2021||Kolkata||At Nandigram’s ground zero, Suvendu Adhikari and TMC face-off over 2007 land stir||KOLKATA: Six months after Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee faced defeat in the assembly election at East Midnapore district’s Nandigram, the agrarian belt on Wednesday witnessed the ruling party and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Suvendu Adhikari, who retained the seat, targeting each other while paying homage to villagers killed in 2007 during a violent movement against the then Left Front government’s bid to acquire land for a chemical hub.Though the government aborted the project, the violence continued for more than two years. The agitation was led by the Bhumi Uchched Protirodh Committee set up by local people, and who were supported by TMC.On November 10, 2007, ten farmers were allegedly killed by CPI(M) cadres who were trying to recapture a village. The TMC has been paying homage to these victims since 2011 when it came to power.Adhikari, who was then a local TMC leader, on Wednesday led a procession and addressed local people. The former minister claimed that he and members of his family, who hail from East Midnapore’s Contai, helped the movement.TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh, who was part of a team that visited Nandigram on Wednesday morning, called Adhikari a traitor and accused him of creating a Hindu-Muslim divide during the March-April poll campaign.Amid the claims and counterclaims, the rivals paid homage to the victims separately at the memorial.“Didn’t Muslims die in the land movement? Mamata Banerjee stood by the farmers during those days. Adhikari’s father Sisir Adhikari, the local Lok Sabha member, did not even keep track of what was happening on the ground. Were the Adhikari’s helping the CPI(M)? ” Ghosh said.Countering Ghosh, Suvendu Adhikari, who held a meeting at another location, said: “Mamata Banerjee was a partner of the National Democratic Alliance at that time and BJP leaders, headed by LK Advani and Sushma Swaraj, raised the Nandigram issue in Parliament. They did not rest till the Lok Sabha condemned the attacks. TMC leaders could enter Nandigram only after Advani and Swaraj came here.”“The TMC is now targeting local BJP workers. I will file a public interest litigation to seek justice for those who faced post-poll violation,” Adhikari added.Mamata Banerjee was the face of the Nandigram agitation which played a key role in ending the Left Front’s 34-year-long rule in 2011. The movement started after 14 villagers died in police firing on March 14, 2007. The day is observed as Nandigram Diwas by the chief minister.On the eve of the state polls, Banerjee was injured in Nandigram when the door of her SUV slammed against her left foot. She alleged that some people in the crowd deliberately pushed the door. BJP leaders accused Banerjee of using the incident to gain political mileage. After the incident, she led the party’s campaign from a wheelchair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/at-nandigram-s-ground-zero-suvendu-adhikari-and-tmc-face-off-over-2007-land-stir-101636576042425.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Imports from Afghanistan via ICP Attari see a spurt||Imports from Afghanistan via the integrated check-post (ICP) at Attari have witnessed an increase in the last few days, officials of the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI) said. Nearly 70-75 truckloads of dry fruits, fresh fruits, onion, pulses and other items are reaching daily at the ICP, which facilitates India’s trade with Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan, from the Taliban-controlled country for the last three to four days against the earlier 40-50 truckloads, it is learnt. When the Taliban wrested power in Afghanistan in August this year, the imports via the land border had come down to just 5-10 truckloads, amid fear among the traders that the movement of goods may cease anytime. “On Wednesday, 73 trucks carrying various goods reached the ICP from Afghanistan. The count of trucks was 71 on Tuesday. The trade seems to have been going up,” said LPAI’s ICP manager Sukhdev Singh.Another ICP official said, “When the Taliban had started taking over control in Afghanistan, we thought that the trade would also stop. But thankfully, it continued and increased gradually. As the prices of onion are rising in India, we expect more onion from Afghanistan in the coming days. The daily arrival of trucks from Afghanistan is likely to be more than a hundred soon.”But the onion traders said that they are facing problem due to increased security measures at the border. “On Tuesday, of the 33 truckloads of onion that reached the ICP, 16 were returned. There is no space at the ICP. The security officials at the border have been examining all goods. They overturn the truck for checking of goods and keep the items at the ICP for at least four days. Onion is a perishable item and we have been facing damages of ₹1 lakh against every truckload. The goods should be checked and released on the same day. Many trucks are being returned and the traders are worried,” said Jatinder Khurana, an onion importer.He said, “The LPAI’s truck scanner is not working. Had it been functional, we would not face any problem. Even the trade would increase from 70 to 150 trucks. Many traders are not giving orders of their goods due to the slow process of examining at the check-post. Pakistan has two truck scanners on their side. Even Afghanistan has installed scanners.”The LPAI had installed the truck scanner to detect arms, ammunition, drugs and counterfeit currency, but the customs department had expressed reservations over its working.Sukhdev Singh said, “We have adequate space at the ICP. Only one or two trucks return sometimes due to security reasons. Even our truck scanner is working, but the customs officials have increased security since the Taliban took over. There are a few glitches in the scanner and our technical team is expected to fix it in a few days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/imports-from-afghanistan-via-icp-attari-see-a-spurt-101636575803337.html

In fact, his application was rejected by the director sports as he was not found to be a permanent resident of Haryana, read a letter written by the director sports and youth affairs to the then Karnal deputy commissioner on November 5, 2019.Kapoor has claimed to have filed a complaint with the IGP Karnal range and Karnal SP demanding action against the officials involved in the issuance of fake documents and helping Patil.Reacting to the allegations, Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said he will get these allegations examined and action will be taken if the allegations were found to be true.Karnal SP Ganga Ram Punia said appropriate action will be taken if any complaint is filed and allegations are proved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paraswimmer-accused-of-procuring-fake-documents-to-get-rs-2-crore-award-from-haryana-govt-101636575802210.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Shortage of DAP fertiliser delays wheat sowing in Punjab||Wheat sowing in Punjab is way behind the schedule due to an acute shortage of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser as only 27% (9.5 lakh hectares) of the total area to go under the crop has been cultivated so far. Worries of farmers as well as the state agriculture department are mounting since 60% of the total area was sown till the corresponding date during the previous rabi season last year. The delay in sowing is highly likely to impact the crop yield adversely, say agriculture experts. The state needs 5.5 lakh tonne DAP fertiliser this rabi season out of which 4.8 lakh tonne goes for wheat sowing as a key basal dose. But the farmers have received only 40% (1.96 lakh tonne) of the total requirement so far. Late harvest of paddy due to rain at the maturing stage also pushed ahead the sowing of wheat. The shortage of fertiliser is adding to the farmers’ woes. Of an allocation of 2.56 lakh tonne the state got for November, 45,000 tonne has been supplied to farmers. Experts at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) said a week’s delay translated into 2 quintal loss in yield as delayed sowing results in slow germination. Punjab has an average per hectare yield of 5,000 kg. Loss of every quintal of yield means a loss of at least ₹2,000 as the minimum support price (MSP) on the produce for the current season has been fixed at ₹2,015 per quintal. The experts said the best period for wheat sowing is up to November 25. “There will still a shortage of 75,000 tonne of the fertiliser with no arrangement to fill the gap. We are not sure the entire allocation for this month will reach the state,” said a senior agriculture department official. Nearly 50 rakes (goods trains) of DAP fertiliser lined up at the Mundra port in Gujarat are to be transported to Punjab (a rake carries average 3,000 tonne DAP), he added. The DAP fertiliser from the US, Russia and China fulfills 70% of the country’s need while the rest of 30% is manufactured domestically. This year, the DAP production in China and two other countries was hit due to Covid-19, pushing the rates in the international market. Alternate fertilisers PAU soil scientist RK Gupta said for each hectare, 135 kg DAP is required to be mixed in the soil before sowing. “There are alternatives such as single super phosphate (SSP) and nitrogen phosphorous and potassium (NPK),” said Gupta who suggested use of alternative fertilisers if the soil is deficient. “There are soils in Punjab where phosphorous content is sufficient. If more phosphorous is added it will lead of zinc shortage. So farmers are advised to act wisely and get the soil test done,” he said. Punjab has a stock of 74,000 tonne NPK and 85,000 tonne SSP, agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shortage-of-dap-fertiliser-delays-wheat-sowing-in-punjab-101636575562157.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||INSO, Congress slams Haryana’s move to recruit employees in varsities||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ruling alliance partner Jannayak Janata Party’s (JJP) Rohtak Lok Sabha nominee in the 2019 polls and its student wing Indian National Students’ Organisation (INSO) national chief Pradeep Deswal on Wednesday opposed the state government’s decision to make recruitment of teaching and non-teaching staff in the state universities through the HPSC/HSSC thereby withdrawing the power of recruitment to the universities.Addressing a press conference in Rohtak on Wednesday, Deswal said the decision is an attempt to undermine the autonomy of universities. “INSO will not let the government do this. We strongly oppose this order and will launch an agitation against the government if the order is not withdrawn,” he added.Deswal launches attack on MDU V-CDeswal slammed Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU) vice-chancellor Prof Rajbir Singh while raising questions on his educational qualification and PhD degree.“The education records of the V-C reveal that he had obtained the degrees through dubious means and by showing false experience certificates. The V-C had pursued a master’s degree (MA) in 2000, while surprisingly he had done PhD in 1999. Apart from this, the educational experience certificates used by him for his appointment as professor are wrong and fake,” he said.Giving an example of his teaching experience, the INSO president said the V-C had mentioned in the records that he had worked as a teacher in Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology (GJUST) in Hisar holding classes of students of MA journalism and mass communication.While at that time he was a government employee holding the post of DPRO. “His teaching record has itself exposed his false claim as it is not possible for a government officer to simultaneously work as a teacher at a university. Significantly, Rajbir Singh himself is holding an MA degree in journalism and mass communication when he was teaching the students in GJUST,” Deswal said.The INSO national president said if such ineligible persons continue to hold the posts like V-C, then education and educational institutions are bound to suffer.Ex-education minister, Jhajjar MLA seek enquiry against V-CSlamming the Haryana government’s decision to recruit employees through HSSC and HPSC in varsities, former education minister and Jhajjar MLA Geeta Bhukkal of the Congress said she had raised the issue in the Vidhan Sabha that the government is trying to end the autonomy of universities.“The education minister has assured the House that they will not snatch the autonomy of universities. We will bring a privilege motion against the government’s move in the upcoming session. The government should mark an enquiry against the MDU V-C as he is facing serious charges of irregularities in his academic qualification. A competent and eligible persons should be appointed as the V-C. Government has been shielding higher education council president Prof BK Kuthiala too, who is facing many complaints and FIRs,” she added.MDU V-C Rajbir Singh could not meet with the journalists after INSO chief Deswal levelled allegations against him and later he could not be reached for a comment as his phone was switched off.The public relations officials of the MDU have also refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/inso-congress-slams-haryana-s-move-to-recruit-employees-in-varsities-101636575441876.html

11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Untreated effluent from Haryana contaminating Yamuna waters: Report||Millions of litres of untreated effluent are being discharged into river Yamuna from Karnal’s Indri block contaminating the river which is considered a major source of drinking water in the national capital, shows the fifth report of the River Yamuna Monitoring Committee.As per reports collected from the stakeholders, around 66 MLD is coming from the industrial city of Yamunanagar and mixed in Yamuna water near Nabipur village after travelling to around 80km via Ganda Nallah, a ditch drain and Dhanaura escape canal from Yamunanagar to Indri block in Karnal district.Even as the issue was highlighted in almost all monthly meetings of the River Rejuvenation Committee held under the chairmanship of chief secretary Vijai Vardhan, there was nothing visible on ground to check the flow of toxic water into the river.The status report of the Implementation of River Action Plans submitted in the last monthly meeting on November 2, emphasised that sewage from unauthorised colonies is to be tapped or diverted at different locations by officials of the urban local bodies department to check pollution in Yamuna and Ghaggar rivers.The urban local bodies department failed to submit the action plan to check the flow of effluent in both Yamuna and Ghaggar from various discharge points highlighted by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), revealed the report.The report highlighted a huge gap between the estimates of sewage generation and actual sewage reaching the sewage treatment plants (STPs). Sewage generation in the industrial cities of Yamunanagar and Jaghadhri is much higher than the quantum of sewage reaching up to the STPs as in Yamunanagar 29.3 MLD sewage was generated but the actual discharge reaching the STPs was 43.7 MLD and in Jagadhri the actual discharge reaching to the STPs was 18.5 MLD against sewage generation of 16.86 MLD.Yamunanagar deputy commissioner Parth Gupta said the government has proposed to develop a 75 MLD STP to tap the untreated water flowing through the ditch drain, but which department (urban local bodies or public health engineering) will undertake the task, is yet to be decided.In Ompal Chaudhary and others v/s State of Haryana at the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the petitioner had highlighted how the said discharge is contaminating the groundwater and the foul smell is affecting public health at large. Multiple media reports have also explained the effects of the chemical discharge (including heavy metals) on the cattle, agriculture fields and the inhabitants.However, Nirmal Kashyap, regional officer of the HSPCB, said that the biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the subsequent months has decreased, suggesting that along with the untreated industrial waste, treated water from some STPs that started operations in the last two years, is also flowing into the ditch drain.On the other hand, in Panipat the actual discharge reaching to the STPs was 42 MLD against 81.80 MLD sewage generated, reads the report mentioning that the waste water reaching the STPs for treatment is higher than the estimated generation of sewerage in many towns.Moreover, of total 59 STPs in the Yamuna catchment area, only six have been upgraded and the rest do not meet the prescribed standards. Only 21 STPs are complying even though the deadlines for most STPs have already expired.Also, sludge management has not been scientific so far and the regional officers of the HSPCB did not give proper reports to establish that sludge is disposed properly.On the untreated effluent being discharged in river Yamuna, HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said, “We are taking samples on daily basis and have found the ammonia levels well within the prescribed limits. It is not exceeding the limits.”On tapping of pollution sources in Yamuna, he said, “Tapping of effluent in the river was going on large scale and any illegal discharge has been put on hold and special teams have been formed with the help of the district administrations concerned.”“If the CPCB issues any further directions, we are ready to follow them,” he added.The member secretary admitted that the untreated effluent from Dhanaura escape canal is being released into Yamuna. “But the departments concerned, including ULBDs and public health engineering department are working on it. There is need to set up a new STP in Yamunanagar, which is still pending for approval. The chief secretary has asked them to expedite the process.”Officials in HSPCB slammed the statements made by the officials and leaders of political parties of Delhi that Haryana was polluting Yamuna water saying that water reaching Faridabad from Delhi is more polluted than it reaching Delhi from Haryana, but they do not want to indulge in blame game.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/untreated-effluent-from-haryana-contaminating-yamuna-waters-report-101636574905925.html

Every day, the government is trying to ruin the farmers by hatching new conspiracies,” Selja said in a statement, asking the state government to procure crop from farmers at minimum support price (MSP) by removing the ban on government procurement.Selja said the BJP-JJP government has issued an order prohibiting government procurement of PR paddy at MSP in mandis of Jind, Ambala, Faridabad, Palwal, Hisar, Fatehabad, Jhajjar, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sonepat and Yamunanagar districts.“Neither is the crop being procured by the government at MSP, nor are farmers getting DAP fertiliser for sowing the next crop.

But they continue to do so,” he said.Hooda said universities are capable of appointing the staff and there is no need for the government to interfere in their functioning.“Haryana is lagging behind in education. A huge drop has been witnessed in ranking of the state universities in the last seven years. Our appeal is that instead of destroying autonomous institutions, the government should take back this decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/interference-in-recruitments-will-undermine-autonomy-of-universities-hooda-101636574181878.html
11-11-2021||Kolkata||‘Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’: Amit Mitra’s piercing response to Bengal guv Dhankhar||KOLKATA: A day after demanding a white paper from Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on investments made in the state after five successive global business summits held by the administration, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday found the state’s former finance minister Amit Mitra calling out the governor in his unusually bitter response on social media.Responding to Dhakhar’s tweet, in which the state’s top constitutional authority contended that he hadn’t received any answer from the Bengal government even a year after seeking details on the outcome of the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS), Mitra posted on Twitter a copy of the response that he sent last year to Raj Bhavan and wondered why he was speaking in two voices.Mitra, whose tenure as finance minister ended on Tuesday as he did not contest the assembly polls owing to health reasons, drew a parallel between the Governor’s tweets and the dual personalities of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous 1886 novel.“Hon Governor’s tweet on Business Summits is a classic case of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde. On 9th Nov he strongly supported CM’s plan of next Summit. “I will leave nothing undone..” & ”togetherness” and within 24 hours he tweets venom on summits, by putting out a year-old letter to CM & FM,(me)!” tweeted Mitra. Mitra was appointed as principal chief adviser to the chief minister and finance department in the rank of cabinet minister on Tuesday. Mitra continued.“Governor said on 9th of Nov at Meet & Greet event as reported, “We have to ensure there is no room for conflict..no room for adversarial situation.. only one way, togetherness.” Very next day, he tweeted the OPPOSITE of these utterances, in a mode of all out conflict ? Shocking !!!” Mitra wrote in his second tweet. The November 9 event Mitra referred to was held at New Town on the eastern outskirts of Kolkata. It was attended by the governor, several foreign diplomats and captains of the industry. The chief minister announced at the event that the next BGBS will be held in March next year. The 2020 summit was not held because of the Covid pandemic. “It is shocking that he seeks response when I had officially responded with a 4 page letter on summits, giving data on investment offers under implementation, employment generation etc,(read letter below). Is he suffering from AMNESIA & needs HELP or is it a Machiavellian omission ?” Mitra said in his third tweet.He also put out the four-page letter on the outcome of the business summits that he wrote to the governor on September 24 last year.In his response to Dhankhar’s letter sent a month earlier on August 25, 2020, Mitra’s letter mentioned that the cumulative investment proposals received at BGBS between 2015 and 2019 amounted to ₹12,32, 603 crore and around half of this amount was in “investment mode.”“You would be happy to know that between BGBS 2015 and BGBS 2018, 50.27% of the investment proposals went into implementation mode. For BGBBS 2019, already ₹71,646 crore is under implementation. The employment generated through these investments is to the tune of 28,00,000 already,” the letter said.Mitra also said because of the success of the summit, the “state’s GDP climbed from ₹4.6 lakh crore in 2019-11 (the year before we came to office) to ₹12.5 lakh crore in 2019-20.” Dhankhar, who was in Delhi to attend a three-day national conference of governors, reacted to Mitra’s comments on Twitter. “Never expected such “low” from Dr Mitra.

11-11-2021||Chandigarh||DCI lowers cut-off to fill vacant MDS seats||Faridkot Facing shortage of eligible candidates to fill all 158 master of dental surgery (MDS) seats in 12 dental colleges across the state, the Dental Council of India (DCI) has lowered the minimum qualifying marks and percentile for admission. The union ministry of health and family welfare has lowered the qualifying cut-off percentile for NEET-MDS by 23.029 percentile for each category (general, SC, ST, OBC and handicapped). As 35 of the total 147 MDS state quota seats remained vacant after four rounds of counselling conducted by the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, including a stray round of counselling which ended on Wednesday. No candidate reached Guru Gobind Singh Medical College at Faridkot on Wednesday for the stray round of counselling for admissions to the MDS courses. Of the total 11 all-India quota MDS seats, four were reverted to the state last month. Following the cut in the percentile, the BFUHS will hold an extended stray round of counselling to fill the vacant seats. “No student participated in the stray round of counselling, so the MDS seats are left vacant in some colleges. Now, the medical university will hold fifth round of counselling with lower cut-off criteria to fill vacant MDS seats,” said BFUHS registrar Nirmal Ouseppachan. The qualifying percentile for the MDS has been lowered from 50 to 26.971 for the general category. For the SC/BC and handicapped candidates, the qualifying percentile has been reduced from 40 to 16.971 and 45 to 21.971, respectively. The cut-off score for the general category candidates has been reduced from 259 to 185 marks. For the SC/ST and handicapped candidates, the revised cut-off score lowered from 227 to 152 and 243 to 170 marks, respectively. Though the result of NEET-MDS was declared on December 31, 2020, the admission process is yet to be completed due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dci-lowers-cut-off-to-fill-vacant-mds-seats-101636573281994.html

Deol, a designated senior advocate, was appointed AG after Atul Nanda who resigned in view of Captain Amarinder Singh’s ouster as the chief minister in September. Berry was appointed additional advocate general on November 8, even as talks of Deol’s ouster were doing the rounds. He has also remained associated with Punjab’s AG office in the past. “Without commenting on the decision of the Punjab government in accepting the resignation ……I hereby submit my resignation,” Berry’s resignation letter reads. Berry and Tarun Vir Singh Lehal, son-in-law of Punjab’s deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, were appointed additional advocates general by invoking special provisions by the state government on November 8. Many in the lawyers’ fraternity hailed his decision and came out on social media in his support. Congress MP and lawyer Manish Tewari in his tweet said that Berry has “eloquently summed up the disgust that a lot of us lawyers across the country feel at repeated subversion of constitutional offices by some members of the political class.” “Wish such politicians who perceive apolitical constitutional functionaries as soft targets to wage their proxy warfare find a better way to do their politics,” he further tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ag-s-ouster-berry-resigns-as-aag-in-solidarity-with-deol-101636572861913.html

Eight buses were impounded for not paying the tax, while three for running as stage carriers instead of contract carriers.

Three buses of Orbit Aviation were impounded which were on their way from Mohali to Rajpura. The minister apologized to the passengers for inconvenience and they were dropped at the bus stand before the buses were taken to the police station. Other buses which were impounded belonged to City Land, Ram Dalal Holidays, Northern Tourist Buses, Himalayas Tourist Buses, and KTC. Pritpal Singh, manager (operations), Orbit Aviation Limited, said during the pandemic, most of the bus operators have not paid tax and were in the process to do so.

11-11-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand govt mulls promoting electric vehicles on Char Dham routes||The Uttarakhand government is planning to promote the use of electric vehicles on Char Dham routes to protect the fragile ecology and environment of the Himalayan state. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj speaking on the sidelines of a flagging off ceremony of the Hoossein memorial rally, said, “We have received several suggestions on running electric vehicles on Char Dham routes. We are in talks with various electric vehicle manufacturing companies and have urged them to open electric vehicle charging stations on Char Dham routes along with cafeterias so that pilgrims or tourists can enjoy the local cuisine while they are charging their vehicles,” he said. “If electric vehicles are used during the Char Dham yatra, it would not only help the state but the country as a whole in saving valuable foreign exchange that is spent on fuel,” he said. The tourism minister also spoke on the plans of the Uttarakhand government to promote winter tourism in the state. On Wednesday, over 100 cars of different makes participated in the Nazir Hoossein memorial rally that was organised to retrace the iconic 1981 Himalayan Rally route. The event was flagged off by tourism minister Satpal Maharaj along with cabinet minister Ganesh Joshi from the Savoy Hotel in Mussoorie. “It is indeed an occasion of joy that a rally in memory of Nazir Hoossein, the architect behind the earlier editions of the Himalayan car rally that helped in putting the area on the international tourism map, is being flagged off from the Savoy which has been host to all such rallies in the past,” Satpal Maharaj said. The state government has received several proposals for such rallies and it is planning to link these rallies with other tourism schemes and circuits so that tourists are able to get a glimpse of the pristine culture of the state and the same would also benefit the locals involved in tourism activities, he added. Rajan Sayal the co-organiser of the event said, “The Himalayan car rally has succeeded in creating interest internationally among tourists and has opened a window to the pristine beauty of the state of Uttarakhand.” Nazir Hoossein in whose memory the rally was organised was the chief architect in conceptualising all Himalayan Rallies from 1980-1990.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-govt-mulls-promoting-electric-vehicles-on-char-dham-routes-101636572682273.html
11-11-2021||Chandigarh||Day after quitting AAP, Bathinda Rural MLA Ruby joins Congress||A day after quitting the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bathinda Rural MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby on Wednesday joined the ruling Congress in Punjab. Ruby was welcomed into the Congress fold by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu at a press conference here. All India Congress Committee secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Chaudhary and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, the Congress MLA from Bathinda Urban, were also present. The 33-year-old first-time legislator’s exit is being seen as a setback for the AAP in the Malwa region of the state in the run-up to the assembly elections early next year. The AAP had won most of its 20 seats in Malwa in the 2017 state polls. Ruby said that she had joined the AAP to serve the people, but decided to leave the party as there was a difference in what its leaders say and what they do. “After seeing Arvind Kejriwal and his party’s policies, I felt that they would work for the aam aadmi (common man) but you get to know the reality after you join the party,” she told reporters in her first remarks after switching sides. On joining the Congress, Ruby said she was impressed with the party’s ideology. “The Congress is the asli aam aadmi party and is headed by a woman leader,” said the MLA, praising the Channi government for decisions taken for welfare of the people in such a short span. Asked if she has resigned from the membership of the state assembly, Ruby said: “She will meet the (Punjab assembly) speaker and whatever is required under the rules.” Sidhu, while welcoming Ruby into the Congress, said that she will be given due respect in the party. Channi said she aspired to work for the development of Punjab and had chosen the right party. Earlier, AAP legislature party leader Harpal Singh Cheema, while reacting to her resignation, said Ruby was not going to get the AAP ticket and, therefore, joining the Congress. “Ruby is our younger sister, be happy wherever you go. This time, she had no chance of getting a ticket from the AAP so she is joining the Congress. The Congress is requested not to cheat Ruby and should give her the ticket from Bathinda Rural,” Cheema tweeted. Hitting back at Cheema, Ruby accused him of not raising his voice for the party leaders or the people of Punjab. “When it was time for you to speak, you did not say anything. You neither raised your voice for the people of Punjab nor for Bhagwant Mann. As for the ticket, you can contest against me,” she tweeted, throwing a challenge to the legislature party chief. Ruby had announced her resignation from the AAP in a tweet on Tuesday night after having a meeting with Channi and Chaudhary earlier in the day. Last month, she had backed Mann for the party’s chief minister face and was said to be cut up with the leadership over the delay in making the announcement. So far, four rebel AAP MLAs – Sukhpal Singh Khaira, Jagdev Singh Kamalu, Pirmal Singh Khalsa and Nazar Singh Manshahia – have joined the Congress. While Khaira, Kamalu and Khalsa joined the Congress in June this year, Manshahia jumped ship in April 2019, just days before the parliamentary polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-after-quitting-aap-bathinda-rural-mla-ruby-joins-congress-101636572622060.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Master Plan public hearings to take place till November 24||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) extended the ongoing public hearing regarding the Master Plan of Delhi-2041 till November 24. The Master Plan was put up for public scrutiny in June this year. It will take the land-owning agency two or three months after the public hearing concludes to finalise and notify the plan, said a senior DDA official, requesting anonymity.The senior DDA official said, “We will hold four more public hearings in which elected representatives, municipal corporations, other government agencies and associations such as trader bodies will participate. People who have had the opportunity to present their views already can also participate.”The public hearings are scheduled for November 15, 17, 22 and 24. “There will be one session just for the municipal bodies, which are the main agencies for the implementation of the provisions of the Master Plan,” said the senior DDA official.During the first public hearing held on October 18, people raised demands for an increase in floor-to-area ratio (FAR), clarity on the status of unauthorised colonies, clarity in redevelopment norms, etc. “Some of the major demands are for an increase in FAR in both commercial and residential areas. We will examine them. But FAR is linked to factors such as the availability of water and other resources. Another demand is for clarity on the status of unauthorised colonies located on Master Plan roads. In such colonies, ownership rights can’t be given,” said the senior official.There were demands both in favour of and against the mixed land-use (MLU), the official said. “Though we have increased the right-of-way (ROW) to 24m where mixed land-use can be allowed, there are many who want it to be done away with. But a large section of people wants MLU and has suggested that grocery stores be allowed in colonies, even on roads with less ROW. During the pandemic, such shops were of great help to people in residential colonies,” he said.Initially, the land-owning agency planned to notify the Master Plan by the end of the year. But the process was delayed as the DDA had to extend the deadline for submission of public suggestions/objections by a month in July because various civic society members demanded more time due to the Covid-19 pandemic.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA joint front, said, “The DDA has reduced the entire public hearing to a joke. I have submitted objections on several issues. But my name was not there in any of their lists. They are just rushing into notifying the plan that is for the city’s future for the next 20 years.”On Wednesday, the land-owning agency held a public hearing in which over 4,300 people were invited. “We received close to 33,000 suggestions/objections. We have given people time to present their views,” said another DDA official, requesting anonymity.The official said that finalisation of the MPD-2041 will take at least two or three months, as the comments will be analysed and discussed with authority members, other committees, etc. “Necessary changes will be incorporated and the plan will again be tabled in the authority meeting before being sent to the ministry of housing and urban affairs for notification,” said the official.Till the time MPD-2041 is not notified, the current master plan (MPD-2021), which was notified on February 7, 2007, will continue to be in force.AK Jain, former planning commissioner at DDA, said, “Future developments will be impacted by the new master plan. But there will be no major change, as this plan doesn’t propose any radical changes. Important policies such as transit-oriented development, land pooling, etc, have already been notified.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-master-plan-public-hearings-to-take-place-till-november-24-101636571188460.html

11-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Pragati Maidan to host trade fair after a year’s gap||The revamped exhibition halls at the Pragati Maidan are being prepared to host this year’s India International Trade Fair. After missing the annual event last year due to Covid, the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) will be organising 40th India International Trade Fair over an area of 70,000 sq m which is almost three times the size of the event held in 2019 (23,000 sqm), officials of the ITPO -- the organisers of the fair -- said.Workers on Wednesday were seen busy testing escalators, finishing up plumbing and setting up frame booths for exhibitors to show-case their products at the giant hangar-like new exhibition halls at Pragati Maidan. The new halls which are part of international exhibition-cum-convention centre project at Pragati Maidan were inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi last month, and they will provide more than 70% space of this year’s annual trade fair event, ITPO official said. LC Goyal, the managing director of ITPO said more than 3,000 exhibitors, state governments and central ministries will be participating in the fair. The foreign participation, however, will be low this year with just nine countries taking part in the fair. The overseas participants are from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, UAE, Tunisia and Turkey, compared to 20 in the previous years.Goyal said they were aware of the Covid situation and taking required steps. He said the ticket sales will be regulated keep the maximum number of visitors at any given time inside the venue between 35,000 to 40,000. Tickets will be available for sale online as well as at 65 metro stations. No counters will be there at Pragati Maidan. “The ticket rates have also been hiked by 20% as a crowd management measure, and not with an aim to generate more revenue,” Goyal said. The ticket prices remain same for children while the entry will be free for senior citizens. In 2019, tickets for general visitors were available at ₹60 for adults and ₹40 for children on weekdays. On weekends or holiday, the rates increased to ₹120 for adults and ₹60 for children.The spacious new complex halls will also play a key role in ensuring social distancing. Goyal said that the minimum stall sizes have been increased from 9 sq m to 12 sq m while the passage pathway width has been raised from 4 m to 5 m. “Moreover, there will be 320 civil defence volunteers to ensure the compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour at the venue,” he added. The 14-day event will be held between 14-27 November with first 5 days reserved for businessmen-to-businessmen sale and the last entry will be permitted at 5:30 pm. For the normal visitors, the entry time will be between 9am and 5.30pm.The main underground tunnel connecting Mathura road and Ring Road- which is a key component of Pragati Maidan revamp project-is still not complete and it will not be used in this year’s annual trade fair. Goyal said that the underground parking and tunnel will be ready much before the next year’s IITF. “The exhibitors will be using parking near Bhairon Marg and enough parking provision has been made for visitors but from the next year we will be able to use underground parking under the Pragati Maidan,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-pragati-maidan-to-host-trade-fair-after-a-year-s-gap-101636571001844.html

11-11-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP expels Howrah unit chief after he challenges Suvendu Adhikari||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) expelled Surajit Saha, the Howrah central organisational unit president, on Wednesday afternoon, hours after he publicly questioned the honesty of Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the state assembly, and refused to take orders from former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders. Although the Bengal BJP has expelled quite a few district leaders since last year following allegations of infighting and indiscipline, Saha is the first who faced action for challenging Adhikari’s authority. “Adhikari alleged at an internal meeting on Tuesday that we lost the assembly polls in Howrah district because a section of our leaders are secretly in touch with TMC leader Arup Roy. How can a person who joined the BJP six months ago make such allegations? He has to prove this or else apologise to all BJP workers in Howrah. Adhikari should first prove his own honesty because in the Narada sting videos he could be seen accepting money,” Saha told reporters on Wednesday. Arup Roy, a cabinet minister, is the TMC’s most influential leader in Howrah. Though an accused in the high-profile Narada case that the Central Bureau of Investigation is probing, Adhikari, who joined the saffron camp in December last year, has not been named in the charge sheet unlike some of his former cabinet colleagues. The meeting Saha referred to was held hours after the state election commission agreed to the TMC government’s proposal to hold civic body elections in Howrah and Kolkata on December 19. Saha and Adhikari reportedly had an argument at the meeting which was convened at the state BJP headquarters to prepare for the polls. Although 25 leaders from Howrah were called, some were absent, party leaders said. Saha claimed that Adhikari wanted former mayor of Howrah Corporation, Rathin Chakravarty, who joined the BJP in January, to be the chairman of the election committee. Saha protested against the idea. “I said there are many efficient leaders and old-time workers in the BJP. We will not take orders from a former TMC leader against whom we brought charges of corruption in the Howrah municipal corporation. We do not want the BJP to turn into a B-team of the TMC,” said Saha. “I worked for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and dedicated my life to the BJP. Nobody needs to lecture me on allegiance. I have not received the expulsion letter yet. An elected district president cannot be expelled like this. They have to first issue a show-cause letter. Even if I am expelled I will remain dedicated to the party,” Saha said on Wednesday afternoon. The expulsion letter said Saha had breached discipline. “At the behest of Dr Sukanta Majumdar, president of BJP, West Bengal, and member of Parliament you are hereby expelled from the party with immediate effect for breaching organizational discipline,” BJP state vice-president Pratap Banerjee wrote in the letter to Saha. It was released to the media at around 5 pm. “Even if the discussions Saha is referring to take place, he cannot talk about this in public. He breached discipline,” said Majumdar. Adhikari, who was in East Midnapore district’s Nandigram on Wednesday, did not want to comment on the controversy. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said the party will contest the Howrah civic polls with full strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-expels-howrah-unit-chief-after-he-challenges-suvendu-adhikari-101636570641947.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||Three men held with fine quality marijuana imported from Canada||Three men, who used the darknet to import marijuana from Canada and sell it for huge profits in Delhi, have been arrested by the Delhi Police’s crime branch. Police said they recovered 1,873 grams of fine quality Canadian marijuana from the three men, adding that unlike the marijuana grown in India, imported marijuana is costlier.The darknet or dark web is a network within the internet which is not accessible through search engines. Over the past few years, criminals are increasingly using the darknet to smuggle drugs and weapons, police said.Joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar pegged the value of the seized contraband at ₹35 lakh. “The consignment was ordered on the darknet and payment was made in bitcoins. The selling price of the seized consignment is approximately ₹40,000-50,000 per ounce (28 grams), depending upon the paying capacity of the buyer. In the USA, it goes for about $600 per ounce,” Kumar said.According to confessional statements of people arrested for dealing in marijuana in the past few years, about one gram of marijuana grown in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh costs ₹10, or ₹280 for 28 grams. The price per gram of marijuana bought from Himachal Pradesh is more. The rate also depends on where it is sold in Delhi. For example, marijuana in south and New Delhi areas would be costlier than in outer or north Delhi, police said. Police said on November 8, they received a tipoff about a Delhi resident who had imported marijuana and was selling it in the city. Around 11.15am that day, police searched a house in Shalimar Bagh and arrested the three men from there. Police identified the three as Karan Sajnani,24, Priyansh, 22, and Sanjeev Midha,39, all residents of Paschim Vihar, Delhi.“During their interrogation, we learnt that Karan Sajnani has a family business of selling and purchasing used cars. Priyansh is his friend. Their common friend Pankaj Davar, a resident of Madipur, was engaged in procuring marijuana from the USA via courier and selling it in Delhi for a profit. About four months ago, Karan and Pankaj Davar procured a consignment of approximately 1.5 kilos of American marijuana, which was sold by Pankaj. About three months ago, another consignment was procured in the same manner. This time Pankaj cheated Karan and did not share the profit equitably, so Karan decided to work without him,” joint CP Kumar said.Around two months ago, Karan and Priyansh procured a kilo of marijuana from abroad and sold it to two men, Golu and Vicky (identified only by their first names), in Paschim Vihar.“A week ago, they ordered the recent consignment, which was intercepted by the crime branch. Priyansh has family business of tour and travels. Earlier, he used to buy marijuana from an Afghani national, who has now shifted his base to Russia. Priyansh is pursuing BTech from a reputed Institute of Technology in Rohini,” Kumar added.The two men confessed that they had roped in Sanjeev Midha to provide a place where the consignment could be delivered. Midha, police said, is listed as a “bad character” with the Pashim Vihar police station. In police records, a bad character is someone whose criminal record in kept as a separate file in the police station concerned. The activities of a “bad character” are monitored by the police to ensure that (s)he does not commit any crime. Police said Midha provided the two men with his brother-in-law Amandeep’s address. Police arrested the three after the consignment had reached Amandeep’s house in Shalimar Bagh.Police said Karan and Priyansh used the darknet to procure the contraband a self-deleting chat messenger service to seal the deals. Joint CP Kumar said the tentative seller is identified on the dark web, which opens with a special internet onion browser. “This onion browser directs internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network, consisting of more than 6,000 relays. After striking a deal, payment is made in bitcoins or other acceptable cryptocurrency. Priyansh paid for the consignment using his own bitcoin wallet. The drug parcels are routed through an international courier or express mail service,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-men-held-with-fine-quality-marijuana-imported-from-canada-101636570582011.html
11-11-2021||Noida||Work on interchange loop in Noida to begin soon, say Yeida officials||The work on a cloverleaf interchange loop which, once completed, will seamlessly connect Yamuna Expressway with the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), will begin as soon as the land issue is resolved, according to officials.Officials of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) said the work on this project has been delayed because farmers in the area refused to give up their land for this project because they wanted additional compensation.“We have discussed the issues with the landowners, who are now ready to give their land. Work on this project is about to start,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.The loop is to be built on 57 hectares of land.“The Yeida, in 2000, acquired the land at a rate of ₹1,300 per sqm. But in 2008, the government bought land for Eastern Peripheral Expressway and other projects from farmers at a rate of ₹3,500 per sqm. We, therefore, need more compensation. If it happens, we will let the work begin on loop,” said Mukesh Kumar, a farmer from Afzalpur. Land from the village is earmarked for the loop project.The loop is a crucial project as it will also provide direct connectivity from the upcoming Jewar airport to Delhi-NCR via the EPE.In the absence of the loop, motorists from Noida, Greater Noida and Delhi face inconvenience reaching EPE as they have to travel through many congested villages such as Kasna and Ghangola. This loop will immensely benefit motorists and offer a smooth ride to thousands of commuters, who use the 165km Yamuna Expressway and EPE.Yeida was scheduled to start work on the loop, to be built at a cost of ₹83.94 crore, by July 2019. The authority, in June 2019, issued a tender and hired a contractor for the project. It had fixed a deadline of 18 months for the project from the day the work starts on the ground.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which built the 135km EPE, will fund the project and Yeida will construct the entry and exit to connect the two important expressways. The EPE passes above the 165km Yamuna Expressway, near the Noida International University and Galgotia University campuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/work-on-interchange-loop-in-noida-to-begin-soon-say-yeida-officials-101636570523293.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: AQI improves to enter very poor zone||Delhi’s air quality improved marginally to reach the ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday as the capital recorded an overall air quality index (AQI) of 372 – a drop from Tuesday’s 404, data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed. According to experts, though local meteorological conditions largely remained the same, a slight drop in the speed of wind that is bringing stubble emissions to Delhi has led to this slight improvement in the last 24 hours. Forecasts on Wednesday showed transport-level winds will once again pick up from Thursday onwards, with two days of ‘severe’ air a possibility once again. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), winds that transport stubble emissions from Punjab and Haryana to Delhi, are expected to pick up again over the next two days. This likely to deteriorate over the next two days. Though the number of farm fire incidents went up to 5,317 on Wednesday from 3,476 on Tuesday, their share in the overall pollution mix of Delhi stayed at 27%. Gufran Beig, founder and project director at Safar, says a combination of strong transport-level winds, along with calm wind speed over Delhi is likely to see ‘severe’ air again. “If the farm fires remain the same, the share of stubble burning will start increasing again from Thursday as winds from Punjab and Haryana will pick up speed. Meanwhile, Delhi will see calm wind conditions, which will help trap pollutants over the city,” he said. In an analysis done by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Wednesday, the body said this smog episode is expected to last another two days, with it already matching the first smog episodes of 2018 and 2020 – each of which lasted six days. “While very high concentrations of PM2.5 have hogged attention, the levels of gases – ozone, CO or NO2 -- have also remained elevated during this smog episode,” says Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager, Urban Lab, CSE, adding that if conditions do not improve, this smog episode is likely to overtake the 2019 smog episode, which lasted eight days. Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 13.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, the lowest so far this season. It was 13.5 degrees on Tuesday. “A gradual drop in minimum temperature is expected over the next seven days, touching 11 degrees Celsius by November 16,” a met official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-aqi-improves-to-enter-very-poor-zone-101636570461810.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi University to start online classes on November 22||Another batch of incoming students at Delhi University (DU) will start classes away from the campus as online classes begin on November 22. In-person classes at DU colleges remain suspended since March last year when the university was closed after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the varsity allowed final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students to return to campus for practical and laboratory work in September, regular classes for students are unlikely to begin any time soon as another semester kicks off in the online mode. DU officials said that the semester will start in the online mode, to begin with. Both teachers and students have expressed concerns over the delay in the resumption of regular classes. Manoj Sinha, the secretary of the DU principals’ association and head of Aryabhatta College, said that the university was in a dilemma regarding the resumption of physical classes since a vast number of outstation students comprised the student population at DU. Sinha said that the university and colleges would need to figure out the modalities of the resumption of hostel facilities and other preparations. “Around 50% of DU’s strength includes students who are not from Delhi. The university and colleges need to make up their mind and accordingly set up facilities. Other preparations also need to be done before students can be called to the campus. We are currently undertaking a survey to seek details about the vaccination status of students in the second and third year,” said Sinha. He said that admissions for incoming students were currently taking place and it would be too early for colleges to ascertain their vaccination details, due to which in-person classes for students starting college on November 22 was not on the cards. “It’s possible that some students among the incoming batch will be below the age of 18. That is an area of concern. We can’t call them for classes in such a situation. The university is looking for solutions and hopefully by January things will be clearer,” said Sinha. He also said that the academic schedule had been prepared while keeping in mind that the semester was already delayed and it was necessary to initiate classes as soon as possible. Management of logistics and other facilities would take time, due to which classes would kick off in the online mode. Incoming students, however, said that an online semester would restrict them from experiencing the university experience. Sanjay (who goes by his first name), who will be pursuing his bachelors degree in political science from Ramanujan College, said that while he preferred in-person classes over online ones, there was little that students could do. “There can never be a replacement for physical classes. I hope regular classes can resume at the earliest so that we can get a taste of the campus life,” he said. Abha Dev Habib, who teaches physics at Miranda House, said that the university needed to issue a schedule outlining the time when physical classes for different semester students were likely to resume. “Now, the university should produce a schedule outlining resumption of in-person classes. It should bring back the third-year students first, which is the weakest batch. In order of priority, second-year and first-year students should also be called back to the university,” said Habib. She said that while first semester students could be called to campus by March next year, it was necessary for the university to prepare them for the possibility of physical exams in March so that there is an initiation of the routine cycle in some way. As per the academic calendar shared by the university, exams for the first semester students will take place in March but there is no clarity on the mode of examinations. For students that are currently studying in the second and third year, the online open book examination is scheduled from November end. A number of student groups and organisations such as AISA, KYS, SFI among others are currently holding an indefinite strike seeking a reopening of the university for the past three days. Students said that the strike will continue till the admission issues a notification outlining the reopening. DU declares ECA merit list Delhi University on Wednesday declared the centralised merit list of eligible candidates for admission to undergraduate courses under the ECA category. Like last year, the university did not hold sports and ECA trials this year. The list of eligible candidates as per the centralized ECA merit list is available on the university’s admission portal and eligible students can register their preferences for the allotment of course and colleges from Wednesday till Friday this week. Candidates will not get any further chance for registering their preferences for allotment of course and college after Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-to-start-online-classes-on-november-22-101636570401836.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi University professor murdered wife for dowry in Burari house, say police||A 38-year-old Delhi University (DU) assistant professor, Virender Kumar, was arrested along with his cousin, Govind Prasad, 29, in connection with the murder of his wife Pinky Singh in Burari on Monday. Police arrested the two men after questioning Kumar’s former driver, Rakesh, 31, who was arrested in the case on Monday evening. Kumar, who holds a PhD in Sanskrit, works as an ad hoc teacher at Ramjas College, police said. According to the police, Kumar allegedly admitted that he murdered his wife as he felt “cheated” after a cheque of ₹5 lakh, given to him by Pinky’s family as a “wedding gift”, bounced. Police said Kumar and Pinky got married in February 2020. Pinky’s family members also told police that Kumar was harassing her for dowry for the past several months. Police said former driver Rakesh was arrested on Monday evening after a police officer found him loitering in the Burari area “in a state of nervousness”. Police have now confirmed that this was part of the plan to mislead them. Police said Rakesh, when questioned, said he had come to surrender after killing his employer’s wife. After arresting him, a police team reached the couple’s home in Sant Nagar and found Pinky dead on her bed. Police then registered a case of murder and announced Rakesh’s arrest, adding that they were probing the role of others in the crime. Police said further Investigation revealed that Rakesh allegedly strangled Pinky and also electrocuted her till she died. According to police, Rakesh allegedly helped Kumar carry out the murder because he had a grudge against Pinky for sacking him as the family driver and getting him evicted from the building. Rakesh told police that Kumar had bought a WagonR car three years ago, which they used as a taxi with Rakesh as the driver.Police said at the time of Rakesh’s arrest on Monday evening, a separate team was probing Kumar, who had also been detained for questioning. THE HUSBAND’S ROLE Kumar allegedly told investigators that he was not at home at the time of the murder, but he made contradictory statements when asked as to why he was not at home. “It was on Monday morning that Kumar and Rakesh made plans to kill Pinky, even though they first spoke about it over 15-20 days ago. He told Rakesh about his marital issues and that the ₹5 lakh cheque had bounced. Rakesh, on the other hand, was upset because he was sacked from the driver’s post by Pinky and made to vacate the room he occupied,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi. DCP Kalsi said according to the plan, Rakesh was to surrender and mislead the police investigation. “Kumar would then help Rakesh get bail and provide him with legal aid. Rakesh did as planned and confessed to the murder on Monday. But there were inconsistencies in his statements. So we scanned the footage from over 300 CCTV cameras to ascertain the time when Kumar left the house. The evidence we gathered showed that both men were lying. Kumar was subjected to detailed questioning and he confessed to the murder. He also said his nephew, Govind Kumar, helped him in the crime,” Kalsi said. DOWRY ALLEGATIONS Pinky’s brother Manvir Singh said his sister and Kumar got married on February 16, 2021. It was an arranged marriage. Singh said a week after the wedding, Pinky was forced to return to her parent’s home in Vijay Nagar as Kumar started pestering her for dowry. “My father is a junior employee with the Indian Railways. He sold our house to pay the dowry but that was not enough for Pinky’s husband. Within a week, Kumar started harassing my sister. He also threatened Pinky and we filed a police complaint in this regard. He took Pinky back in August only after we threatened to pursue our complaint,” Singh said. DELHI TOPPED DOWRY DEATHS IN 2019 and 2020 Pinky’s killing has brought to fore the rise in dowry related crimes in the national capital. Among all metropolitan cities with a population of at least two million, Delhi reported the maximum dowry deaths in 2020. At least 111 women were murdered last year (2020) over dowry in Delhi, shows the data released by the National Crime Records Bureau. Lucknow came second on the list with 48 dowry deaths. In Mumbai, there were 12 cases, while Bengaluru reported 28, Kolkata nine and Chennai 3. In 2019, too, Delhi topped the nationwide list with 117 dowry related cases. An analysis of over 500 dowry related cases registered in Delhi in 2017 by HT showed that the dowry demands ranged from a buffalo to a gas cylinder; from an autorickshaw to an Audi car, from a few thousands to crores of rupees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-du-professor-murdered-wife-for-dowry-in-burari-house-say-police-101636570282091.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||No executive, political will to curb hawking in Chandni Chowk: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Wednesday pulled up the authorities for their failure to control encroachment of hawkers in the Chandni Chowk area, saying that there seems to be no executive or political will to curb squatting.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed that barring the Lutyen’s zone there is no other place in the city that is free of hawkers.The court said, “...why spare Lutyens’ zone. They (vendors) should be all over here. Let them be in front of the President’s House, Prithviraj Road, Delhi high court, India Gate and make it a jungle. Why leave this area, we all should face it.”It said all street vendors must be paying their “haftas” or commission to authorities, which is why they are allowed to squat there despite the area being a no hawking, no vending zone. It said that the officials evidently did not want any improvement in the situation because they’d rather have commission from these unauthorised vendors.“If there is no political and executive will, then let it go the way it has to, why should we be bothered. We are getting a feeling of complete defeat in this matter,” it said.The court was hearing a plea by Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal seeking direction to the authorities to remove illegal hawkers and vendors from the no-hawking and no-squatting area in Chandni Chowk, which has recently been redeveloped.On Wednesday, senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli informed the court that despite repeated directions to the Delhi Police to install 330 CCTV cameras, there isn’t a single one in the area to check encroachment.Additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal, representing the Delhi Police, said earlier due to the redevelopment work, cameras were not being installed. He, however, sought a week’s time to install the cameras and remove encroachments in the area.Additional standing counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan, appearing for the Delhi government, said some CCTV cameras have been installed by the government and he will report the exact number on the next date of hearing.The court directed the north corporation to immediately start preparing a street vending plan involving experts from the field of planning, including from the School of Planning and Architecture, IIT, PWD and other bodies.The bench directed the north corporation to file a status report indicating the steps taken in this regard and made it clear that its commissioner shall be personally responsible for complying with this direction.During the proceedings, the court also remarked that there was no point in removing hawkers today as they will return tomorrow.“Either you all (authorities) get together and put your hands up that you can’t do anything because you are ill-staffed or whatever. There is a lack of will to it. Don’t tell us that the police and municipal authority want to do something and it is unable to do it. Either you sort it out or we will issue contempt notice,” the bench said.The matter will now be heard on December 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-executive-political-will-to-curb-hawking-in-chandni-chowk-delhi-hc-101636570221674.html
11-11-2021||Noida||Noida: Deteriorating air leads to increase in patients with respiratory issues||Government and private hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar are reporting a deluge of patients coming in with respiratory issues. Doctors say the high pollution levels and deteriorating air quality in the district have triggered chest and breathing issues. Due to the worsening of air quality in the last one week, cases of respiratory diseases in out-patient departments (OPDs) of hospitals across the city have gone up in the last few days. Doctors said most complaints pertain to asthma attacks, breathing difficulties, bronchitis and burning sensation in the eyes, among other issues.“In the last one week, there has been a 25% increase in patients coming in with complaints of acute respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute bronchitis, bronchial asthma and fever. In cold weather, dust and smoke in air settle on a lower surface in the atmosphere, which triggers allergic reactions in the respiratory tract and spreads infection as a lot of viruses and bacteria are also present in this toxic air,” said Dr N K Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association, Noida. As per data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Noida has been recording “severe” air for six days since November 4--the day Diwali was celebrated. Dr Yatendra Singh, medical superintendent at Community Health Centre, Bhangel said among the patients suffering from respiratory issues, there is a large number of patients who are unaware of their allergies and asthma. “Many people are unaware that they are asthmatic or allergic to pollutants and their condition has aggravated into acute breathing problems since the pollution levels increased in the past week. We have been nebulising most of the patients and providing inhalers to the rest of them. In the last one week, there has been an increase of about 25-30% such patients in the OPD,” said Dr Singh.Doctors at Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida said this time, patients with no history of bronchial asthma or COPD are also showing severe symptoms. “Surprisingly, we are seeing that not only are the diseases getting flared up in patients with history of respiratory issues but even healthy patients, with no history of bronchial asthma or COPD are showing severe symptoms since the last one week,” said Dr Devendra Kumar Singh, associate professor of respiratory medicine at Sharda University and Hospital, Greater Noida. He added about 50% of the hospital’s out-patient department (OPD) is filled with patients having moderate symptoms such as headaches, wheezing, coughing as well as breathing difficulties. “About two to three patients are currently admitted in the emergency ward as well, as they are suffering from severe symptoms and are unable to breathe. They have to be put on oxygen support or ventilators,” he said. Doctors at the district hospital in Noida’s Sector 30 have witnessed about 30% increase in patients complaining of dry and itchy throat, cough, fever and chest congestion. “Compared to a week ago, there has been a 30% increase in patients complaining of respiratory issues. All such patients are middle aged and most of them are those who have to go out for work,” said Dr Vikas Kheria, general physician at the district hospital’s flu clinic.At Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, 30% of all OPD patients are those suffering from respiratory problems. “Earlier, patients suffering from respiratory issues make up about 15-20% of the total footfall in the OPD. However, in the last one week, this has increased to 30%. About 1% of these patients with breathing difficulties, acute bronchitis or COPD also needed to be hospitalized,” said Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS.Dr D K Gupta, chairman at Felix Hospital in Sector 137, advised people to avoid going outdoors and always wear masks while stepping out. “N-95 masks are able to provide protection against PM2.5 pollutants in the air. Hence, people should start using them when going outdoors. Those who go for morning walks should avoid it as the air in the morning is at its most toxic level since the particles settle closer to the ground. As soon as people develop respiratory or breathing issues, they should consult their doctor,” said Dr Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-deteriorating-air-leads-to-increase-in-patients-with-respiratory-issues-101636570162045.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||RK Puram, Okhla Phase 2 now Delhi’s least polluted spots||RK Puram and Okhla Phase 2, two localities that featured in the list of Delhi’s 13 most polluted spots in 2018, have seen a turnaround in their air quality and are now ranked among the areas with cleanest air in the national capital, according to analysis by the state pollution control body.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s (DPCC) report — which ranked 39 localities that have air quality monitors — showed that Okhla Phase 2, Lodhi Road, Pusa, Aya Nagar, RK Puram and Nehru Nagar were among the city’s least polluted areas.The findings of the study show that between November 1 and November 8, RK Puram recorded only one “severe” air quality day, compared to eight in Jahangirpuri and Wazirpur, and five in Alipur.Okhla Phase 2, in comparison, saw its air quality index (AQI) breach the “severe” mark on just two of the eight days.RK Puram, officials said, performed poorly in the 2018 list because of then ongoing construction work involving two major Metro rail corridors: the Pink Line (connecting Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar via Moti Bagh and Bhikaji Cama Place), and the Magenta Line (connecting Janakpuri West and Botanical Garden via RK Puram and Vasant Vihar). Dust from the construction, coupled with high vehicular volume on the Ring Road and the Outer Ring Road, which flank RK Puram, combined to give the area pollution levels among the worst in the city at the time.“Since RK Puram is a largely residential area, it was easier for us to carry out awareness campaigns and control the pollution levels here. Once the Metro and the new Rao Tula Ram Marg flyover got constructed, a lot of the construction dust and vehicular volume was controlled,” a senior environment department official said.Okhla Phase 2, meanwhile, has benefited from stringent action against open waste dumping and garbage dumping, said officials.“Traffic jams also cause high pollution in this area. We are working with the Delhi traffic police to manage the snarls there. This will also help clean up the air in the area,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/on-hotspot-list-in-2018-rk-puram-okhla-phase-2-now-delhi-s-least-polluted-spots-101636570043222.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||Parts of north Delhi have city’s worst air quality, pollution control body says||Jahangirpuri, Wazirpur, Alipur, Bawana and Mundka topped a list of most polluted areas among 39 localities in the national capital where air quality is monitored regularly, according to an analysis by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC).The DPCC marked the 39 localities based on the average AQIs reported at these stations between November 1 and November 8.To be sure, the air in Delhi has been at its worst in the first week of November this year, breaching levels not seen since January. The city recorded the season’s first ‘very poor’ air day on November 2 — for the first time since June 9 — and its first ‘severe’ air day on November 5, for the first time since January 19, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board.The localities were marked on the basis of the number of ‘severe’, ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ air days recorded during the first eight days of the month.Jahangirpuri, Wazirpur and Alipur, all located in north Delhi, recorded five severe air days — from November 4 to November 8. Bawana, Mundka, Narela, Sonia Vihar and ITO recorded four severe air days each during this period — from November 5 to November 8, the analysis shows.After recording the cleanest October air for at least six years, Delhi’s air quality quickly spiked to dangerous levels on November 1, according to DPCC.Senior environment department officials explained that Jahangirpuri, which topped the list of the most polluted areas in the Capital, regularly records higher than city-average pollution readings primarily because of the location of the air quality monitoring station in the area. They said that open burning of garbage and biomass in nearby slum areas also adds to the high pollution levels in the area.Officials attributed the toxic air in Wazirpur to an industrial cluster in the area. They also added that open garbage burning was rampant in Jahangirpur and Wazirpur, and acted as the primary contributor of particulate matter levels in these two areas.Explaining the reasons behind high pollution levels in Alipur, the officials said it was emerging as a new pollution hot spot. They said high movement of heavy trucks and other traffic around Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar as well as the Bhalswa landfill could be the main factors responsible for the toxic air in the area.With air levels consistently in the severe, and nearly severe zones in Delhi, health experts have advised residents to take precautions especially during morning hours when pollutants usually are at the highest levels. Doctors have warned that long-term exposure to the toxic air can lead to several health problems to people of all age groups, including increase in blood pressure, under-development of lungs in infants, and chronic lung conditions cancers, low immunity, and depression among adults.Environment department officials said area specific action will be taken to curb pollution across the city. “There will be area-specific action that is required to fix pollution sources in these areas and the municipal agencies have been asked to sprinkle water, settle dust and look at any sources of pollution that can be fixed immediately,” a senior environment department official asking not to be named.A senior Met department official said Delhi recorded the cleanest October this year since record-keeping because of above-average rainfall recordings and the late withdrawal of monsoon. However, it also delayed the stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana.“Because of a late monsoon withdrawal, the window for stubble burning also shortened. This meant that the farm fires peaked around Diwali. The blatant violation of the ban on firecrackers this year and the contribution of stubble fire pushed the air in the severe zone. Also, northwesterly winds, low wind speed and falling temperatures are not helping with dispersal of pollutants, ” the official said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that to tackle specific, area-wise pollution concerns, Delhi needs localised air quality management plans.“While there is a larger plan that is in place in the form of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) and the Delhi government’s winter action plan, we also need plans on the localised level to function simultaneously. Many of the pollution hot spots have very specific geographical or demographic make, which are unique only to that area. The solutions for these unique problems also need to be unique and targeted,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/parts-of-north-delhi-have-city-s-worst-air-quality-pollution-control-body-says-101636570041870.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s 13 hotspots continue to record alarmingly high levels of pollution||Delhi’s 13 pollution hot spots – identified first in 2018, jointly by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) -- for area-specific action, continue to record alarmingly high levels of pollution, data shows. In a review meeting held by the DPCC on Tuesday evening, air quality data analysed between November 1 and November 8 shows that not only do these locations continue to record ‘severe’ air, but newer locations with high pollution levels have also emerged during this period. These new locations -- Alipur, ITO, Nehru Nagar and Sonia Vihar -- all recorded at least four ‘severe’ air days during this period, levels exceeding even some of the existing pollution hot spots. While Alipur recorded five ‘severe’ air days during this period, the remaining three locations saw four severe days each, DPCC data shows. Delhi’s original 13 hot spots were Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Wazirpur, Punjabi Bagh, Dwarka Sector 8, Rohini Sector 16, RK Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela, Okhla Phase II and Vivek Vihar. While locations such as Bawana, Mundka, Narela, Jahangirpuri and Wazirpur, Okhla-Phase II are largely dominated by industries, residential hot spots such as Dwarka’s sector 8, Rohini’s sector-16 and Punjabi Bagh have different sources of pollution. RK Puram and Anand Vihar are polluted mostly because of heavy traffic movement around them. “Action can only be focused if each hot spot’s top sources of pollution are known. One can undertake measures such as sprinkling of water, but long-term action can only be driven if agencies know specific sources of pollution. Even then, it can take some time for pollution levels to drop as background emissions will remain high across the city,” says Tanushree Ganguly, Programme Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). Among the emerging hot spots, ITO is characterised with heavy traffic, with vehicular emissions playing a key role in the PM 2.5 levels, especially during idling of vehicles. Alipur, located on the highway exiting Delhi from the north, also receives heavy traffic, in addition to receiving emissions form industries and the nearby Bhalswa landfill. The largely residential localities of Sonia Vihar and Nehru Nagar meanwhile may be recording instances of bio-mass burning, in addition to vehicular emissions and dust-upliftment. Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, says emissions from vehicles can end up releasing secondary aerosols and toxic chemicals in the air. Each time vehicles move, dust re-suspension also occurs. “If meteorological conditions are not ideal, these emissions can get trapped in the air and with dust, stay in the air for a long period. Stations located close to a source can record such high concentration easily,” he explains. On November 5, an anti-smog gun was installed at ITO by the Delhi government, to control upliftment of dust and pollutants in the area. The smog-gun was also inspected by environment minister Gopal Rai. Meanwhile, senior environment department officials said Alipur in north Delhi has a locational disadvantage, with close proximity with the Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar and the Bhalswa landfill. The area also reports among the highest cases of garbage dumping and open garbage fires, according to action-taken reports. “Alipur is among the areas where a lot of work needs to be done. The pollution levels here remain higher than the city average because of the large movement of trucks and heavy vehicles. In this area at night tyres and other waste from vehicular repairs are set ablaze. The close proximity with the landfill, which also reports frequent fires, is also a problem,” the official explained. Residents also said that dust is another factor that is prevalent in this part of the Capital. Since many of the internal roads here are unpaved and broken, road dust constantly remains suspended in the air and is made worse by the high vehicular movement. In south Delhi’s Nehru Nagar, close proximity to the Ring Road was the primary cause of pollution. Between November 1 and November 8, high cracker bursting in this residential area could also be another reason for the sudden dip in air quality. Sonia Vihar, another residential suburb in north-east Delhi, is another area which could meanwhile be getting impacted by emissions from biomass burning, as well as dust from unpaved roads along the river’s banks. Professor Mukesh Khare from IIT Delhi said while dust and garbage burning are two factors which can lead to a spike in residential areas such as Nehru Nagar and Sonia Vihar, it is difficult to pin-point any additional sources of pollution in such a short window of analysis. He says moving ahead, identifying new hot spots should be done on the basis of the total emissions being generated in the area and not the PM 2.5 or PM 10 concentration. “PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration is influenced by meteorology. If the location is near the border, trans-boundary pollution may impact it. Similarly, if there are calm winds there, pollutants will accumulate there. In order to identify a pollution hotspot, locations with the most emission count should be prioritized,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-13-hotspots-continue-to-record-alarmingly-high-levels-of-pollution-101636569921719.html
11-11-2021||Delhi||Boats, water sprinkling, bamboo barriers to clear foam in Yamuna on Chhath||Hundreds of people gathered on the banks of the Yamuna on Wednesday to perform prayers on the occasion of Chhath, defying the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) ban on celebrating the festival along the river, with authorities implementing some intriguing measures to remove the highly toxic foam that was floating on the surface of the river such as installing bamboo barricades, sprinkling water and running a boat through the froth at high speed. Experts, however, dismissed these measures as “merely optics”, and added that they will do nothing to address the basic problem of high pollution content in the river water. The 800 Chhath Puja venues set up by the Delhi government also witnessed large crowds, with MLAs of the party participating in the celebrations.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also participated in the celebrations. “This year, we faced lot of hurdles because of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we overcame all and now we are celebrating Chhath Puja. I pray for everyone’s well-being,” said Kejriwal, at a puja venue in East Kidwai Nagar.When asked about large number of people, including many led by two MPs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- Manoj Tiwari and Parvesh Verma-- celebrating the festival on the Yamuna banks in defiance of the DDMA order, Kejriwal said, “It is a pious occasion. It should not be politicised in any manner.”Massive foam built up on the surface of the Yamuna due to pollution levels touching unprecedented levels at Kalindi Kunj. On Wednesday, a government official said the revenue department, flood control department and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee decided to deploy two boats with a large cloth tied to them to remove foam from the river as an emergency measure. He added that at total of 15 boats were used to dissolve the foam. On Monday, Delhi Jal Board officials explained that high phosphate content, industrial pollutants, detergent in untreated domestic sewage, and water hyacinth near Okhla barrage caused the foam build up in the river. They said the froth indicates zero dissolved oxygen levels, which means that the water was unfit to support any aquatic life. A jal board official explained that water mixed with anti-phosphate agents was being sprinkled to clean the froth, debunking rumours that it was just plain river water. “Our teams are sprinkling water on the river to suppress the foam on a short-term basis. After we raised the issue, UP Jal Nigam officials visited the site and closed the Okhla barrage’s sluice gates so that no more polluted water reaches the area where foam formation takes place,” the official said. A senior DPCC official said deploying boats was only a short-term measure. “We deployed boats to remove the froth for the Chhath Puja. But we are also acting against sources of phosphates such as detergents, soaps, and other effluents. We are penalising owners of industries without effluent treatment plants or shutting them down. Delhi will also see a considerable improvement in the water quality once all sewage treatment plants are operational,” the officer said asking not to be named.Manoj Misra, the convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said the government is simply engaging in optics by adopting measures such as sprinkling water on the river. “Their engineers may have advised them to collect froth with boats or sprinkle water over the floating froth. These are optics which will have no effect on improving the water quality of the river,” he said.Misra added that the focus of the agencies should be on reducing industrial pollutants in the river by adopting zero-liquid discharge principle from industrial areas and restoring the natural flow of the river. Zero liquid discharge (ZLD) is wastewater management system that to ensure that there is no discharge of industrial wastewater into the environment. It is achieved by treating wastewater through recycling, recovery and reuse for industrial purpose.A major blame game over the toxic foam crisis has already begun among political parties in the Capital. DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha said on Tuesday the toxic foam floating on the Yamuna river was a gift to Delhi from the governments in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Chadha said about 105 MGD wastewater from the Yamuna in Haryana and about 50 MGD wastewater from the Ganga in Uttar Pradesh merged into Okhla barrage and this water had industrial waste, untreated detergents, and ammonia that led to the formation of the dirty frothing. Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala hit back at Aam Aadmi Party leaders in Delhi, saying that it had become the Delhi government’s “habit” to blame the neighbouring state for everything.Earlier in the day, BJP MP (northeast Delhi) Manoj Tiwari and MP (West Delhi) Parvesh Verma participated in Chhat celebrations at two seperate locations in the banks of the Yamuna.Verma said, “The Arvind Kejriwal led government has failed to clean the Yamuna. Now he is trying to justify his failure by stopping people from celebrating Chhat Puja in the riverbank. This is not acceptable.”To be sure, the DDMA, which imposed the restriction, is chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, who is an appointee of the BJP-led Union government. The Delhi chief minister is the Authority’s vice chairperson.In a press conference after Chhat celebrations on Wednesday, Tiwari said: “It is a serious matter as what should have been banned is not the chhatt pooja celebration but that poisonous froth in the river. The fact is the scheme should have been made to clean the river but the one being made is to ban that festival which actually cleans the river. Devotees are being stopped from going to ghats to prevent his own shortcomings from being exposed. The point is neither would they go near the Yamuna nor would they be able to see froth flowing in the river at Kalindi Kunj area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/boats-water-sprinkling-bamboo-barriers-to-clear-foam-in-yamuna-on-chhath-101636569862605.html
11-11-2021||Noida||Noida’s air improves, Ghaziabad still the most polluted in the country||The air quality in Noida showed some improvement on Wednesday for the first time since Diwali. With an air quality index (AQI) reading of 378, the city’s air was in the ‘very poor’ category. On the other hand, Ghaziabad again topped the list of most polluted cities in the country as with an AQI of 428, its pollution levels continued to be in the ‘severe’ category. According to the AQI bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Greater Noida too had ‘very poor’ air on Wednesday with an AQI of 374. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Noida reeled under “severe” pollution levels for six days at a stretch since November 4--the day Diwali was celebrated. Official statistics of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) indicate that it is for the first time since 2018 that Noida suffered “severe” pollution levels for six days at a stretch. Last year, the city suffered from “severe” pollution levels for six consecutive days from November 5 to November 10. “The ‘very poor’ AQI of Noida is the result of less traffic on roads; there were hardly any traffic congestion on the day of Chathh Puja. Moreover, the impact of firecrackers burst during Diwali has considerably died down. It is likely that once the wind speed increases, more pollutants will be dispersed,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. According to official statistics, Ghaziabad city reeled under “severe” pollution levels for eight consecutive days from November 9 to 16 in 2017. “There is huge traffic volume in Ghaziabad due to Chhath Puja. The two air quality monitoring stations at Loni and Sanjay Nagar continued to record the higher ends in the ‘severe’ category. We have asked the authorities in Loni to increase the frequency of water sprinkling as there is high volume of dust on roads. The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation has also told us that they will be procuring more mechanical road sweeping machines and these will be deployed at Sanjay Nagar and at Delhi Meerut Road,” Sharma added. The Delhi Meerut Road is estimated to have a volume of 1.2 lakh passenger car units per day. Work on the Regional Rapid Transit System on the median of the road is also going on in full swing. This has led to an increase in traffic congestion, which increase the amount of PM2.5 in the air. As per the CPCB AQI bulletin, all the monitoring stations in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida were running high on PM2.5 and it also stood as the primary pollutant on Wednesday. “Air quality is expected to deteriorate for the next two days but will remain either at the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category or touch the lower end of ‘severe’ category. Calm local surface winds may cause stagnation, which weakens dispersion of pollutants. Today’s share of crop residue burning is 27% in PM2.5 and effective fire count is 5,317. Air quality is likely to improve on November 13,” said the forecast by the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar) on Wednesday. Environmentalists blame the agencies for lack of ground level action. “Their claims of abetting pollution through various action plans have fallen flat. The ‘severe’ AQI for seven days calls for some introspection by agencies in Ghaziabad. They are yet to procure the required equipment to tackle pollution. This indicates the seriousness with which agencies are dealing with pollution,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-air-imrpoves-ghaziabad-still-the-most-polluted-in-the-country-101636569681731.html

11-11-2021||Lucknow||Now, Rajbhar's remark on Jinnah sparks row||Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) president Om Prakash Rajbhar on Wednesday said there would have been no Partition of the country had Muhammad Ali Jinnah been made India’s first prime minister, adding to the row on a remark on Pakistan’s founder by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav earlier, and drawing a sharp reaction from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Om Prakash Rajbhar, who was interacting with the media in Varanasi, recently announced an alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) for the Uttar Pradesh assembly election. Akhilesh Yadav had also praised Jinnah and said that he played a role in the freedom struggle along with Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The BJP had reacted strongly to Akhilesh’s remark as well.Om Prakash Rajbhar further said, “Think why Atalji and Advaniji also praised Jinnah’s thoughts. That is why I think that if Jinnah had been made the first Prime Minister of the country, then there would have been no Partition of the country.” Reacting to Om Prakash Rajbhar’s remark on Jinnah, UP cabinet minister and BJP leader Anil Rajbhar alleged that the SBSP chief made the statement at the instance of the Samajwadi Party. Talking to the media at the circuit house in Varanasi, the minister said that the statement on Jinnah is an example of the narrow mentality of the SP and the SBSP.“These are the people who eat in this country, but sing the praises of another country. This statement has been (made) only in the greed of votes. This is an attempt to create unrest in the state by them,” he said. He accused the SP of doing the politics of appeasement. Anil Rajbhar said that in order to win the election, the SP and SBSP hurt people’s sentiments about great leaders and the people will give a befitting reply in the coming elections.Any amount of condemnation is less for the statement on Jinnah, he said.One who cannot respect great men can neither do good to the country nor understand the pain of the poor, deprived and common man, the minister said. UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh said as the Uttar Pradesh assembly election was approaching, there was a competition among the opposition leaders to praise Jinnah.He said Samajwadi Party leaders were not desisting from insulting countless freedom fighters by constantly comparing Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. Singh said that such comparison was also an insult to people, including backward classes across the country, who consider Sardar Patel as their ideal and draw inspiration from him.The backward classes of the state were eager to teach the Samajwadi Party a lesson, the UP BJP chief said.Singh said that the leaders of opposition parties have become victims of mental bankruptcy due to the politics of appeasement.These leaders of the SP and SBSP have forgotten that first Jinnah formed a party on the basis of religion and eventually got the country divided, Singh said.He said that Akhilesh and his leaders may not have realised the pain of Partition but the countrymen have not forgotten that yet.In view of the assembly elections, some are conspiring to spoil the social harmony in the state but people of the state along with the Bharatiya Janata Party will not allow any such mischief to succeed, he said.On October 31, Akhilesh Yadav, while addressing a public meeting in Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh, had said that leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Muhammad Ali Jinnah had played a role in India’s freedom struggle. The remark saw BJP leaders, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath, targeting Akhilesh Yadav and seeking an apology from “Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle,” Akhilesh Yadav had said.UP minister Anand Swaroop Shukla on November 6 had said to reporters in Ballia: “SP chief Akhilesh Yadav making a statement on Muhammad Ali Jinnah is not a common incident. Akhilesh Yadav has been the chief minister of UP while Jinnah is responsible for the partition of the country.”Shukla also said the SP chief should clarify as to under what pressure he is glorifying Jinnah. “I want Akhilesh Yadav to himself come forward, and get his narco test done,” Shukla said, adding that Jinnah is such a villain who no Indian would like to see or listen to. He further said that those heaping praises on Jinnah should go to Pakistan. The Samajwadi Party had demanded the sacking of Shukla for making controversial remarks against Akhilesh Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/there-would-have-been-no-partition-if-jinnah-had-been-made-india-s-first-pm-om-prakash-rajbhar-101636562181700.html
11-11-2021||Lucknow||Youth dies in custody,Kasganj cops claim he hanged himself from pipe in washroom||A youth called for interrogation at the Kasganj police station in an abduction case died in custody on Tuesday evening, with his family members alleging that he was killed by police personnel.The police claimed that Altaf, 22, who was accused of eloping with a minor Hindu girl, had strangulated himself using a string from his jacket hood in the washroom of the police lock-up and said five policemen had been suspended for negligence in the wake of the incident.The post-mortem report cited asphyxia as the cause of death, claimed police.Prashant Kumar, ADG (law and order), UP Police, said on Wednesday that five police personnel were suspended for their negligence in the custody death case. “Judicial inquiry will be conducted into the incident and further course of action will be decided based on the findings,” he said.Altaf, a resident of Ahroli village in Kasganj district, was working as a tile fixer. He was accused of abduction and eloping with a minor girl and a complaint in this regard had been filed by the girl’s family.“A case was registered at the Sadar Kotwali police station of Kasganj under Sections 363 and 366 (kidnapping, abduction) of the IPC against Altaf who was taken into police custody for interrogation on Tuesday morning. During interrogation, the accused went to the washroom at the police station, where he hanged himself to death from the tap,” stated AK Singh, ASP.“The accused was wearing a jacket with a hood and used its string which he tied to the tap in the toilet and hanged himself,” stated Singh.He said the body of the accused was sent for a post-mortem examination, which was conducted by a panel of three doctors. “Asphyxia because of hanging has been cited as the cause of death in the post-mortem report. The body was handed over to family members who conducted the last rites on Wednesday,” added the ASP.The five policemen suspended for laxity included in-charge of the police station Virendra Singh Indolia, sub-inspector Chandresh Gautam, sub- inspector Vikas Kumar, head moharrir Dhanendra Singh and constable Saurabh Solanki.Family members of the deceased alleged that policemen from Sadar Kotwali police station picked Altaf in a case related to a missing girl. “We were assured that Altaf would return soon, but news about his death came,” said Chand Mian, father of the youth who died in police custody.DOUBT OVER COPS’ THEORYThough police maintained that Altaf hanged himself to death, there were doubts on this theory as the tap was of plastic and was at a low level in the toilet.OPPN ATTACKS UP GOVTSamajwadi Party president of Akhilesh Yadav raised suspicion over the sequence of events narrated by the Kasganj police. “The death of the youth in police custody appears suspicious. Suspension of a few cops in the name of negligence is an act of cover-up,” he stated in his tweet.“There needs to be a judicial probe so that family members of the deceased can get justice and trust could be re-established in police under the BJP regime,” he added.The Samajwadi Party took to Twitter to attack the Yogi Adityanath government, calling the incident another misdeed of UP’s “thoko (trigger-happy) police.”“In UP, under the patronage of the chief minister, criminals and police are committing an encounter of law and order. The guilty policemen should face a murder case and must be punished,” the Samajwadi Party said in a tweet in Hindi.With different communities involved, police took no chances and heavy force was deployed when Altaf’s body was taken through the roads of Kasganj city for burial on Wednesday. Additional police force, including the PAC from nearby districts, was called in.The incident comes close on the heels of a sanitation worker, who was accused of stealing ₹25 lakh from Jagdishpura police station in Agra, dying in police custody after his health deteriorated during interrogation.AIMIM FOR JUDICIAL PROBEThe All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (UP) condemned the incident in Kasganj and asserted that the “custodial death must be viewed as an extension of the rampant police killings of innocent Muslims, Dalits and tribals in the name of police encounters,” read a press statement by the AIMIM.“Making a mockery of constitutional procedures and police code of conducts, chief minister Yogi Adityanath gives calls for ‘thok denge’, thereby giving a free hand to the police to kill. Our national president Asaduddin Owaisi said in his speech in Balrampur - of all the people encountered by the UP Police, 37% were Muslims,” stated the press statement.The silence of the self-claimed secular parties on these killings reveals their lack of conviction in challenging the BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh government on issues concerning Muslims and other marginalised groups, alleged AIMIM leaders.AIMIM also demanded a judicial probe into the matter under a sitting high court judge along with reasonable compensation and government job to the next of kin of the deceased.‘My son was innocent, brutally murdered’“My son was innocent but was brutally murdered by them (police). I want justice for him. I had served him food. When he was about to have it, the police arrived. They asked him to come with them, not allowing him to put a morsel in his mouth,” said an inconsolable Fatima, mother of Altaf, who wants justice for her son.“The policemen told me that he will be sent back in half an hour. Two hours passed but he did not return. I went to the police station with the food for him but they did not allow me to give it to him,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/youth-dies-in-custody-kasganj-cops-claim-he-hanged-himself-from-pipe-in-washroom-101636550480657.html

11-11-2021||World||Meghan Markle apologises to court for forgetting book discussions, says 'no intention to mislead'||The Duchess of Sussex has apologized for misleading a British court about the extent of her cooperation with the authors of a sympathetic book about her and Prince Harry.The former Meghan Markle is embroiled in legal action in London over a newspaper’s publication of portions of a letter she wrote to her estranged father after her 2018 marriage to Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.She sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and the MailOnline website for breach of privacy and copyright. A High Court judge ruled in her favor in February, saying publication of the letter Meghan wrote to her father, Thomas Markle, was “manifestly excessive and hence unlawful.”Publisher Associated Newspapers is trying to overturn that decision at the Court of Appeal. The publisher argues that Meghan wrote the letter knowing it might be published, and made private information public by cooperating with Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, authors of “Finding Freedom.”The duchess’ lawyers have previously denied that she or Harry collaborated with the authors. But the couple’s former communications director, Jason Knauf, said in evidence to the court that he gave the writers information, and discussed it with Harry and Meghan.In a witness statement, Knauf said the book was “discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email.” Emails released as part of Knauf’s statement showed he also emailed Harry to discuss the book and to say he would meet the authors.Knauf said Harry replied: “I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn’t have anything to do with it. Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there.”In a witness statement made public on Wednesday, Meghan accepted “that Mr. Knauf did provide some information to the authors for the book and that he did so with my knowledge, for a meeting that he planned for with the authors in his capacity as communications secretary.” She added that “the extent of the information he shared is unknown to me.”The duchess said she did not remember the discussions with Knauf when she gave evidence earlier in the case, “and I apologize to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time.”“I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court,” she said.Associated Newspapers says Knauf’s evidence also undermines Meghan’s claim that she did not intend the letter to be seen by anyone but her father.In his witness statement, Knauf said the duchess “asked me to review the text of the letter, saying ‘obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked.’”Knauf said Meghan asked whether she should address her father in the letter as “Daddy,” adding that “in the unfortunate event that it leaked, it would pull at the heartstrings.”In her own written evidence, Meghan, 40, said she had not believed that her father “would sell or leak the letter, primarily because it would not put him in a good light.”“To be clear, I did not want any of it to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimized, were it to be exploited,” she said.Lawyers for Meghan told the Court of Appeal Thursday that if she had wanted to put the letter to her father in the public domain, the “Finding Freedom” book would have been the “perfect opportunity” to do so.The appeal continues Thursday before three senior judges. A ruling is expected at a later date.Meghan, a former star of the American TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry at Windsor Castle in May 2018.Meghan and Harry announced in early 2020 that they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-apologises-to-court-for-forgetting-book-discussions-says-no-intention-to-mislead-101636650013206.html

Sethi, founder of wearable devices brand Pavlok, hired a woman named Kara, for $8 an hour, to watch his screen and slap him if he went on the social media platform.Sethi’s peculiar act was advertised in Craigslist back in 2012 and has started doing the rounds on social media nine years later after Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacted to it using two ‘fire’ emojis, injecting new life into the stunt.“When I am wasting time, you’ll have to yell at me or if need be, slap me,” Sethi had written in the 2012 ad.Sethi reacted to Musk’s response with doubt, wondering if the ‘fire’ emojis symbolised his ‘Icarus flying too close to the sun moment. “I'm the guy in this picture. Is @elonmusk giving me two emojis the highest I'll ever reach? Is this my icarus flying too close to the sun moment? Was that implied by the fire symbols elon posted?

11-11-2021||World||China: With signature CPC resolution, Xi Jinping tightens grip on power||The Communist Party of China (CPC) wrapped up a key meeting on Thursday, adopting a rare resolution on the party’s history, strengthening President Xi Jinping’s stature, legacy and future as he looks to secure a precedent-breaking third-term as the country’s leader in late 2022.The adoption of the resolution puts Xi, 68, in the same category as CPC icon and founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, and the key architect behind the country’s economic ascent, Deng Xiaoping.“A high-profile meeting of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has adopted a landmark resolution on the major achievements and historical experience of the CPC’s 100 years of endeavours,” according to a CPC communique released and quoted by the Xinhua news agency, on Thursday evening.“CPC plenum passes landmark resolution”, Xinhua headlined the story.The adoption of the resolution concluded the sixth plenum of the CPC’s central committee, a group of 348 party members, which chooses its new leaders every five years, which had been meeting since Monday behind closed doors in Beijing.Similar resolutions have been adopted only twice before - in 1945 under Mao and in 1981 under Deng.The resolutions helped consolidate the power bases of both leaders and enshrined their roles in Chinese and CPC histories.China approved the removal of the two-term limit on the presidency, effectively allowing Xi to remain in power indefinitely at the annual session of its parliament, the National People’s Congress in March, 2018.A 12-page communique on the plenum issued on Thursday evening said it was necessary to review the party history for “…resolutely upholding Comrade Xi Jinping’s core position on the central committee and in the party as a whole and upholding the central committee’ authority and its centralised, unified leadership to ensure that all party members act in unison”.The communique eulogised Xi Jinping’s role in Chinese politics, mentioning his “meticulous assessment and deep reflection on a number of major theoretical and practical questions regarding the cause of the party and the country in the new era…”“He is thus the principal founder of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. This is the Marxism of contemporary China and of the 21st century. It embodies the best of Chinese culture and ethos in our times and represents a new breakthrough in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context.”The adoption of the resolution on Thursday coincided with Xi’s speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum where he spoke against forming cliques.In a recorded video to the forum, Xi urged Asian nations to resist forming “small circles on geopolitical grounds”, a reference to efforts by US President Joe Biden to counter China.“The Asia-Pacific region cannot and should not relapse into the antagonism and division of the Cold War era,” Xi said.Experts say that Xi is rewriting history to strengthen his grip on power. “He is using the resolution on history, which will be published at the end of the 6th plenum, to shape the narrative of the party’s history. Likely he will highlight the role of his father, an important figure of the Northwestern revolutionary base area, as well as his own role in realising an economically prosperous and geopolitically assertive China,” Victor Shih, expert on Chinese politics at University of California, San Diego, said.“For someone who grew up in the bosom of the party, telling the story according to his vision is important,” Shih said.The plenum heard and discussed a work report Xi delivered on behalf of the political bureau of the CPC central committee.

11-11-2021||World||Pandemic sparks sharp rise in online shopping fraud: Europol||The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a sharp rise in online shopping fraud, Europe's policing agency warned on Thursday, saying criminals continued to prey on victims working from home.Fears of catching the virus have driven a sharp increase in online shopping, which in turn has led to a major rise in delivery fraud in the second year of the pandemic, Europol said in its annual cybercrime report."The extension of lockdowns throughout Europe has brought with it a number of new e-commerce opportunities, which have often proven to be a target for criminals," the Hague-based agency said."Criminals offer goods and receive payment without delivery, defraud online shops with weak security measures, or use delivery services as phishing lures," it said.Mobile phones in particular were being targeted, with criminal gangs posing as delivery services pretending to offer information about a parcel, but in reality hoping to get the victim's account and credit card details.This included sending messages via SMS on mobile phones, a practice referred to as "smishing."Meanwhile, the dark web continued to be the main market place for illicit activity, despite recent global police successes in taking down illegal websites such as DarkMarket in January.Europol said cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero remained the most popular form of payment for illegal goods and services on the dark web.Weapons appear to be increasingly traded on the dark web as well as through encrypted chat groups, Europol said.Novel weapons, such as those made by three-dimensional printers, were also on the rise.For instance, Spanish police in September last year busted a workshop where these weapons were being made.There, law officials seized templates for guns downloaded from the dark web and several 3D printers, "one of which was in the process of printing a small firearm," Europol said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-sparks-sharp-rise-in-online-shopping-fraud-europol-101636620080431.html
11-11-2021||World||Uber sued in US for charging 'wait time fees' to people with disabilities||The United States Justice Department on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app Uber over allegations of overcharging passengers with disabilities. According to the statement published on the department's website, Uber Technologies charged "wait time" fees to passengers who needed more time to enter the car due to their disability. It has also asked the company to comply with the anti-discrimination law of America.In April 2016, Uber began charging passengers wait time fees in a number of cities, the department of justice stated in the lawsuit. Eventually, the company expanded the policy nationwide, it also said.The department said that the wait time policy of Uber violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, saying blind people or users of wheelchairs or walkers need more than two minutes to get into a car. "People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber," Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who is representing the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.The lawsuit seeks to bring the company into compliance with the mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), "while sending a powerful message that Uber cannot penalise passengers with disabilities simply because they need more time to get into a car," it also said.The department further asked Uber and other similar companies to ensure equal access for all people, "including those with disabilities". "People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber," Clarke also said.The lawsuit is filed at US District Court in San Francisco and seeks an order to Uber to modify its wait time fee policy and pay monetary damages for any illegal fees that have been charged so far. Wait time fees start two minutes after the Uber car arrives at the pickup location and is charged until the car begins its trip.Meanwhile, the company has called the lawsuit "surprising and disappointing". "Wait time fees are charged to all riders to compensate drivers after two minutes of waiting, but were never intended for riders who are ready at their designated pickup location, but need more time to get into the car," it said in a statement, according to a report by Reuters.It also clarified that the company has issued refunds whenever disabled riders alerted about the charges on the app.In April, Uber was ordered to pay $1.1m to a blind woman who was refused rides on 14 occasions. In the lawsuit, it was alleged that Uber's drivers had illegally discriminated against her due to her condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-sued-in-us-for-charging-wait-time-fees-to-people-with-disabilities-101636612230142.html

11-11-2021||World||COP26: US, China unveil surprise deal to cooperate more on climate crisis||China and the United States early on Thursday unveiled a surprise deal and issued a joint statement on climate cooperation, pledging they would work together to slow global warming during this decade and ensure that the Glasgow talks result in progress. The framework agreement was announced by US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the Glasgow UN climate conference (COP26). The world’s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters said they would take “enhanced climate actions” to meet the central goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord - limiting warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrial levels, and if possible, not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius.The agreement is titled he China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s. “The two sides said they appreciated the work done so far and pledged to continue working together with all parties to strengthen the implementation of the Paris Agreement,” the Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.“On the basis of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities as well as taking into account national conditions, enhanced climate action will be taken to effectively address the climate crisis,” the Xinhua report said.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Wednesday welcomed a China-US joint declaration on enhancing climate action at the Glasgow conference. “I welcome today’s agreement between China and the USA to work together to take more ambitious #ClimateAction in this decade,” Guterres tweeted. “Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity, and this is an important step in the right direction.”Beijing and Washington have agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action in the 2020s to promote cooperation on climate change between the two countries and the multilateral processes.Chinese President Xi Jinping did not attend the UN meeting in person, delivering instead a written statement to the opening section of the summit when leaders usually give speeches.In it, he offered no additional pledges, while urging countries to keep their promises and “strengthen mutual trust and cooperation”.Xi pledged at the UN General Assembly in September that China would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.Interestingly, the US and China had signed a climate deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during former president Barack Obama’s visit to China exactly seven years ago in November, 2014.US officials, according to Reuters, had then said the commitments by the world’s two biggest carbon polluters came after months of backroom negotiations and would set the stage for a global climate control pact, but experts said the limits did not break significant new ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop26-us-china-unveil-surprise-deal-to-cooperate-more-on-climate-crisis-101636609404093.html
11-11-2021||World||SpaceX launch marks 600 space travelers in 60 years||A SpaceX rocket carried four astronauts into orbit Wednesday night, including the 600th person to reach space in 60 years.The repeatedly delayed flight occurred just two days after SpaceX brought four other astronauts home from the International Space Station. They should have been up there to welcome the newcomers, but Nasa and SpaceX decided to switch the order based on Monday’s ideal recovery weather in the Gulf of Mexico.“It was a great ride, better than we imagined,” mission commander Raja Chari said shortly after the spacecraft reached orbit.The launch was just as riveting for spectators at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center, as well as along the East Coast, as the Falcon rocket thundered through clouds on its way to space, turning night into day.Germany’s Matthias Maurer claimed the No 600 position, according to Nasa, based on his mission assignment. He and his three Nasa crewmates should arrive at the space station in under 24 hours, well over a week late.One of the astronauts — Nasa isn’t saying which one — was sidelined last week by an undisclosed medical issue. The crew member is fully recovered, according to Nasa. Officials won’t say whether it was an illness or injury but noted it wasn’t Covid-19.Bad weather also contributed to their flight delays. Chari said trying to launch on Halloween left them with "a trick instead of a treat.” It was also drizzling Wednesday night when the four astronauts said goodbye to their families for six months but it cleared up by launch time.“Enjoy your holidays among the stars. We’ll be waving as you fly by," SpaceX launch director Mark Soltys radioed to the crew.The list of 600 travelers ranges from those who have barely scratched space — like actor William Shatner last month — to US and Russian astronauts who have spent a year or more in orbit. This year’s surge in space tourists helped push the tally over the 600 mark.That averages out to 10 people per year since Yuri Gagarin’s pioneering flight in 1961, Maurer noted.“But I think in a very few years, we will see an exponential rise of that one because now we’re entering the era of commercial spaceflight,” he said after arriving at Kennedy Space Center two weeks ago.The crew launch marked SpaceX’s fourth for Nasa in 1 1/2 years and the company’s fifth passenger flight overall — including a September charter flight for four that skipped the space station. The Dragon capsule’s toilet leaked during their three days in orbit, necessitating a quick redesign of the flushing system in the newest capsule, named Endurance by its crew.A balky parachute during Monday's descent had SpaceX engineers poring over the data, before giving the go-ahead for Wednesday’s launch. One of the four chutes opened more than a minute late, a problem seen in testing and well within safety limits, SpaceX officials said.Mauer is one of three newbies on the crew. The 51-year-old was a finalist when he first applied to be an astronaut with the European Space Agency. Encouraged, he left his research job at a medical company and joined the space agency as an engineer, and made the astronaut cut in 2015.Chari, 44, is an Air Force colonel and the first space rookie in decades to lead a mission to orbit for Nasa. A test pilot from Cedar Falls, Iowa, Chari accumulated more than 2,500 hours in fighter jets, including combat missions in Iraq.Also on board:— Dr. Thomas Marshburn, 61, will be the oldest person to live aboard the space station and perform a spacewalk. Born in Statesville, North Carolina, he pursued a career in emergency medicine, then joined Nasa in 1994 as a flight surgeon. This is his third trip to the space station.— Kayla Barron, 34, a Navy lieutenant commander from Richland, Washington. She was among the first women to serve as submarine warfare officers. Added to the flight in May, she’s No. 601 in space.During their station stay, they will welcome two groups of tourists. A Russian film crew recently spent two weeks at the station, making a movie.The new crew will be joining three station residents — two Russians and Nasa's Mark Vande Hei, who celebrated his 55th birthday on Wednesday.“Nasa and @SpaceX are lighting a big candle in the sky for you tonight,” Nasa tweeted before the launch.That candle — the first-stage booster — landed upright on an ocean barge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-launch-marks-600-space-travelers-in-60-years-101636606038906.html
11-11-2021||World||Taliban must cut off umbilical cord with Pak for Afghanistan to survive||After a day-long deliberations on Afghanistan by National Security Advisors (NSAs) of eight neighboring countries here on Wednesday, it has become quite evident that the Taliban will continue to hold the reins of power in Kabul. It has also become clear that apart from Afghan people themselves or any rival Sunni Salafists like the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) or al Qaida, no one can remove the Taliban from power as global powers neither have the intentions, energy nor the mind space to tackle humongous problems of Afghanistan.Now that the global community has mentally accepted the Taliban regime in Kabul, it is time that the Sunni Pashtun force came out of the shadows and started governing the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan in the earnest and not wait for acceptance in UN. Since the Taliban occupied Kabul on August 15, its Supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada has only been heard not seen, giving rise to the very physical existence of the cleric. According to Kabul watchers, none could confirm the physical presence of the Emir-ul-Momim when he was said to have made his first public appearance in Kandahar on October 31. He was perhaps last seen at the Pakistan Army cantonment in Karachi earlier this year.While secrecy surround Mullah Akhundzada in Afghanistan, there are reports that Pakistan deep state backed Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani frequently moves to and fro on Durand Line even as he contests with Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob, son of first Emir-ul-Momin Mullah Omar, for political power in Kabul. The Taliban may be good in wielding the gun and asymmetric warfare, but governance is definitely not their forte as the country moves towards virtual ventilator state.If the Taliban have real desire to provide governance even under the Islamic Sharia law to Afghanistan, then the answer lies within the country and not across in the ISI Headquarters in Rawalpindi. With Taliban’s acting Foreign Minister Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi in Islamabad today for first bilateral talks with Pakistan after seizing power and the ISI chief making frequent trips to Kabul as it was just another intelligence station, the beginning is surely not good but on expected lines.Even though Pakistan ISI is gloating over its success in making the mighty US run away empty-handed from Kabul, it is only a matter of time that the chaos spill across the Durand Line. It is said that Taliban Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Baradar told the ISI chief Gen Faiz Hameed that if Islamic Emirates is good for Afghanistan, the same holds good for Pakistan. The threat in Barader’s statement is understood by Pakistan Army but not by the civilian leadership in Islamabad. For a country where retail sugar is more costly than petrol, the chances of sustaining a neighboring perpetually strife torn country are simply non-existent. It is only a matter of time when Pakistan gets dragged down by its own creation.Rather than let Pakistan practice its dark arts in Kabul, the Taliban should cut the umbilical cord from Rawalpindi and seek legitimacy from the Loya Jirga (Tribal Council) and the Ulema Council (Religious Council) of Afghanistan for internal peace in the country. Legitimacy from the people of Afghanistan will not only bring stability to the nation that has not seen peace in many a decade but also respect and acceptance from the international community. Taliban must make a transition from a terrorist group to a political ruler if Afghanistan has to survive. Or else a weak vulnerable state with actual reins of power across the Durand Line will give way to opportunistic Islamic jihadist groups, which are present on an industrial scale in Pakistan. Given their Islamic duty to spread jihad in non-Muslim lands, these Islamist Takfiri (who have no qualms in killing fellow Muslims) groups in a matter of time will start targeting a third country in the west with or without the knowledge of the Taliban, leading to another cycle of occupation, total chaos and violence. The tragedy is that Taliban leadership can always take shelter across the Khyber and Spin Boldak passes as in the past, but the hapless people of Afghanistan have nowhere to go.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-must-cut-of-umbilical-cord-with-pak-for-afghanistan-to-survive-101636603944269.html

They are in the prisons,” Hamraz added.Also Read| Taliban minister Muttaqi in Islamabad for talks as Pak hosts meet on AfghanistanSince the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August this year, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in the war-ravaged country.The latest attack by the terror outfit was on November 2 when its fighters attacked a military hospital in the capital city of Kabul, killing 25 people and injuring over 50. Among the deceased was Mawlawi Hamdullah Mukhlis, head of the Kabul military corps and a senior commander in the Taliban, officials of the so-called Islamic Emirate said.In October, the Islamic State warned that Shi’ite Muslims are perilous and they will be targeted everywhere.Taliban chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid, who was also present during Wednesday's press conference, said that the Islamic State is not a great threat at present and 21 of its sanctuaries were eliminated in several provinces.“Our efforts are continuing to root out Daesh (IS) but the threats have been reduced to a great extent,” Mujahid told reporters, according to the Tolo News report."They are not many in Afghanistan, because they do not have the support of the people," the Taliban chief spokesperson further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-600-islamic-state-members-arrested-in-last-3-months-claim-taliban-101636598059557.html
11-11-2021||World||Brazilian Prez Jair Bolsonaro to join centrist party, eyeing 2022 reelection bid||After two years without a political party, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro sealed an agreement with the centrist Liberal Party to back his 2022 reelection bid, according to a party statement released Wednesday.The decision followed a meeting between Bolsonaro and Liberal Party leader Valdemar Costa Neto in the capital Brasilia, the statement said. The president's formal enrollment to the party's ranks will take place Nov. 22.Bolsonaro intends for the alliance to aid him in battling his nemesis, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “Lula,” as da Silva is known universally, holds a handsome lead over Bolsonaro in early polls. Joining one of the parties that forms part of the so-called Centrao group also signals Bolsonaro shifting course from his 2018 campaign strategy, when he sharply criticized their old-school political practices.“It is very symbolic how Bolsonaro has started to play the traditional game of Brazilian politics," said Maurício Santoro, a political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “The PL is helping Bolsonaro survive.”The Liberal Party - known by its Portuguese initials PL - and other Centrao parties are notorious for their ideological malleability and swapping support for government appointments and earmarks. Bolsonaro was affiliated with such parties during most of his seven terms as a federal lawmaker, but cast himself as a political outsider during his 2018 presidential campaign. He vowed not to embrace the horse trading that benefited entrenched actors and enabled corruption.Instead, he ran under the banner of the Social Liberal Party, which he left one year after his election victory amid disagreements with party leadership over funding and regional nominations. He set out to forge his own party, but failed to garner enough signatures and has been without a political home since.Two of Bolsonaro’s ministers told The Associated Press the president’s decision to join the PL was influenced by his three politician sons, who believe the party will grant their father sufficient autonomy to pick allies as candidates for gubernatorial and congressional positions in next year’s election. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.The presidential press office didn't respond to a request for comment from the AP confirming the PL's statement, nor the president's justification for the decision. Earlier Wednesday, Bolsonaro said in a radio interview there was a “99.9% chance” he would join the PL.Reports that Bolsonaro was seeking a Centrao party to sponsor his reelection bid had already generated commentary from analysts that he was fully departing from his prior anti-establishment stance. As rumors of his agreement with the PL intensified this week, a series of comments criticizing party leader Costa Neto were deleted from the social media profiles of Bolsonaro family members.Bolsonaro himself has said Costa Neto was corrupt and a convict, noted Carlos Melo, a political analyst and professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. In 2012, Costa Neto, then a lawmaker, was convicted for corruption and money laundering in a vast vote-buying scandal that almost brought down da Silva’s administration. He served time in prison.“Bolsonaro was always affiliated with a Centrao party, his whole congressional career," Melo said. “He got elected criticizing the Centrao, the Workers' Party, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, saying he was an outsider. It was a strategy for that election.”Bolsonaro joining the PL will mark the continuation of his cozying up to the Centrao over the past year. The far-right president has turned to the Centrao for political shelter from increasing pressure on his administration, including more than 100 impeachment requests, a Senate investigation into his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and plunging popularity. In August, he appointed a senator from the Centrao to be his chief-of-staff, sealing his rapprochement with the power brokers.“If you take away the Centrao, there’s the left," the president told a small conservative news outlet, Jornal da Cidade Online, on Tueday. "So where do I go?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-jair-bolsonaro-to-join-centrist-party-eyeing-2022-reelection-bid-101636595732745.html
11-11-2021||World||Nasa, SpaceX launch ‘Crew 3’ astronauts on flight to International Space Station||Nasa and SpaceX, the private rocket company of Elon Musk, launched four more astronauts on a flight to the International Space Station late on Wednesday, including a veteran spacewalker and two younger crewmates chosen to join Nasa's forthcoming lunar missions.The SpaceX-built launch vehicle, consisting of a Crew Dragon capsule perched atop a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, climbed into the night sky from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as its nine Merlin engines roared to life at about 9pm (0200 GMT Thursday).Liftoff of the Dragon spacecraft, named Endurance by the crew, was aired live from Cape Canaveral on Nasa TV. Intermittent rain and clouds over the Cape earlier in the day had cast doubt on launch prospects, but the weather cleared sufficiently by flight time, Nasa said.Live Nasa video footage showed the four crew members strapped into the pressurized cabin of their gleaming white SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, wearing their helmeted white and black flight suits in the final minutes before launch.The three American astronauts and their European Space Agency crewmate were due to arrive at the space station, orbiting some 250 miles (400km) above the Earth, on Thursday evening following a flight of about 22 hours.The flight marks the third “operational” space station crew sent to orbit aboard a Dragon capsule since Nasa and SpaceX teamed up to resume space launches from American soil last year, following a nine-year hiatus at the end of the US space shuttle program in 2011.“Crew 3” includes two members of Nasa's latest graduating class of astronauts - Raja Chari, 44, a US Air Force combat jet and test pilot serving as mission commander, and mission specialist Kayla Barron, 34, a US Navy submarine officer and nuclear engineer.The team's designated pilot and second-in-command is veteran astronaut Tom Marshburn, 61, a medical doctor and former Nasa flight surgeon who has logged two previous spaceflights to the space station and four spacewalks. Rounding out the crew is European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Matthias Maurer, 51, of Germany, a materials science engineer.Chari, Barron, and Maurer were making their debut spaceflights with Wednesday's launch, becoming the 599th, 600th, and 601st humans in space.Both Chari and Barron also are among the first group of 18 astronauts selected for NASA's upcoming Artemis missions, aimed at returning humans to the moon later this decade, over a half-century after the Apollo lunar program ended.Nasa-SpaceX partnershipIt is the fourth crewed flight overall in 17 months under Nasa's public-private partnership with SpaceX, the rocket company founded in 2002 by Musk, the billionaire chief executive of electric car maker Tesla IncThe first was a two-astronaut trial run to the space station in May 2020, followed by the maiden Nasa-SpaceX operational “Crew 1” in November of that year.“Crew 2” was launched to the space station in April of this year, and just returned safely to Earth on Monday night with a splashdown capping a record 199 days in orbit.The latest mission also follows a flurry of recent high-profile astro-tourism flights, including the SpaceX launch in September of “Inspiration 4”, the first all-civilian crew sent to orbit without a professional astronaut on board.Earlier this month, 90-year-old actor William Shatner, famed for playing Captain James T Kirk on the original 1960s “Star Trek” TV series, made headlines riding aboard a rocketship launched by billionaire Jeff Bezos's company Blue Origin to become the oldest person to fly in space.The “Crew 3” team, on arriving at the space station, will be welcomed aboard the orbiting laboratory by its three current occupants – two cosmonauts from Russia and Belarus and a US astronaut who shared a Soyuz flight to orbit with them earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-spacex-launch-crew-3-astronauts-on-flight-to-international-space-station-101636596425066.html

A date has not been announced for the Xi-Biden meeting but a person briefed on the matter said it was expected to be as soon as next week.Stakes for the meeting are high - Washington and Beijing have been sparring on issues from the origins of the pandemic to China’s expanding nuclear arsenal - but Biden’s team has so far set low expectations for specific outcomes.This came even as China reacted with fury on Wednesday to a visit by a delegation of US lawmakers to Taiwan.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its territory. Taiwan’s foreign ministry confirmed the visit was arranged by the American Institute in Taiwan - Washington’s de facto embassy on the island - and said it would provide “necessary administrative assistance”.Beijing responded by saying the “risky and provocative actions” are “doomed to end in failure”. “Colluding with Taiwan independence forces is a dangerous game and playing with fire will result in burning themselves,” said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a press briefing, calling the visit a “clumsy performance”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ready-to-work-with-us-to-manage-differences-101636592112346.html

This is the fist visit of Afghan officials to Pakistan since the Sunni Pashtun group swept to power in Kabul.The Pakistan foreign ministry said that during the three-day visit, the focus will be on bilateral ties, with discussions to be held on enhancing trade, cross-border movement, land and aviation links, people-to-people contacts and regional connectivity. Muttaqi will also hold talks with Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi.The visit is taking place as a follow-up to Qureshi's visit to Kabul on October 21.It comes at a time when Pakistan is holding the Troika Plus meeting on Afghanistan with special representatives from China, Russia and the United States. The meeting is scheduled to be held on Thursday and Muttaqi is expected to meet the special representatives of these nations.The 20-member delegation being led by Muttaqi includes minister for finance Hidayatullah Badri, minister for industries and trade Nooruddin Aziz and senior officials from the aviation ministry.Pakistan has been trying to convince the world to diplomatically engage with the Taliban since they seized power in Afghanistan on August 15. However, no country has officially recognised the government in Afghanistan.At a meeting of top security officials held in India on Wednesday, discussions were held on the evolving situation in Afghanistan, especially the security situation and its regional and its global ramifications. The meeting was chaired by National Securoty Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval and attended by NSAs and secretaries of security councils of seven countries - Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan besides Russia and Iran.They later released a consensus statement, which emphasised on maintaining the territorial integrity of Afghanistan and was against interference from outside powers - a clear message to Pakistan - and called for a collective cooperation against the menace of radicalisation and extremism in the region. The NSAs also suggested to the Taliban that Afghanistan should have an independent and an inclusive regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-minister-muttaqi-in-islamabad-for-talks-as-pak-hosts-meet-on-afghanistan-101636589607792.html
11-11-2021||World||Astronauts suit up for planned SpaceX mission to International Space Station||The latest team of astronauts bound for the International Space Station, three from Nasa and a German crewmate, suited up for a planned liftoff atop a SpaceX rocket on Wednesday, despite rain and clouds at the Florida launch site that forecasters predicted would clear in time.The SpaceX-built launch vehicle, consisting of a Crew Dragon capsule perched atop a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, was set for liftoff at 9:03pm. (0200 GMT on Thursday) from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida.LIVE: Four astronauts are launching to the @Space_Station on @SpaceX's Crew Dragon!Our #Crew3 mission is scheduled to lift off from @NASAKennedy at 9:03pm ET (02:03 UTC Nov. 11). Watch with us and send your #askNASA questions: https://t.co/KZST234MYEIf all goes smoothly, the three US astronauts and a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut will arrive about 22 hours later and dock with the space station 250 miles (400 km) above the Earth to begin a six-month science mission aboard the orbiting laboratory.Intermittent showers and heavy clouds over the Cape on Wednesday cast renewed doubt on prospects for the launch proceeding as planned, although Nasa said its latest forecasts called for a 70 per cent chance of favorable weather conditions for liftoff. Commentators for NASA's live webcast of pre-launch activities said the weather was expected to clear sufficiently by launch time.A string of weather delays has confounded the mission since its original launch window on October 31. One postponement earlier this month was attributed to an astronaut's unspecified medical issue, which has since been resolved.Joining the SpaceX mission's Nasa astronauts – flight commander Raja Chari, 44, mission pilot Tom Marshburn, 61, and mission specialist Kayla Barron, 34 – is German astronaut Matthias Maurer, 51, an ESA mission specialist.After donning their helmeted white and black flight suits for the final checkout, they strolled out of the space center's operations building, waving to cheering loved ones and well-wishers. They were then escorted by assistants under umbrellas to three cars waiting to take them to the launchpad to board the Dragon capsule, dubbed Endurance.Chari, a US Air Force combat jet and test pilot, Barron, a US Navy submarine officer and nuclear engineer, and Maurer, a materials science engineer, are all making their debut spaceflights on the mission. The three rookies will become the 599th, 600th, and 601st humans in space, according to SpaceX.Both Chari and Barron were also among the first group of 18 astronauts selected last year for Nasa's upcoming Artemis missions to the moon.Marshburn, a physician and former Nasa flight surgeon, is the most experienced astronaut of the crew, having logged two previous spaceflights and four spacewalks. He was part of a 13-member team that helped assemble the space station in 2009 and returned to the orbiting outpost in a 2012-2013 mission.‘Crew 3’Wednesday's liftoff, if successful, would count as the fifth human spaceflight SpaceX has achieved to date, following its "Inspiration 4" launch in September that sent an all-civilian crew to orbit for the first time.The latest mission would mark the fourth crew Nasa has launched to orbit aboard a SpaceX vehicle in 17 months, building on a public-private partnership with the rocket company formed in 2002 by billionaire Elon Musk, also the founder of electric car maker Tesla Inc.Their collaboration helped usher in a new era for Nasa leading to last year's first launch of American astronauts from US soil in nine years, since it quit flying space shuttles in 2011.The team set for blastoff on Wednesday has been designated "Crew 3" - the third full-fledged "operational" crew Nasa and SpaceX have flown to the space station after a two-astronaut trial run in May 2020.The four astronauts of "Crew 2" safely returned to Earth late on Monday from a record 199 days in orbit, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico off Florida after an eight-hour voyage home from the space station.The latest mission also follows a flurry of recent high-profile astro-tourism flights. In July, two SpaceX rivals – Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic Holding Inc – launched back-to-back flights with their respective billionaire founders, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, riding along.Last month, 90-year-old actor William Shatner, famed for playing Captain James T Kirk in the original 1960s “Star Trek” TV series, rode aboard a Blue Origin rocket to become the oldest person to fly in space.Crew 3 will be welcomed aboard the space station by its three current occupants - two cosmonauts from Russia and Belarus and a US astronaut who shared a Soyuz flight to the orbiting platform earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astronauts-suit-up-for-planned-spacex-mission-to-international-space-station-101636587382145.html

11-11-2021||World||No shortage of differences, but only one way for climate cooperation: US, China in joint statement||China and the U.S. vowed to work together to slow global warming, issuing a surprise joint statement Wednesday that injects new momentum into the last days of global climate negotiations. The deal also marks a rare moment of cooperation between superpowers locked in geopolitical rivalry and who seemed at odds for most of the two-week talks in Glasgow, Scotland.The two sides agreed to boost their efforts to cut emissions, including by tackling methane and illegal deforestation, China’s special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua told reporters.  They will establish a working group to increase action in the 2020s — a key decade — which will meet in the first half of next year. His U.S. counterpart John Kerry said that the group will focus on “concrete” measures.As the world’s two major economies, “we need to work actively to address climate change,” Xi said. Kerry said that 'the U.S. and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate cooperation is the only way to get this job done.' The two spoke at separate press conferences, one after the other, with Xie going first. The announcement changed the mood in Glasgow, where negotiators are in the midst of fraught discussions over how to accelerate measures to curb the rise in global temperatures. It was a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and China that paved the way for the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015.'The big significance of this is geopolitical,” said Nick Mabey, co-founder of think tank E3G. “The U.S. and China have signaled they will end the wars of words that marred the past days.”The two countries reaffirmed the temperature goals of the Paris accord, which has a stretch target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and recognized there is a gap between current policies and what needs to be done, Xie said. Both are committed to pushing for a successful COP26, including agreements on climate finance and rules to create a global carbon market, he said.Still, China declined to join the global pledge being pushed by the U.S. and the European Union to cut methane emissions 30% by the end of the decade from 2020 levels. Xie said China will develop its own national plan. Kerry admitted that he had failed to get China to move its deadline for reaching peak emissions earlier from 2030. “We've peaked out on peaking,” he said. As the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, China can do more than any other country right now to help the world avoid the worst effects of global warming. But it argues that its plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 will already be the most ambitious emissions reduction ever attempted. The joint agreement comes ahead of a virtual summit likely to be held next week between Chinese President Xi Jinping — who skipped an in-person appearance at COP26 — and U.S. President Joe Biden. The leaders have held two phone calls alongside various lower-level meetings that the U.S. said were disappointing and lacked serious engagement from Chinese officials.The aim of the meeting is likely to be simply putting a floor under tensions over everything from tech to trade, human rights and the status of Taiwan. Xi wrote in a letter this week to the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations that China is ready to deepen ties with the U.S. and better manage their disputes. Both leaders have an incentive to put the relationship on a more even footing as they each focus on challenges at home, and climate matters are one of the few areas they can cooperate on. But the longer-term trajectory is still toward a collision between the world's two biggest economies as they jostle for both economic and strategic influence around the world.  “It can only be good news that the U.S. and China are working closely on climate change and slashing methane emissions,” said Bernice Lee, research director at Chatham House. “But the statement is not enough to close the deal. The real test of Washington and Beijing is how hard they push for a 1.5°C-aligned deal here in Glasgow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-shortage-of-differences-but-only-one-way-for-climate-cooperation-us-china-in-joint-statement-101636573880529.html
11-11-2021||World||HT This Day: Nov 11, 1938 - Maker of modern Turkey dead||Istanbul- Kemal Ataturk is dead.Earlier in the day it was officially stated that Kemal Ataturk was unconscious. A bulletin issued last night stated that the seriousness of his general condition had increased.Kemal Ataturk's adopted daughter and his sister were keeping constant watch in a near by room. There was grace concern among the entire Turkish people. Police patrols were strongly reinforced and precautionary measures taken.The Prime Minister, Bay Celal Bayar, arrived at the Palace yesterday evening, following an all night journey from Ankara.Kemal Ataturk had been very seriously ill nearly a fortnight back but he made a marvelous recovery and was considered to be out of danger. The illness, however, took a sudden turn for the worse two days back, and the end was not long in coming.It is officially announced that Kemal Ataturk died at 07-05 (G.M.T.). Under the constitution, the President of the National Assembly, Abdul Halikrenda, automatically assumed interim Presidency until a new President is elected.The National Assembly is meeting at -Ankara at 11 a.m. tomorrow in order to proceed immediately with the election. The most likely successor to the Presidency is General Ismet Ineunu, the 58-year-old ex-Premier, who has taken no part in public life since he resigned the Premiership last October. He collaborated closely with Kemal Ataturk for 13 years.Kemal Ataturk or Ghazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, as he was known earlier, was born in 1878 in comparatively modest circumstances in Salonika. His father was a customs officer who afterwards entered the timber trade and died when Mustafa was yet a small child. The boy was brought up and educated by his mother, a women at character and ability. He completed his primary education in Salonika and entered a secondary school in the same place; but, having been maltreated by his Arabic teacher he left school, against his family's wish and secretly entered the military preparatory school. There he proved to be an exceptional student, specially in mathematics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-nov-1938-maker-of-modern-turkey-dead-101636567284254.html
11-11-2021||World||US announces launch of global Covid-19 tracker portal||The US on Wednesday announced the launch of a publicly accessible and comprehensive global tracker of progress on battling Covid-19 - from hospitalisation to vaccination rates to vaccine donations pledged and delivered - to bring transparency and accountability to the fight.Accessible at covid19globaltracker.org, the site will be run by the WHO, WTO, IMF and the World Bank Group.“It will help provide two critical elements for stopping the pandemic - transparency, because we need a centralised source of data to stay ahead of Covid and accountability, because we all need to follow through on our commitments,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said, announcing the launch of the tracker, at a global meeting of foreign ministers on Covid-19.India was represented by foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla at the meet, which was held virtually.The tracker, which has gone live, says is goal it to measure progress towards the global targets for access to Covid-19 vaccines, treatments, tests, PPEs, other tools, and delivery of donor pledges. The listed targets were based on targets identified by the WHO’s ACT (Access to Covid-19 Tools) - A Strategic Plan & Budget, the Multilateral Leaders Task Force (comprising the IMF, WHO, WTO and the World Bank Group), the IMF’s Pandemic Proposal, and the Covid-19 summit hosted by US President Joe Biden in September, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders.Public health officials and experts around the world have pointed to the lack of transparency and accountability as a key driver of the pandemic from its start in China in November 2019 to its spread to every corner of the world, killing 5.08 million people.Blinken also announced a public-private partnership to support countries vaccinate their people. “Leading private sector companies will work pro bono to share their expertise and capabilities to support vaccination campaigns, taking on issues like managing supply chains and helping optimise vaccine sites to deliver shots as quickly and safely as possible,” he said.The third, and final, announcement Blinken made was about vaccinating people in regions and areas not accessible by governments, such as conflict zones. “I’m pleased to share that the United States has helped broker a deal between J&J and Covax (the WHO-run global effort towards equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines) to facilitate the first delivery of J&J vaccines to people living in conflict zones and other humanitarian settings.”This was the first meeting of foreign ministers on Covid-19, the secretary of state had pointed at the start of the ministerial, and the need for it was felt as one of the key learnings of dealing with the pandemic was that it cannot be left to only public health officials and experts.“This pandemic has taught us that preventing and responding to global health emergencies cannot be the responsibility only of health ministers or global health experts because a pandemic isn’t just a health crisis. It’s also a security crisis and economic crisis, a humanitarian crisis,” Blinken said, adding that he hoped several more would follow as part of an ongoing discussion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-launch-of-global-covid-19-tracker-portal-101636564583316.html
11-11-2021||World||Dialogue with Dalai Lama only about his future, not about Tibet: China||China on Wednesday said it was ready for dialogue with Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama but it would only be about his future and not about Tibet.The Chinese foreign ministry said the 14th Dalai Lama should stop activities aimed at splitting China and stop plotting and inciting violence.The ministry was responding to a question on the Dalai Lama telling an online forum that he had no particular plan to meet President Xi Jinping and whether Beijing was willing to resume dialogue with the Tibetan government-in-exile.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin called the government-in-exile an “out and out separatist political group”.“The so-called Tibetan government-in-exile is an out and out separatist political group. It is against China’s constitution and laws, it is an illegal organisation. No country in the world recognises it,” Wang said on Wednesday.“The central government in China, on engaging and discussing issues with the 14th Dalai Lama, the position is consistent and clear. The door to dialogue and engagement is open,” he said, before clarifying: “I would like to stress that the only matter that can be discussed is the future of the Dalai Lama himself, not to do anything with Tibet”.“What the Dalai Lama should do is to stop secessionist activities and take concrete measures to win the trust of the central government and the Chinese people,” Wang added.Speaking at an online forum, hosted in Tokyo, Dalai Lama, 86, on Wednesday criticised the leaders of China saying they “don’t understand the variety of different cultures” there and that there is too much control by the main Han ethnic group.A Reuters report from Tokyo quoted him as saying that he had nothing against “Chinese brothers and sisters” as fellow humans and he broadly supported the ideas behind Communism and Marxism.“Though the Dalai Lama said he had no plan to meet China’s leader, Xi Jinping, he said he would like to visit again to see old friends since ‘I am growing older’ - but would avoid Taiwan since relations between it and China are ‘quite delicate’,” the Reuters report said.“I prefer to remain here in India, peacefully,” he said.Wang’s mention about the Dalai Lama’s future comes in the backdrop of the issue of his succession.In May, China said it would choose the successor to the Dalai Lama through “drawing lots from the golden urn” with the candidate subject to the approval of the Communist Party China (CPC)-ruled central government.Citing historical precedence, a government policy paper on Tibet said the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas have been subjected to approval by the central government since an ordinance passed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 via northeastern India following a Chinese crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet.The Tibetan leader was granted political asylum in India and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dialogue-with-dalai-lama-only-about-his-future-not-about-tibet-china-101636543820288.html
11-11-2021||World||Canada’s NDP leader denies in talks with Trudeau for a coalition government||Canada’s New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh on Tuesday denied that he is discussing a potential coalition government along with Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau.While speculations of a deal between the two parties have been ongoing after Trudeau failed to secure a majority in the September general elections, Singh refuted those rumours.“There is no discussion at all of a coalition and that is a firm no for me. There’s not going to be any coalition at all,” the NDP leader said in Ottawa on Tuesday, according to the outlet National Post.However, he added, “We are prepared to make parliament work for Canadians.”Trudeau announced the full cabinet last month but the two parties have been in negotiations about an arrangement prior to parliament reconvening on November 22.Multiple media outlets have reported that they could agree to a “confidence and supply” deal, which would mean support from the NDP foe Liberal legislation in exchange for a minimum common agenda.Trudeau called snap elections in Canada on August 15, with the objective of securing a majority. However, his gamble to turning the minority into a majority failed when his party only secured 160 seats in the House of Commons in the elections, falling short by 10 seats. It will need outside support from other parties to pass bills.For the NDP, the outcome was similarly disappointing: it secured only 25 seats, gaining only one additional seat in the elections. Previously, when Trudeau ran his minority Government between 2019 and this year, the NDP often extended support to legislations, particularly when it came to Covid-19 benefits packages. However, there was no formal or informal arrangement between the two parties. That could change as talk continue.The possibility of an arrangement has attracted the criticism from the principal opposition party, the Conservatives. “The Liberals are planning to form a coalition with the NDP that will be a disaster for our economy. They’re united in the same high-tax, high-spending agenda,” Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole said on Twitter on Tuesday.NDP is the fourth-largest caucus in the House after the ruling party, the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-ndp-leader-denies-in-talks-with-trudeau-for-a-coalition-government-101636533499570.html
11-11-2021||World||China strengthens LAC facilities for soldiers before winter||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has strengthened facilities for its soldiers along the disputed border with India, ahead of winter, in anticipation of “small frictions”, a state media report said on Wednesday.Observers told state-run tabloid Global Times that although “large-scale clashes are unlikely to occur in winter, small frictions may happen from time to time” along the Sino-India border, making it necessary for the PLA to be ready.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border. Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Keeping in mind the possibility of a clash between India and China and the harsh winter conditions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the PLA has been focussing on streamlining the logistic supply lines, the report said. Other reports in China’s official military outlets also reported recently on the improvement of living conditions along the LAC so that PLA troops can remain stationed for prolonged periods at high altitudes during the winter, especially when temperatures drop sharply to well below zero.Last week, the PLA Daily reported that personnel assigned to a brigade under the PLA Xinjiang Military Command, which carried out training on the snow-capped plateau at an elevation of 5,300 metres, have received new types of tactical vests.“The materials used for the vest can resist strong wind and keep the soldiers warm in freezing conditions, and the embedded quick-slip device enables the soldiers to quickly escape from danger at critical moments,” the report said.Another PLA Daily report said a type of balanced-air-pressure chamber for oxygen therapy was put into use for troops under the Hotan military sub-command of the PLA Xinjiang Military Command in mid-October.Portable oxygenators, oxygen chambers and individual oxygen supply devices have also been deployed for frontline troops.According to the Global Times report, “barracks on the high-altitude plateau are operated and heated with multiple energy sources such as coal, electricity and solar power”. A PLA border regiment commander quoted in the report said that all outposts are connected to the state power grid and have communication base stations.Separately, the PLA has also revealed that it conducted multiple drills on its western plateau over the past week.An artillery regiment, affiliated with the PLA Xinjiang Military Command, recently conducted a comprehensive, cross-day-and-night exercise in a high-altitude region, involving live-fire shooting of PCL-181 155mm self-propelled howitzers and PHL-11 122mm multiple rocket launchers. The drill tested the troops’ fire strike efficiency and combat capabilities under the harsh cold in plateau regions, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Saturday.In September, Chinese official media announced that both Xinjiang and Tibet, bordering India, will soon have 30 airports at the disposal of the Western Theatre Command (WTC) to facilitate the movement of PLA personnel.The WTC is the largest military command of the PLA and oversees the disputed border with India. While some of these airports have been built and are functional, the remaining are under construction.Among the three new airports to be built in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) are those at Lhunze county, Tingri county and Burang county, close to the border with India, official media had reported earlier this year.The opening of new routes and rapid construction of new airports come in the backdrop of the ongoing Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh.China is bolstering its presence all along the border with India, fortifying the remote regions by building critical civil-military dual use infrastructure like airports and railway routes.Former director general of military operations Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia (retd) said, “As long as the standoff continues and additional forces are deployed on both sides, the possibility of localised flare ups cannot be ruled out. Both armies are prepared for that, although there has been no escalation or flare up after the June 2020 Galwan Valley skirmish.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-pla-strengthens-facilities-at-lac-in-anticipation-of-small-frictions-101636530741401.html
11-11-2021||India||No evasion of duty on iron ore pellets: Centre to Supreme Court||Export of iron ore pellets are legal and export duty cannot be evaded by private firms when the levy has been fixed at zero, the Union government has submitted in the Supreme Court while seeking dismissal of two public interest litigations (PILs) that have alleged a scam in the overseas trade. Submitting its affidavit before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, the Union ministry of commerce and industry emphasised that export of iron ore subheading minerals, value-added products, including iron ore pellets and derivatives, are neither prohibited nor restricted under the foreign trade policy. “Further, the export of iron ore pellets is not required to be canalized through state trading enterprises (STEs) under the prevailing rules. Therefore, the position is clear that iron ore pellets are not listed in either of the three regulated entities (prohibited, restricted or through STEs), which also clearly shows that as per foreign trade policy, trade-in iron ore pellets are free,” said the affidavit. It pointed out that iron ore pellets have been subject to export duty from time to time and there was a duty of 5% on its export between January 2014 and January 2016. “Imposing export duty or removing it on any class of commodity is a policy decision and such decisions have been taken by the Government of India from time to time. The rate of the export or import duty on a product or commodity is based on various factors which are taken into account keeping in mind the avowed objective of boosting international trade and commerce, particularly exports which are essential for earning foreign exchange” stated the government. The affidavit called the charge of evasion of duty “misleading”, saying that there was no export duty on iron ore pellets between 2011 and January 2014 when a decision was taken to impose a levy of 5%. “Similarly, after January 2016 there is no export duty on iron ore pellets. The imposition of export duty on any commodity or class of commodities is a public policy decision and such decisions have been taken by the Government of India from time to time,” it added. Advocate petitioner ML Sharma and NGO Common Cause have filed separate PILs in the top court, alleging duty evasion by several private firms in exporting iron ore in the form of pellets. The petitions have contended that a 30% export duty has been levied to discourage the export of iron ore, but companies are exporting iron ore in the form of pellets to avoid the duty. Further, the pleas claimed that the companies used the wrong Harmonized System (HS) code to evade the lawful levy of 30%, and alleged that the governmental authorities acted in cahoots, leading to a severe loss of public money. Sharma’s petition has demanded an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into such exports while making 61 iron exporting firms, including Essar Steel and Jindal Steel & Power, as parties to his plea. On Thursday, both the petitions came up for hearing but had to be adjourned to November 26 since the government’s affidavit was not received by the petitioners. The affidavit, reviewed by HT, has also drawn a the distinction between iron ore lumps and fines, and iron ore pellets, saying they were allotted different HS codes because the former was a by-product while the latter was a manufactured product. According to the government, the petitioners have tried to mislead the top court by mixing up the two in making accusations of evasion duty in exports. “The petitioner is intentionally misleading the honourable court by saying that export of iron ore fines public lumps about 64%-72% Fe (iron) is being done in the guise of pellets,” added the affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evasion-of-duty-on-iron-ore-pellets-centre-to-supreme-court-101636654299826.html

Defence spokesperson said that joint operation was launched in Chawalgam, Kulgam Thursday afternoon, based on specific inputs.The operation soon turned into an encounter which was still underway as more than couple militants are hiding in a house that has been encircled by the troops.  “As the cordon was laid and contact established. Terrorists opened fire forcing Security Forces to retaliate.Firefight ensued. The operation is in progress,” said the defence spokesperson.A senior police officer said that one terrorist has been killed in the operation. “We have reports two to three militants at the encounter spot.”A police official said the identity and group affiliation of the slain ultra was being ascertained.The Jammu & Kashmir Police said they “neutralised” 17 terrorists in 10 encounters in the Valley in October. Some of these terrorists were allegedly either involved or were collaborators in the civilian killings. The slain terrorists included two Lashkar-e-Taiba-linked district commanders who were allegedly involved in the civilian killings.Meanwhile, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has decided to send additional troops to Kashmir in the wake targeted terror attacks that left 13 civilians dead in the region since October, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday. Five companies – approximately 500 personnel – will be rushed to the Valley for deployment mainly in Srinagar city in addition to 25 companies of the force sent last month, people said.Last month, Union home minister Amit Shah visited Jammu and Kashmir, first time after the revocation of Article 370, to review the security situation amid a wave of targeted terrorist attacks on civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-shot-dead-in-kulgam-encounter-jkpolice-101636653879969.html
11-11-2021||India||List of 96 countries that recognise Indian vaccine certificates to grow: MEA||NEW DELHI: India has agreements with 96 countries for mutual recognition of vaccination certificates for individuals vaccinated with nationally recognised or World Health Organization (WHO)-recognised Covid-19 vaccines and the list is set to grow following the global health body’s approval for Covaxin. The indigenously developed and manufactured Covaxin was accorded emergency use listing (EUL) by WHO on November 3. Covaxin and Covishield, the Indian variant of the AstraZeneca vaccine, are the two main jabs used in the country’s immunisation programme.“We feel that this should ease international travel of those vaccinated with Covaxin. Many countries recognise WHO-approved vaccines. Now, with Covaxin joining this list, that should become automatic,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing. “Some countries had issued individual orders for individual vaccines, and they perhaps need to issue separate orders for Covaxin. We are taking up this matter with those countries,” he said. Certain countries also accorded national regulatory clearance to Covaxin even before the vaccine’s clearance by WHO, he pointed out.According to the external affairs ministry’s website, there are 96 countries in the “Category A” list, which includes countries “with which government of India has agreement for mutual recognition [of] vaccination certificate for individuals fully vaccinated with nationally recognised or WHO-recognised Covid-19 vaccines and those exempting Indian citizens fully vaccinated with nationally recognised or WHO-recognised vaccines”.The list includes the US, the UK, Australia, Bangladesh, Egypt, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Russia. Fully vaccinated citizens of these 96 countries can enter India without quarantine, Bagchi said.Responding to a question on India’s “Vaccine Maitri” initiative, Bagchi said the country resumed overseas supplies of Covid-19 vaccines while keeping domestic requirements in mind. Some shipments of vaccines have taken place, and others were in the pipeline, including through the WHO-backed COVAX facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/list-of-96-countries-that-recognise-indian-vaccine-certificates-to-grow-mea-101636653099618.html

We have taken samples of close contacts and got fogging and anti-larva spray done in the vicinity of their homes. More sampling will be done,” said Dr KP Tripathi, the official in charge of vector-borne disease control in Lucknow.One patient is a 30-year-old man residing in the Hussainganj area of Lucknow. The other is a 24-year-old woman from the Krishnanagar area on Kanpur Road in the state capital. The man had a fever for one day. Their samples were taken during random testing. “We have isolated both the patients and also asked their family members to remain at home. The neighbours in a 50-metre area have been educated about preventive measures. Tomorrow (Friday) morning, we will further check people in a 100-metre area and fogging will be repeated during the night,” said Dr Tripathi.Health department teams are tracing fever cases around the homes of the two patients. People have been asked to report any fever cases to the health department. Lucknow reported over 1100 dengue cases this year, around 700 of them since September 1.The first case of Zika virus infection in Uttar Pradesh was detected when an Indian Air Force (IAF) warrant officer tested positive in Kanpur on October 23, after which the Union health ministry had sent a high-level multidisciplinary team. Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes species of mosquito named Aedes aegypti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-two-zika-cases-reported-in-lucknow-101636652559677.html
11-11-2021||India||'Congress responsible for partition': Owaisi amid 'Jinnah' row||All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday said the Partition did not happen due to Muslims but because of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, as he challenged the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Samajwadi Party leaders who “don't read” to prove otherwise.Owaisi also held the Congress responsible for the Partition which divided the country into two independent dominions –  India and Pakistan –  in 1947.“I challenge people of RSS, BJP & SP who don't read. Partition didn't happen due to Muslims but due to Jinnah. At that time,only those Muslims could vote who were influential,nawabs or degree holders. Congress & leaders of that time were responsible for partition,” news agency ANI quoted Owaisi as saying while addressing an event in Uttar Pradesh.Owaisi's remark came a day after the Samajwadi Party's ally in Uttar Pradesh –  Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party –  stoked a controversy after the party's chief said there would have been “no partition” had Mohammed Ali Jinnah been made the first Prime Minister of India."Had Jinnah been made the first Prime Minister of India, the country's partition wouldn't have happened. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is responsible for India's partition and not Jinnah. The state of dispute was created by the Sangh itself," SBSP chief OP Rajbhar said in Varanasi on Wednesday.Also read | BJP, SP trying to give communal colour to UP polls, says MayawatiThe Samajwadi Party and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party entered into an alliance ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due early next year.Earlier, Akhilesh Yadav, the Samajwadi party supremo, made headlines for speaking about Jinnah in the same breath as Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru as freedom fighters."Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle," Yadav said on Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's 146th birth anniversary on October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-responsible-for-partition-owaisi-amid-jinnah-row-101636649100976.html

11-11-2021||India||Another actor-turned-politician quits Bengal BJP; selection process draws flak||Seven months after she was inducted by the Bharatiya Janata Party and fielded in the March-April Bengal assembly polls against Trinamool Congress secretary general Partha Chatterjee, who won, popular Bengali actor Shrabanti Chatterjee announced on Twitter on Thursday that she was quitting the party.Her decision instantly triggered a debate in the Bengal BJP, with several leaders questioning the induction of actors prior to the polls. Before the elections -- in which the BJP secured only 77 of the state’s 294 assembly seats against a target of 200 -- more than a dozen television and movie personalities with no political background joined the saffron camp. The TMC, which started the trend before 2011, also fielded several actors and artists but ended the race with 213 seats. The only actor who brought success to the BJP is Hiranmay Chattopadhyay, popularly known as Hiran, who wrested the Kharagpur Sadar seat. “Severing all ties with the BJP, the party for which I fought the last state elections. Reason being their lack of initiative and sincerity to further the cause of Bengal...,” tweeted Chatterjee. She was not seen in any BJP programme after the poll results were announced on May 2. She lost from Behala West by 50,884 votes while the TMC leader recorded his fifth consecutive victory from the seat since 2001. With TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh claiming that more celebrities who had joined the BJP will follow suit “because the party’s organisation in Bengal is collapsing,” the state’s BJP leaders expressed doubts about the pre-poll inductions.Many accused the party’s central leaders such as national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya in whose presence Chatterjee joined the BJP in March. Head of the BJP’s national information and technology cell, Amit Malviya, and the then state president Dilip Ghosh were also present that day. Vijayvargiya and Malviya were put in charge of Bengal during the polls. Vijayvargiya has not visited Bengal since May. The most vocal among the critics is former BJP state president Tathagata Roy, a retired technocrat who earlier served as Governor of Tripura and Meghalaya. “I didn’t even know that Shrabanti was still in the BJP. This is good riddance. The party is in this position today because of leaders like Vijayvargiya. They are answerable for random induction of these actors. A huge sum of money was given to each of them towards election expenditure. I will not reveal the amount,” Roy, who has raised his voice against a section of central and state BJP leaders in recent months, said. Vijayvargiya could not be contacted despite efforts. The celebrities are not the only ones who are a cause of worry for the state BJP leaders. Though the BJP captured 77 seats, its tally in the assembly has now effectively come down to 70. Five BJP legislators have joined the TMC since June although none have resigned from the party yet. After wresting the Santipur and Dinhata seats from the BJP last month and retaining Samserganj and Jangipur in September, the ruling party now officially controls 217 of Bengal’s 294 constituencies. The BJP also has many TMC turncoats who could not win seats. Among them, Rajib Banerjee, a former minister, returned to the ruling party on October 31. “I am repentant and ashamed. I was made to believe that BJP would usher in development and progress. I do not want people to make the same mistake and regret,” he said while switching allegiance for the second time in 10 months. “We don’t want anyone to leave. Shrabanti can return if she wants to. However, it is time to review the selection process,” Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said on Thursday. BJP’s state president Sukanta Majumdar said the actor’s exit was of no consequence as she was a not an organiser or mass leader. “Several people who came to the BJP from other fields are facing professional crisis because they are not being hired. Rudranil Ghosh, despite being a proficient actor, has no work since one year,” said Majumdar, indirectly hinting at the TMC’s influence over the local movie industry. “This is a baseless allegation. People in our industry are not hired because of their political background,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and actor Nusrat Jahan. Ghosh, who unsuccessfully contested the Bhawanipore seat in south Kolkata in the March-April polls, was not available for his reaction. Bengal BJP leaders said several popular actors such as Shrabanti Chatterjee, Payel Sarkar, Tanushree Chakraborty and Yash Dasgupta distanced themselves from the party after failing to win seats. Two actors, Rupa Bhattacharjee and Anindya Banerjee, left in August. Former actor Joy Banerjee, who joined the BJP years ago and was a member of the state committee, had quit earlier this week. BJP’s biggest loss was the exit of Babul Supriyo. The Bollywood singer-turned politician, who won the Asansol Lok Sabha seat twice and served as Union minister of state for two terms, joined the TMC last month. Only two actor-turned-politicians, who joined the BJP in 2015, have risen in the hierarchy. They are Roopa Ganguly and Locket Chatterjee. Ganguly, who became nationally famous after playing the role of Draupadi in the television series Mahabharat in the 1980s, is now a Rajya Sabha member. She also won national awards for her movies. Chatterjee represents the Hooghly Lok Sabha seat. Both earlier headed the state Mahila Morcha, the BJP women’s wing. BJP Lok Sabha member and state vice-president Arjun Singh feels that high expectations drive actors. “Most people who come from the movie industry expect instant success and get disillusioned when their expectations are not met. These people thought we would come to power and now they want to leave. We must review the method of selecting people,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-actor-turned-politician-quits-bengal-bjp-selection-process-draws-flak-101636648360621.html
11-11-2021||India||‘Shouldn’t stop political party from campaigning’: SC orders Tripura on TMC plea||NEW DELHI: No political party should be prevented from campaigning and pursuing its electoral rights, said the Supreme Court on Thursday as it directed the Tripura government to make all arrangements to maintain law and order to allow all political parties in the fray to have an unimpeded right to campaign peacefully ahead of the ensuing municipal elections in the state.The order came on a petition filed by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) led by Mamata Banerjee that is contesting elections for one municipal corporation seat, 13 municipal council and 6 Nagar Panchayat seats to be held on November 25. Tripura is presently ruled by Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).The TMC complained that incidents of violence have been reported against the political party in the state since August, and now the party was prevented from holding rallies and mass contact programmes by the police on the ground of possible mischief by opposition parties.Dealing with the issue, a bench headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud issued notice and said, “Since the election process has commenced, it is the bounden obligation of the respondents (state government and police) to ensure that no political party which is in the fray is prevented from pursuing its electoral rights in accordance with law and from campaigning in a peaceful and orderly manner.”Posting the matter for November 25, the bench also comprising of justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath said, “We direct the respondents, by way of an ad-interim order (passed without hearing the other side), to duly consider the grievance so that appropriate arrangements are made to ensure the maintenance of law and order in a manner that would further the unimpeded right of political participation in the course of the ensuing municipal elections.”Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament Sushmita Dev, who recently quit the Congress to join Trinamool Congress, was also a petitioner in the plea filed by the political party.Senior advocate Gopal Shankararnaraynan appearing for the two petitioners informed the court that in September, the police denied them permission to hold a massive rally and now less than two weeks were left for the elections. He further stated that the party members and workers associated with MP Sushmita Dev apprehended a threat to their lives.The court directed the superintendents of police concerned who are party to the petition to ensure protection to TMC workers having regard to the threat perception and take necessary action for the maintenance and provision of security.The court held, “Necessary arrangements shall be put into place and appropriate action taken by the Secretary to the Department of Home Affairs of the Government of Tripura as well as by the Director-General of Police, together with the law enforcement machinery of the State to enforce and comply with this order.”By the next date of hearing, the court directed the state government to file an affidavit detailing steps taken pursuant to the Court order to ensure the ensuing municipal polls remain free and fair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shouldnt-stop-political-party-from-campaigning-sc-orders-tripura-on-tmc-plea-101636648359343.html
11-11-2021||India||To ensure 100% coverage, Assam govt to begin door-to-door vaccination drive||The Assam government will undertake a door-to-door campaign to ensure 100% coverage of the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, between November 22 and 27.The state has so far vaccinated more people than the others; in terms of first dose coverage the state’s figures of 79% correspond to the national average. On Thursday, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma who is in Delhi, said that a special drive will be conducted across all 42,000 polling booths in the state between November 22 and 27 where healthcare workers will visit each household to inoculate those left behind. “The vaccination will be carried out on November 22 and 23, then the entire paperwork will be done; by November 29 we will have certificates issued by a gazetted officer on the first dose coverage and in the next three months a similar drive will be carried out for the second dose coverage. By February we will have certificates for the second dose as well,” he said.The CM and the legislators will be assigned districts where they will visit polling booths as part of the vaccination drive. “I will be visiting one of the polling booths, all the other MLAs will also be assigned districts in constituencies other than the one which they represent,” Sarma said. On whether the government has come across cases of vaccine hesitancy, the chief minister said more or less all communities have been forthcoming, only some pregnant women have shown reluctance to take the jab. The authorities have already cleared pregnant women for getting the jab. Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week launched the month-long Har Ghar Dastak or knock on every door campaign to carry out a special drive to focus on people who have not been vaccinated so far.In a meeting with chief ministers the Prime Minister also referred to countering vaccine hesitancy by roping in religious leaders. He made a specific mention of his meeting with Pope Francis in Vatican City and emphasised how religious heads could play a significant role in addressing vaccine hesitancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-ensure-100-coverage-assam-govt-to-begin-door-to-door-vaccination-drive-101636645527312.html

Salman Khurshid’s new book titled Sunrise over Ayodhya sparked controversy after a paragraph making such a comparison was shared on social media.In his book on Ayodhya verdict, the former Union minister has opined that classical Hinduism was being pushed aside by a “robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years.” ISIS and Boko Haram are the dreaded terrorist groups that aim to establish a Caliphate and impose their harsher interpretation of Sharia law."We may not agree with Hindutva as a political ideology but comparing it with ISIS and jihadist Islam is factually wrong and exaggeration," ANI quoted Ghulam Nabi Azad as saying.Like no one killed Jessica, nobody demolished Babri Masjid: Chidambaram at Salman Khurshid's book launch eventTwo Delhi lawyers have filed complaints with the Delhi Police against Salman Khurshid for allegedly defaming Hindutva. One of the lawyers, Vivek Garg, said in the complaint that the comparison “reflects the true mindset of Congress as they try to legitimise the radical elements of ISIS by creating an artificial equivalence with Hindus.” Another complaint called the statement “quite aggravating and defamatory” for the whole Hindu community.Speaking at the book launch on Wednesday, Congress leader P Chidambaram said that the developments after the Ayodhya verdict took a “predictable course” as all accused were acquitted “within a year or so.”“So like no one killed Jessica, nobody demolished Babri Masjid," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghulam-nabi-azad-disagrees-with-khurshid-s-comparison-of-hindutva-with-jihadist-islam-calls-it-exaggeration-101636644651296.html

The deteriorating socio-economic situation in Afghanistan and the need to provide urgent humanitarian aid to the Afghan people was a key part of the declaration issued after a regional security conference hosted by India on Wednesday. The meet was joined by top security officials of seven countries, including Iran and Russia. India’s efforts to provide relief materials to the Afghan people in recent weeks, including an offer to supply 50,000 tonnes of wheat, have been held up by Pakistan’s refusal to allow the use of its territory for transporting the aid. The Delhi Regional Security Dialogue, which was attended by the security tsars of Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, held detailed discussions on the “very serious humanitarian situation in Afghanistan”, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. Several other multilateral meetings too had sought unimpeded and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance providers, he told a regular news briefing. “We have been looking at possibilities, but there have been difficulties due to lack of unimpeded access,” Bagchi said, without naming Pakistan or giving details. The situation on the ground “has become very difficult over the last few months since the transition” in Afghanistan, he added, referring to Taliban takeover in Kabul in August. Pakistan, Bagchi said, was invited to the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue and its decision “not to participate in such an important meeting reflects their attitude towards the issue of Afghanistan”. China too was invited but couldn’t attend for scheduling reasons, he said. Bagchi said the regional conference had achieved consensus on many issues, and this was reflected in the Delhi Declaration issued after the meeting. The top security officials of the eight countries had discussed ways to counter terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, how to bring in an inclusive governance system and ways to meet humanitarian needs. “India’s support to the people of Afghanistan is very clear. It is a people-led interaction and involvement with that country. We have been extending support for many years for the people of Afghanistan,” he said. During both the regional conference and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval’s meetings with his regional counterparts, “there was clearly concern over the looming humanitarian situation”, Bagchi said. All regional countries were on the same page on the humanitarian situation and “their determination to see that assistance is provided”, he said. “I hope this joint call by so many national security heads would spur movement on the ground,” he added. A UN assessment conducted last month stated that the shocks of drought, conflict, Covid-19 and an economic crisis have left more than half Afghanistan’s population facing a record level of acute hunger. It found that more than one-in-two Afghans will face “emergency levels of acute food insecurity” from November through March, requiring an urgent global response to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humanitarian-aid-for-afghanistan-being-held-up-by-lack-of-unimpeded-access-india-101636643368341.html

Police said they did not have any identification papers on them and were detained.During their initial questioning at the Bazarichara police station, the couple told the police that they crossed into Tripura a few days back and were on their way to Guwahati for the final leg of their journey to West Bengal’s Murshidabad 1,200km away where they hoped to make a fresh start; find themselves jobs or maybe, even start a small business.“They said they got married recently and were looking for better opportunities. They decided to move to India so that they both get themselves jobs, or start some business,” Karimganj superintendent of police (SP) Padmanabh Baruah said.Karimganj and Cachar districts of Assam also share a border with Bangladesh but local police officers said this part of the border, also guarded by the Border Security Force like the rest of the Indio-Bangladesh wasn’t porous.Baruah said the couple has been booked under the Foreigners Act under provisions that outlaws foreigners from entering the country illegally.Police officers said 10 Bangladeshi nationals who illegally entered the country from neighbouring Tripura and were headed to south India were intercepted by the Assam police over the last month.Baruah said the district police was still investigating the couple’s version and will look into all possible angles. “In other cases too, we have heard similar stories,” he said.The police officer said the couple has spoken of organised gangs that help them cross the Bangladesh border and take the bus out of Tripura. “These cases are increasing and we are going to strengthen the checking procedure at inter-state border check posts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newlywed-bangladeshi-couple-crossed-border-for-a-better-life-arrested-cop-101636643367012.html

Registered buyers have been directed to avoid blending imported tea of inferior quality with teas from these regions.“In view of teas of inferior qualities being imported & blended with teas from Darjeeling, Kangra, Assam (Orthodox) & Nilgiri (Orthodox), it's directed that henceforth no registered buyers of teas shall blend any ported tea with teas aforementioned regions from today,” a notice released by the board says."All importers have been directed to ensure that the origin of imported tea is mentioned in all their sale invoices and not to pass off imported tea as teas of Indian origin," the commerce ministry said. The board warned that failure to abide by these instructions “will invite action as deemed fit”.Besides this, manufacturers of Darjeeling tea have been directed not to purchase green leaf from the outside GI (geographical indication) area. Darjeeling Tea, along with Kangra Paintings, Tirupati Laddu, Nagpur Orange and Kashmir Pashmina have registered GIs, to convey an assurance of quality and distinctiveness that is typical of its area of origin.The chairman of Tea Board of India, PK Bezboruah, had earlier raised an alarm over cheap imported tea from Nepal, Vietnam, Indonesia being blended with homegrown teas, which brings down the quality and the price of domestic teas. Data collected by the board showed that tea imports increased by 34 per cent during January-August this year compared to the same time last year.The commerce ministry has started conducting surprise checks to ensure registered buyers abide by their orders. "Surprise check of three units in Siliguri was conducted on November 11, and samples were drawn for testing," the ministry said.A majority of the blended teas currently available in the market is actually for re-exports, since custom duty is not charged on tea imports meant for re-exports, however, a certain percentage also gets absorbed in the domestic market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-takes-steps-to-curb-blending-of-inferior-quality-imported-tea-with-premium-indian-teas-101636641178737.html

He noted that Pakistan had denied permission for visits by Indian Sikh pilgrims twice in June this year – on the occasion of the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev and on the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh – even though both were covered under the 1974 bilateral protocol on visits to religious shrines. “We hope that the [visit by the] forthcoming jatha...does take place,” Bagchi said. Referring to the cross-border Kartarpur Corridor, which was opened in 2019 to allow Indian citizens visa-free access to the gurdwara at Kartarpur in Pakistan where Guru Nanak spent the last years of his life, Bagchi said movement through the corridor was suspended in March 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Land travel between India and Pakistan is since being conducted on a limited scale through the Attari-Wagah integrated check post in coordination with the Pakistani side. Either side follows its extant rules and health guidelines,” he said. The planned visit by the 1,500 pilgrims for Gurupurab is covered under the 1974 bilateral protocol. The pilgrims are scheduled to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Gurdwara Dera Sahib, Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib and Gurdwara Sachha Sauda. Visits by pilgrims from both sides have been hit by a downturn in bilateral relations over the past few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hopes-pakistan-will-allow-visit-by-1-500-pilgrims-for-gurupurab-101636640066760.html

The villagers killed two foxes after the incident. Locals recounted that a pack of around 20 foxes attacked villagers at Hardamnagar early on Thursday morning. The injured villagers have been admitted to Harishchandrapur Rural Hospital for vaccination and treatment. “We haven’t seen so many foxes in our village earlier. This morning suddenly 20-odd foxes attacked many villagers-completely unprovoked. We have no idea where the animals came from,” said Bani Chowdhury, a resident of Hardamnagar. After the villagers raised an alarm the animals were chased away. However, two of the foxes were beaten to death. “Around 40 people have been injured. We have set up a special camp for the treatment of the injured villagers. They have been administered vaccines and medicine. The injury of around 15 villagers is very serious. We may have to shift them to Chanchol Hospital,” said Dr Choton Mondal, medical officer of Harishchandrapur Rural Hospital. An officer of the Harishchandrapur police station said that there is a wooded area near the village. The animals may have come from there. “We have informed the forest officials.

11-11-2021||India||India has not accepted China's illegal occupation or unjustified claims: MEA||The ministry of external affairs on Thursday said India has neither accepted the illegal occupation of Indian territory by China nor China's unjustified claims. "China has undertaken construction activities in the past several years along the border areas, including in the areas that it has illegally occupied over decades. India has neither accepted such illegal occupation of our territory nor has it accepted the unjustified Chinese claims," ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.New Delhi has always conveyed strong protest to such activities via diplomatic means and will continue to do so in future, the ministry said adding that the government has also stepped up border infrastructure, including the construction of roads, bridges which have provided much-needed connectivity to the local population along the border.‘Shows their attitude’: India criticises Pakistan's decision to skip NSA-level Summit on Afghanistan"The government is committed to the objective of creating infrastructure along border areas for improvement of livelihood, including in Arunachal Pradesh. The government keeps a constant watch on developments having bearing on India's security and takes all measures to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.The MEA statement comes after a Pentagon report claimed that China has built a village along the Line of Actual Control in the Arunachal Pradesh sector.China built village in area held by PLA for decades, say officials"Beginning in May 2020, PLA launched incursions into customarily Indian-controlled territory across the border and has concentrated troops at several standoff locations along LAC. In addition, a substantial reserve force from Tiben and Xinjiang military districts were deployed to the interior of western China to provide a rapid response," the Pentagon report said.The report said that this new village built last year is in a disputed area along the Tsari river. "Sometimes in 2020, the PRC built a large 100-home civilian village inside disputed territory between the PRC's Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Arunachal Pradesh state in the eastern sector of the LAC. These and other infrastructure development efforts along the India-China border have been a source of consternation in the Indian government and media," the Pentagon report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-not-accepted-china-s-illegal-occupation-or-unjustified-claims-mea-101636635595142.html

In an apparent reference to Pakistan, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular press briefing that there have been difficulties in providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan due to a lack of unimpeded access.The spokesperson highlighted that India has been extending support to Afghanistan for many years but the situation on the ground has become “very difficult” over the last few months.“One of the key elements which we've seen in previous meetings was the need for unimpeded, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance providers...There have been difficulties due to lack of unimpeded access,” Bagchi added.He said that the “very serious humanitarian situation” in Afghanistan was discussed at length during the meeting of NSAs of eight regional countries, including India, Russia, and Iran.Also Read | India has not accepted China's illegal occupation or unjustified claims: MEAPakistan and China were invited for an NSA-level summit on the Afghanistan issue but they chose not to attend citing different reasons.

According to Uttarakhand state in-charge and national spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary, the Samajwadi Party will position itself as a viable, reliable and development-oriented political option for the voters in the hill state. The Samajwadi Party is currently focussing on party workers, booth management, membership drives and is also organising district headquarters, tehsil, block and panchayat level meetings. In both Kumaon and Garhwal divisions, the SP in the coming days will hold conventions and chalk out poll strategy with senior party leaders and organisational office bearers to address the party workers. Citing resentment among voters against the BJP-led Central and state government, Chaudhary said in the name of double engine governance, the BJP had misled the people, failing to usher in development despite having a five-year term in the hill state. “What has BJP done for Uttarakhand, apart from changing 3 chief ministers in four and half years? Mahakumbh fake testing scam, factionalism within the party, differences among cabinet ministers and legislators, corruption and lucrative poll announcements by current CM Pushkar Singh Dhami are some of them. Just less than five months are left but CM Dhami is making announcements which will leave the state exchequer in debt,” said Chaudhary, who is a former UP cabinet minister. On the Samajwadi Party’s election focus, BJP district president Jaypal Singh Chauhan said that in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi party is afraid of CM Yogi Adityanath while in Uttarakhand it is afraid of Pushkar Singh Dhami owing to his popularity, corruption-free governance and mass appeal of both the CMs. “Even if they get 70 deserving candidates it will be a herculean task to win a single assembly seat. In the past 21 years of state formation with four assembly elections held so far, they haven’t won a single seat. So, claims are easy to make. But the fact is, Samajwadi party has no base in the state,” said the BJP district president. Congress state vice president Suryakant Dhasmana said voters have already made up their mind to bring Congress back to power in Uttarakhand. “There is no scope of any other party becoming a political option for voters barring Congress in the state,” he said. Apart from the BJP and Congress, other parties like Bahujan Samaj Party, Uttarakhand Kranti Dal, Aam Aadmi Party and Lok Jan Shakti Party had also earlier announced that their candidates will contest on all 70 assembly segments in the next election. Uttarakhand Kranti Dal president Kashi Singh Airi has said that already his party has mobilised its workers in both the Kumaon and Garhwal division of the state. This means UKD will also field its candidates in the plains of Udham Singh Nagar, Haridwar and Dehradun. The Bahujan Samaj Party on the other hand has decided to contest independently in the 2022 assembly elections without entering into any alliance. BSP state unit president Naresh Gautam said that in both UP and Uttarakhand there is anti-incumbency and voters realise that only the BSP can provide a strong, secular and development-oriented government. The Aam Aadmi Party has also announced that it will contest all the assembly segments in the hill state. Rashtriya Lok Dal national secretary and Uttarakhand in-charge Braham Singh Baliyan said that the party has a major chance of making an entry and finding a foothold in the hill state so it is preparing to contest all seventy seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-to-contest-all-70-seats-in-uttarakhand-assembly-for-2022-polls-101636633346282.html

Posting the copy of the legal notice on Twitter, Amruta Fadnavis warned Malik to either delete the tweets in 48 hours with an “unconditional apology or face action”.The NCP leader, currently a minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, had accused Fadnavis and his wife of having close links with an alleged drug dealer, Jaydeep Rana. Malik had shared pictures of Amruta and Rana together at an event. Amruta has defended the photographs saying those were clicked during an organised in Mumbai for the conservation of rivers and Rana was hired by the creative team of the organisers.“The said event was organised by activists who has formed a social group under the name of 'River March' with an initiative to save the rivers of Mumbai...It is stated that Mr. Jaideep Rana was hired by the creative team of 'River March' and our client or her family had no association with him,” the notice reads.Amruta's lawyers alleged that Nawab Malik “consciously and selectively” shared those pictures which “reflects your malafide intentions to tarnish” her image.Also Read | 'Torture, financial loss': Nawab Malik's son-in-law sends legal notice to Fadnavis, demands ₹5 cr damagesThe legal notice was sent a day after Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan, now on bail in a drug-related case, sent a similar notice to Devendra Fadnavis for “mental torture, agony, financial loss and injury” inflicted to his reputation because of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader’s statement on a television channel.The allegations and counter-allegations were made after Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan, was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau in the drugs-on-cruise case.

The Bollywood actor's comments on the freedom movement have stirred a row as she said Congress is an extension of the British rule and India attained her 'real freedom' in 2014, apparently referring to the BJP coming to power in 2014. What India got in 1947 was 'bheek' (alms), the actor said."The RSS could never accept the fact that their British masters were forced to leave in 1947. Their slavery knew no bounds. No wonder they didn't hoist the tricolour for half a century. The return of slavery in 2014 was their 'independence'.

The bye-poll loss was a wake-up call.”Tagore said the scheme is not a favour to the public. “But unwantedly they stopped this scheme that was in favour of the public,” he said. He added the government should increase the amount paid under the scheme.Annadurai CN, a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam lawmaker, welcomed the decision but added the money granted under the scheme is insufficient. “There is a lot of work that needs to be done.”Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy said suspending the fund was a bad move and its restoration was long overdue.Tagore and Roy were among the vocal opponents of the suspension of the scheme in April last year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The funds were diverted to the finance ministry to deal with the pandemic.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the restoration of the scheme for the remaining part of the financial year till 2025-26, which will have a financial implication of ₹17,417 crore.Under the scheme, each MP will get ₹2 crore in one instalment for development activities for the remainder of 2021-22 and annually ₹5 crore thereafter. A Lok Sabha MP can use the fund in her constituency. Rajya Sabha members can fund any project in a state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-performance-in-bye-elections-prompted-govt-to-restore-mplads-congress-mp-101636624465134.html

Two Delhi lawyers Vivek Garg and Vineet Jindal have filed complaints with the Delhi Police against Salman Khurshid for allegedly defaming Hindutva.The book titled 'Sunrise Over Ayodhya' is on the Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. The book launch event was held on Wednesday and was attended by Congress leaders P Chidambaram, Digvijaya Singh among others."Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints were being pushed aside by a robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years," a chapter of the book titled 'The Saffron Sky' reads. Congress’s Salman Khurshid in his new book writes that Hindutva is similar to the jihadist Islamist groups like ISIS and Biko Haram.What else can we expect from someone whose party coined the term Saffron terror just to draw equivalence with Islamic jihad, to get Muslim votes? pic.twitter.com/3OikNQJ3qtIn the complaint, Vivek Garg said, "This reflects the true mindset of Congress as they try to legitimise the radical elements of ISIS by creating an artificial equivalence with Hindus. His statement printed in his book is itself self-explanatory and clearly discloses his commission of the cognizable offence. The language, intention of the said book authored by the alleged accused, is an open case of sedition, conspiracy to wage the war against India, promoting enmity between Hindus-Muslims, etc.""The contents of the statement made by the accused claim Hinduism to be equivalent to ISIS and Boko haram, which are terrorist groups. It is a quite aggravating and defamatory statement for the whole Hindu community and also questions their values and virtues about society. The equivalence of Hinduism to ISIS and Boko haram is perceived as a negative ideology Hindus have been following and Hinduism is violent, inhuman and oppressive," Jindal's complaint read.Speaking at the book launch, Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday said it is unfortunate that Hindutva and Hinduism have become synonymous. "Savarkar wasn't religious. He even asked why the cow is considered 'maata' and he had no problem in consuming beef. He brought 'Hindutva' word to establish Hindu identity which caused confusion in people," Digvijaya Singh said.Reacting to the controversy that his statement on Hindutva has kicked up, Khurshid said he praised Hinduism and Sanatan Dharma in his book. Hindutva is different from Hinduism, the writer has said.Madhya Pradesh minister Narottam Mishra said Salman Khurshid must have published the book to purposely create a controversy.  “They support politics of appeasement. Congress leaders and the Gandhi family are supporters of 'Tukde-Tukde' gang. They want the country to be divided on the basis of castes,” Mishra said.

She said the fear of being captured as prisoners of war (POW) should not be held against women.A third of the candidates appearing for the NDA examination on November 14 for entry into the premier joint services training institution are women, HT reported on October 30. A Supreme Court order on August 18 made women eligible to join NDA, which was a male preserve for almost seven decades. Women were allowed to serve in select branches of the army, IAF and navy as short-service commission officers three decades earlier. Front-line combat roles were off-limits to women until the government approved a 2015 IAF plan to induct them into the fighter stream. Warships, tanks, and combat positions in the infantry are still no-go zones for women. Navy has women as pilots and observers onboard its maritime reconnaissance aircraft, which is a combat role.Bandopadhyay, 77, who retired in 2005, said if women work hard and prove themselves, then nobody can stop them. “If I can do it, then anybody can do it. Whether you are a man or woman, all challenges that come your way need to be accepted. We are not posted in Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, or any of those big cities. We are in the periphery.”Also Read: ‘Feels like winning war,’ says one of 39 women Army officers who got permanent commissionBandopadhyay said women should not be afraid of tough field postings. She added there were three types of people that existed in the armed forces. Bandopadhyay said the first were the ones who “mollycoddled” women, the second thought they could do nothing and were useless, and the third accepted them and encouraged them to do better. She added this has stopped, and women are treated like any other officers.Bandopadhyay said when officers were held captive and mutilated during the Kargil war, did people talk about it? “Are they not human beings?” she said when asked about POW argument to keep women away from combat roles. “...both men and women can be held as POWs...everyone has to be prepared for it because it may or may not happen.”Bandopadhyay said comparisons between the opportunities women get in the American and Israeli militaries with India were not valid. “We are culturally different from these nations. Incorporating women in the force will take time but the move towards this has been made by allowing women cadets to join the NDA from 2023.”Bandopadhyay, a recipient of Param Vishisht Seva, Ati Vishisht, and Vishisht Seva medals who joined the IAF in 1968, was the second woman to be promoted to a three-star rank. She was also the first Indian woman to conduct scientific research at the North Pole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-of-getting-captured-as-pows-shouldn-t-be-held-against-women-padma-awardee-101636616664276.html

"The chargesheet filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau does not support even a single allegation levied by you. The Panchnama dated 14/01/2021 clearly says that the house was searched and no contraband/suspicious substance was found in my client's house or under his possession. But from which source you obtained such false, frivolous and baseless report is better known to you," the legal notice for defamation said.Commenting on the legal notice, Nawab Malik said, “My daughter has sent a legal notice to former CM and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis over his allegation that drugs were found at our residence.

11-11-2021||India||Central trade unions set to launch protests against monetisation pipeline||Ten central trade unions will be conducting a series of protests starting Thursday, ahead of their planned two-day nationwide strike during the Budget session of Parliament. The trade unions intending to hold the protests include the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), the Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (Citu), and the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC). The demonstrations and strikes are aimed at protesting the central government's decisions to fully or partially privatise the public sector units (PSUs) and the effect these moves will have on the working class in the country. However, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the labour union affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), will not be participating in the protests.According to a joint statement issued by the protesting trade unions, the demonstrations against the central government's disinvestment policy intend to make people aware of the “dangerous effects” of the move. The national convention of trade unions, which is to be held on Thursday, is the first in a series of demonstrations to reach out to the citizens of the nation, the unions said, adding that this will be followed by state-level conventions and protests all over India.As per a media report citing the statement issued by the trade unions, Thursday's national convention will be “followed by a two-day countrywide general strike during the Budget Session in 2022.” Meanwhile, November 26 has been fixed as the nationwide protest day, since the date marks the anniversary of the National General Strike of trade unions and the ‘Kisan March’ (farmers' foot march) to Delhi.The national monetisation pipeline (NMP), against which the 10 trade unions are protesting, is a scheme introduced by the central government to raise as much as $81 billion by leasing out state-owned infrastructure assets over the next four years. According to the Union ministry of finance, the NMP will help fund new capital expenditure without putting pressure on government finances. However, the trade unions call the plan a “destructive” and “nefarious design” to hand over public infrastructural assets to private hands at little to no cost.The unions had also marked protests against the monetisation pipeline policy earlier on October 7, when they alleged that the move announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is merely a scheme to hand government assets to private hands “virtually free”.Meanwhile, according to the government vision, NMP is envisaged to serve as a medium-term roadmap for identifying potential monetisation-ready projects, across various infrastructure sectors. The NMP has been prepared after insights, feedback, and experiences consolidated through multi-stakeholder consultations undertaken by Niti Aayog, the finance ministry, and the infrastructure line ministries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-trade-unions-set-to-launch-protests-against-monetisation-pipeline-101636595628388.html

Here's his story||When President Ram Nath Kovind conferred the Padma awards, among the highest civilian honours in India, one of the recipients was Lt Col Qazi Sajjad Ali Zahir - a former Pakistani soldier who risked his life by crossing over to India and helping liberate Bangladesh in the 1971 war. Although Lt Colonel Zahir's name went by largely under the radar all those years ago (owing to the confidential nature of military business), he was thrown into the spotlight this week when stepping onto the podium to receive the Padma Shri, a recognition of his contributions to the Indian intelligence and subsequently, the Bangladesh freedom movement.President Kovind presents Padma Shri to Lt Col Quazi Sajjad Ali Zahir (Retd.) for Public Affairs. He is an independent researcher and author on the Bangladesh Liberation War. He joined the War of Liberation and participated in many battles alongside the Indian Army. pic.twitter.com/xhuCupSCtoThat Lt Col Qazi Sajjad Ali Zahir risked his life to help India and the nascent Bangladesh is no understatement. As a 20-year-old officer posted in Sialkot, Lt Col Zahir crossed over to neighbouring India at the height of the Pakistani army's atrocities and human rights violations in Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).His troubles did not end even after he arrived in India, where he was naturally suspected of being a Pakistani spy and grilled by the border security force and later by senior officers of the Indian Army in Pathankot. However, after Lt Col Zahir presented a bunch of confidential documents of the Pakistani Army to back up his cause, he was sent to a safe house in Delhi, from where the Indian intelligence coordinated with him. Later, the former Pakistani soldier moved to Bangladesh, where he trained the Mukti Bahini (freedom fighters) in guerilla warfare to take on Pakistani forces.In fact, Lt Col Zahir's is a name that Pakistan continues to hate even today. According to the ex-military man, there's a death sentence pending in his name in Pakistan for the past 50 years. In Bangladesh, however, Lt Col Zahir has been honoured with gallantry medals such as the Bir Protik and the country's highest civilian honour, the Swadhinata Padak. Now India, too, has recognised his contributions to the military history of the subcontinent and conferred on him the Padma Shri.The Padma Awards are the highest civilian honours of India announced annually ahead of Republic Day. However, the award-giving ceremony was affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic this year.The Padma Awards are given in three categories: Padma Vibhushan (for exceptional and distinguished service), Padma Bhushan (distinguished service of higher-order) and Padma Shri (distinguished service). The award seeks to recognise achievements in all fields of activities or disciplines where an element of public service is involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/padma-shri-goes-to-ex-pak-soldier-who-helped-india-liberate-bangladesh-here-s-his-story-101636591175843.html

Under this campaign, the central government is aiming to ensure vaccination of all adults who have not received their first dose of the Covid jab yet or are overdue for their second dose.The virtual interaction is the continuation of the November 3 meeting that was held between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and health officials of more than 45 districts across 12 states with sluggish vaccination pace. During that meeting, the Prime Minister had hailed the hard work done by healthcare workers but warned against laxity. "The progress made so far is due to your hard work. Every member of administration, ASHA workers worked a lot. They walked for miles and took vaccination to remote locations. But if we become lax after one billion (doses), a new crisis can come," PM Modi had said.The central government had launched the month-long 'Har Ghar Dastak' campaign on November 2, to take the vaccination drive house-to-house to ensure maximum inoculation.According to the data by the Union health ministry, around 79.2 per cent of India's adult population has received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, while more than 37 per cent of the country's around 94 crore adult population has been administered both the doses.The top five states which have administered the highest number of doses include Uttar Pradesh. It is followed by Maharashtra, West Bengal, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-mandaviya-to-meet-health-ministers-of-states-uts-to-push-for-door-to-door-vaccination-101636591485108.html

The scheme will continue till 2025-26.Under the scheme, each MP will get ₹2 crore in one instalment for development activities for the remainder of 2021-22 and annually ₹5 crore, in two instalments of ₹2.5 crore each, thereafter, he added.“During Covid-19, a decision had been taken by the Cabinet that for two years, 2020-21 to 2021-22, MPLAD scheme money will be used in the fight against the pandemic. And all parliamentarians had also enthusiastically given their consent to contribute in the fight against Covid,” Thakur said.“I am glad to share with you that in view of the improvement in economic scenario, the way economic recovery has taken place and we have seen growth in various sectors as well, a decision has been taken to restore the MPLAD Scheme for the remainder of the fiscal 2021-22,” he added.In a notification issued separately, the Centre said that as the country was now on the road to economic recovery and “the scheme continues to be beneficial for the creation of durable community assets, in fulfilling the aspirations of locally felt needs of the community, in skill development and creation of jobs across the country, thereby helpful in achieving the objective of Atmanirbhar Bharat”, a decision has been taken to restore the Parliamentarians’ access to the funds.“The objective of the scheme is to enable MPs to recommend works of developmental nature with emphasis on the creation of durable community assets in the areas of drinking water, primary education, public health, sanitation and roads, etc. primarily in their Constituencies,” the notification added.Several MPs belonging to opposition parties had sought the restoration of MPLAD funds during debates in Parliament. While a Lok Sabha MP can use the fund in his or her constituency, Rajya Sabha members can fund any project in the state.Meanwhile, the government has decided to set up 10 tribal museums across the country to mark Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas on November 15.“The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime MinisterNarendra Modi, today approved declaration of 15th November as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas dedicated to the memory of brave tribal freedom fighters so that coming generations could know about their sacrifices about the country,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-gives-nod-to-restore-mplads-101636576928369.html
11-11-2021||India||Tribunals cannot just be avenues for post-retirement jobs: SC||Tribunals cannot just be avenues for post-retirement jobs and must be subjected to some kind of performance assessment the Supreme Court said on Wednesday while fretting over the shortage of manpower and lack of infrastructure in consumers courts across the country. A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh underscored that tribunals were created to ease the life of the common man but that various problems plaguing them have compelled the top court to intervene repeatedly and pass orders on appointments and infrastructure that the Centre and state governments should have created on their own.“They (tribunals) cannot just be avenues for post-retirement jobs. Some kind of performance assessment is required. There should be a mechanism to know how they are functioning,” the bench told Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, who appeared for the Union government in the matter registered suo motu (on its own motion) by the top court on the alleged “inaction of the government” in appointing members of the consumer courts and providing such fora with adequate infrastructure. “What we are trying to do here is to improve the life of the people...to make sure the (Consumer Protection) Act works and its objective is not defeated...Ideally, states should do this themselves. We never had to intervene if things were working properly,” the bench added. Lamenting the absence of a legislative impact study before the new consumer protection law was passed, the court told Lekhi that proper research should have been done on the social, economic and institutional impact before replacing the 1986 consumer protection law with the 2019 law, which was brought into force in July 2020.Lekhi conceded that no formal study was carried out before the new law was notified and that a legislative impact study has been done after the court’s August 11 order in this regard. “This is whole problem with all legislations. The whole principle of having a legislative impact study is that you research beforehand so that you can assess some of the problems and they can be dealt with before a law is brought into force,” retorted the bench. The court further cited the colossal problem of pending cases, with almost 20% of pending litigation pertaining only to dishonoured cheques under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.“The law on Section 138 proved to be a disaster. No legislative impact assessment was done there as well. The manpower required to handle this kind of litigation is not there. After the first hearing in a cheque bounce cases, the next date given is at least after 10 months. And the cases just keep growing,” pointed out the bench. At this, Lekhi said that he acknowledges the problem and that he has submitted the impact study on the new consumer protection law for the court’s consideration. Recording Lekhi’s submission, the bench asked the ASG and senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, to jointly examine the legislative impact assessment report and make their suggestions to ensure the law works properly and there is adequate infrastructure to support its working. During the hearing, the court also warned states that it would impose a penalty of ₹2 lakh each on them for not complying with its August order on filing status reports with respect to infrastructure and vacancies in state and district consumer commissions. The court will take up the matter next after three weeks. On October 22, the bench reproached the Union government for creating an “imbroglio” over functioning of the tribunals and making “citizens suffer in the bargain”, observing the Centre should abolish all tribunals if the judiciary is compelled to make appointments in these bodies to keep them alive. The bench called it “very unfortunate” that the Supreme Court is being called on to fill vacancies in tribunals, which is the primary job of the government that has framed legislations and rules for these forums.It had also referred to the August 11 order laying down a timeline of eight weeks for filling up around 800 vacancies in consumer courts across the country, adding the schedule shall be strictly adhered to by the Centre and states.On August 11, the court issued a string of directives to the Centre and states to speed up the process of appointments and the upgradation of infrastructure of consumer courts. “Don’t create hopes when you are unwilling to fulfil aspirations. If you raise hopes that consumers will get their disputes redressed, you have to have adequate number of people to deal with the cases coming up... We can’t leave consumers and citizens to your mercy if you aren’t willing to perform,” it said then.The 2019 consumer protection law has broadened the meaning of “consumer”, allowing people to file a complaint from their place of residence; brought e-commerce platforms within the fold of the law; provided for time-bound redressal; made celebrity-endorsers liable; and enhanced the monetary jurisdiction of consumer courts at all levels.Under the new law, a district forum can decide a consumer dispute up to ₹1 crore as against ₹20 lakh under the old law. Similarly, pecuniary jurisdiction of a state commission has been enhanced from ₹1 crore to ₹10 crore, and a national commission can now decide disputes over and above ₹10 crore.According to a report submitted by the central government in the Supreme Court, there are more than 2.5 lakh cases pending across all levels of consumer courts, and a large number of pendency has arisen after the 2019 Act was brought into force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribunals-cannot-just-be-avenues-for-post-retirement-jobs-sc-101636572322046.html
11-11-2021||India||Infants shifted after ventilator catches fire in Assam hospital||The alertness and timely action by doctors and staff members of Assam Medical College Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh helped avert a tragedy after one ventilator at an intensive care unit (ICU) of a pediatric ward caught fire on Wednesday.According to hospital authorities, the incident happened around 6:30 pm when the ventilator unit caught fire due to a short circuit. The baby in the unit was immediately moved out and as a safety measure, all 10 other newborns were shifted to another part of the hospital. “As it was an ICU unit, doctors and staff took immediate action and the fire was doused. The baby in the particular unit and all other babies of the ICU are safe and there’s no cause of any worry,” Dr Sanjeev Kakati, principal-cum-chief superintendent of AMCH, told HT over phone. Asked whether the ventilator unit that caught fire was part of supplies from the PM Cares Fund, Dr Kakati said that since the hospital has received several such units over the course of the past one-and-half years from various sources, it would be difficult to verify its origin. “There’s no certainty whether the short circuit took place due to a problem in the machine or due to some issues in wiring. As a safety measure, we have ordered an electrical audit of the entire hospital, which will be conducted on Thursday,” Dr Kakati said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infants-shifted-after-ventilator-catches-fire-in-assam-hospital-101636572141850.html
11-11-2021||India||Fadnavis-Malik war of words continues||On Day 2 of the political slugfest between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik, the latter accused the former of allowing a fake currency racket to flourish in Maharashtra after the 2016 demonetisation, when currency notes of ₹500 and ₹1000 ceased to be legal tender.Malik on Wednesday also accused Fadnavis, who was the chief minister at the time, of shielding underworld criminals.On Tuesday, Fadnavis had accused Malik of buying property from two people, one of whom has links with the underworld while the other is convicted in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts that killed 257 people. Malik had responded stating that the property deals were above board and that he would reveal how Fadnavis “held the city hostage” during his tenure as CM of Maharshtra.In a press conference on Wednesday, Malik said that while fake notes were seized in other states after demonetisation, there was not a single such instance in Maharashtra.On October 8, 2017, the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized fake notes worth ₹14.56 crore from the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai, Malik said.“But Fadnavis helped sweep the case under the carpet. The seized amount was later shown with a value of ₹8.8 lakh,” Malik alleged, questioning why the case was not handed over to the National Investigation Agency.Fadnavis chose not to directly respond to the allegations. He tweeted a quote by British author George Bernard Shaw: “I learned long ago, Never to wrestle with a pig, You get dirty. And Besides, The pig likes it!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fadnavismalik-war-of-words-continues-101636571961222.html
11-11-2021||India||Karnataka is BJP’s gateway to South India: Bommai||Asserting that Karnataka is the BJP’s gateway to south India, state chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said the saffron party has made an impact in all southern states except Kerala where it needs to work “differently”.The party has high hopes in Telangana, while in other states it has made an impact irrespective of election outcome, he said at a meet organized by a TV channel. Asked about BJP’s prospects in South India, Bommai said, “South is hope for BJP...Karnataka is a gateway. Hopes are much more in Telangana. In Tamil Nadu, we have made an impact even though we have lost (elections). “Kerala is one state where there is political lag and where we have worked hard. We have been working hard, but we have to work differently,” he said.Noting that many BJP leaders have worked very hard for the last 30 years to spread the saffron colour in South, Bommai said the government in Karnataka has not come by chance. It has come by hard work for so many years on different fronts.Several leaders like B S Yediyurappa and Anant Kumar have worked hard in Karnataka. Similarly, BJP leaders have been working hard in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, irrespective of election results, he said.“I am sure when the time comes for change, the choice will be for BJP,” Bommai asserted. Asked if reservation in private jobs for locals is a way forward or a short term political appeasement, he said economics and social conditioning go together. “There has been a lot of talk about this. But what I feel is that in a democratic set up, if the major population is not taken along then the democracy will not work for a long time. Therefore opportunity has to be created to the classes which have been deprived of. In that aspect, reservation is one big tool to see that opportunities are created,” he said.Bommai further said a good economist or a good administrator has to ride two horses -- one of efficiency and the other equity -- in the same direction and same speed. “So, we have to balance -- equity and efficiency,” he said, adding that movers and shakers of the economy are people at the bottom of the pyramid. Bommai answered in the affirmative when asked if the legacy of his father and former chief minister S R Bommai and predecessor Yediyurappa was weighing heavily on him. “... Because people start comparing immediately as they don’t even give time. The very first day, they want me to behave like my father and BSY,” he said, adding that there is “pressure” to perform better. Bommai, however, said he converts this pressure into an opportunity to get the best out of himself and then from his people with the experience he has gained working under five chief ministers. Asked how he was managing the reins of Karnataka government in the middle of the term, Bommai said all major policies and programmes envisaged during BSY time are continuing. “I took over during the period when Covid-19 was on the way out. I had to prepare the state to take off its economic activity without wasting much time and instill confidence in people to be part of the economic activity. That challenge was new to me. I concentrated on that and we are doing well on that,” he said.Bommai also said he wants to leave his legacy as “a common man chief minister by the people and for the people” who has uplifted the life of last person in Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-is-bjp-s-gateway-to-south-india-bommai-101636571903611.html

The forecast is until Thursday morning.Rains are also expected in Bengaluru city which has suffered a significant damage in recent weeks due to heavy and unseasonal downpour, inundating entire neighbourhoods across India’s IT capital.“Widespread very light to light rains likely over BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) area. Forecast for next 2 days (ending at 08:30 am of 13.11.2021). Widespread light to moderate rains with isolated places heavy rains likely,” according to the disaster management authoritiesThe poor quality of civic infrastructure, rapid and unplanned expansion, lack of long-term vision and emphasis on short-term fixes among other issues have compounded the problems for Bengaluru and its ability to deal with downpours.The rains have claimed at least 21 lives across Karnataka in the month of October.The death toll in neighbouring Tamil Nadu continues to rise as heavy downpour is expected to continue across the south-east coast of the country.The low pressure area over Bay of Bengal is likely to concentrate into a depression, affecting the southern parts of Andhra Pradesh and parts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai.

11-11-2021||India||Pending railway projects to be fast-tracked, says Karnataka minister||Karnataka infrastructure development minister V Somanna on Wednesday said that the state will fast-track railway projects that are languishing since 2007, in a time-bound manner.He said, the cost of most of these projects have almost doubled “Since 2007, nine railway projects that were launched have not been completed.....after discussion, as the cost has also gone up, putting a burden on both state and central government, we have decided to fast-track these projects. Within 15-20 days, land acquisition and other hurdles will be cleared in a time bound manner,” Somanna said.“The state government is in talks with Indian Railways authorities. They were being laggard. We have sent across whatever message we had to and work will speed up from tomorrow,” he added.The minister on Wednesday reviewed the infrastructure development department and held discussions with railway officials regarding the languishing projects.Of the nine railway projects cleared since 2007, at least four have seen their total cost go up.According to Somanna, the cost of the Tumakuru-Rayadurg line has gone up from ₹479 crore to ₹2,432 crore, Ginigera-Raichur from ₹1,350 crore to ₹2,565 crore, Bagalkot-Kudachi from ₹816 crore to ₹1,525 crore and Tumakuru-Chitradurga-Davangere from ₹1,801 crore to ₹2,161 crore.Karnataka has a 50 per cent share in the cost of these projects.Other than these four, the other railway projects that have been languishing and will be expedited are Munirabad-Mehaboobanagar; Gadag-Wadi; Shivamogga-Shikaripura-Ranebennur; Chikkamagaluru-Belur; Belur-Hassan and Dharwad- Belagavi (which is yet to start).Noting that about 56 pending railway over bridges and under bridges (ROB/RUB) are languishing in various places, including Bengaluru, Tumakuru among others, Somanna said after discussions, it has been decided to give some shape to this.“The state government is releasing our share of funds. Once the Centre releases its share at the earliest, minor land-related issues that were being used as an excuse for the delay will be resolved,” he said.The aim is to finish all these projects in this financial year as much as possible, he said, adding that “We will review them once every month.” Further stating that the work on new airports at Shivamogga, Vijayapura, Hassan, Raichur and Karwar are on track, the Minister said, the Shivamogga airport will be commissioned before 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pending-railway-projects-to-be-fast-tracked-says-karnataka-minister-101636571843566.html
11-11-2021||India||Karnataka CM in Delhi to discuss water disputes, may meet PM Modi today||Karnataka chief minister Basvaraj Bommai landed in Delhi on Wednesday and is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.“I have asked for time with the Prime Minister and I may get it tomorrow,” Bommai said in Bengaluru on Wednesday, just before he departed for Delhi.The chief minister said that he would meet union ministers to discuss several issues concerning Karnataka including the interstate water disputes.“Mostly it is to discuss the interstate water disputes. Will also discuss the case of Krishna and Cauvery with the lawyers and check the progress of these cases,” he said.The visit to Delhi comes at a time when Karnataka has been piling pressure on the Centre to provide requisite clearances for the contentious Mekedatu project.Mekedatu, which literally means Goat’s crossing in English, is situated around 100 kms from Bengaluru in Ramanagara district and evokes deep-rooted emotions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.The long-winding legal battles have been used as a political currency in the past as well as an active tool to deflect attention away from other issues both sides of the border and irrespective of the party in power.The Cauvery river basin originates in Karnataka and flows through Tamil Nadu and Puducherry before it enters the Bay of Bengal. Of the total catchment area of 81,155 square kilometers, 34,273 kilometers is in Karnataka, 44,016 square kms in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and about 2,866 sq kms in Kerala.Karnataka has maintained that the Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project is to generate 400 MW of power and additionally utilise 4.75 tmcft of water for drinking and domestic needs in the state and particularly Bengaluru.The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, soon after it came to power in 2013, announced the construction of the project which would cost ₹5912 crore to help use the excess water to quench the thirst of surrounding districts, including Bengaluru.Then Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalitha wrote to the union government not to give the project an environment clearance as it would disrupt the natural flow of water from the upper riparian state.The Congress in Karnataka has announced to carry out a Padayatra or a march from Mekedatu to Benglauru in the first half of December, demanding clearances and immediate commencement of work on the project.The BJP has termed Congress’s march as “politica” while the latter has termed the Bommai government to “lack political will” as the two national parties trade charges over the project.Bommai has also been under pressure after the BJP suffered a blow in the October 30 bypolls as it lost Hanagal, in the chief minister’s home district of Haveri, to the Congress.Bommai said that the much delayed cabinet expansion in Karnataka is not on the agenda and that he is unsure if it will come up when he meets the party’s leadership in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-in-delhi-to-discuss-water-disputes-may-meet-pm-modi-today-101636571842009.html
11-11-2021||India||Karnataka’s cybersecurity policy likely by next month, says IT minister||The Karnataka government is likely to release its cybersecurity policy by the end of December, according to the information technology minister, arming the state with key infrastructure and software to deal with rising complexities in the online space.The government had announced to frame a cybersecurity policy a year ago. The state government is also readying a data centre policy.“The IT department of the state will provide the necessary policy framework to protect its growing technology ecosystem as well as individuals,” said Dr CN Ashwath Narayan, Karnataka’s minister for information technology, biotechnology, science & technology, higher education, skill development, entrepreneurship and livelihood.“This space (online and technology) is expanding. We have to look at the applications and implications of this. Rights have to be protected from hackers and we also train individuals on how to protect themselves,” Narayan told Hindustan Times.Unveiling of the policy comes at a time when there has been a steep increase in cyber crimes across the country, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic which forced higher dependence on online solutions due to extended periods of lockdowns across India.Bengaluru, India’s technology capital and startup hub, had the highest number of cyber crimes (cases under IT Act) in 2020, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau in September.Bengaluru recorded 8,892 such cases in 2020, which was several times more than the other five biggest urban centres in the country, including Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, data shows.Narayan said that there is no existing policy around data and information security and a framework is needed as hackers continue attacks on organisations and individuals.“As we grow (in technology), hackers too are growing,” Narayan said.According to IT research and advisory firm, Gartner, enterprise information security and risk management end user spending is expected to rise 9.5% to total $2.08 billion this year.“Rapid adoption of cloud has led to growth in the enterprise information security and risk management end user spending in India is expected to rise 9.5% annually to total $2.08 billion in 2021,” according to the latest forecast from research firm Gartner.The policy by the Basvaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government comes even as the chief minister has been accused to be part of a several thousand crore Bitcoin scandal.Congress leader Siddaramaiah has accused that a hacker was used to purchase Bitcoins worth over ₹2,000 crore and has levelled allegations against the chief minister, the BJP state president, and some senior officials.Cyber security policy would also help police officials work better and more effectively with social media platforms, which have become crucial in investigations, and improve chances of prosecution.There have been several instances where the crimes have remained unsolved or the police being forced to take longer time as there is no necessary framework or infrastructure to reach out or use advanced tools to crack the case.Narayan said that all necessary software will be provided to the police to help with their investigation.“This (policy) was for a long time coming, not just because the number of cyber crimes in Karnataka are at an all-time high, but also Karnataka being the IT hub of the world, the state of Karnataka needs to take a leadership role in recognizing the essential role that a state cybersecurity policy plays,” said Jatinder Pal Singh, the director of cybersecurity at Informatica.He added that the increasing adoption of ‘internet of things’ or IOT makes lives easier but adds to the risk component of organisations and individuals.“With the ever expanding sphere of internet of things, basically every home device is now connected and in effect becomes both an attack vector as well as a target of a cyber attack,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakas-cybersecurity-policy-likely-by-next-month-says-it-minister-101636571783652.html

Narrowing down to the six-book shortlist from our longlist of 12 books was very hard because so many of the books captured unique and diverse angles of modern India.” This year’s jury includes political scientist Niraja Gopal Jayal (chair), entrepreneurs Nandan Nilekani and Manish Sabharwal; and historians Srinath Raghavan and Nayanjot Lahiri.Instituted in 2018, the prize carries a cash award of ₹15 lakh and a citation, and celebrates non-fiction literature published in the previous calendar year by emerging writers of all nationalities in modern and contemporary India.The prize is named after Chattopadhyay, who contributed significantly to the freedom struggle, to the women’s movement, to refugee rehabilitation and to the renewal of Indian theatre and handicrafts.Last year, the prize was jointly awarded to Amit Ahuja and Jairam Ramesh. In 2019, it was given to Ornit Shani and in 2018 to Milan Vaishnav.“This year’s longlist of 12 extraordinary books covered a variety of themes and subjects showcasing some of the finest non-fiction writing about the world’s largest democracy. The six books shortlisted from this outstanding list of works are those that combine strong research with compelling writing in weaving together unique perspectives that resonated with the NIF jury,” the NIF said in a statement.“Highly-researched and eminently readable, the six books comprise creative and conscious insights into the history of India as it has emerged today: its diversity, difference, heterogeneity, and the very idea of the nation-state itself. Each of these books offers a valuable understanding of the country’s complex past through the lens of the present moment in potentially opening up avenues to address the future,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/books-on-mahatma-naoroji-s-life-among-six-shortlisted-for-nif-prize-101636571782203.html
11-11-2021||India||Karntaka: Political slugfest over Bitcoin case escalates||The Congress on Wednesday alleged that the BJP was protecting the hacker involved in the cryptocurrency case. Talking to the media, Congress legislator and former information technology minister Priyank Kharge alleged that the BJP government had taken thousands of crores kickbacks in the Bitcoin scandal involving hacker Srikrishna alias Sriki. “This government is very systematically trying to cover up the bitcoin scam. All the BJP senior leadership is involved, their children are involved as well as senior officials. This is a scandal of thousands of crores. They have got kickbacks from drugs, transfers, investments, and even bribes through this method,” Priyank Kharge told reporters. He went on to add that hacker Srikrishna was important for the BJP since he was key to the scandal. “Sriki is BJP’s prized possession. Like the Hindi saying that raja ki jaan thothe mein hai, he (Sriki) is their thotha (The King’s heart is in the parrot, Sriki is their parrot),” said Kharge.Srikrishna was arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police on November 18, 2020, in a drug peddling case. He had bought drugs from international dealers using bitcoins on the dark web. In the interrogation that followed, CCB found that the software engineer was also involved in a series of online crimes. He hacked into websites to steal their data and locked the owners out of it. He would then demand payment in bitcoins to unlock the websites. He also confessed to creating ‘mirror’ sites, or fake payment portals that mimicked real ones, to steal credit or debit card information to steal money. He confessed to stealing ₹11.5 crore from the e-procurement cell of the Karnataka e-governance centre, apart from hacking into some Bitcoin exchanges. Kharge asked the government to make the letter written by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the issue public. “Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, there will be a digital footprint. It is difficult to trace but not impossible,” he added. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah too joined the attack. On Wednesday the veteran Congress leader tweeted: “Bitcoin, whoever is involved, whether it is Congress, BJP or JD(S), we have to book them. Let them share their names. I never say anything without evidence,” Siddaramaiah said. “We are not trying to blackmail anyone. I am getting suspicious of the way Basavaraj Bommai is talking. He is talking like he is involved. I never alleged that Basavaraj Bommai is involved,” he added. Responding to the allegation, chief minister Bommai said that the Congress leaders were commenting without any knowledge of the case. “Ask poor Priyank Kharge to get full information first and then talk. There are names of Congress leaders and he should worry about that,” Bommai said on Wednesday. Bommai said that Sriki was first arrested in 2018 when Congress was in power. “Please remember who was in power at the time (Congress). The case was registered in Cubbon park station and five to six arrests were made. But Sriki was given an opportunity for anticipatory bail. Even after that, he could have been probed. He was involved in a brawl recently and he could have been brought in for questioning…. in 2020, we (the BJP government) started a war on drugs and he (Sriki) was caught that trying to buy drugs from the dark web in other countries and selling it here,” he added. Meanwhile, a court in Bengaluru on Wednesday granted conditional bail to alleged hacker Sriki alias Srikrishna in a case related to a hotel brawl. Srikrishna who was granted bail in the hacking cases earlier this year was arrested again by Bengaluru police on Sunday after he got into an argument with the staff of a five star hotel in Bengaluru. Later police found that the hacker was under the influence of drugs and he was taken into custody. He was fined ₹4,500 for consuming drugs and was released on conditional bail with ₹25,000 as surety. Srikrishna refused to comment on the case. “I have nothing to say, man. Please stop. There is nothing to say about this. This is just nuisance and bogus,” he told reporters in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karntakapolitical-slugfest-over-bitcoin-case-escalates-101636571721821.html
11-11-2021||India||Gujarat riots: No case made out of Zakia Jafri’s complaint, SIT tells SC||A Special Investigation Team (SIT), which gave a clean chit to 64 people in the 2002 Gujarat communal riots, on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that a probe into allegations of a larger conspiracy was thoroughly examined after which the agency came to the conclusion that there was no material to take it forward.The SIT made the submission while referring to a complaint filed by Zakia Jafri, widow of slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, who challenged the clean chit. In her complaint, Zakia accused the state government then led by chief minister Narendra Modi and police of being complicit in not preventing the riots.Appearing for the SIT, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said: “After the SIT was constituted by the Supreme Court to probe the Gujarat riots cases, an order was passed in September 2011 in which the court wanted the SIT to examine all aspects of her complaint. The SIT concluded that there was no reason in the complaint to take the matter further and add to the existing number of accused facing trial in the riots cases. That was a closure in a sense.” Questioning the SIT’s conclusion, Zafri’s counsel and senior advocate Kapil Sibal said: “The most damaging fact is that the SIT ignored the sting operation conducted by Tehelka as extra-judicial confession when the same was authenticated by the CBI and used as evidence to prosecute the accused in the trial related to Naroda Patiya case,” he said. The bench told Sibal: “Individual role and evidence is not relevant. Tell us what the SIT failed to do procedurally.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-riots-no-case-made-out-of-zakia-jafri-s-complaint-sit-tells-sc-101636571481875.html
11-11-2021||India||Mullaperiyar reservoir: Kerala cancels tree-felling nod extended to TN||The Kerala government on Wednesday cancelled an order granting permission to Tamil Nadu for felling 15 trees downstream of Baby Dam at Mullaperiyar reservoir, with the state cabinet taking a decision to this effect.The development comes in the wake of the ruling CPI(M)-LDF facing flak, mainly from Opposition Congress over the issue after Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin earlier thanked his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan for his government allowing felling of the trees. As the move drew criticism in the state, the Kerala government later froze the order.Since the November 5 order issued by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and the Chief Wildlife Warden was “not legally binding”, it was decided by the Cabinet to cancel it, a statement issued by the government said on Wednesday. An official who prepared the order could face action, sources said.Besides that, the Cabinet also decided to set up a three-tier committee to provide the state government with the necessary views and advice to take quick and accurate decisions on issues related to inter-state river water disputes, it added.Official sources said the government has also decided to take disciplinary action against chief wildlife warden Bennichan Thomas, who allegedly prepared the tree felling order and indicated he may be suspended from service.The Congress-led UDF welcomed the government move to cancel the tree-felling order, with the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly V D Satheesan claiming it was an outcome of their questioning the state government’s decision.The Vijayan government was under attack from the opposition Congress-led bloc in the state Assembly for its controversial order granting permission to cut the trees.It had staged a walkout in the assembly earlier in the day over the issue.Incidentally, on Tuesday, the Tamil Nadu government had released a copy of the “Proceedings of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala,” giving an order allowing it to fell 15 trees.While Tamil Nadu had sought nod for removal of 23 trees, permission was granted for clearing 15, which was also later frozen. Kerala and Tamil Nadu have been at loggerheads over the century-old dam, with the former insisting the reservoir is not safe, and wants a new one in its place while its neighbour has been maintaining it was strong.Tamil Nadu Minister Duraimurugan had said last week that his government wants to carry out strengthening work in Baby dam and finally raise the water level in the reservoir to 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mullaperiyar-reservoir-kerala-cancels-tree-felling-nod-extended-to-tn-101636571363195.html
11-11-2021||India||Vijayan warns of action against people obstructing film shooting||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday warned of stern action against those disrupting film shootings in the state in the wake of recent confrontation between Malayalam actor Joju George and some Congress workers during a road block protest in Kochi over the increase in fuel prices.Replying to a submission by actor-turned-legislator Mukesh on the issue in the state Assembly, he said obstructing film shootings was not just the issue of restricting freedom of expression but also a matter of civil liberty.“No matter who makes such attempts, no mercy will be shown.. Such people will be dealt with severely. The entire state will support such an act (by the government). That’s the tradition of this land,” he said.Referring to alleged protests against a film, the CM said there was outcry from certain quarters not to allow the shooting of films of a particular actor.It could not be viewed as an isolated incident, he said adding that the news reports in this regard indicate that there was a conscious decision behind the act.“The government will ensure civil liberties, democracy and rule of law in the state. We cannot remain idle as organised mobs try to disrupt work of art,” he said.Vijayan also said those who barge into film sets and unleash violence had a fascist mindset and the actions of such criminals could not be tolerated for no reasons.There were media reports that certain Congress leaders and activists had decided not to allow shooting of films of actor Joju.The award-winning actor-producer has been facing stiff opposition from the Congress party after he questioned the blocking of a busy National Highway in Kochi as part of its agitation against fuel price hike last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayan-warns-of-action-against-people-obstructing-film-shooting-101636571361981.html
11-11-2021||India||Telangana collector opts for government hospital for childbirth||A district collector in Telangana set an example by admitting his wife to a government hospital in a rural area, where she delivered a baby boy on Wednesday.At a time when even the middle class people are hesitant to go to government hospitals, Anudeep Durishetty, collector of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, admitted his pregnant wife Madhavi to the government hospital at Bhadrachalam, a temple town on the borders of Andhra and Chhattisgarh.In the early hours of Wednesday, Madhavi underwent C-section surgery and gave birth to the baby boy. Senior gynaecologists Surapaneni Srikranti and Bhargavi with the support of anaesthetist Devika performed the surgery.“Both the mother and child are healthy. Neonatologist Dr Y S Rajasekhar Reddy examined the infant and gave the necessary medication,” a senior resident doctor of the hospital said on condition of anonymity.Durishetty, a 2018-batch IAS officer from Metpalli town of Jagitial district of Telangana, was the all-India No. 1 ranker in the UPSC civil services examination of that year. He was allotted Telangana cadre and served as assistant collector of the same district before being elevated as the district collector.While Durishetty was not available for his comment, Bhadrachalam area hospital deputy superintendent M Ramakrishna told Hindustan Times that such an initiative taken by the head of the district administration will go a long way in instilling the confidence of the common man in government hospitals.“The IAS officer could have taken his wife to any big hospital in Hyderabad. But he wanted to prove that our hospital is no inferior to any corporate hospital. In fact, even before getting admitted to the hospital, Madhavi had been regularly visiting our hospital for periodical check-ups and consultation with the doctors,” he said.Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao, who was allotted the portfolio of medical and health on Tuesday night, expressed happiness over the Bhadradri-Kothagudem collector choosing a government hospital for his wife’s delivery.“Warmest congratulations to @Collector_BDD & his wife. I hope both the mother & the child are doing well. It gives us immense pride to see how under the able leadership of CM KCR garu, state medical infrastructure has proven to be the first choice of people,” Harish Rao tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-collector-opts-for-government-hospital-for-childbirth-101636571303083.html
11-11-2021||India||TRS to hold stir against Centre over ‘refusal’ to buy paddy from Telangana||Stepping up its attack on BJP and the NDA government at the Centre, the ruling TRS in Telangana on Wednesday said it would organise state-wide protests from next Friday against the Centre’s alleged refusal to buy paddy from the state’s farmers.TRS Working President K T Rama Rao asked the party leaders to hold dharnas after obtaining permission from District Collectors as the model code of conduct is in force for the MLC elections.The TRS’ decision to organise protests came amid an ongoing war of words between the party and BJP over paddy procurement and reducing VAT on petrol and diesel.TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who sought procurement of all the paddy grown in the state by the Centre, had said on November 7 that his party would raise the issue in Parliament, besides holding dharnas in districts. The BJP, meanwhile, called for protests on Thursday, demanding that the TRS government immediately procure the paddy grown in the rainy season.Observing that the Centre was willing to procure paddy from Telangana, the party said in a release that it would question the TRS government over why it was not taking up procurement.The Centre had written to the state in August that it was ready to procure 60 lakh metric tonnes of paddy grown in the rainy season.But the state government troubled farmers by not procuring it and was trying to blame the Centre for it, the release said.Slamming state BJP leaders who announced agitational programmes against the TRS government for discouraging farmers not to go for paddy cultivation this Rabi season, Rao had alleged it was the Centre which is not willing to procure paddy from the state.Stating that the BJP had no moral right to ask states to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel, Rao had demanded that the NDA government remove the cess on petroleum products.Rao had also said he would cut the tongues of BJP leaders if they don’t refrain from using bad language to criticise him.Hitting out at Telangana BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Rao had alleged the saffron party leader is resorting to cheap talk and looking for political gain out of farmers.State Civil Supplies Minister Gangula Kamalakar said in Karimnagar on Wednesday that the Centre should buy the ‘Yasangi’ (summer) season paddy crop in Telangana. Protests would be held in Karimnagar district on Friday in support of the demand, he said.The Centre has indicated in a letter that it would not buy parboiled rice in the summer crop season, he said in a release.BJP leader and Union Tourism Minister G Kishan Reddy alleged on Wednesday that Rao is spreading untruths about petroleum prices.In a tweet, he said that Rao had blamed the NDA government for the increase in fuel prices despite international crude prices not going up. The prices go up only if they rise globally, he said.The Centre decreased the prices now as things have improved, Reddy said.He said on Tuesday that 600 lakh metric tons of rice was procured across the country during 2020-21 kharif marketing season. Out of that, 94 lakh metric tons was procured in Telangana which was the second highest, he said.It shows the Modi government’s sincerity towards the Telangana farmers, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trs-to-hold-stir-against-centre-over-refusal-to-buy-paddy-from-telangana-101636571301982.html
11-11-2021||India||Telangana: Jagan’s sister Sharmila halts 4,000km march over MLC election||YSR Telangana party president Y S Sharmila, who has been on a marathon 4,000-km long padayatra (foot march) in Telangana for the last three weeks, announced a break from the trip on Wednesday following the enforcement of the model code of conduct by the Election Commission for next month’s elections to the state legislative council. She has covered over 300km so far.Speaking to reporters at Kondapalakagudem village of Nalgonda district, Sharmila said she was halting her padayatra, respecting the rules mandated by the EC. “It is only a pause, and I shall resume the padayatra soon after the model code of conduct comes to an end,” she said.The EC on Tuesday announced that no political rallies, public meetings and padayatras would be allowed in the districts where elections to 12 vacancies in the state legislative council under local bodies’ quota would be held on December 10. The results are out on December 14, and the model code of conduct will end on December 16.Sharmila, sister of Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, said she had completed 21 days in her padayatra, covering six assembly constituencies – Chevella, Maheshwaram, Shamshabad, Ibrahimpatnam, Devarakonda and Munugode. “I have covered 150 villages during this period, and the response from the people has been tremendous. The people are pouring out their grievances at every village. Thousands of people have joined hands with us and walked with me,” she said.She alleged that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government has not been able to address the basic needs of the people. “Many of the projects started during the YS Rajasekhar Reddy regime are yet to be completed. In many villages, old people are not getting pensions, and women are not getting loans,” she said.Sharmila announced that she would take up a 72-hour long fast in Hyderabad from Friday demanding that the K Chandrasekhar Rao government purchase every grain of paddy cultivated in the state instead of throwing the blame on the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telanganajagans-sister-sharmila-halts-4-000km-march-over-mlc-election-101636571243069.html
11-11-2021||India||Faulty weather forecast system worsened Chennai’s rain woes||A failure in weather system to forecast the 210 mm rain that lashed Chennai in the intervening night of November 6 and 7 caught authorities unprepared for one of the city’s heaviest rain spells, officials said on Wednesday.Those privy to functioning of the regional weather department said Chennai’s weather radar, which helps with “nowcasts” (forecasting weather for short term up to six hours), has aged and data on upper air has been lacking that is crucial for making weather forecasts (for longer periods).“We have rectified the radar this (Wednesday) morning,” said a Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) official, who did not wish to be named. “We haven’t been able to use it till now.”The RMC is currently relying on satellite data feeding it with numerical weather models for forecasts.CPI (MP) from Madurai S Venkatesan spoke to union earth sciences secretary M Ravichandran who informed him that repair work was ongoing at Chennai Meteorological Department’s radar near Chennai Port Trust and it will be operational soon.Ravichandran had ordered an enquiry into the malfunctioning radar during the current north east monsoon. The RMC is currently providing rain forecasts with the help of radars from Sriharikota and Karaikal, he said.“Radars are very reliable to give specific forecasts but it has aged and stopped working in Chennai so it was also not being operated continuously. It generally runs non-stop,” said a meteorological expert, who did not wish to be identified.“So no rainfall warning was given to Chennai. There has been a failure in giving a correct forecast. They only predicted rainfall from Sunday (November 7) onwards. The rain was caused by an upper air circulation and it unexpectedly moved in-land. If a day’s warning was given, we could have been better prepared.”India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) bulletin on November 6 forecast very heavy rainfall in north coastal Tamil Nadu which includes around 14 districts and issued an orange alert (the second highest warning which means to “be prepared”) and a red (highest warning meaning “take action”) alert was issued only on Sunday.“It is correct that this spell of rain could not be predicted by the numerical weather data model,” the expert quoted above said. “Any model will can errors. But observations are important. If you don’t have the correct observations the forecast will not be very good. satellite data gives a lot of information. But upper air circulation data gives more accuracy.”An instrument called radiosonde or GPS sonde observations are the primary source of upper air data which uses parameters such as winds, pressure, humidity, temperature to accurately predict changes. This instrument isn’t available for Chennai, the RMC official quoted above said.“Even if radiosonde data is not available still we can get satellite data but that works on algorithms as an input for numerical weather prediction,” says former IMD deputy director YEA Raj. “Whereas radiosonde is actual data, satellite data can be checked for accuracy only with data generated from radiosonde.”IMD has issued another red alert for Chennai until November 11. It forecast very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy rain at isolated places over Chennai and delta districts such as Cuddalore, Villupuram, Pudukottai, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram and Puducherry and Karaikal.Chennai registered 23.7 mm of rainfall on Wednesday up to 15.30 pm. Coastal districts Nagapattinam and Karaikal, where rains pounded on the intervening night between November 9 and 10, receive with 245 mm and 272 mm rainfall, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faulty-weather-forecast-system-worsened-chennai-s-rain-woes-101636571241829.html
11-11-2021||India||Ayushman Bharat: Centre begins work to digitise health records||The union health ministry has started the registration of all government medical facilities and doctors under the Ayushman Bharat- Digital Health Mission (ABDHM), a process that involves the digitisation of their information , including health records. In a letter dated November 9 addressed to the directors of all government hospitals in the country, and to the secretaries of all government departments, Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan and chief executive officer of National Health Authority, RS Sharma, wrote that the government of India has decided all its health facilities shall take part in the mission, and laid down steps that need to be followed in coming weeks.The mission was launched by the Prime Minister on September 27. However, experts say the major challenge for the mission will remain convincing private health care providers to come on board as it is voluntary for them to share information for this digital repository.The National Health Authority, which supervises the running of Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna, the government’s health insurance scheme, is also is tasked with implementing ABDHM. The health facilities to be registered under ABDHM include, apart from government hospitals, government-run clinics, laboratories, pharmacies and radiology centres across the country. The ABDHM web portal (https://abdm.gov.in/) has separate verticals for the registration of professionals and facilities under different categories that people can access to register.In addition to registering the facilities on the “Health Facility Registry” and the doctors (“full-time or part-time”) in the “Healthcare Professionals Registry”, the hospitals and facilities have also been asked to digitize their health records and told to “procure and install a Health/Hospital Information Management System”, according to the letter. The letter asks that all this “may be started at the earliest”. The Health Management Information System (HMIS) is a government-to-government web-based monitoring information system that has been put in place by the health ministry, to monitor the National Health Mission and other health programmes, besides providing key inputs for policy formulation and appropriate programme interventions. The system was launched in October 2008, and currently, around 200,000 health facilities (across all states/UTs) are uploading facility-wise service delivery data on a monthly basis, training data on quarterly basis and infrastructure related data on an annual basis on the HMIS web portal, according to the National Health Mission website. Among the challenges faced in adopting the system is the need for trained manpower to handle the software. “There will of course be challenges as it is commonly seen when anything of that scale is getting implemented; we saw that even during the implementation of Aadhar, but it won’t be anything that cannot be addressed. It depends on the way you design the network and protocols under which data exchange happens. It’s more of a technical issue but nothing major,” cyber policy analyst Subimal Bhattacharjee said. Experts wondered how the government plans to encourage private hospitals and facilities to do the same. Even though India has more private hospitals than public ones, only about 10,478 of the 23,306 hospitals empanelled under the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme are private ones. The health insurance scheme was launched in 2018.“The Ayushman Bharat scheme is a classic example of how private health facilities can be successfully roped in to offer treatment. Health care facilities are unevenly distributed and there are many private hospitals in the periphery that are equipped to treat in terms of infrastructure, and can be made use of,” Dr MC Misra, former director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, said.A health ministry official said the government is aware of the challenge, and aims to engage with the private sector. “We plan to have constant dialogue and engagement with the private sector that includes both private hospitals and doctors. We will also engage with their associations to create awareness,” added this person on condition of anonymity. Girdhar Gyani, director general of the Association of Healthcare Providers (India), association of hospitals, said, “We have had discussions with government representatives on the matter and more discussions will happen going forward, for sure. The hospitals are willing to participate, even if there may be some concerns, and we hopefully will find a solution to those soon. It sounds like a good initiative and will help patients to better access health care facilities, especially in remote areas where health care delivery services are unevenly distributed. Let us see how the discussions go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayushman-bharat-centre-begins-work-to-digitise-health-records-101636571182022.html
11-11-2021||India||NSA Doval talks defence ties with Iran Kazakhstan, Russia counterparts||India’s National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval discussed the situation in Afghanistan and bilateral security cooperation with his counterparts from Iran, Kazakhstan and Russia on the margins of a regional security meeting on Wednesday. Doval met Iran’s supreme national security council secretary, Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, Kazakhstan’s national security committee chairman Karim Massimov and Russia’s security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev after the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan. The three bilateral meetings were substantive and there were detailed discussions on Afghanistan and on bilateral relations, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Doval and Patrushev discussed future high-level exchanges, defence cooperation and deepening interaction between the national security councils of India and Russia, the people said. This was Patrushev’s second visit to India since the Taliban assumed power in Afghanistan in mid-August. A statement issued by the Russian side said Doval and Patrushev had discussed plans for further India-Russia cooperation in security and touched upon a “number of regional problems”. It added, “Special attention was paid to cooperation on various information security issues.” At the meeting with Shamkhani, the two sides discussed the situation in Afghanistan, bilateral trade and the current state of India-Iran relations. Iran had hosted the two previous meetings of the regional security dialogue on Afghanistan and Doval and Shamkhani discussed ways to carry forward the process. Discussions between Doval and his Kazakh counterpart focused on Afghanistan, and practical steps for enhancing connectivity and trade routes between the two countries. The NSAs and security council chiefs of the seven countries that attended the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan had a “very substantive exchange” during a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The people said Modi shared India’s perspective on Afghanistan with the security officials. The people also said the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue had exceeded India’s expectations, as the foreign security officials easily arrived at a complete consensus that enabled the issuance of the joint Delhi Declaration on Afghanistan. The declaration said the eight countries were committed to combat terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. The foreign delegations appreciated the opportunity to engage in frank and open discussions on Afghanistan, the people said. Since this is the only dialogue at the level of NSAs, there was unanimity on the need to continue with this mechanism and have regular consultations, the people added. The people also said there was an “extraordinary degree of convergence” in assessments of the situation in Afghanistan by the eight countries and the principal challenges in the war-torn country and the region. These challenges include the security situation, heightened risk of terrorism and an impending humanitarian crisis. The security officials pointed to the need to provide humanitarian aid and emphasised that land and air routes should be made available and no one should impede the process of providing assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-doval-talks-defence-ties-with-iran-kazakhstan-russia-counterparts-101636569026637.html
11-11-2021||India||Ayodhya verdict has become right as both sides have accepted it: Chidambaram||Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday said that only because both the sides accepted the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya, it became a right judgement and not the other way around.After launching party colleague Salman Khurshid’s book “Sunrise over Ayodhya - Nationhood in our Times”, he termed the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 as a “terrible wrong” that debased our Constitution.Party colleague Digvijaya Singh said in the country’s history, vandalism and destruction of temples happened even before the advent of Islam, but an atmosphere has been created where it has been told that such acts came with Muslim rulers and that is why they are responsible for it. Singh also alleged that LK Advani’s ‘Rath Yatra’ was not to unite society, but to divide it and wherever he went, he sowed the seeds of hatred and created that atmosphere of sectarianism in the country.He further alleged that Veer Sarvarkar was not a religious man as he questioned the cow being called “mata” and also consumed beef.Chidambaram lamented that even after 75 years of independence one has to conclude that nobody demolished Babri Masjid as everyone who was accused in the case were acquitted within a year of the Supreme Court verdict.“That story started in 1992 and came to a completely unexpected end on the 9th November 2019, exactly two years ago. The jurisprudential faces of this judgement is extremely narrow, it is a very thin ledge, but due to the passage of time what the author points out is all sides have accepted it.“Because both sides have accepted it, it is become the right judgement, not the other way around. It’s not a right judgement, which both sides have accepted. Because both sides have accepted it, it has become the right judgement,” the former finance minister said.Chidambaram said Khurshid did not want to rock the boat or stir the hornet’s nest and he understood his reluctance to do so.Quoting Singh, Chidambaram said he spoke about truth and reconciliation with emphasis on reconciliation. Nelson Mandela also promised truth and reconciliation, but first the truth must be told and then there can be reconciliation. “The truth was that what happened on December 6, 1992 was a terrible wrong. It was an incident that debased our Constitution, that defied the Supreme Court and created, what appeared to be at that time, an unbridgable chasm between two communities. It was wrong, terribly wrong and I would say 100 times that it will always be a terrible wrong,” he said.Chidambaram lamented that everyday there are occurrences that empty a bit of the soul of our Constitution, yet no one in high authority is willing to stand up and speak for this grave debasement and denigration of our Constitution. He also lamented even while lynchings are happening in the country, no one in authority speaks against it.The Congress leader said words and practices have acquired a new meaning today as whatever Gandhi ji thought was ‘Ram Rajya’ is no longer the ‘Ram Rajya’ as understood by many of fellow Indians.He also said that what Panditji thought about secularism is certainly not the way secularism is understood by many millions of fellow citizens.“Secularism has moved away from acceptance to tolerance and from tolerance to an uneasy co-existence. Secularism has moved away from community living to living apart, to living in ghettos. Secularism has moved away from having friends from all communities and all religions,” he said, adding that words have acquired a new meaning and unless we recognise what has happened to our country in the last 15-20 years, we would not be true to what we believe India should be.“Today we live in a world where lynching is not condemned by anyone in authority, certainly not the prime minister and certainly not the Home minister,” Chidambaram said.Singh said the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute was there since 1858 but the VHP, Bajrang Dal and the RSS never made it an issue. It was after they were restricted to two seats in 1984 they decided to make it a national issue because Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Gandhian socialism had failed and they took to hardcore religious fundamentalism, he claimed. “L K Advani’s Rath Yatra was not to unite society, but to divide it. Wherever he went, he sow the seeds of hatred. Advani’s rath yatra created that atmosphere of sectarianism in our country,” he said.“’Hindutva has nothing to do with Hindu religion. Savarkar was not a religious man. He had even said why is the cow considered ‘maata’ (mother) and had no problems in consuming beef. He brought in the ‘Hindutva’ word to establish Hindu identity that caused confusion in people and that was propagated by the RSS,” he also said.Besides its legal implications, Singh said Khurshid in this book has also talked about the implications of this on society and that path of reconciliation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-verdict-has-become-right-as-both-sides-have-accepted-itchidambaram-101636569024503.html

After media reports, Priyank Kanoongo, the chairperson of NCPCR, took note of the decision. He has sought CBFC’s confirmation that the movies have been certified and also sought the category of certification.Kanoongo has also written to UNICEF India representative Yasumasa Kimura seeking the “mandate under which the movies have been selected to be screened for minors”. The movies will premiere on December 3 at the 8th Bad and Beautiful World Film Festival at Kalanjali Art Space in Kolkata. The movies explore different aspects of same-sex relationships, from the reconciliation of the father with his gay son to the trials of a male escort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samesex-movies-child-rights-panel-seeks-clarification-from-cbfc-101636569022805.html
11-11-2021||India||Farm fires at a record high; FIRs by 2 NCR states: Nil||At least 50,000 instances of farm fires have been recorded since October 1 in two National Capital Region (NCR) states, but not a single police case has been registered over any of them in Punjab – where most of the incidents have been recorded – and Uttar Pradesh.Till November 9, there were 49,273 farm fires seen in Punjab alone. In UP, this number was 2,172. In both these states, the enforcement of a ban against burning crop residue first slackened last year, and has now virtually ceased with no FIR (first information report with police) being registered. This has correlated with a spike in the number of such incidents compared to recordings in 2018 and 2019.The second-highest numbers of farm fires are typically reported from Haryana -- this year, 6,929farm fires were recorded till November 9. Haryana Police officials said they have not yet collated information from districts on how many FIRs have been registered, seeking more time to provide the data. But data from one district, Karnal, showed that 70 FIRs were lodged.The main reasons why officials are going easy on enforcement are the farm protests and upcoming elections -- Punjab and UP are due to go to polls early next year.“We are now mute spectators. There is clear direction not to register any FIR against any farmer. The government does not want to anger farmers, who are a significant vote bank. Already, the farmers have been protesting,” said a deputy commissioner in Punjab, asking not to be named.In Punjab, the number of FIRs registered in 2019 was 1,737, which fell to 48 in 2020. This year, the number is zero.The official quoted above added that last year too, the administration went easy since farmers had begun protesting the Union government’s new farm laws in August 2020. That protest continues.Farmers are being issued challans for Environment Compensation fines at the rate of ₹1,500 per acre, but that too has remained only on paper since no recoveries are being made.Farm fires contribute some of the largest share of ultra-fine PM2.5 pollutants that choke the NCR region in the pre-winter weeks every year. This year, the number of farm fires has reached a new high for this late in November -- incidents usually begin to come down after November 7 but data accessed by HT show the number of fires on November 8 and 9 were the highest for these two dates since 2012, the earliest year for which data is available.Attempts to tackle the problem have failed, with challenges spanning deep-rooted issues pertaining to farm equipment, economics and, lately, politics. In 2019, the Supreme Court formally ordered a ban, which states have implemented using section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.The lack of action appears to correlate with a rise in incidents in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, till November 9, the total number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana was below 50,000, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) mission. In 2019, the year the ban was announced, it was the lowest since 2012 at 41,706.But in 2020, this number shot up to 65,753 in the October 1-November 9 period. This year, it stands at 56,202, and many experts warn that the process has simply been delayed because of an extended monsoon.Farmer unions have said that they need more financial incentive to stop burning paddy stubble, which is a cheap and quick way to clear their fields in the short window between harvesting of summer crops (which includes paddy) and the sowing of winter crops (most popularly, wheat).“Our demand is very simple. With rise in diesel prices and other farm machinery items, the in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy straw has become very expensive. Farmers are not able to spend ₹3,000- ₹5,000 extra to handle straw. Farmers are already under financial stress, if government wants that farmers should handle straw, they must provide ₹5,000 per acre as incentive for handling straw. Otherwise unions will continue to oppose any penal action,” said Jagtar Singh, a leader of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan).Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) nodal officer Samita, who goes by her first name only, said the agency only reports farm fires to respective districts, and action is left to the district administration and other concerned departments. “We are daily sending report to deputy commissioners who have to initiate action as per the roles defined by Punjab government,” she said.In Uttar Pradesh, experts from the pollution control board said they have recorded a roughly 18% increase in farm fires this year compared to 2020 in the month of November. VK Singh, the chief environmental engineer of UP Pollution Control Board, said most agricultural fires were reported from Saharanpur, Meerut, Baghpat, Bijnor, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Etawah, Mainpuri, Unnao, Maharajganj, Bahraich and Gonda districts.“West UP districts have more concentration of farm fires as compared to east UP districts,” Singh said.In UP, too, the enforcement of the ban has gradually collapsed. In 2020, more than 2,000 FIRs were registered over stubble burning by local administrations. In 2019, the number of FIRs was around 3,200. However, majority of these FIRs were later taken back by the district administration as anger over the farm laws began to spread last year.A farmer in a UP district echoed concerns voiced by the BKU representative quoted above.“The use of special combines and spraying of enzyme solution to remove stubble cost us more. Farmers with large landholdings may be able to afford them, but small farmers like us don’t have any option apart from burning it,” said Sarwajeet Singh, a farmer of the Kalan area of Shahajahanpur district in western UP.The Delhi government has been pushing states and the Union government to nudge other states and farmers to use what is known as the Pusa decomposer, a microbial bio-enzyme that can decompose crop residues, including stubble from paddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-fires-at-a-record-high-firs-by-2-ncr-states-nil-101636568841070.html

The official had bank deposits of ₹1.61 crore and paid an annual insurance premium of nearly ₹57.72 lakh.Samal and his wife Sasmita couldn’t explain the source of the assets, the official claimed. She has been charged with abetting her husband.“This is the highest-ever seizure of disproportionate assets by a state government official,” a second vigilance official said, underlining that the ₹14.87 crore figure was the acquisition value of the assets as is the norm for disproportionate assets cases, and not the market value which would be much higher.Director Vigilance Yeshwant Jethwa said his officials are committed to taking stronger actions against corruption in the coming days.“We have a proficient pool of skilled Investigators, a legal team comprising legal advisors, counsels, a financial wing with CAs (chartered accountants), banking officers for an in-depth analysis of financial transactions, a technical wing comprising civil engineers for valuation of properties. We are going to use the latest technology for investigations,” said Jethwa.The previous record for disproportionate assets unearthed by vigilance officials in Odisha was associated with former Indian Forest Service officer Abhay Kant Pathak. When he was raided in November last, officials allegedly found assets worth ₹9.35 crore.When vigilance officials raided Pratap Samal’s house on Tuesday, he allegedly pushed a carton packed with bundles of currency notes from his roof to his neighbour’s house in Bhubaneswar’s IRC village. But the vigilance officials saw him and brought back the carton.Officials counted currency notes totalling ₹20 lakh. Another ₹18 lakh was found in his house.Samal, who did a diploma in civil engineering, joined the corporation set up in 1980 to construct buildings for the police, as a junior engineer in August 1988. He was promoted to the rank of deputy manager in 2013, and drew a monthly salary of ₹71,000 last month, a vigilance official said.Last year, Odisha topped the states in lodging disproportionate assets cases against corrupt government officials. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 93 such cases were registered by Odisha in 2020 followed by Gujarat with 37 cases, and Tamil Nadu with 21 cases. The NCRB report said disproportionate assets amounting to ₹123.92 crore were seized in Odisha, up from ₹62.83 crore assets seized by the vigilance department from government employees in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/official-who-threw-out-rs-20-lakh-cash-arrested-has-rs-14-9-crore-assets-101636568601724.html
11-11-2021||India||Top court seeks report from Centre on Tihar reforms within 3 weeks||Absence of prompt action by the Centre to install jammers and body scanners at Tihar Central Jail, over a month after a secret report submitted by the Delhi Police chief to the Supreme Court disclosed serious security lapses at the jail, made the apex court remark on Wednesday that a “sorry state of affairs” exists at Tihar. The Court called for a report from the Union Home Secretary in three weeks providing an action plan to fill the gaps pointed out by the Delhi Police Commissioner in his report that the Court had forwarded to the Centre last month.A bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said, “We had recently read about deaths and suicides at Tihar Jail. It is a sorry state of affairs. The Centre cannot wait till something happens. You have to do something immediately.”The directions by the Court came in a pending proceeding related to completion of the Unitech housing projects since the arrest of former Unitech promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra facing probe by the Delhi Police, Serious Fraud Investigation Office and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) for cheating homebuyers and laundering their money to offshore shell companies.On October 6, the Court directed the two brothers to be removed from Tihar Jail and be lodged at separate jails in Mumbai after the ED disclosed their clandestine operations from jail and how Tihar officials were complicit in allowing the accused to launder money, influence witnesses and tamper with the probe.A confidential report prepared by Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana named the jail officials involved and proposed 23 action points needing immediate consideration of the Centre for enhanced prison management at Tihar. Some of these recommendations related to installation of jammers and body scanners. According to the ED, the Chandra brothers had access to the jail telephone and communicated to their staff through the mobile phones of certain jail officials. The Court ordered immediate suspension of the jail officials and directed a formal case to be registered.Appearing for the Delhi Police, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) KM Nataraj told the Court that pursuant to directions issued by Court, a FIR was registered on October 12 against 37 people which included 32 jail officials. However, he had no information on whether the named jail officials had been suspended as the jail came under the administration of the Delhi government.Even on the action taken on Asthana’s report, the ASG said that since the report had multiple recommendations, the same was under consideration of the Union Home Ministry. The Court said, “We find that neither any action plan nor any information has been provided by Centre on the steps taken,” and went on to direct the Union Home Secretary to take necessary steps in this regard and place an affidavit before the Court in three weeks detailing the action taken on the reforms suggested for enhanced prison management.The Court on October 6 while ordering suspension of the complicit jail officials said, “We direct the Ministry of Home Affairs to respond to the suggestions contained in the report of the Commissioner of Police so that remedial steps can be taken immediately, in terms of the report and in view of violation of the Jail Manual, for enhanced prison management.”A report prepared by Joint Director, SFIO filed on November 8 was also shared with the Court in a sealed cover on Wednesday detailing the progress of investigation into the web of companies operated by Chandra brothers following the ED revelation of having attached crime proceeds worth ₹7638 crore. The Court directed the latest SFIO report to be shared with ED and directed both agencies to submit updated status reports on investigation against Unitech and the Chandra brothers in four weeks. The Chandra brothers are facing prosecution since 2015 in separate cases accusing them of cheating homebuyers of 74 Unitech housing projects. A forensic audit ordered by the Supreme Court in 2018 revealed that the former Unitech promoters had siphoned off ₹1749 crore to foreign countries. The audit report prepared by M/s Grant Thornton India concluded that Chandra brothers collected more than ₹14,200 crore from nearly 30,000 homebuyers in their 74 residential projects. It was the claim of Unitech that they had spent close to ₹26,000 crore in the projects, much beyond what they received from homebuyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-seeks-report-from-centre-on-tihar-reforms-within-3-weeks-101636568481843.html
11-11-2021||India||India, 7 countries call for an inclusive govt in Afghanistan||Eight countries from the region, including India, Iran and Russia, pledged on Wednesday to combat terrorism emanating from Afghanistan and called for an open and inclusive government in Kabul with representation from all sections of Afghan society. In an apparent reference to Pakistan’s backing for the Taliban, a declaration issued at the conclusion of the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan – which was attended by top security officials from the eight countries – emphasised respect for Afghanistan’s sovereignty and non-interference in its internal affairs. The security officials pitched for collective efforts to counter extremism, radicalisation, separatism and drug trafficking in the region. The meeting, chaired by India’s national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval, was attended by Iran’s supreme national security council secretary, Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, Russia’s security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, and the security council heads of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. “We all have been keenly watching the developments in [Afghanistan]. These have important implications not only for the people of Afghanistan, but also for its neighbours and the region,” Doval said in televised remarks. “This is a time for close consultations amongst us, greater cooperation, interaction and coordination among the regional countries,” he said. This was the first regional meeting on Afghanistan convened by India since Kabul fell to the Taliban on August 15. However, the dialogue was the continuation of a mechanism whereby Iran hosted two meetings in 2018 and 2019. Pakistan and China were invited to the meeting but chose not to participate. Pakistan’s NSA Moeed Yusuf said last week he wouldn’t attend because India was being a “spoiler” in the region, while the Chinese side cited scheduling problems. The Delhi Declaration on Afghanistan, issued after the meeting, said the eight countries are committed to “combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its financing, the dismantling of terrorist infrastructure and countering radicalisation, to ensure that Afghanistan would never become a safe haven for global terrorism”. It said that “Afghanistan’s territory should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing any terrorist acts”. The declaration stressed the need to form “an open and truly inclusive government that represents the will of all the people of Afghanistan and has representation from all sections of their society, including major ethno-political forces in the country”. The inclusion of all sections of Afghan society in the administrative and political structure is “imperative for the successful national reconciliation process”, it said. The eight countries said they backed a peaceful, secure and stable Afghanistan while emphasising “respect for sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and non-interference in its internal affairs”. They expressed concern at the suffering of the Afghan people because of the security situation and condemned terror attacks in Kunduz, Kandahar and Kabul. The declaration emphasised the protection of the rights of women, children and minorities, and expressed concern at the deteriorating socio-economic and humanitarian situation. In this context, the declaration highlighted the need to provide urgent humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. While pointing to the UN’s “central role” in Afghanistan, the eight countries said humanitarian assistance should be provided in an “unimpeded, direct and assured manner”, and distributed in a non-discriminatory manner to all sections of Afghan society. The representatives of the eight countries, in brief opening statements, pushed for collective efforts to cope with threats such as terrorism and drug trafficking emanating from Afghanistan, and to provide humanitarian aid to Afghans before the onset of winter. Shamkhani referred to the challenges of terrorism and a refugee crisis, and said: “The solution comes only through the formation of an inclusive government with the participation of all ethnic groups.” Patrushev noted the proliferation of dialogue mechanisms on Afghanistan, including the Moscow Format and Turkic Council, and said it was important that these forums do not duplicate work but complement each other. Kazakhstan’s national security committee chairman Karim Massimov said his country is closely monitoring threats from Afghanistan. “With the Taliban movement coming to power, the situation inside the country remains complicated. There are many obstacles to form an effective government system,” he said. “Terrorist organisations are intensifying their activities. We are strongly concerned with the operations of the Central Asian fighters,” he added.Tajikistan’s security council secretary Nasrullo Rahmatjon Mahmudzoda said his country is concerned about developments following the Taliban takeover because it has a long border with Afghanistan. “The current situation creates extra risk and possibility for growth of drug trafficking, terrorism and criminality. The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains complicated currently under the influence of many negative factors,” he said. The security officials also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the dialogue. The meeting in Delhi coincided with the Taliban foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, beginning a three-day visit to Pakistan. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid expressed optimism over meetings on Afghanistan held in Islamabad, Moscow, Tehran and New Delhi. “We are optimistic because the whole region needs stability and security in Afghanistan...the meetings...pave the way to understanding, and they are hopefully in the benefit of Afghanistan,” Mujahid said. China’s special envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong will attend a meeting of the “extended troika” to be hosted by Pakistan on November 11. The meet will also be attended by the senior envoys of the US and Russia. Muttaqi’s delegation is expected to meet senior officials of all four countries while in Islamabad. Pakistan’s security establishment, with its close ties to the Taliban and the Haqqani Network, has gained influence in Kabul since August. At the same time, the Taliban are looking towards China for investments following the withdrawal of Western assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-7-countries-call-for-an-inclusive-govt-in-afghanistan-101636568241073.html

His home in Chennai’s T Nagar had ankle deep water, and his furniture was floating in it. Water was everywhere, but there was not a drop to drink -- pipes and taps were all running dry. His 96-year-old mother needed to be physically lifted to an apartment on a higher floor. Submerged under the water were the apartment’s electrical boxes, and therefore no power could be turned on for fear of electrocution.

Singh’s comments came while addressing the Indian Air Force’s top brass at the opening day of the three-day bi-annual commanders’ conference. The remarks come at a time when India and China have hardened their stance on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, and also in the eastern sector, with increased military activities on both sides of the boundary, infrastructure development, surveillance and combat manoeuvres by their armies. The two countries have been locked in a border standoff in Ladakh for over 18 months. Singh lauded IAF for its high level of preparedness and ability to respond to any situation at short notice. The minister also said enhancing jointness was essential and joint structures should be evolved after closely examining various options. He said inputs from all stake holders would be taken into consideration. “Expounding on theaterisation, he mentioned that enhancing jointness is essential and the structure should be evolved after closely examining various options, and inputs from all stakeholders would be taken into consideration,” the IAF said in a statementThe commanders of the IAF will carry out a comprehensive review of India’s security challenges along the borders with China and Pakistan at the conference from November 10-12.Addressing the commanders, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari stressed on the need to develop multi-domain capability to give a “swift and befitting response” to any misadventures by India’s adversaries. The air chief also highlighted the need for joint training with the army and the navy for synergised application of combat power in future conflicts. The department of military affairs (DMA), headed by chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, has asked the three services to expedite their ongoing studies on the creation of threatre commands, and submit comprehensive reports within six months. The deadline for submitting the reports has been advanced from September 2022 to April 2022. The current theaterisation model seeks to set up four new integrated commands for synergy in operations --- two land-centric theatres, an air defence command and a maritime theatre command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-need-to-stay-prepared-given-the-situation-at-borders-rajnath-singh-101636566561850.html
11-11-2021||India||In our better interest, says Taliban on India-led regional meet on Afghanistan||The Taliban regime in Kabul on Wednesday said the first regional meeting on Afghanistan convened by India was in its “better interest” and reiterated its stated policy that “its land will not be used against any country”.In an audio statement released hours after the Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan chaired by National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval wrapped up its deliberations, the Taliban regime’s spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said: “Though we are not present in this conference, we firmly believe that this conference is in the better interest of Afghanistan as the entire region is considerate of the current Afghan situation and the participating countries also must be thoughtful of improving and safeguarding the security situation in Afghanistan and helping the current government to ensure security in the country on its own”.The meeting, chaired by the Indian NSA, was attended by Iran’s supreme national security council secretary, Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, Russia’s security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, and the security council heads of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

11-11-2021||India||Globalisation and its discontents, in Haryana||From January 15, 2022, a law giving 75% reservation for local residents in private sector jobs will come into effect in Haryana. To be sure, the policy will only apply to jobs where the monthly salary is up to ₹30,000. The announcement has already triggered a rethink among IT companies currently located in the state, said a Business Standard report published on November 9. The policy appears to be an example of myopic populism, which could ultimately harm the economic prospects of the state. However, simply classifying it as that does not take into account the context behind the political economy of such decisions. Haryana is not the only state to implement or consider bringing such laws. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh are other states that have brought in such laws. Here are four charts that explain the political rationale behind them.Gurugram, the symbol of aspirations and exclusion in HaryanaIn 2002, Joseph Sitglitz (he received the Nobel Prize in economics in 2001) wrote a book called Globalization and Its Discontents. The book drew on Sitglitz’s experience as the chairman of the council of advisers to US President Bill Clinton and his term as the chief economist of the World Bank, and questioned the then entrenched dogma about the efficacy of Washington Consensus policies in promoting growth and well-being. Two decades since Stiglitz wrote his book, the discontent vis-a-vis globalisation has percolated from policy debates to the real world. Protectionism and populism are increasingly dominating politics across the world as it becomes clear that only a fraction of people have gained from the policies of globalisation. Gurugram is one of the best-case studies of this phenomenon.If one were to make a list of things that capture the transformation economic reforms have brought about in India, the city of Gurgaon or Gurugram, as it is known now, will probably be in the top five. What was a small town in the Aravalli foothills is now the abode of corporate India, especially companies in new-age sectors such as IT services, finance, and now startups. The rapid expansion of the corporate footprint has also led to an explosion in the white-collar workforce in the city. Most of this high-skilled workforce has come from outside the city, even the state, and in some cases outside India.While Gurugram’s growth did bring some capital gains for the local residents – land prices shot up as private builders started acquiring land for real estate development – those gains were skewed in favour of the landed elite and are mostly over now.For the average Haryanvi, Gurugram is both a symbol of aspiration and exclusion. There are far too few high-paying salaried jobs in the rest of the state compared to Gurugram, and the ones in Gurugram aren’t available to many locals. This gap is even bigger if one looks at the status of workers in rural Haryana. It is this aspiration and sense of exclusion which the policy is seeking to address by reserving private sector jobs for locals.

Sandeep Mawa, who runs a dry fruit shop at Bohri Kadal, also claimed that he escaped the attack on Monday as he left his shop early due to a prior intelligence input. His salesman, Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, was shot dead instead.“Making us run away and killing... is the policy. They (terrorists) are nobody’s friends,” the44-year-old said. “There is fear and my family, including my father, have been wanting to relocate. But how is running away a solution? For how long will we keep running? This has to stop somewhere. If a mistake has been committed by one, you cannot punish the others,” he added. It was in 1990 that the Mawas relocated to Delhi after the businessman’s father, Roshan Lal Mawa, was shot dead by terrorists. The family returned to Kashmir in 2019, after 28 years, and restarted their wholesale dry fruit business. Mawa said that on Monday, he was warned by police of a possible attack on him, following which he left his shop and returned home early. Hours later, terrorists mistook his salesman for the businessman and opened fire at him outside the shop. Khan died on the spot. “During the day, police informed me of an imminent attack and I left but my vehicle was left behind. In the evening, when Ibrahim opened my vehicle, he was fired upon. They mistook him for me,” Mawa said. The businessman, who lives with his father, mother, wife and two children, said he was also provided with personal security officers. A day later, a little-known organisation, Muslim Janbaaz Force, claimed responsibility for the attack on the businessman but later issued a corrigendum saying they had mistakenly killed his salesman.Khan is survived by his wife and two children.“Khan was like a brother to me. He always stayed with me... in Delhi, Bengaluru and even Jammu. It is unfortunate that he lost his life. We are trying to get a government job for his daughter or son,” Mawa said. Khan family quotes if we can get pleaseWhile Zoheb Tanveer, police superintendent (north), refused to comment on the matter, inspector general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar did not respond to a message sent by this reporter. The Mawas were among the bulk of Kashmiri Pandits who left the Valley after an insurgency erupted in the region in 1989. In 2016, the then state government had said that over 154,080 people migrated from the Valley in 1990.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/businessman-believed-to-be-actual-target-of-attack-vows-not-to-leave-kashmir-101636544000467.html

According to the order, only those citizens having taken at least one dose of the vaccine for Covid-19 will be able to get groceries from ration shops, gas cylinders from agencies and fuel from petrol pumps.If the order is not followed, the administration will take action against the people concerned, under the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act, Chavan said.In Aurangabad, about 55 per cent of the eligible population in the district have been inoculated so far, compared to 74 per cent in the state. This has put the district in the 26th place in terms of vaccination among 36 districts in Maharashtra.The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation has also started checking vaccination certificates of people coming to government and private offices. The Municipal Corporation has directed all petrol pumps to check Covid-19 vaccination certificates of all customers from November 30.Maharashtra has about seven million doses pending from the October stock with the state government likely to get over 20 million Covid-19 doses from the Centre for its vaccination drive. The state has also registered lowering demand as a section of the population has shown hesitancy for the second dose after the second wave of Covid-19 infections waned.Though there has been a steady supply of the vaccine the demand for it has gone down drastically since October mainly due to two factors including the mandatory 84 days gap between two doses and the declining number of Covid-19 cases.To increase the vaccination rate, the Aurangabad Zilla Parishad has decided to extend the inoculation process to the evening, another official said.“Many people work in agricultural fields from morning to evening. Hence, to facilitate their inoculation, the Zilla Parishad will undertake vaccination from 5 pm to 8 pm in the district,” the Zilla Parishad’s health officer Sudhakar Shekle said.The first such drive was organised on Tuesday in Kaygaon village, located on the Aurangabad-Ahmednagar district border, and 100 doses of vaccines were given to residents, he said.Public announcements were also being made to create awareness about the importance of vaccination, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-groceries-fuel-for-those-not-vaccinated-says-aurangabad-administration-101636543580218.html

The survey, which assesses the competencies developed by the students at the grade levels of third, fifth, and eighth, is conducted every three years.The survey was last conducted in 2017 and was scheduled to take place in 2020. However, due to the Covid-19 situation, it was postponed until this year.This is the first time when private schools have been included in the NAS for grades 3,5 and 8. Earlier, private schools were included for the class 10 NAS that is being conducted separately.Officials said the survey will be very crucial to assess the impact of the pandemic on the learning levels among students. “(The survey) will help to assess the learning interruptions and new learnings during the COVID pandemic and help to take remedial measures,” the Union education ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. It added National Council of Educational Research and Training has done the instrument development, testing, finalisation of the test items, sampling of the schools, etc.The Central Board of Secondary Education will conduct the test in the sampled schools in collaboration with the respective states and territories. “NAS 2021 will cover the entire spectrum of schools...”For students of classes third and fifth, the NAS will cover language, mathematics, and environmental studies. For those in class eight, it will be include language, mathematics, science, and social science.“The Test would be conducted in 22 mediums of instruction covering Assamese, Bengali, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Mizo, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Bodo, Garo, Khasi, Konkani, Nepali, Bhutia, and Lepcha,” the statement said.Also Read: Delhi Police arrests 3 for buying imported marijuana over dark net using bitcoinThe NAS 2017 report released in 2018 highlighted issues including how learning levels for mathematics were progressively lower among government school students as they progressed from class to class. The ministry later drafted some interventions based on the survey findings.“This year the findings would be more crucial in the backdrop of the pandemic. It will help to formulate better strategies to bridge the learning gap among students and to address the issues faced by them,” an official said.To ensure fair conduct of the survey, 1,82,488 field investigators, 1,23,729 observers, 733 district-level coordinators, and district nodal officers separately and 36 state nodal officers in each state and territory have been appointed. “Also, 1,500 board representatives have been appointed in the districts for monitoring overall functioning and ensuring fair conduct of the Survey.

Nawab Malik, on the other hand, said while fake notes were seized in other states after demonetisation on November 8 2016, there was not a single such instance in Maharashtra as Fadnavis swept the case under the carpet. Malik also said that Sameer Wankhede at that time was the joint director of the DRI. चलो आज BJP और ड्रग्स पेडलर के रिश्तों पे चर्चा करते है pic.twitter.com/FVjbOQ8jvfNawab Malik had earlier tweeted a photo of Amruta Fadnavis with alleged drug peddler Jaideep Rana.In a press meet on Wednesday, Nawab Malik alleged Fadnavis appointed people with criminal background when he was the chief minister. Fro example, the NCP minister said one Munna Yadav from Nagpur was made the chairman of the Maharashtra Construction Workers Welfare Board despite criminal charges like murder registered against him. Malik alleged that Fadnavis also sheltered an individual whose second wife was a Bangladeshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fadnavis-wife-has-one-word-for-nawab-malik-amid-bjp-ncp-slugfest-101636535608583.html
11-11-2021||India||Special court gives rhea access to bank accounts after a year||A special court has allowed a plea by Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty, seeking access to her bank accounts which were frozen after she was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in connection with a drugs case filed in relation to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death last year. The court, in a recent order, also allowed another plea for return of the actress’ electronic gadgets seized during the course of investigation last year. Rhea and her brother, Showik, along with at least two dozen others, were arrested by the NCB on September 8, 2020 on charges of facilitating procurement of drugs for consumption for Rajput, who was found dead at his apartment in Mumbai on June 14, 2020. The Chakraborty siblings have been on bail since October last year. In her first application, pertaining to her bank accounts, Rhea alleged that she needed access to her bank accounts for fulfilling various tax liabilities and to support her as well as her brother’s lifestyle. Having her accounts frozen for over 10 months caused her prejudice, she added. The actress’ counsel Satish Maneshinde argued that the NCB case will take time for disposal and it was not necessary to keep the accounts frozen. Opposing the plea, NCB’s counsel and special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande said a probe into the financial transactions was underway and providing its access to the actress could hamper the investigation.The court, however, observed that the investigating officer in the case said that he had left a decision on the matter to the discretion of the court, and allowed the de-freezing of accounts subject to conditions.“From the reply of the officer, it appears that there is no strong objection from the respondent side for unfreezing the bank account and FDs (fixed deposits) of the applicant,” the court said in its order.In such circumstances, she is entitled to unfreezing the bank account and FDs subject to conditions, it added. The court directed the actress to give an undertaking supported by an affidavit stating that during the pendency and conclusion of the trial, she will make the balance amount, as shown on September 16, 2020, available for necessary orders.The court separately ordered that the electronic gadgets seized be returned after due verification and identification upon executing a bond of ₹1 lakh.Sarpande said a laboratory, where Chakraborty’s seized phone and laptop were sent for forensic analysis, has returned the items and the investigating officer in the case has informed her that she can collect them.While granting her relief in the drugs case last year, the Bombay high court observed that Rhea was “not part of the chain of drug dealers”, and “she ha[d] not forwarded the drugs allegedly procured by her to somebody else to earn monetary or other benefits”.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), on orders of Supreme Court, is separately probing abetment to suicide charges against Rhea, as alleged by Rajput’s family. The Enforcement Directorate and NCB are investigating different aspects of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-case-rhea-chakraborty-s-accounts-to-be-unfrozen-101636535179898.html

"It was only after 12 at night when I received a call from Sameer that he was made to sign an arrest memo and that they were arresting him," she wrote. It was January 12, this year.Sameer Wankhede not completely out of picture, will assist in Aryan Khan case An Open Letter From The Wife Of An Innocent: THE BEGINNING#OpenLetter #SameeeKhan #NiloferMalikKhan #SameerWankhede #JusticeForSameer #WeWontBackDown #justiceoverinjustice #nawabmaliksameer pic.twitter.com/CEyVwSGiydNilofer spent the night at her parents' place and the following morning, she got a call from NCB officers for searching their house. "By the time I got there, they had already barged into our office since the guard had a spare key. After tossing our belongings around and thoroughly checking both the place, they found nothing, absolutely nothing," she wrote."We were ostracised by society, the media ran a vicious and biased trial against us where we were declared criminals without knowing our side of the story. My kids have been put through an ordeal no one should go through. They lost their friends, people were wary of even speaking to us. We were shunned overnight and terms like ‘peddlers’, 'peddler's wife', ‘drug traffickers’ were thrown at us," Nilofer wrote.Nilofer wrote that she will continue posting over the next few days offering glimpses of the torture that she had to bear.With Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik training his gun at the NCB and its Mumbai zone chief Sameer Wankhede, the arrest of Malik's son-in-law has been raked up as NCB officials said the minister has been attacking the central agency because of his personal interest.Nawab Malik's son-in-law got bail in September after spending eight months in prison in the drugs case which he claimed were herbal cigarettes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-called-peddler-s-wife-kids-lost-friends-open-letter-of-nawab-malik-s-daughter-101636210331810.html
