We will also study development of schools in rural and border areas of the state,” Pargat, who addressed a press conference on the issue on Friday, said. A former Olympian, Pargat categorically added that as a general principle, Punjab’s 19,377 schools could not be compared with just 2,767 schools in Delhi. “Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal must not indulge in cheap publicity and must raise questions of issue-based politics,” he said, adding, “The challenges and complexities of running a full-fledged state like Punjab with far-flung schools were a different challenge than managing schools in compact municipality like Delhi. We have seven-time more schools.” “The department has embarked on the recruitment of nearly 20,000 teachers in schools and colleges, which is expected to be completed by next month. A platform of top educationists from the state has been formed to improve employability,” he added. The minister also claimed that the student-teacher ratio in Punjab was 25, with Delhi at 33. “Punjab has maintained zero percent dropout rate up to upper primary level,” Pargat claimed. SISODIA RESPONDS: SET DATE AND TIME FOR A SCHOOL TOURResponding to Pargat, Sisodia offered to send a list of 250 Delhi schools and also sought a list of 250 government schools from him. Sisodia has also asked Pargat to set a date and time of his choice for a tour of the best schools listed in Delhi and Punjab, and a debate on education system and reforms in the presence of the media. “Punjab’s school education minister has accepted my challenge for a debate on education reforms in 250 schools in Delhi and Punjab. I am waiting for the list of the best 250 schools in Punjab, which have improved in the last 5 years,” he tweeted. Sisodia added that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was visiting Mohali on November 27, where he would meet the protesting teachers. “Who better to tell about improvements made in schools than teachers teaching there?” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ready-for-debate-with-sisodia-on-govt-schools-pargat-101637951387869.html
26-11-2021||Gurugram||Air quality in Gurugram ‘very poor’ for third day in a row||The air quality in the city worsened on Friday but continued to remain in the ‘very poor’ category for the third consecutive day even as pollution levels spiked in neighbouring Delhi and Faridabad with the air quality turning ‘severe’. Experts said low wind speed and drop in temperatures have come in the way of effective dispersion of pollutants. According to the air quality index (AQI) bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Gurugram recorded an AQI of 379 on Friday, higher than the recording of 334 on Thursday. Data shared by the air monitoring stations in the city showed that Vikas Sadan and Teri Gram recorded AQI 381, Sector 51 station recorded an AQI of 398, and the recording at Gwal Pahari was 355. According to CPCB guidelines, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 to 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 to 200 ‘moderate’, 201 to 300 ‘poor’, 301 to 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 to 500 ‘severe’.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the air quality is likely to deteriorate further due to static winds.“Mostly calm or slow winds during night are unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to improve marginally but remain in the upper end of very poor category on Saturday and Sunday. For the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain in very poor category,” said the IMD in its forecast. The maximum temperature recorded on Friday was 26 degrees Celsius while the minimum was 10°C. Dr Anurani Sharma, associate professor at Teri School of Advanced Studies, said the air quality was deteriorating due to meteorological conditions. “The contribution from external sources of pollution has reduced, local sources of pollution producing dust and vehicular pollution are to be blamed now. We need to take immediate steps to reduce local pollutants as dispersal is not happening,” she said, adding that there could be slight relief from Monday onwards. Meanwhile, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said they have intensified patrolling to curb pollution and also started issuing penalties to those found violating pollution control norms. “Construction sites and industrial areas are continuously being monitored. The objective is to reduce local pollutants. Once the speed of wind improves, the air quality will be better,” said Kuldip Singh, regional officer, north, HSPCB. Officials at the department of town and country planning also said that their teams are continuously moving around in private colonies and enforcing pollution norms. “I went to DLF Phase 1 to interact with residents and apprise them about building plan violations and NGT norms. Instructions were issued to plot owners regarding construction waste management and other matters related to pollution,” said R S Bhath, district town planner, enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-in-gurugram-very-poor-for-third-day-in-a-row-101637951208629.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||Post 26/11, BMC’s focus: in-house capacity building, communication||The November 26, 2008 Mumbai terror attacks prompted state and civic authorities to identify and tackle loopholes in security, communication, and disaster response, a process that has, according to senior officials, evolved over the last 13 years. Various agencies have reportedly streamlined their standard operating protocols (SOPs), improved coordination between state and central entities, and ensured that surveillance systems are ramped up. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) disaster management department, the first-responder agency for any emergency situation in the city, focuses on refining two major aspects of disaster response: communication and in-house capacity building. A home department official said, “Though the Disaster Management Act mandates that district, city and state level bodies take care of disaster management, they were not in place. There was confusion over the responsibility, hierarchy and the steps to be taken at any level. It took us hours to activate the Mantralaya control room. Since then, we have modernised the police force, procured weapons and built a CCTV network.” Besides the dedicated National Security Guard (NSG) teams in Mumbai, the state has permanently posted 14 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams in the state, including three in Mumbai and 10 in Pune. “Though specialised operations involving guns or other weapons will be armed forces’ domain, NDRF is equipped and trained to handle any type of disaster including a nuclear attack,” the official said. “Its major role is in rescue and relief. For this, the NDRF has specialised response teams.” “A major lapse during the 26/11 attack was coordination. We have put in place better coordination protocols in accordance with the Pradhan commission recommendations.” The Pradhan Commission report said, “What we have found are instances of lack of intelligent appreciation of threats, handling of intelligence, maintaining high degree of efficiency in instruments specifically set up to deal with terrorist attacks and certainly lack of overt and visible leadership in carrying out operations to face multi-targeted attacks… While senior police officials at Mumbai police headquarters were clueless about the protocol to follow to monitor the situation, the political leadership in Mantralaya took hours to take decisions on steps to be taken.” The home department official said, “Our major achievement was building the CCTV network in Mumbai and other key cities such as Pune, Nagpur, and Aurangabad. Mumbai has a network of 5600 cameras installed by the state government at a cost of ₹1100 crore. The state-owned network has since been integrated with the network of CCTVs owned by Mumbai’s private establishments.” In March 2019, BMC inaugurated its City Institute of Disaster Management in Parel, which houses a second disaster management control room, an exact replica of the main control room at the BMC headquarters. “If the main control room fails, the second one will fire up in 19 seconds,” a civic official said. As part of the GIS-based system, notifications are sent to agencies that need to be mobilised. There is an SOP for each type of disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/post-26-11-bmc-s-focus-in-house-capacity-building-communication-101637951147301.html
26-11-2021||Lucknow||BSP keeps away from Constitution Day prog, Mayawati cites reasons||Lucknow: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president Mayawati on Friday asked the central and state governments to seriously think whether or not they were following the Constitution in the true spirit. She had announced in the morning that her party would not take part in the programmes being organised on Constitution Day. In a statement, Mayawati said the benefits given to SC/STs by the Constitution had not reached them. “The government does not have the moral right to celebrate Constitution Day. It should apologise to these sections of society and promptly rectify this shortcoming,” she said. “On Constitution Day, the central and state governments need to seriously review whether or not they are following the Indian Constitution properly in all honesty.The BSP feels that it is not being done and the governments need to think over it,” she said. “There is SC, ST and OBC reservation backlog in government jobs for which they are fighting on the roads. No effort has been made till now to provide reservations in private jobs. The central and state governments are not ready to frame any law for this,” she said. Meanwhile, Mayawati also announced the appointment of Rasra MLA Uma Shankar Singh as leader of the BSP legislature party, after Shah Alam, who was occupying the post, resigned as MLA and from the party on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-keeps-away-from-constitution-day-prog-mayawati-cites-reasons-101637950969568.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||13 years of 26/11: How prepared are we?||On January 5, 2009, two months after 10 sea-borne terrorists launched a deadly attack on Mumbai that left 166 people dead and 238 injured, the Maharashtra government issued a government resolution sanctioning funds to hire boats to patrol the coastline. Three police stations were notified as responsible for coastal policing — their jurisdiction ranged from the seashore to 12 nautical miles off the city’s 114-kilometre coastline.In 2021, the Sagari police, as they are referred to, remains under-equipped. Even today, there are only three stations — Yellow Gate police station in South Mumbai, Sagari 1 at Mahim and Sagari 2 at Gorai in North Mumbai — whose mandate includes investigating and preventing crimes in territorial waters. To be sure, there are other stations whose jurisdiction involves patrolling the coastline, but their jurisdiction only extends to the shore.While Yellow Gate police station —responsible for the coastline between Sassoon docks and Vashi bridge and operating with a sanctioned strength of 152 personnel, including 12 officers — was already tasked with policing the high seas before the 26/11 attack, the other two came up a few years after the terror siege.Sagari I PS, which came up in 2012, has a sanctioned strength of 60 policemen and was tasked to look after coastal security between Sassoon docks and Juhu. Sagari II PS, which came up in 2013 was charged with keeping the northern coast of the city, between Juhu and Dahisar, secure. It has a sanctioned strength of 120 personnel. The force has about 20 boats to patrol the coastline. In 2016, the Mumbai Sagari police acquired 10-speed boats— eight equipped with 500 horsepower (HP) engines and two with 750 HP engines — to patrol territorial waters; the rest patrol the shoreline. However, police officers said that only 12 (including speedboats) are operational. Some break down often, making it risky for policemen to patrol the sea beyond four nautical miles.A senior IPS officer said that the boats have to be sent to the repair centre and spare parts come from the Goa shipping yard, a government facility.A second officer said that at present, three working boats are allotted to the Yellow Gate police station and two each are allotted to Sagari I and Sagari II stations. A team of seven policemen — one sub-inspector, three members of the constabulary, two technical staff members and the driver — patrol the coast within their respective jurisdictions in the speed boats twice a day.In the aftermath of the 26/11 attacks, the Mumbai police were also equipped with 18 amphibious vehicles (though they are called amphibious, they are not sea vehicles), which were distributed to the police stations on coastal areas including Gorai, Malwani, Versova, and Juhu.With their wide tyres, these vehicles move easily on the sand and water. However, from 2013 onwards, some were seen parked at police stations. “Some of these vehicles were working till 2014 and even in 2015, but after that, they became dysfunctional and have since been removed from police stations as well,” said the second police officer.A year after the 26/11 attacks, four Sea-Legs (boats with wheels that can also operate on the shore and road, but with limited speeds) were procured by the state government and provided to Girgaum, Dadar, Juhu and Versova police stations. They too stopped functioning after a few years.“I have not seen them functioning after 2013 because their parts were unavailable in India. Sea-legs were capable of moving on both land and water and could travel at over 40 knots in the water and over 10 km per hour on land,” said a third senior police officer.He said that the spare parts of these vehicles are not available in India.In the latest move to upgrade the infrastructure of the existing Coastal security system, in 2018, the Maharashtra government decided to construct Marine Operation Rooms (MOR) at 10 major landing points of Mumbai’s coast, including Badhwar Park in Colaba where the 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives on the night of November 26, 2008. These rooms are meant to serve as quick response posts for marine combat.“The formation of three MORs would be done on a pilot project basis at Sassoon Docks, Marve in Malad and near Bandra end of the Bandra-Worli Sealink,” a senior Mumbai police officer had said ahead of the 26/11 anniversary in 2018.Three years on, none of the MORs has come up.“We require at least two police personnel posted round-the-clock at each of these landing points. Currently, due to lack of staff, we are compelled to post one person at each of the points, that too without any support of modern equipment,” said a third police officer.“Most importantly, we require more life jackets and bulletproof jackets which are currently in one digit per police station,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/13-years-of-26-11-how-prepared-are-we-101637950968504.html
26-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: NHAI, contractors fined for failing to curb pollution on Sohna Road||Keeping in line with the directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to take action against those failing to take pollution control measures, the state pollution control board on Friday imposed a penalty of ₹10 lakh on the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and its two contractors constructing the elevated road at Sohna. Officials from the pollution control board said its team inspected the entire Sohna road and found that the highways authority and its contractors had not taken exhaustive measures to curb air pollution, despite repeated directions from authorities and the CAQM. Kuldip Singh, regional officer (north), Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said action is being taken against those found violating pollution control norms and neither the government agencies nor the private companies, which are executing various projects, are being spared. “We issued the penalty after our teams found several violations on the Sohna Road. We have closed all stone crushers in this zone, construction has been stopped and project developers have been asked to take adequate measures to curb air pollution,” said Singh. On Thursday, the pollution board’s night patrolling team discovered five locations, where diesel generator sets were being used and were made to turn off. “We imposed an environmental compensation penalty of ₹50,000 on these sites collectively,” said Singh. Officials from the pollution control board said following directions of the Supreme Court and the CAQM, they have intensified action against individual violators as well as companies, which are found violating pollution control norms. “We have decided to impose heavy penalties to send a clear message that violations will not be tolerated,” said Singh. On Thursday, the department imposed a penalty of ₹12.25 lakh on violators across the city. A penalty of ₹10 lakh was also imposed on NHAI and its contractor building the Dwarka Expressway. Three construction sites in Udyog Vihar and one in Sohna were also penalised for violations on Thursday, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-nhai-contractors-fined-for-failing-to-curb-pollution-on-sohna-road-101637950967207.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC stays trial court order directing action against cops in rape case||The Delhi high court on Friday stayed an order of a trial court directing action against a station house officer (SHO ) and an investigating officer (IO) for filing distinct charge sheets in connection with the rape of a minor.Justice Anu Malhotra stayed an order dated November 24 in which the trial court had said that appropriate legal action be taken against the IO and SHO concerned after prima facie opining that they had committed offences of punishable under the Indian Penal Code.“Without any observations on the merits and demerits of the petition, it is considered essential that the State submits its status report in the matter and that furthermore the trial court record in its physical and e form be requisitioned for the next date of hearing. The applications if any filed by the complainant and accused seeking supply of charge sheet be also placed on record under supervision of concerned district and sessions judge…The matter is directed to be re-notified on December 9 till which date the operation of the order dated November 24 is stayed,” the court said.The trial court, in its order dated November 24, observed that the action of the police officers was purely mala fide and vicious while also calling for a compliance report before November 26.While one set of the charge sheets was filed with the court and accused’s counsel, the other was filed with the public prosecutor and complainant’s counsel, wherein material facts were allegedly omitted.On November 17, the court had said that such conduct was a big slap on the motto of Delhi Police “Shanti, Sewa, Nyay” wherein Nyay (justice) had been taken for a ride.Challenging the order, the SHO and IO moved the high court, seeking to set aside the orders and expunging the remarks made by the trial court.Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Geeta Luthra, submitted that there was no deliberate or motivated act on the part of the petitioners and that it was only an inadvertent error.Appearing for the state, additional public prosecutor Rishikesh Kumar, also supported the petition while submitting that an enquiry was in progress.He said that what was placed on the record of the court was only the amended charge sheet and that there was only an inadvertent error on behalf of the petitioners.In this case, the accused person was arrested in March for allegedly kidnapping and raping a 14-year-old girl. An FIR was registered under sections 363 (kidnapping), 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage), 376 (rape), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-stays-trial-court-order-directing-action-against-cops-in-rape-case-101637950847292.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||Women have a greater say in healthcare and household purchases: Survey||There has been a significant improvement in the number of women having a say in household decisions pertaining to healthcare and household purchases and the operating of bank accounts, according to the findings of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), released on Wednesday. Experts said that while there were positive developments on the banking and decision-making front, the gains did not translate into land-holding patterns, with the number of women owning land and houses declining. The survey shows that a greater number of women in the age group 15-49 years had a say in making decisions pertaining to healthcare for themselves, major household purchases, and visits to family and relatives. The number of women having a say in these decisions increased from 73.8% in 2015-16 to 92% in 2020-21. The data for the survey was collected in two phases -- between January 4, 2020 and March 2, 2020 (prior to the Covid-19 lockdown), and between November 21, 2020 and January 20, 2021. A total of 9,486 households, 11,159 women, and 1,700 men were surveyed in the Capital. All the comparative figures are from NFHS-4, for which data was collected in 2015-16. The findings also showed that there was a jump in the number of women owning bank accounts from 64.5% to 72.5%. The number of women who own a mobile phone also increased from 66.6% to 73.8%. Another positive marker showed that the number of women who worked in the past year and were paid in cash increased from 21.1% to 24.9%.Shalini Sinha, India country representative of Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), said that the number of women who own a bank account did not necessarily translate into asset creation for women in a patriarchal society. “Access to financial income may improve the bargaining power that women have in the house. However, such shifts usually take place after a long-drawn process,” said Sinha.She added that just one indicator of access to a bank account alone did not mean economic empowerment, and there were a number of other factors at play, which, combined together, indicated economic empowerment. “One should encourage initiatives that seek to link women to banking services because it is a fact that the whole household can prosper if women are earning and saving regularly. However, opening a bank account alone doesn’t mean economic empowerment,” said Sinha.As per the survey, the number of women owning land or a house decreased 34.9% to 22.7%. Jaya Velankar, director, Jagori, a Delhi-based women’s organisation, said that women in India had been denied land traditionally due to the belief that the land will be divided when women marry into another family. “Land ownership in Indian societies is usually vested with fathers and sons. Women are denied property rights since there is a belief that more people will lay claim to the land when a woman is married into another family,” said Velankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/women-have-a-greater-say-in-healthcare-and-household-purchases-survey-101637950547310.html

Kejriwal is also busy now in doing politics on stubble burning and pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/modi-kejriwal-only-busy-in-giving-ads-claims-congress-101637950487168.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||Survey shows increase in cases of anaemia across India||There has been an increase in anaemia—a condition that results in low concentration of the blood-carrying cell haemoglobin—across age group and gender, according to the recently released data for the complete fifth round of the National Family Heath Survey, prompting the government to take a “hard look” at its Anaemia Mukt Bharat programme, according to a senior government official. “The Anaemia Mukt Bharat programme was launched in 2018 and a large part of the survey was conducted in 2019 itself, hence the full impact of the programme might not have been captured. However, the numbers still shouldn’t have gone up. This indicates that we need to take a hard look at the programme—probably modify or add supplements, change diet packages, and address the core issue of nutrition throughly,” the official said, requesting anonymity. The Anaemia Mukt Bharat programme focuses on prophylactic iron folic acid supplementation, identification of anaemic cases, and their referral and treatment, in addition to improving nutrition. Anaemia has increase in children between the ages of 6 and 59 months to 67.1% from 58.6% in the previous round of survey conducted in 2015-16. In women between the ages of 15 and 49 years, it has increased to 57% from 53.1%; in pregnant women it has gone up to 52.2% from 50.4%. The data for the survey was collected in two phases -- between January 4, 2020 and March 2, 2020 (prior to the Covid-19 lockdown), and between November 21, 2020 and January 20, 2021. A total of 9,486 households, 11,159 women, and 1,700 men were surveyed in the Capital. All the comparative figures are from NFHS-4, for which data was collected in 2015-16. Severe anaemia during pregnancy can lead to several complications including pre-term birth. There are two reasons for high prevalence of anaemia in India—one, the cutoff for the level of haemoglobin is high and better suited for Caucasian population and two, the levels are lower when a prick test is conducted. One of the anomalies is likely to be address during the next round of NFHS for which data collection will begin in 2022. “The measured value of haemoglobin is lower when a finger prick test is conducted as opposed to blood drawn from the veins. Now, in NFHS-5 the prick test was conducted but we are planning to measure the haemoglobin level from blood drawn from the vein for the next round of survey to discount at least the measurement bias,” the official said. The official explained that the need for haemoglobin to carry oxygen throughout the body is directly proportional to the muscle mass. The current cutoff for haemoglobin levels is 12gm/decilitre for women and between 11 and 12gm/decilitre for children. A study from the Indian Institute of Population Sciences, Delhi, and St. John’s Medical College, Bengaluru, suggests this is high for Indians and is leading to anaemia being over-diagnosed in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/survey-shows-increase-in-cases-of-anaemia-across-india-101637950307160.html

26-11-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh alert over new Covid variant||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh health department has sounded an alert about the new variant of Covid ‘B.1.1529’ found in South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana. In an advisory to all chief medical officers in the state, additional chief secretary, medical and health Amit Mohan Prasad has asked them to focus on travellers coming from or transiting through these countries and reaching Uttar Pradesh, as well as their contacts. Such travellers should be taken as those coming from ‘at risk’ countries and their rigorous screening should be done as per the guidelines from the Union ministry of health and family welfare, he said. South Africa has reported six cases of the new variant ‘B.1.1529’ while Hong Kong has reported one case and Botswana three cases till now. The chief medical officers have been advised to take samples of all such travellers for genome sequencing. The district surveillance officers shall do the follow-up with contacts of these travellers and also ensure the genome sequencing. “Genome sequencing is a key tool to check whether a certain variant of Covid is present in the population, as was applied in the past. With quick screening and genome sequencing, spread of the infection can be checked,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. “We are already screening all travellers coming to the state from other countries and also states where Covid cases are still being reported in high number. Focus will be increased as per the advisory,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, chief medical officer of Lucknow. The health department has written a letter to premier medical institutes, including the PGI and King George’s Medical University, where patients from abroad come for treatment, to compulsorily screen all patients from foreign countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-alert-over-new-covid-variant-101637949768863.html
26-11-2021||Dehradun||‘Might be arrested’: BJP leader moves HC in Khurshid house vandalisation case||DEHRADUN: A local leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party Kundan Singh Chilwal has asked the Uttarakhand high court to stop the police from arresting him in the case relating to vandalism of Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s Nainital house on November 15, people familiar with the matter said.Kundan Singh Chilwal cited a police report that alleged he led the mob that vandalised the house, insisting that he did lead a protest 100metres from Khurshid’s house, left and later returned when he heard about the vandalism, adding that he tried to put out the fire.A single bench of justice Alok Kumar Verma heard the petition on Friday. The hearing will continue on Saturday.Chilwal’s lawyer RS Sammal said they sought a stay on the BJP leader’s arrest since he did not have any role in vandalising Salman Khurshid’s house which was later set afire by a group of miscreants.“In its report, police has stated that Kundan Singh Chilwal was leading the mob that vandalised the house. We have apprised the court that Chilwal, who is a local BJP mandal leader, held a protest nearly 100metres from the house and left the area after the protest. When he came to know about the vandalisation, he returned and tried to put out the fire, which is also evident in the video of the incident,” Sammal said.The incident took place amid controversy over Khurshid’s book “Sunrise Over Ayodhaya: Nationhood In Our Times”. In a chapter titled ‘The Saffron Sky’ in the book, Khurshid has written, “Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints were being pushed aside by a robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years.”A protest outside Khurshid’s house against the book on November 15 turned violent when a group of people threw stones, fired shots at the house and set it afire.Bhowali police told the high court that they have arrested four people in the case but underlined that Chilwal was leading the protest, Sammal said.Ravindra Singh Bisht, counsel of Sunder Ram, caretaker of Salman Khurshid’s house and one of the respondents in the case said that state government sought a day’s time to file an affidavit. “The state government will submit its affidavit on Saturday (November 27) when the court will hear the matter”, he said. PS Mehra, the officer in charge of the Bhowali police station, said the probe was based on the caretaker’s complaint in which only one person was named.“During the investigation, police has been trying to identify other people involved in the protest. Based on a video clip, four people were arrested on November 18. Chilwal was also spotted in the video and he said that he led the protest”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/might-be-arrested-bjp-leader-moves-hc-in-khurshid-house-vandalisation-case-101637949767165.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||MVA turns 2: Survival of the politically fittest||On Sunday, November 28, a most unlikely of political coalitions – the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – completes two years in office. And quite like any unlikely political coalition, its single biggest achievement could well be its survival, with the uncertainty of the next three years not going to make the journey to the 2024 election any simpler. In that sense, its real test begins now. Of the 24 months, 20 were spent battling the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, there were natural calamities such as cylones and floods, action by central agencies such as Enforcement Directorate (ED), Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against MVA leaders, and the frequent friction with Delhi, where the BJP has absolute majority in the Lok Sabha. The latter may have just begun. Unending uncertainty On November 28, 2019, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was sworn in as chief minister to head a three-party coalition formed unexpectedly after the BJP and Sena broke their 35-year-old alliance over differences pertaining to sharing of the chief minister’s post. The Sena then joined hands with NCP and Congress to form the MVA and, later, the government once a power-sharing ratio and common minimum programme was agreed upon. The common agenda the three parties shared: keep BJP out. NCP chief and former union minister Sharad Pawar played a key role in making this happen, and in the process even the Sena played the smaller partner, even if its chief was invited to lead the government. There have been accusations that the other parties – specifically the chief minister -- have been a “puppet in the hands of Pawar.” However, Thackeray seems to have managed to create his own identity. A Senior Shiv Sena leader said, “The BJP attacks to destabilise the government have been relentless. The financial blockade by the Centre, the continuous scrutiny of our leaders using central agencies, all of this has kept the MVA on tenterhooks.” Besides, the BJP tried to corner the coalition government over the issues such as actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, the Antilia explosives scare, Thane trader Mansukh Hiran’s murder, allegations by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against then home minister Anil Deshmukh, and raids and notices by the central agencies. “This created the impression that Thackeray government will crumble anytime,” the Sena leader said, “but it has somehow survived.” Facing challenges Barely three months into its tenure, the MVA government already faced its biggest challenge – a rampaging Covid-19 pandemic that hit Maharashtra with unprecedented ferocity both in the first wave in April to June, and then in the second wave in 2021. It overwhelmed the health infrastructure, crippled state finances and brought development work to a sudden halt. In all of this, the revenue deficit mounted to more than ₹79,000 crore in FY 2020-21. An IAS officer closely associated with the Covid-19 fight said, “Bed shortage in the first wave hit us hard, and the shortfall in oxygen supply in the second was challenging, too. But we increased the number of beds from 80,000 to more than half a million. We managed to get oxygen from other states and saved lives. Maharashtra accounts for 20% of the cases and a third of all of the deaths in the country, leading to stinging criticism from the opposition. But leaders close to Thackeray said that he demanded transparency and accountability in data. “In some states, data was manipulated to hide the severity of the spread,” a Sena leader close to the Thackeray family said. “But the CM never allowed his officers to do that.” The transparency was ultimately praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and some independent agencies assessing the state’s Covid management. Maharashtra also witnessed two major cyclones Nisarg and Taukte, in addition to seasonal and unseasonal downpours leading to flooding, and the consequent displacement of hundreds of thousands in western Maharashtra. The state had to allocate more than ₹30,000 crore as relief, hurting the exchequer further. BJP leader and finance minister in the Fadnavis government Sudhir Mungatiwar said the Thackeray government has failed on all fronts. “The government kept cursing the Centre for no reason,” he said. “This won’t last long. Nobody, be it worker, farmer, industrialist or the common man, is happy with the government. They have realised the government cares only for the liquor industry. In two years, they have taken five decisions to benefit the liquor industry.” Political commentator Hemant Desai said the Thackeray government could not achieve much in two years. “The BJP-led Fadnavis had announced projects such as the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Expressway, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan, both of which the public could relate to, but the MVA has no signature project. Shiv Sena lacks the vision needed to lead a state like Maharashtra, nor does it have the experience. The government has been spending most of its precious time in fighting a perception battle,” he opined. However, Public Works Department minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan said, “We have performed well, considering the challenges of the last two years. Centre has adopted a non-cooperation mode, by creating a financial impasse by not releasing the rightful GST dues.” He added, “BJP leaders in Maharashtra left no stone unturned to destablise our government. In the garb of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and the Palghar lynching case, they hatched a conspiracy to defame us. People have now realised that BJP’s hunger for power, and our success in recent polls is a good sign.” The way aheadThe removal of restrictions at the fag end of the second wave meant that the state’s economy could recover a bit, but with the rider that both the opposition and the voting public will put the rest of the tenure under the scanner. A retired IAS officer and a former state bureaucrat, who did not wish to be named for this story, said, “The Samruddhi Expressway, the Metro rail network, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Line, and the Coastal Road were rolled out by the previous government. The Thackeray government has not been able to sustain the pace. In fact, in two cases – the Metro car shed and the Samruddhi expressway first phase deadline – there has been a significant delay.” To top this, Thackeray and his ministers have to resolve the contentious issue of reservation for Marathas and OBCs. A section of the Maratha and OBC communities feel the MVA has failed to safeguard their interests. Observers believe that infighting among the three ruling parties is expected to resurface during the local body elections scheduled to be held over the next six months. The Congress has announced it will go solo, while interests of Shiv Sena and NCP are likely to clash in local bodies in Pune, Navi Mumbai, Nashik though they are keen on joining hands. “The three parties may have to part ways in Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in 2024,” a senior Congress leader said. “If they fight collectively, their success rate remains high, but it shrinks the party base. Chavan added, “There could be differences between the ruling parties as we were joining hands with Shiv Sena for the first time. We might have committed a few mistakes in two years, but corrective measures too were taken. We never were adamant or never acted vindictive against dissident voices.” Mungantiwar said the three parties had nothing to be afraid of if they had not done anything wrong. “Shouldn’t the Central agencies not take action? If a couple of ministers out of 43 are caught, why should the rest worry? Instead of crying foul, the government should keep working for the welfare of the people every moment they get in the power,” he said. Desai said the Thackeray government can no longer hold the central government responsible for its inefficiencies or hold the Covid-19 responsible for non-performance. “The remaining three years are going to be really challenging for them. They cannot point at the Centre now for non-cooperation. The three parties will have to have better planning and strategies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-turns-2-survival-of-the-politically-fittest-101637949587113.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||MVA turns two: For Pawar, the heat is on||On November 2 this year, Enforcement Directorate, the country’s premier financial investigations agency, arrested Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh over money-laundering charges. This was unprecedented. No home minister in the state has ever been arrested, on such serious charges. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray dated March 20, 2021, senior IPS officer and former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh forced a police officer named Sachin Vaze – then the chief of the crime intelligence unit – to “accumulate ₹100 crore a month”. Singh wrote, “For achieving the aforesaid target, the Hon’ble Home Minister told Shri Vaze that there are about 1,750 bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai and if a sum of Rs. 2-3 lakhs each was collected from each of them, a monthly collection of Rs. 40-50 crores was achievable.” Singh made these allegations days after being shunted out as the city’s top cop over his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare case and in the murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. In the portfolio sharing agreement between the three parties of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), the home department was allocated to NCP. But, Deshmukh is not the lone minister or NCP leader in the central agencies’ radar. Three others – deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, rural development minister Hasan Mushrif and former revenue minister Eknath Khadse – have been scrutinised or questioned. The Income Tax (I-T) department has also conducted raids at establishments linked with Ajit Pawar and his three sisters. It was Sharad Pawar who cobbled together a three-party coalition by bringing together Congress and Shiv Sena in an alliance, an impossible task till 2019. Political observers said “BJP is targeting NCP” because it thinks Sena can be its future ally. Going after Pawar and his party, observers point out, could make the BJP feel that the 81-year-old Maharashtra veteran, who wants to play a role in putting forth a nationwide alternative to the BJP, may be discouraged. Pawar, however, has started retaliating by hitting back at the Narendra Modi-led BJP government in Delhi. On November 18, Pawar said in a rally in Nagpur, “You (BJP) are spreading propaganda against a person (Anil Deshmukh). He came to meet me and said that the complaint has been made by the police commissioner. Until the probe is completed, he doesn’t want to stay in this position and he is stepping down as home minister. We will not keep quiet. You (BJP) have sent him (Anil Deshmukh) behind the bars and will be made to pay the price of every day and every hour.” Political analyst Abhay Deshpande said both the NCP and Shiv Sena are under attack as BJP needs either of them to form a government in Maharashtra. “Both NCP and Shiv Sena are under attack as Pratap Sarnaik , MP from Yavatmal-Washim Lok Sabha constituency Bhavana Gawali, former MP Anandrao Adsul and state transport minister Anil Parab also face a probe by central agencies,” Deshpande said. “Both are the parties that can join hands with the BJP but are not doing so and thus are being targeted. Central agencies are more active in Maharashtra than other states.” He said Pawar’s aggression against BJP also strengthens his purpose of playing a larger role in national politics by uniting opposition parties against the BJP. “The opposition parties are looking to unite and even though he is not being accepted as their leader, he is working as a convenor. Earlier, Congress was the main party and other parties used to play second fiddle. No longer. Today’s Congress is weak and not in a position to bring the parties together. Pawar has a major role to play in national politics in the current scenario.” Apart from investigating Deshmukh, on July 1, the ED attached the Jarandeshwar Cooperative Sugar Mill in Satara, a factory allegedly linked with Ajit Pawar’s relatives on the grounds that it was auctioned at an undervalued price by Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank when the latter was one of its directors. Three months later, income tax department sleuths carried out raids and searches at the premises of multiple sugar mills and real estate groups, including those linked to Ajit Pawar, his three sisters and his son Parth on October 7. NCP leader Eknath Khadse, too, faces an ED probe in an alleged money laundering case tied to a land deal in Bhosari in Pune. ED started investigating Khadse just two months after he quit the BJP in October 2020. Once a BJP heavyweight, Khadse is under scrutiny for allegations of graft and conflict of interest in the land deal. In September, former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya approached the Income Tax department and ED for an alleged fraud of ₹127 crore. He claimed that Mushrif’s family opened accounts in banks in the name of shell companies that do not exist. Later that month, he accused Mushrif of committing fraud worth ₹100 crore involving the Appasaheb Gadhinglaj Cooperative Sugar Mill. Political analyst Hemant Desai said the BJP is looking to break either NCP or Ajit Pawar by relentlessly attacking them. “They (BJP) started their attacks against Shiv Sena by targeting (MLA) Pratap Sarnaik and (the then forest minister) Sanjay Rathod,” he said. “But after Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray dismissed any possibility of an alliance with BJP despite being pressured by Sena leaders, they (BJP) shifted the attack to NCP. The case of Jarandeshwar sugar mill is a good example because it came to light before state assembly elections in 2019, but it was suddenly brought back to target Ajit Pawar.” Desai said the BJP is succeeded in pressuring Ajit Pawar, who has been skipping political functions for the past fortnight or more. “State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil recently said that the change will come in the new year. It may be that the party is looking for a repeat of 2019 when Ajit Pawar along with a splinter group of NCP MLAs formed a government with BJP,” he said. “He (Sharad Pawar) never made such strong statements in the past. Praful Patel also said that they will again make Anil Deshmukh the home minister of the state. It indicates that the continuous attack has compelled senior Pawar to go all out against BJP.” NCP’s national spokesperson Nawab Malik said the BJP thinks it can break NCP leaders by targeting them through central agencies just like it tried to do in West Bengal ahead of the state assembly polls, but added that “it will not work in Maharashtra.” Malik said, “By misusing central agencies, they were under the impression that they would force our leaders to jump ship. They have used this strategy in West Bengal and many other states as well, but NCP has decided to fight head on and will not give up.” In a rally in Mahabaleshwar on November 24, Pawar said, “The same is happening here in Maharashtra but there is no need to worry about it. Let them do all the probes; they will not get anything. However, they have set an example on how to misuse power.” In response, BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar said NCP is misleading people and that if their leaders are innocent and are being targeted by the central agencies why is no one moving court. “Their allegation is an admission of their crime as they are not saying that their leaders are innocent,” he said. “Where there is a crime, there has to be an investigation and that is the reason NCP leaders are facing a probe. Even though they are making such allegations, none of the leaders went to court against any of the central agencies if they are really innocent. It means they are crying crocodile tears.” Controversy is not new to the Pawars or the NCP. In 2012, Ajit Pawar was embroiled in a ₹70,000-crore irrigation contracts scam. Following the allegations, Ajit Pawar, who was then deputy CM, resigned from the state cabinet. He was re-inducted in December the same year. Another NCP leader, Chhagan Bhujbal, was made deputy chief minister after the party formed a government with Congress in 1999. However, he had to quit the position in 2003 after his name was embroiled in a controversy over fake stamp papers involving Abdul Karim Telgi. He too made a comeback as the Congress-NCP combination returned to power in 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-turns-two-for-pawar-the-heat-is-on-101637949527187.html
26-11-2021||Other||Chaudhary’s hand-in-glove remark baseless, says ex-CM Amarinder||Chandigarh Former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday lashed out at Congress’ Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary over his baseless accusations against the former being “hand-in-glove” with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), when he was the chief minister.Capt Amarinder said that although he owed no explanation to an “out-of-job legislator” who has been sacked as a minister in Rajasthan, but he still wanted to set the record straight. “Had I had any understanding with the Prime Minister or the BJP when I was the chief minister, I would not have supported the farmers’ agitation and demanded repealing of the agriculture laws and passed a law in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha against these,” he said. Amarinder claimed it was for the first time that a party in-charge had made the state his permanent abode. “I have worked with 14 party in-charges like Pranab Mukherjee, Mohsina Kidwai, Janardhan Dwivedi to name a few, and they would rarely interfere, leave aside visiting or settling down in Punjab,” he recalled. He added that a party in-charge was not supposed to settle down in the state that he has been assigned to, but facilitate interaction and feedback to the high command. “Harish Chaudhary is enjoying chief ministerial power and privileges in Punjab, turning chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi into a rubber stamp by dictating terms to him,” he claimed. The former CM accused Chaudhary of even attending cabinet and other meetings of officers, which was “illegal and unconstitutional”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chaudharys-hand-in-glove-remark-baseless-says-ex-cm-amarinder-101637949407224.html
26-11-2021||Other||Punjab vigilance report indicts Ireo promoters of causing ₹100 cr loss to exchequer||Mohali The Punjab vigilance bureau has recommended the registration of a First Information Report (FIR) against promoters of Ireo Waterfront (now AIPL, Dreamcity) Mega Housing Project in Ludhiana and the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) officers concerned for causing a loss of ₹100 crore to the government exchequer. Of around 1,300 allottees in the project, situated in Dakha village on the Ferozepur road in Ludhiana, 250-odd allottees are awaiting possession for over 10 years. Now, the vigilance has sought permission from the government to register a case. On November 17, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested Lalit Goyal, real estate tycoon and managing director of IREO group, in connection with an alleged money-laundering ( ₹2,600 crore) probe. Goyal was taken into custody under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in Chandigarh. PROJECT WAS APPROVED IN 2005In 2005, the Punjab industries department had approved the 500-acre project under Industrial Policy 2003. Under terms and conditions with the GLADA, the builder was to pay the due amount under the heads of external development charges (EDC), licence fee, and Social Infrastructure fund (SIF), after phase wise completion of the project. “The builder, however, paid only the first instalment, with no payment made for the rest of the phases, causing a loss of nearly ₹100 crore to the government exchequer. GLADA officials, too, did not pursue the matter, giving a long rope to the private developer,” the vigilance report notes, adding that GLADA did not secure its dues by way of hypothecation of plots as mandated in the policy framed by the department of housing and urban development. The report notes, “With the builder not completing the project, even three years after approval, the allottees lodged a complaint regarding incomplete development works and the collusion of GLADA staff in issuing completion certificate for 64-acre pocket in 2017, even as work remains pending even today.”On April 30, 2021, the Punjab department of housing and urban department cancelled the Partial Completion Certificate issued to the 64-acre pocket. In 2018, the state government issued directions to the builder to stop work and further selling of plots, but the builders continued doing so, in complete violation of government orders.“Now, the company has handed over the project to a company, AIPL, without paying dues to the government,” the vigilance report adds. One of the aggrieved home buyers Manmohan Jain said, “I booked 10 adjoining plots for ₹11.5 crore, of which 10.73 crore have been paid to the builder. To date, we have not been offered possession of developed plots.” GLADA chief administrator Rishipal Singh said, “I have joined only recently, but we have started an inquiry. After the inquiry report, action will be taken as per law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-vigilance-report-indicts-ireo-promoters-of-causing-rs-100-cr-loss-to-exchequer-101637948868375.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||We will beat anti- incumbency, change in mood already visible: Punjab dy CM OP Soni||Chandigarh: A prominent Hindu face in Punjab Congress, Om Parkash Soni, 64, was among the major gainers of the change of guard in Punjab two months ago. The five-time MLA and a minister in the Capt Amarinder Singh cabinet was elevated as one of two deputy chief ministers and given the important health portfolio. As the BJP prepares to contest all the 117 assembly seats and both the AAP and SAD eye the urban voters, the Congress faces the challenge of retaining its sway on this section which had propelled it to a spectacular win in 2017. On Friday, HT spoke to Soni about the incessant internal bickering in the state Congress, Capt’s exit and the impact of leadership change. Edited excerpts: Q: Why the ruling Congress continues to be chaotic even after Amarinder’s exit? Our government is functioning very well. Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is working day and night. We all are with him. Both the party organisation and the government should work together. The government is fulfilling the promises at breakneck speed as per the directions of the party high command. Q: But there seems to be no end to bickering – first it was Sidhu-versus-Capt and now Sidhu-versus-Channi. Isn’t this hurting the party? Sidhu is raising the issue of drug report, but this matter is in the court and no one can interfere in it. The government also wants this report to be made public at the earliest. What can the government do in the legal process? Q: Will the change of CM help the party beat the anti-incumbency of four-and-a-half years? We will surely beat it. Look at the effort being put in by Channi Ji and his entire team and the decisions taken by the government. The elections are just two months away and the CM, party and the high command are clear that we need to first fulfil all promises made in 2017 before going to the people for a mandate. The change in mood is already visible. I was in Dhuri and Sangrur on Thursday for a meeting with traders and industrialists and they were happy with the decision taken by the government. Q: How big a challenge will it be for Congress to woo the Hindu voters? They are the key to Congress’ success in Punjab. Whenever we win 30 urban seats, we get the majority. There is no such thing that Hindus are silent or not satisfied. We have addressed the pending VAT cases and slashed power rates. In health sector, we have expanded the health insurance scheme to benefit 15 lakh additional families. Punjab is the first state to cover all its 61 lakh families under this scheme. We will bag more urban seats in 2022. Q: The BJP plans to contest all 117 seats and both AAP and SAD are also going all out to woo the Hindus. Who will be the Congress’ main rival in urban areas? This time, neither the BJP nor SAD will make any impact in urban area because they don’t have an alliance any longer. The AAP is just making announcements whereas we are taking decisions and implementing welfare measures for the poor, farmers, women, traders and others. They are in disarray and their MLAs are quitting to join the Congress. Q: How will Capt Amarinder Singh’s move to float his own party and contest the polls as BJP’s ally impact the Congress? I hold him in high esteem. Capt saab should have accepted the high command’s decision. His new party will not make any difference to the Congress. Had he continued with the party, the situation would have been even better. There was no need for him to react the way he did. Q: AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal is “guaranteeing” total transformation in health sector in Punjab. What do you have to say? He keeps talking about his “Delhi model”, but Punjab is far better placed than Delhi in the health sector. They (AAP) make a lot of claims and give guarantees, but just compare the facilities and manpower to know where they stand. We have more doctors and clinics than them in proportion to population. If things were so good in Delhi, people from national capital would not have rushed to Punjab for beds and treatment during the second wave of Covid-19. Q: The Centre has pointed out Punjab for dip in Covid testing rate. What is being done to ensure sufficient testing? We are conducting 20,000 tests daily which are lower than 40-45,000 tests that were being done daily during the second Covid wave. There are very few cases coming now. The positivity rate has also dropped sharply. Another reason for the dip in testing rate was dengue outbreak. Our health teams got busy with it. Q: As compared to other states, the vaccine coverage in Punjab is low with only 32% of eligible population receiving both shots? Over 2.3 crore vaccine doses, including 1.6 crore first shots and 70 lakh second shots, have been administered so far. As fresh infections have dipped, people feel there is no coronavirus and, therefore, no necessity to get vaccinated. And, we are making continuous efforts to motivate people to get vaccinated. Q: You have worked with Capt Amarinder and Channi. What difference do you see in their working and leadership styles? Channi is working harder, and is far more accessible. He is holding cabinet meetings in person and more frequently and decision-making has accelerated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/we-will-beat-anti-incumbency-change-in-mood-already-visible-punjab-dy-cm-op-soni-101637948686959.html

The committee that party leaders would also court arrest against the alleged plan of the state government to arrest at the district level against ex-minister Bikram Singh Majithia in a fake drugs case. Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal chaired the meeting. “Tomorrow’s arrest will be followed by a ‘jail bharo’ andolan at the district level,” Sukhbir told reporters at the party headquarters. He added that party is not afraid of cases, but would not tolerate a case on fake grounds. “We have concrete information that the CM has ordered the state DGP to register a false case against Majithia at a meeting which deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who holds the charge of home department, was also present,” Sukhbir alleged, adding that Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu was pressuring the government to book Majithia, and had even threatened to go on fast unto death. He cautioned officers and politicians behind this conspiracy to be ready to face the music, if the SAD-BSP government comes to power after 2022 state polls. Two weeks ago, Sukhbir had alleged that the Channi government was pressuring the DGP to implicate the Badal family in sacrilege cases. “On coming to power we would set up a commission to probe all false cases,” said Sukhbir, who is also the Ferozepur MP, reiterating that all drug cases be probed under the direct supervision of a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court. He added that Channi and Sidhu are indulging in a game of one-upmanship for their personal, politicsl vendetta against Akali leaders so as to divert attention from their government’s failure. “We see it as a challenge to the SAD and we accept it,” Sukhbir dared Channi adding that there was no case against Majithia, adding that Arvind Kejriwal, who had accused him in the past, had to save himself from going to jail by tendering apology. The SAD president also hailed the victory of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) with the farm laws being repealed and completion of one year of peaceful protest. “For the repeal of these farm laws, we quit from the union cabinet and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had returned the Padma Bhushan in protest,” he added.Senior core committee members who were present were Balwinder Singh Bhunder; SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur; Prem Singh Chandumajra; Maheshinder Singh Grewal; Daljit Singh Cheema; Gulzar Singh Ranike; Jagmeet Singh Brar; Janmeja Singh Sekhon; Hira Singh Gabria; Sikander Singh Maluka; Surjit Singh Rakhra; Baldev Mann; Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and Harmeet Singh Kalka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sad-to-protest-outside-cm-channi-s-house-on-saturday-to-start-jail-bharo-stir-101637948146858.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||For the first time, BMC to appoint private agency to maintain heritage structures||For the first time, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is planning to hand over the maintenance of heritage structures in the city to a private agency. Earlier, the civic body would appoint private agencies to restore heritage structures but this is the first time that the private agency will also be responsible for their upkeep and security. The structures to be maintained include various pyaus, fountains and statues made of bronze and marble, which have been identified as heritage structures of different grades by the BMC heritage department. Some of the 27 structures the BMC has chosen are - Flora Fountain, Fitzgerald Fountain, and the statues of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Swami Vivekananda at Gateway of India. In a bid to preserve their heritage value, the BMC restored some of these structures, in recent years, including the 154-year-old Fitzgerald Fountain. A structure gets a heritage tag not only for its age but also based on its cultural and historical relevance as well as its location. Senior officials of BMC’s heritage cell said that so far, no contract was awarded to agencies specifically for maintaining heritage structures. “Earlier we used to award contracts only for restoration work, but henceforth all the new contracts will have the clause for maintenance as well,” an official said. The cost of the contract is ₹1.03 crore and it will be awarded to an agency for a period of three years. The civic official also specified that in order to be eligible for the contract, the agency should have an aesthetic sense, understand the cultural importance of these structures and must have prior experience in maintaining historical properties. Some of the clauses in the tender would include cleaning the structures, removing algae from the fountains and filtering the water, polishing the coating of statues and carrying out regular scientific inspections. “All these structures are over 100 years old and most of them are located in areas that have high tourist footfall. If regular maintenance is not done, then these structures will again lose their charm and all the resources spent on restoring them would go in vain,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.The BMC is in the process of restoring four century-old pyaus inside the Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan (Byculla Zoo). The G/North ward office has also taken up the task of renovating existing pyaus at Shivaji Park, Dadar. The officials of the heritage cell said that the pyaus in Dadar will be maintained by G/N office while the pyaus at Byculla zoo will be maintained by the agency that is restoring it.The proposal of issuing work order was tabled for final approval at the civic standing committee earlier on November 24. However due to the ongoing code of conduct imposed due to the MLC elections the committee got adjourned and normal operation of the committee is expected to resume after December 14. “A day after the proposal is cleared by the standing committee, the work order will be issued by us,” said the official.Conservation architect Vikas Dilawari, who is known for restoring various heritage buildings and structures including the Flora Fountain, Wellington Fountain and Mulji Jetha Fountain said that it’s important to appoint experts for the maintenance of these heritage structures. “The advantage of appointing consultants for maintaining these structures is that they have a knowledge on how to do the job perfectly. If those who are carrying out the maintenance are not properly trained or sensitized, then they can damage the objects during the process. The BMC has taken the right step in appointing consultants because this will keep the quality of structure from deteriorating in the long run.”Box:Some of the structures Fitzgerald Fountain (Marine Lines) Flora Fountain (Colaba)Bandstand (Cooperage Garden)Devidas Purushottam Kothari Pyau (Balchand Heerachand Marg)Rajiv Gandhi Statue (Cooperage Garden)Hutatma SmarakLal Bahadur Shastri statue (SP Mukherjee Chowk)Ferozeshah Mehta’s statue (BMC HQ)Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s statue (Madame Cama Marg) Govind Ranade statue (Veer Nariman Road) Dinshaw Maneckji Petit statue (DN Road)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/for-the-first-time-bmc-to-appoint-private-agency-to-maintain-heritage-structures-101637948027018.html

26-11-2021||Pune||India’s Organ Donation Day: 1,500 in Pune region awaiting kidney transplant||PUNE: On the occasion of Indian Organ Donation Day on Saturday, November 27, the Pune region transplant coordination committee has urged citizens to voluntarily come forward and register for organ donation. While Pune has won the award for the highest number of organ donations in the state for two consecutive years namely, 2020 and 2021, and 1,500 persons and over 54 persons in the Pune region are presently in line to receive kidney, and heart transplants, respectively, the organ donation percentage is still scarce in the country and even in a metro like Pune according to the Pune zonal transplant coordination committee.Dr Aarti Gokhale, coordinator for the Pune zonal transplant coordination committee, said, “Pune has stood at the top position for two consecutive years. In 2020, the Pune zonal transplant coordination committee carried out 41 donations, which was the maximum for last year despite the pandemic and the lockdown in place. This year till date, we have carried out 41 donations. Last year, Maharashtra saw 74 donors and this year, the number has gone up to 83 till now, because of which the state has won the best SOTTO state. Pune was also one of the first to introduce a QR code system which makes it very easy for participants to register themselves for organ donation. This has accelerated the process however we still see very few responses from people who hesitate for various reasons. The real heroes that help push donation numbers are doctors, hospital staff, ambulance drivers, lab technicians, zonal transplant coordination committee staff, NGOs that help coordinate, and of course the family members of the donors without whom this would never be possible.”Dr Sujata Patwardhan, director, ROTTO-SOTTO (Regional cum State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation, Mumbai, said, “It gives us immense pleasure to inform you that Maharashtra has won the best SOTTO/state and best ROTTO/region award. ROTTO-SOTTO, west and Maharashtra have been established by the ministry of health and family welfare, government of India, at KEM hospital, Parel, Mumbai, since 2017. ROTTO-SOTTO, Mumbai works under the aegis of NOTTO and is responsible for the monitoring and surveillance of organ transplant activities in Maharashtra and other states in the western region such as Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and the union territories of Diu and Daman. It also maintains transplant registries and conducts promotional activities for spreading awareness regarding organ donation.”In view of the rising demand for dialysis in the city, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will also start a dedicated unit for dialysis at the Meenatai Thackeray civic hospital since it is a regular treatment which is also rather expensive. Diabetes and blood pressure are also found to eventually impact the kidneys. As of now, around 1,500 persons are waiting for a kidney transplant. The demand for other organs is also alarming as 575 patients are presently awaiting liver transplants, 54 are awaiting heart transplants and 55 multi-visceral transplants. A multi-visceral transplant is a combined transplant, which may include kidney plus pancreas, kidney plus liver, heart plus lungs and small bowel, with pancreas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/indias-organ-donation-day-1-500-in-pune-region-awaiting-kidney-transplant-101637947546954.html

The delay has made matters worse for parents and children seeking admissions in RTE schools.Dinkar Temkar, incharge of RTE admission in Maharashtra, said that Pune is one of the few districts in which the admission process has not been completed.“So far 8,912 provisional admissions have been done in the district and 10,861 are confirmed admissions. The education department and Zilla Parishad officials are expected to finish the admission process soon,” he said.According to officials from the education department, two waiting rounds are remaining for the Pune district and it will be completed in December.For the academic year 2020-2021 the process was delayed till January 2021. Due to this, many students have missed out on their studies.Education activist Mukund Kirdat said, “The delay happens every year and it is mostly due to the non-cooperation by the education department staff. This year due to Covid-19, the whole process is online and it has left parents confused.

Minto Hall will be named after Kushabhau Thakre," he said amid applause from BJP members.Speaking on other issues, he said the state government's 'Laadli Laxmi' scheme, which seeks to provide a host of benefits to the girl child, had begun to show results as the sex ratio in MP had improved from 912 females for every 1,000 males to 956 for every 1000 as per the national health survey report. Hitting out at the Congress for claiming the BJP will change the Constitution, Chouhan said, in fact, it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had started the tradition of celebrating November 26 as 'Constitution Day'. The Chouhan government had earlier changed the name of Habibganj station to Rani Kamalapati railway station and renamed Pataalpani railway station near Indore after tribal hero Tantya Bheel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/minto-hall-set-to-become-kushabhau-thakre-hall-shivraj-singh-chouhan-101637945997192.html
26-11-2021||Pune||Pune schools start prep to reopen; student safety top priority||PUNE Many private and public schools in the city are now preparing to reopen from December 1. All safety measures are being taken by the schools to welcome students.After a gap of nearly two years, all students, including primary school children, will be going back to physical classes in schools. The decision was taken at a state cabinet meeting on Thursday.Since October 2021, schools in urban areas were open for students from Class 8 to 12, and from Class 5 to 12 in rural areas.Various stakeholders expressed mixed reactions to the reopening of schools for the primary section.Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune District Principals’ Association, said that the decision is welcome and schools are already preparing to reopen.“Schools are already prepared with the initial safety measures. They are sanitising the premises and ensuring that social distancing is followed in classes. Teachers and school management are equally excited about having students from Class 1 on the premises. As fully vaccinated teaching and non-teaching staff are only allowed at the premises, there is no doubt that students will remain safe. However, the official Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are not yet issued,” said Gaikwad.He also added that vaccination for children should start soon to ensure more safety for them as they attend offline classes.Parents from the city have welcomed the decision, however, they want a fee reduction for students so far.Prashant Khande, National President, All India Parents, Students and Teachers Association (AIPSTA) said that the decision is welcomed but the fee reduction so far should be implemented strictly.“There are multiple questions about reopening of schools and safety is on the priority. On multiple occasions, students tested positive post attending schools and so utmost safety precautions should be taken at the school premises. However, the step is welcomed as many students are facing learning loss and offline education will help them go back on track on their studies,” said Khande.However, so far fee reduction has not been implemented in the last one and a half years.“In such a case, it seems schools are ordered to reopen now so that they can charge full fees from parents. I request the education department to ensure that fee reduction is implemented for this academic year so far,” said Khande.Rajendra Singh, president of the Independent English Schools Association (IESA), said that not all private schools are likely to reopen from December 1.“We will gradually and slowly reopen classes in private schools while strictly following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Over 90 per cent of teaching and non-teaching staff are fully vaccinated with both doses. As many schools are already functioning for Class 8 and above, we will slowly start offline classes from Class 5. Private schools will follow a hybrid form of teaching with online and offline teaching for students to ensure maximum safety,” said Singh.Kiran Desai, secretary of the Pune bus owners’ association, said that the decision to reopen schools is very short-sighted especially for school buses.“For the last one and a half years, school buses have not been functional. Now that the government has decided to reopen primary classes, they have not yet taken any decision concerning school buses. We have not got any SOP from the transport department. Moreover, there is clarity about whether 50 per cent occupancy is allowed or 100 per cent occupancy is allowed. There is no clarity if the driver and lady attendant is expected to get Covid-19 tests in before joining. There are multiple questions which are not answered by the government,” said Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-schools-start-prep-to-reopen-student-safety-top-priority-101637946407393.html
26-11-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath suggests keeping a copy of Constitution at home just like religious books||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said people should keep a copy of the Constitution of India at home just like their religious books. He was speaking at an event at Lok Bhavan in Lucknow for advocates’ welfare on the occasion of Constitution Day.The Constitution gives equal rights to all, including voting rights, and mentions certain duties along with those rights, he said.“That is why we should keep the Constitution in our homes in the same way as we keep the religious books, so that respect for the Constitution can be inculcated in the mind of every Indian. Everyone, along with their individual religion (dharma), also has a duty towards the nation (rashtra dharma),” he said.Before this function, Yogi Adityanath and several Uttar Pradesh ministers were connected from Lok Bhavan in Lucknow to a live event in New Delhi where President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the Constitution Day programme. The President led the group reading of the Preamble of the Constitution.Addressing the lawyers, Yogi Adityanath said that this year was special for the people as it coincided with the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence (75th year of independence) and centenary celebrations of the Chauri Chaura incident.He said the UP Vidhan Sabha had also organised special sessions on the values of the Constitution.“It will not be wrong if the Constitution is called the soul of India,” he said.He said PM Modi had laid the foundation stone of the memorial of Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar. Constitution Day was celebrated for the first time in the country with full honour on November 26, 2015, he added. Congratulating the people of the state on the 71st Constitution Day of the country, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday also announced chambers for lawyers will be built in the high court and the courts of all the districts, besides making proper arrangements for litigants coming to the court.He said that his government had increased the Advocate Welfare Fund in the state from ₹1.5 to ₹5 lakh.“The state government has successfully taken forward its efforts like modernization of courts, construction of advocate chamber, POCSO court, fast track court, establishment of National Law University at Prayagraj,” he said.Yogi Adityanath also said before 2017, the citizens of UP were looked upon with suspicion and the state used to be considered BIMARU (laggard), but now the situation had changed.“We have implemented the rule of law in the state,” he said.“Today, the law-and-order situation of UP has become an example. Uttar Pradesh is at number one in 44 schemes of the country. Respect for the country and the state has increased among the common people,” Yogi Adityanath added.He said Uttar Pradesh had become the first choice of investors and the UP model had also been appreciated in the recently held DGPs’ conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-suggests-keeping-a-copy-of-constitution-at-home-just-like-religious-books-101637945866727.html

26-11-2021||Lucknow||NFHS: Anaemia cases down in UP, can be brought down further, say doctors||Anaemia cases among women of all age groups, including pregnant women, have gone down in Uttar Pradesh (UP) while it has increased slightly among children between 6 months and 5-years of age, according to fifth-round of national family health survey (NFHS) even as doctors say the condition can easily be eliminated almost completely with proper diet and medication.“There has been considerable fall in number of anaemic women but there is no reason why children and women remain anaemic as avoiding the condition is simple,” said Dr Rama Srivastava, former president of Indian Medical Association, Lucknow.The data showed that 66.4% children between six and 59 months were anaemic against 63.2% in NFHS-4 conducted in 2015-16. In all 45.9% pregnant women between 15 and 49 years of age were found anaemic against 51.0% in NFHS-4 and among all women between the same age group 50.4% were found anaemic against 52.4% in NFHS-4. Doctors said eliminating anaemia just needs balanced diet. “Women just need to ensure their daily diet includes certain food that saves them from anaemia. The lack of folic acid and iron are both responsible for anaemia. Jaggery among other food, found in every house is an excellent source of both these minerals, the regular consumption of which can help prevent anaemia,” said Dr Amita Shukla, senior gynaecologist SC Trivedi Memorial Trust Hospital. In all 21.5% men between 15 and 49 years of age were also found anaemic against 23.7% in NFHS-4. “About 80% anaemia is nutritional hence with proper diet the percentage of anaemia can be brought down to 4 or 5 %,” said Dr PK Gupta, a microbiologist and health activist. “Anybody who has lost blood during surgery or due to chronic ailment related to kidney or any other organ may suffer from anaemia but others can avoid it if they take proper diet. Those unable to get rid of anaemia can also make use of medicines that are provided free-of-cost at government hospitals,” said Dr Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nfhs-anaemia-cases-down-in-up-can-be-brought-down-further-say-doctors-101637945386859.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik consents to re-hearing of Wankhede’s plea||Mumbai NCP leader Nawab Malik on Friday presented a draft of proposed consent terms in the appeal filed by Dnyandev Wankhede, father of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Wankhede filed an appeal against the order passed by the single-judge bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on November 22 in the interim application in the defamation suit filed by him. In the consent terms, Malik has expressed willingness for setting aside of the single-judge bench order of November 22, have the interim application heard all over again by another single judge bench, file a detailed affidavit in response to the interim application and has assured of abiding by the undertaking given by him to the division bench of the HC which is hearing the appeal by Wankhede. The division bench has granted time to Wankhede’s lawyers to respond to Malik’s proposal by Monday. On Friday, advocate Karl Tamboly, who represents Malik in the appeal filed by Wankhede, informed the division bench of Justice S J Kathawalla and Justice Milind Jadhav that his client had prepared a draft of consent terms in response to the appeal filed by Wankhede. The proposed consent terms by Malik are: Setting aside of single-judge order; another single-judge bench should hear parties afresh; Malik be permitted to file a comprehensive affidavit in reply to the interim application in the defamation suit; Malik would abide by the statement made before the HC in appeal till interim application was reheard and re-hearing of the interim application be uninfluenced by the earlier order. Senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf for Wankhede welcoming the proposed consent terms, objected to the setting aside of the 50-page single-judge bench order as it contained any observations that were in their favour. However, he agreed that as the November 22 order had refused to grant an interim injunction against Malik, he wanted time to speak and explain the intricacies of the consent terms to his client. Though the bench asked him to decide on the consent terms in five minutes by speaking to his client, Dr Saraf sought time till Monday which the bench granted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-consents-to-re-hearing-of-wankhede-s-plea-101637945086626.html

A delegation, including joint secretary of INTACH’s Prayagraj chapter Vaibhav Maini, PR and events coordinator Nilesh Narayan and librarian of Bharti Bhawan Swatantra Pandey brought back the manuscripts from Lucknow-based INTACH Conservation Institute (ICI) recently. Maini said the project was funded by INTACH and it took around four months to restore the manuscripts. “The antique manuscripts were in a dilapidated condition but Bharti Bhawan Library lacked funds required for their restoration and preservation which prompted INTACH to take up the task,” Maini said. The manuscripts that have been restored are Mahakal Sanhita (samwat 1600-1700), Navgrah Srot Mantra Janta (samwat 1600-1700), Mahabharat (Sauptik Parv samwat 1663), Kishkindha Kaand (samwat 1762), Lanka Kaand (samwat 1762), Tulsi Mahatya (samwat 1757), Panchang Panna (samwat 1842), Panchang Panna (samwat 1857), Panchang Panna (samwat 1858), Panchang Panna (samwat 1887). “These manuscripts are part of the rare and rich collection at Bharti Bhawan and a great source of knowledge about religion, science and culture,” Maini further said. Maini said there were more old and important manuscripts and rare books that needed immediate restoration. However, due to lack of funds the work was still pending. “INTACH members and Bharti Bhawan officials will soon hold meetings to chalk out a plan for arranging funds for their restoration,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rare-manuscripts-at-prayagraj-s-bharti-bhawan-library-restored-by-intach-101637944427835.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||Teen bullied, assaulted, dies by suicide next day||A 16-year-old boy died by suicide after being allegedly bullied and assaulted on the first day of his offline junior college. The Nhava Sheva police have booked two juveniles for abetment to suicide on Thursday. The deceased and the two minors were classmates till Class 10, after which, they took admission in different junior colleges. According to the family of the deceased, he was assaulted and bullied on November 12, outside a Seawood-based junior college, where he studied. The deceased, an Ulwe resident, while having a conversation with a common friend, had claimed that the two accused were drug addicts. After the duo found out about the claim, they confronted him after his college hours and physically assaulted him. The eyewitness intervened and stopped the fight, police said. The victim then narrated the ordeal to his school friend on Instagram and told him that he was afraid the duo would again assault and bully him, hence, he was going to end his life. The victim’s 24-year-old brother said, “After the chat, he kept his phone on silent mode and switched off the data. The friend, whom he had sent the message, unfortunately, did not have any of the family member’s contact numbers to alert.” The incident came to light after the father of the deceased reached home at around 3pm. Assuming that the son was sleeping, he did not call him. However, after 5pm, when there were no signs of the boy coming out of the room, the father went to check on him and found him dead. After the last rites of the boy were conducted, his brother looked into the phone of the deceased and found that his friend had sent screenshots of the Instagram chats on WhatsApp. On November 15, a complaint of abetment to suicide was filed against the two boys. “Based on allegations, we registered a case. The duo will be produced before the juvenile justice court,” a police officer from Nhava Sheva police station said. “He was an introvert and had scored 77% in his Class 10. He never got involved in any fights. All we now want is justice for my brother,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/teen-bullied-assaulted-dies-by-suicide-next-day-101637944426527.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra announces ₹50,000 as ex gratia for kin of those died due to Covid-19||Maharashtra government on Friday announced its decision to pay an ex gratia sum of ₹50,000 to the families of people who died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since the beginning of the pandemic. The state revenue department issued the government's resolution in which it has pledged to compensate kin of those who died of Covid-19.The announcement comes days after Maharashtra Congress Legislature Party wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, urging him to commit ₹1 lakh for families of Covid-19 victims as per the norms of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The Congress MLAs, in the letter, said that the decision would force the central government to announce its share of ₹3 lakh for each Covid death.The letter stated that the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) norms require 75% of ₹4 lakh to be paid by the central government and the remaining 25% by the state government.“We request that you commit to upholding the state government's share of ₹4 lakh as ex gratia payment so that it pressurizes the Central government to fulfil its commitment to the affected citizens,” the letter read.“We cannot understand how the Central government continues to collect taxes through rising fuel prices on one hand and provide discal reliefs to big corporates on the other hand and it continues to deny much-needed relief to the citizens,” it added.Uddhav chairs cabinet meet from hospital; winter session in Mumbai from Dec 22Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan chief ministers have also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to increase the compensation from ₹50,000 to ₹4 lakh for each Covid death. Gehlot said the pandemic badly affected the majority of the population and many families lost their earning members and exhausted their savings on hospital bills.“As a welfare state, it is our shared responsibility to look after our citizens during times of need. Our state has started many welfare schemes to help people tide over these difficult times. We expect that the central government will also share this responsibility," the chief minister wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-announces-50-000-as-ex-gratia-for-kin-of-those-died-due-to-covid19-101637943914658.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh appears before Thane Police||A day after he appeared before the Mumbai Police crime branch for inquiry, director general of home guards Param Bir Singh on Friday visited the Thane Nagar police station for probe in connection with a case registered against him on the basis of an extortion complaint by businessman Ketan Tanna in July. According to a senior officer, the former Mumbai top cop was reached the police station around 10.30am and was questioned till evening. The other accused in the extortion case include deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Deepak Devraj, assistant commissioner of police NT Kadam, retired encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, senior inspector Rajkumar Kothmire and gangster Ravi Pujari. Tanna has alleged that the accused cops had extorted crores of rupees from him and his friend businessman Sonu Jalan in 2018. Jalan had been arrested in connection with a betting racket by the Thane crime branch’s anti extortion cell (AEC) the same year. Sources said Singh was questioned in connection with the allegations made against him as well as over the original case filed by AEC against Jalan, in which the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) had been invoked. In the presence of senior officers, including DCP (zone 1) Avinash Ambure, Singh was questioned about invoking MCOCA as well as over evidence against Jalan. “He also appeared before the Thane sessions court, which had issued a non-bailable warrant against him last month, around 3.30pm. The court has cancelled the warrant. Subsequently, he came back to the police station and the questioning resumed,” an officer said. After several hours of questioning, Singh finally left from the police station around 7 pm. While the Supreme Court has granted him blanket protection from arrest in the cases registered against him, officers said the former top cop might be called again for inquiries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-appears-before-thane-police-101637943707049.html
26-11-2021||Patna||Bihar prohibition: For 4th time, police vow to ensure successful prohibition in state||More than 80,000 Bihar Police members, along with thousands of others across the state, on Friday took a vow against the sale and consumption of alcohol and ensure successful prohibition in the state. Police have been in the firing line over the easy accessibility of liquor in the state, which enforced prohibition in April 2016. This was the fourth pledge taken by the policemen to make prohibition a success, as the previous oaths did not yield the desired results. Around 11 am on Friday, policemen gathered across the state to take the oath, some at their police stations and others on big open grounds. In Patna, Bihar’s police chief SK Singhal administered the oath to several policemen. “I do solemnly swear I will never consume liquor in my lifetime. I shall be liable for stern action if I am ever found involved in any activity involving liquor,” read the oath. Earlier, on December 21, 2020, and April 4, 2016, all police personnel, including home guards, had taken a similar pledge. In 2019 also, the exercise was repeated on the CM’s directive. “Such oath has no legal sanctity. It is strange how the entire officialdom gets down to such meaningless exercise to appear holier than the king. Removing or suspending anyone is purely an administrative decision. In matters of the Excise Act, the courts have also been rightly liberal in granting bail,” said former assistant solicitor general NA Shamshi. Another lawyer Sashikant Yadav said that there was no performance of oath under the India Oath Act 1873 & 1969 (section-3). “There is a defined process for administering an oath. More importantly, if there is no respect for the oath, it becomes a futile exercise,” he said. Former DGP Abhayanand asked what would happen with those policemen, who were on leave today and could not take the oath, if they were caught consuming liquor. “Will they not be dismissed from service? If there is no fear of law, what will an oath do? This oath is being taken in the name of what, the Constitution, law, morality? There are provisions of punishment in the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” he added. Bihar police association’s former general secretary KK Jha said that administering oath repeatedly reflects a lack of trust and governance failure. “There is no such provision in the Police Act. The police manual deboned the roles and responsibilities of the police as per the Act. Though the government organises the oath against liquor almost every year, the recent hooch deaths and subsequent police overdrive to nab youth consuming liquor and catch truckloads of smuggled liquor exposed the truth of prohibition, providing the opposition ammunition to attack the government. The main reason attributed to the easy flow of liquor was the police-mafia nexus. Ever since the state went dry in 2016, several lakh litres of illicit liquor have been seized while 850 policemen, found either drunk or hand-in-glove with the liquor traders, have been suspended,” said KK Jha. “Of them, 206 policemen were dismissed from service after the prohibition law was amended and made quite stringent,” said a senior official in the state home department. The CM has now made the SHO of each police station accountable for any illegal sale or consumption of liquor, said the official. From January 2021 and October 2021, the Bihar police seized 38.72 lakh litres of illicit liquor while 62,140 persons, including 1590 outsiders, were arrested and 12,200 vehicles seized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-prohibition-for-4th-time-police-vow-to-ensure-successful-prohibition-in-state-101637942866560.html
26-11-2021||Patna||Niti Aayog report: Sparks fly over poor ranking; NDA calls it bundle of lies, oppn rubs it in||A war of words has erupted in Bihar over the recent Niti Aayog’s national multidimensional poverty index baseline report in which the state has been ranked poorly in majority of indices, be it education, nutrition, school attendance, electricity, housing, bank accounts, sanitation and drinking water. While chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday refrained from commenting on the report, state’s energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav and Bhartiya Janata Party’s state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel called the report a “bundle of lies” and far from ground reality. On the other hand, the report, released on Wednesday, has offered ammunition to the opposition. Rashtriya Janata Dal’s (RJD’s) Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who is leader of Opposition in the assembly, said, “Bihar government has no logical explanation as to why the state has got a dud in almost all parameters in the report despite the claim that last 16 years of Nitish Kumar’s dispensation have been glorious.” The Niti Aayog report has ranked Bihar lowest in various parameters. It says that 51.91% of the state’s 11 crore population is poor whereas in nutrition index, 51.88% of the population is deprived. In both the indices, the state’s ranks among the worst compared to other states. In child and adolescent mortality, the state is second worst in the country after Uttar Pradesh, says the report. In other indices like maternal health, years of schooling, school attendance and cooking fuel, the state has scored poorly, and has been ranked among the most laggard states. In maternal health, the report says 45.62% of state’s population is deprived of good medical assistance while in years of schooling, 26.27% of population is deprived.In sanitation, Bihar again has scored poorly and is only a notch higher than Jharkhand. The report says that 73.61% of the population is deprived of good sanitation facilities. It says 39.96% of the state’s population are deprived of electricity, putting Bihar on top of the list of states with highest number of households not having power. However, Bihar’s ranking in indices like drinking water is better than other states. “Only 2.35% of the state’s population is deprived of safe drinking water,” it says.The report says that 24.32% of the state’s population is deprived of assets (a household is deemed deprived if it does not own more than one of the assets, be it radio, TV, telephone, computer etc). In bank account index, 26% of the state’s population doesn’t have an account. The report has upset the ruling Janata Dal (United) and the Bhartiya Janata Party. “The entire report has seemingly been made in an arbitrary manner and it is beyond comprehension as what parameters were chosen. How can one accept that 40% of the households in Bihar does not have electricity. Even the centre has praised Bihar for its reforms and initiatives in power sector over the years,” said energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav. “Niti Aayog team should visit Bihar and see how development has taken place over the last several years as compared to the situation before 2005. This report is totally baseless and false,” BJP’ Patel said. He said the per capital income in Bihar in 2005 was ₹7,000, which had risen to ₹46,000 as of now while the budget size had exponentially increased in last 15 years. “Development is visible all over in the state, be in road sector, education or health,” he said. However, Tejashwi Yadav, in a tweet, said, “Bihar in a bad shape in 16 years of Nitish’s rule.” RJD chief Lalu Prasad too has slammed the Nitish Kumar government over the poor score of the state in the Niti Aayog report, saying there has been no worthwhile development in the state last 16 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/niti-aayog-report-sparks-fly-over-poor-ranking-nda-calls-it-bundle-of-lies-oppn-rubs-it-in-101637942747728.html
26-11-2021||Patna||Union power minister to dedicate two NTPC units in Bihar today||Union power, new and renewable energy minister RK Singh will review implementation of central schemes in power sector in Bihar, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM Kusum) scheme, which hasn’t seen much progress in the state, officials said.In Singh’s presence, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar will dedicate the 500 MW stage-II units of Barauni Thermal Power Station and 660 MW unit 1 of the Barh Super Thermal Power project from Barh in Patna district on Saturday.Both Barh and Barauni units are run by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).The first component of the PM Kusum scheme involves setting up decentralised ground mounted grid connected renewable power plants of individual plant size up to 2 MW, said an office memorandum of the ministry of New and Renewable Energy, dated July 22, 2019. As part of initiating work on this scheme, the state energy department has decided to invite farmers and private land owners set up grid connected solar plants of 500 kW to 2 MW capacity, said officials of the energy department privy to the scheme. “All an individual has to do is bear the cost of setting up the solar plant. The state discoms will purchase the entire power thus generated at a rate to be decided by the regulator — the Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC). They will also bear the cost of laying transmission line for carrying power from the solar power grid of private land owners to its distribution system,” said the official who did not wish to be named. Central scheme yet to take offMuch of the ground work and inter-department coordination between the discoms — the north and the south Bihar power distribution companies — and the Bihar Renewable Energy Development Agency (BREDA) was lacking, said government sources, even as the discoms want to showcase initiation of work under the PM’s scheme to the Central team on Saturday. “We are yet to identify the potential areas in the state where the scheme can be rolled out and farmers or land owners be invited to set up grid connected solar plants of 500 kW to 2 MW capacity,” said an official who did not wish to be identified. The central scheme is envisaged against the backdrop that India has committed to increasing the share of installed capacity of electric power from non-fossil-fuel sources to 40% by 2030. The Union cabinet had approved scaling up of solar power target from 20,000 MW of grid connected solar power projects to 1,00,000 MW by 2022. While large scale solar power generation projects are being installed to achieve the ambitious target of 100 GW of solar power generation by 2022, it has been planned to simultaneously develop decentralised solar energy and other renewable energy generation plants of capacity up to 2 MW which could be connected directly to existing 33/11 kV or 66/11 kV or 110/11 kV sub-stations of distribution company, thus saving in transmission system requirement apart from transmission and distribution losses. Ironically, not much has been done on this front in Bihar so far. Managing director (MD) of South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited, Sanjiwan Sinha did not respond to calls or text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/union-power-minister-to-dedicate-two-ntpc-units-in-bihar-today-101637942746384.html
26-11-2021||Patna||DA case: Premises of minister’s pvt secy, his friend searched||Special vigilance unit (SVU) of Bihar Police on Friday carried out simultaneous searches on properties of a Bihar Administrative Service (BAS) officer, currently posted as officer on special duty (OSD) at mines and geology department, and his associate in a case of disproportionate assets worth ₹1.74 crore, officials said. The officer, Mritunjay Kumar Verma, has also been serving as private secretary to mines and geology minister Janak Ram since February 26 this year. Verma’s associate Ratna Chatterjee was dismissed from the job in 2012 after she was caught accepting a bribe of ₹30,000 when she was posted as child development project officer in Thakurganj block of Kishanganj district in 2011, SVU officials said. The sleuths conducted raids at the OSD’s residence in Patna and Araria, besides Ratna’s residence at Katihar, where the team seized ₹30 lakh in cash, 30 gold bars, some old currency notes, besides other items. The SVU also seized six cell phones and found details of a shop in a mall, a flat at Siliguri in West Bengal, a plot in Patna worth ₹33 lakh, ornaments worth ₹45 lakh, three LIC policies and six passbooks, all in Ratna’s name. The SVU suspects that all the ill-gotten money was routed through Ratna. Vigilance sleuths also raided Mritunjay’s brother Dhananjay’s house. According to an official of the raiding team, Ratna and Mritunjay have been staying together in a live-in relationship at the latter’s house in Patna. Sources said Mritunjay was under the surveillance of the SVU since May 1, 2021. A disproportionate assets case under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and 120 (B) of IPC has been lodged with the SVU police station against Mirtunjay, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/da-case-premises-of-minister-s-pvt-secy-his-friend-searched-101637942386494.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||CNG and piped gas prices hiked in Mumbai for third time in six weeks||For the third time in six weeks, Mahanagar Gas Limited has decided to hike the prices for Compressed Natural Gas(CNG) and Domestic Piped Natural Gas (PNG) with effect from Friday midnight in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. According to all-inclusive revised rates, the CNG price will be increased by ₹3.06 per kg and will be available at the rate of ₹61.50 per kg. While the PNG rates will increase by ₹2.26/Standard Cubic Meter(SCM) and will be priced at ₹36.50/SCM.The month of October saw two revisions in the prices, on October 14, CNG was priced at ₹57.54 per kg while PNG was priced at ₹33.93/SCM in slab 1 and ₹39.53/SCM in slab 2 respectively. October 5 saw the prices of CNG and domestic PNG at ₹54.57 per kg, while PNG was available at ₹32.67/SCM in slab 1 and ₹36.00 /SCM in slab 2.In July, the prices of CNG and domestic PNG were hiked in the city. CNG was available at ₹51.98 per kg while PNG was available at ₹30.40/SCM in slab 1 and ₹36.00 /SCM in slab 2 respectively. Before that CNG was priced at ₹49.40 per kg in the city.According to a statement from Mahanagar Gas Limited, “In order to meet the shortfall in domestic gas allocation, MGL is sourcing additional market-priced natural gas to cater to the increasing requirement of CNG and domestic PNG segments. On account of the substantial increase in natural gas prices in the international market, MGL’s input gas cost has also increased substantially.Even after the above revision, CNG offers attractive savings of about 62 percent and 35 percent as compared to petrol and diesel respectively at current price levels in Mumbai,” said a statement from Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL).Taxi unions had earlier demanded the state government to hike taxi fares in the city. Unions have also threatened to go on a strike if CNG prices hike any further. Unions have approached the state government asking to hike the base fare of taxis by ₹2 and increase it to ₹27 from the present ₹25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cng-and-piped-gas-prices-hiked-in-mumbai-for-third-time-in-six-weeks-101637941846464.html

However, the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that changes are not on the cards. “We had a long meeting of more than five hours in Delhi in the presence of our national leaders. We deliberated upon the organisational course of action and also reviewed programmes being implemented. Whenever in Delhi, we meet Amit Shah. Our meeting with him was a casual one and there is nothing more to read into it. No organisational changes are on the cards,” he said.Maharashtra, BJP chief Chandrakant Patil and Fadnavis held a marathon meeting with the party’s organisation secretary CT Ravi, Maharashtra in charge BL Santosh in Delhi on Friday. The leaders reportedly discussed the organisational issues and reviewed the outreach programmes ahead of the forthcoming local body elections. Fadnavis and Patil met Union home minister Amit Shah separately over the last two days.Though a section of the party leaders in the state say that there could be organisational changes in the state BJP soon, Fadnavis ruled out such a possibility. The party is expected to make changes in key positions, including the state unit chief, though there is no clarity if they will be done before or after the polls.More than 75% of the local bodies, including municipal corporations and district councils, will face elections in the next six months. BJP rules more than 40% of the local bodies in rural and urban parts of the state. Politically, it is important for the party to do well in these elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-buzz-over-reshuffle-in-state-bjp-fadnavis-patil-meet-amit-shah-101637941607693.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||Lack of job opportunities for graduates boost MBA applications by 26% in Maharashtra||Applications for Masters in Business Administration/Masters in Management Studies (MBA/MMS) are slowly witnessing a steady rise across the state in the academic year of 2021-22 compared to last year.According to the figures shared by the state Common Entrance Test (CET) cell, the admissions authority for professional courses, shows that a total of 54,227 aspirants have completed the pre-admission registration process for around 32,000 seats as compared to 42,814 students who registered for the course last year. The figure stood at 38,000 in 2019.Not only were the total applications for these courses lower than usual in 2020, but figures shared by the state CET cell after closing the admissions window showed how nearly 32% of the allotted seats in MBA/MMS courses went vacant in 2020-21 academic year.“While engineering is still not picking up, several other professional courses are witnessing a rise in the applications. MBA not only attracts fresh graduates but also professionals with work experience,” said an official from the state CET cell.Experts in the industry told HT that the lack of job opportunities for fresh graduates could be one reason for the increasing demand for postgraduate courses like MBA. “While the job scenario is looking better than last year, several fresh graduates are struggling to find a job, especially one that pays well. Many are therefore opting for higher education like MBA to highlight added qualifications on their CV, hoping to fare better in the job market,” said Dr R K Srivastava, professor and HOD, Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education (SIMSREE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lack-of-job-opportunities-for-graduates-boost-mba-applications-by-26-in-maharashtra-101637941606245.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||CBI case against Anil Deshmukh: HC reserves order on state’s petition for SIT probe||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday concluded the hearing on the petition filed by the government, seeking transfer of the investigation in the April 21 first information report (FIR) against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to the special investigation team (SIT). The hearing was concluded after the state, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey responded to the arguments of CBI, which had opposed the transfer of the probe to SIT. Pandey has denied the allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in his April 19 letter to CBI and also challenged the veracity of the transcripts mentioned in the letter. The state submitted that CBI director Subodh Jaiswal was the decision maker in the police establishment board (PEB) meetings wherein the transfer and posting of over 92% names of officers were finalised and forwarded to the home ministry. Hence, it was Jaiswal who played a vital role in transfers and postings and so the agency headed by him [CBI] could not conduct an unbiased probe into the corruption allegations made against Deshmukh. CBI responded by saying that its willingness to submit a progress report to HC in a sealed envelope proved that there was no need for a court-monitored SIT headed by a retired judge. The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal, which is hearing the petition filed by the Maharashtra government, was informed by special counsel Darius Khambatta for the state that the claims made by CBI that Jaiswal, despite being the director of the agency would not influence the investigation in the allegations of corruption in transfer and postings of police officers, could not be accepted. Khambatta said that HC’s April 5 order had handed over probe to CBI as it felt Mumbai Police could not do an impartial investigation as Deshmukh then headed the home ministry. A similar parallel could be drawn in the case of Jaiswal, he said, adding that the fact that CBI did not disclose to HC that they had recorded the agency director’s statement with regards to the case in May indicated that there was bias. The court was further informed that the refusal of the Centre to part with the third pen drive – which was part of its investigation in the data leak case against unknown persons – was also indicative of an attempt to put the blame of corruption only on Deshmukh, while others were involved as well. Khambatta lastly submitted that CBI’s objection that the state could not file the petition under the parens patriae (parent of the nation) jurisdiction was also not valid as the agency summoned Pandey who was not even part of PEB when the alleged acts of corruption took place. He said that as the summons would affect the morale of the entire police force in the state, it had filed the petition under parens patriae jurisdiction on behalf of the force. Responding to the rejoinder by the state and the two officers, additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi for CBI submitted that there was no mala fides on the agency’s part in summoning the two top officers or by having Jaiswal at the helm of the agency. He concluded that HC could monitor the investigations by itself rather than transferring it to an SIT headed by a retired judge as CBI was willing to submit progress reports in a sealed covers for perusal of the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-case-against-anil-deshmukh-hc-reserves-order-on-state-s-petition-for-sit-probe-101637941006217.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||BJP, Congress reach consensus, 4 legislative council candidates get elected unopposed||Four of the six seats of the state legislative council to be elected from local body constituencies in five districts have been elected unopposed after Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders decided to avoid the ‘horse trading’ in the polls. Nagpur and Akola-Buldhana-Washim constituencies will go for the polls on December 10. Sunil Rane of Shiv Sena and Rajhans Singh of BJP from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), minister of state and Congress leader Satej Patil from Kolhapur local bodies and BJP leader Amrish Patel from Dhule-Nandurbar have been elected unopposed. Nagpur seat will see a fight between the former minister and BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule and Congress’s Ravindra Bhoyar. Bhoyar switched to Congress last week after BJP denied him the ticket and fielded Bawankule. Sena’s sitting member of legislative council (MLC) Gopikishan Bajoria is pitted against BJP’s Vasant Khandelwal in the Akola-Buldhana-Washim constituency. State leaders from BJP and Congress held a round of meetings last week in Mumbai to avoid the elections which induce ‘horse trading and bad blood’ in the elections. The two parties arrived at the consensus to withdraw their candidates in Dhule-Nandurbar, Mumbai and Kolhapur. Congress leader Suresh Koparkar withdrew his nomination from Mumbai, while BJP candidate Amal Mahadik withdrew from Kolhapur. Congress’s Gaurav Wani withdrew the nomination from the Dhule-Nandurbar constituency. Congress and BJP candidates were in a comfortable winning position in Kolhapur and Dhule-Nandurbar respectively. “Congress thinks they can defeat us in Nagpur, but Bawankule will emerge victorious without any hassle,” said the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis. Amal Mahadik said that he was withdrawing his nomination as directed by the state leadership of the BJP. Satej Patil said that the decision of amicable understanding in two constituencies was taken at the state level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-congress-reach-consensus-4-legislative-council-candidates-get-elected-unopposed-101637940766099.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Prayers For Her Departed Soup||It’s always challenging to write about bereavement and loss, more so, at times like these, when everyone has felt the immeasurable grief of losing loved ones. After all, death is the great unifier and the universal condition, and who amongst us is not familiar with its pain? But I wonder if I’m the only one who notices the piquancy (and often inadvertent hilarity) of bereavement, in the time of social media and how different things were in this department in the days before its arrival.Remember those days? When the death of a loved one meant that right on top of the list of tasks for organising their final passage into the great unknown, was that you had to inform their family, friends and the general public at large of their demise in the classified section of the next day’s newspapers?Of course, how you went about this task was up to you. The announcement could be discreet, florid, stoic, expansive or expensive, depending on your personality, relationship with the deceased, size of your wallet etc; but the message was the same: So, and so had passed on, to the great beyond. They would be sorely missed. You could come and pay your last respects at this stipulated place and time (unless you cited the forbidding no visits, please) and that was it more or less when it came to the public face of your grieving. Because a few days later, after people had trooped in offered their commiserations and condolences, you were expected to fold away your grief along with your mourning face and clothes and begin the process of getting back to your normal existence, nursing your desolation in privacy.But no, thanks to Zuck and Co. and their shiny new toys, today, it doesn’t end there.Today, thanks to social media one’s grieving can go on ad nauseam. So, you have people marking the first anniversary of their loved one’s passing, then the second and third ...to the 50th…. This in itself would not be remarkable, until you realize that the usual practice to do this is by addressing them directly in the posts. (Eg: Dearest Dad. You have left a great void in my heart that will never be filled.’ Or ‘ Ravi my childhood friend, I just want to say that I still miss you twenty-three years after your passing. BTW yaar: I’m sorry for stealing your science notebook and then your business idea and GF (who is my wife now). Hope you’re happy up there. Love you forever.’)I often wonder what people think when they post such heartfelt messages to those who have left for their final resting places. Do they imagine that an afterlife is a place that has good Wi-Fi connectivity and that its inhabitants all have Facebook accounts, which they check regularly? And what about others who post messages to their much-adored deceased pets? (‘Silky, there will always be a place in my heart for you.’ And ‘ Dearest Fido, how I miss you!!’) Do they do this in the belief that Silky and Fido have not only learnt to read after they died, but also have FB accounts and check their timelines?*********************************************************************************************************************Of course, one of the most important parts of processing grief and coming to terms with personal loss is through community support and there is no denying that for this, social media is invaluable. Before its advent, loved ones were missed in private moments through the course of one’s day; a song, a fragrance, a memory would occur perhaps while we were sipping tea and a silent tear would begin to roll down. But today, before the tear is halfway down our cheek, we can share this feeling with our friends and family on social media and receive their almost instantaneous love and empathy in good measure. Of course, your post will call upon them to appropriately (and sensitively) respond to your lamentation with messages of comfort and commiseration. Sentences like ‘He/She is in a better place/ They will always be with you… etc.’ are expected and imparted. Orr, perhaps they will respond with an appropriately empathetic emoticon. (The popular choice is the ‘care’ emoticon, followed by a decorous Namaste and accompanied by a single, solemn rose (Though it’s best to avoid a whole bouquet or a hug as they might convey jocularity).However, social media has brought inadvertent hilarity to even this aspect of bereavement thanks to the devil in its system –that vexatious ingredient of all modern communication: Spellcheck.In the saddest moments of a person’s grieving, it is not unknown for their friends and family to blithely post messages that cannot but evoke in them a secret giggle or even a hearty belly laugh.Messages such as ‘Sending heartfelt prayers for her departed soup’ or even ‘I’m Shanti. I’m Shanti.’ (instead of Om Shanti) in response to your post about your much-adored octogenarian mum having passed on, are not unknown.Of course, the other peculiar aspect that social media has brought to the business of bereavement and dying is the fact that we have to regularly deal with the unfamiliar and often searing loss of people we’ve never met. People with who we laughed jousted and shared our innermost thoughts and private moments daily. One fine morning we wake up and learn that they’ve copped it; how does one process this loss in the real world? Especially in the company of people you live and work with who perhaps had no clue how deeply you felt for the deceased person, who not only had you never met but had no intention of ever meeting? Is there a name for this kind of bereavement and sadness? And if not, isn’t it time social scientists/psychiatrists/ anthropologists and sundry navel-gazers study this peculiar impact of social media ‘s ubiquity?*****************************************************************************************************************************So, as I was saying the omnipresence of social media has brought much piquancy (and often hilarity) into the way we process and deal with loss and bereavement: Not only has it led us to believe that our dear departed loved ones regularly log on and read the loving messages we send them on our social media platforms. But also, that our adored deceased pets have somehow learnt to read,( this, after spending their entire lives on earth not being able to master a simple command like ‘ Sit’) and are also checking their social media accounts. Also, it has given us emoticons to express how deeply we care and has brought us the peculiar unfamiliar pain of losing people we have never met. But above all it has given us that timeless phrase, that never fails to bring a giggle to even the most despondent soul in their hour of suffering the loss of a loved one: ‘ May they RIP’ …||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-prayers-for-her-departed-soup-101637940526425.html
26-11-2021||Ranchi||Blame game begins as Jharkhand figures among poorest states in Niti Aayog report||The JMM-led ruling dispensation and the opposition BJP on Friday engaged in a war of words over reasons behind the state's backwardness after Jharkhand emerged as the second-poorest state in the country at Niti Aayog's Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). Hitting out at the Hemant Soren government, the BJP said the dispensation did not implement the central schemes properly as it was busy with transfers and postings. In response, the ruling JMM sought to know if the saffron camp, during its tenure, was "asleep". Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh have emerged as the poorest states in India, according to MPI. The report stated that 51.91 per cent population of Bihar is poor, followed by 42.16 per cent in Jharkhand. "The situation is alarming. The JMM-led government in the state failed to implement the Centre's policies on food security and pension on the ground. Budgetary allocations are barely spent. Ever since this JMM-led alliance rode to power, it has been busy with transfers and postings so much so that over 200 officials were shifted during the pandemic," said BJP state spokesperson Kunal Sarangi. Sarangi alleged that the government has completely ignored the interest of the masses. Rubbishing the allegation, JMM general secretary and spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya pointed out that the BJP, despite ruling the state for the major part of the time since its formation, "did not do much to alleviate poverty". "It is the present regime which is making all sorts of policies to address issues of hunger and scarcity. Amid the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, the present state government has started programmes like 'Aapke Adhikar, Aapki Sarkar, Aapke Dwar' (Your rights, your government at your door), aimed at resolving issues related to government schemes," Bhattacharya said. Admitting that many children in the state still suffer from malnutrition, he said a slew of initiatives are being taken to improve the situation, and the change will be visible in a few years. Echoing him, state Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey claimed that the incumbent government is focused on all-round development of the state, like never before. Terming the Niti Aayog report a "realistic" one, state finance minister and Congress leader Rameshwar Oraon said 15 lakh ration cards have been distributed among people, while 13 lakh residents of the state have already benefitted from the pension scheme. A number of schemes have also been launched for the farmers, he said, adding that jobs were being provided to the poor. In the 2019 Assembly elections, the JMM-Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) alliance trounced the BJP, winning 47 seats in the 81-member House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/blame-game-begins-as-jharkhand-figures-among-poorest-states-in-niti-aayog-report-101637938349856.html

Punamiya was arrested in the extortion case registered against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. During the course of investigation of the case, it was found that on May 4, the builder had shared with his son some purportedly confidential documents, such as the call data records of his partner’s nephew and documents relating to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s case. A case was registered against the builder and his son on October 20 for theft under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code and some provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, as well as the Telegraph Act. Apprehending arrest in connection with the case, Punamiya and Sunny had approached the sessions court. The court granted pre-arrest bail to both of them after noticing that absolutely nothing was mentioned in the FIR against Sunny. “There are no sufficient and justifiable grounds for which the custody of both applicants is required for custodial interrogation,” said additional sessions judge Dr UJ More while granting anticipatory bail to the father and son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/confidential-papers-shared-on-whatsapp-builder-sanjay-punamiya-son-get-bail-101637938125592.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||Over 91% positive for antibodies in TMC’s sero survey||Thane Over 91% of the samples tested by Thane Municipal Corporation in the recent sero survey showed the presence of antibodies to fight against Covid-19. Out of the total 1,571 samples tested, those residing in slum areas have lesser antibodies at 88.12% than those residing in non-slum areas at 93.32%. Around 94.3% of the samples tested of those fully vaccinated showed the presence of antibodies. With the help of ATE Chandra Foundation and IDFC Institute, who helped with financial and technical aspects, the corporation conducted the survey among nine wards in the city.“Our sample size included around 10 to 12% of people from each ward, 51% were from slums and another 49% from non-slum areas. We also divided the samples into six different age brackets,” said Milind Ubale, microbiologist and principal co-ordinator of the sero survey, TMC. He further added that although 91% of the samples have shown the presence of antibodies, they are still not sure whether it is enough to achieve herd immunity. “Very few countries with high vaccination numbers have seen another wave. Only Thane’s antibody count doesn’t matter. The status of neighbouring cities, states and countries will also impact a probable third wave,” he added.Dr Vipin Sharma, Commissioner, TMC, said, “We assumed that Majiwada Manpada area, which saw the highest number of cases, will have more antibodies, but that is not the case. Due to the presence of individual homes and lack of interaction with other families, this ward has around 79.21% antibodies, while the densely-populated Lokmanya-Savarkar Nagar may have developed immunity with the presence of 93.92% antibodies.” Uthalsar has the highest antibody population at 96% followed by Lokmanya and Savarkar Nagar. It has also come to light that those who are not vaccinated have only around 89% and 90% antibodies in slum and non-slum populations respectively. Those who are partially vaccinated in slums and non-slums have 90% and 96% antibodies present. While the presence of antibodies among fully vaccinated in non-slums continue to be at 96%, among those in slum areas the antibodies have increased to 92.22% after being fully vaccinated. “This 2% also matters and hence we are requesting everyone to get vaccinated with both doses at the earliest. The survey also highlights that those who have been fully vaccinated overall have developed a 94.8% antibody presence. Despite various efforts, we have noticed that among the slum population, those who have taken the first dose, do not return for their second dose,” said Naresh Mhaske, Mayor, Thane. For the first time in such a survey, samples of children from the age group of 6 to 18 were also collected. It has been observed that they have the lowest presence of antibodies at 83.43% as they have not been vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-91-positive-for-antibodies-in-tmc-s-sero-survey-101637937465662.html

The current fleet size of PMPML consists of 2,261 buses, but only around 1, 510 buses ply on the city roads.PMPML has 17 depots and 13 open spaces under its jurisdiction. Out of the 17 depots, four are reserved for electric buses. All depots and open spaces are located at prominent places in various areas across Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits. Maharashtra state government has already approved a 2.5-floor space index (FSI) for the land owned by PMPML.The proposal to develop these depots was taken during the board meeting held recently.Dattatrey Tulpule, incharge of the civil department of PMPML, said, “In the first phase, we will develop ten depots on the lease of 30 years. We have called proposals from private players to develop the land. We will provide some part of the land to private players for commercial utilisation.”To capitalise on the prime assets of the depots, PMPML had carried out a feasibility study of 30 depots a few months ago with help of a private agency named VK Associates. As per the report, PMPML needs ₹11,666 crore for the modernisation and development of existing depots.As per the report, depots can be developed according to the areas where they are located. The agency has estimated that the modernisation would fetch profits up to ₹1,516 crore for PMPML annually once the depots are developed and the space leased for commercial activities. The depots besides having facilities for buses will also have commercial offices, hotels, hospitals, which will bring in the desired revenues.At present, private players or government semi-government establishments are already using Pune station, Na Ta Wadi depot land for their official purpose on a lease basis.As per officials, the PMPML higher authority will take the final decision on the issue of already leased out land in various depots.As per the report, depots will have workshops along with ample parking facilities for the buses while the upper floors will accommodate hospitals, hotels and offices and other commercial establishments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/to-generate-more-revenue-pmpml-to-develop-10-depots-101637936985622.html

You’ll have to wait a little longer||PUNE With private offices resuming operations and the construction of the Metro in full swing, industries in Hinjewadi have stressed the completion of the alternate road to Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park through Maan-Mhalunge at the earliest. The Hinjewadi Industries Association (HIA) has also taken up the issue with the concerned authorities. The work of the proposed project has been jointly undertaken by the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and the Public works Department (PWD) of the state government. Col (Retd) Charanjeet Singh Bhogal, chief operating officer Hinjewadi Industries Association, said, “The road is in patches of three and six lanes. The road is nearing completion from the Maan area but has not been connected to the bridge that has been ready since January 2018. We have been told that the patch connecting the road to the bridge is incomplete because of the land acquisition issue. With companies resuming operations, we expect employee footfall to increase from January. Hence, the alternate route must be completed to avoid traffic snarls.” The alternate road to phase three of the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park in Hinjewadi through Maan-Mhalunge is expected to cut short the commute time by an hour, thus reducing the traffic congestion. However, the work on various stretches of the proposed road has been stalled due to opposition from locals. A senior official from MIDC who is monitoring the project and has conducted meetings with HIA, on the condition of anonymity said, “The MIDC is incharge of constructing the road and the responsibility of land acquisition lies with the PMRDA. Construction has been completed in areas where there is no land dispute. Though the construction of the bridge was completed in 2018, the land issue has affected its connectivity. We will complete the work as soon as this issue is resolved.” The HIA has also demanded an underpass on the Baner-Hinjewadi road to avoid the traffic congestion at the junction. “We have written to the National Highway Authority of India about it. They have pointed out some technical difficulties. But the work of the underpass and the alternate road should be done at the earliest,” added Bhogal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/waiting-for-respite-from-traffic-jams-at-hinjewadi-you-ll-have-to-wait-a-little-longer-101637936745823.html

Chugh added it has always been clear that Channi and Sidhu are not on the same page, because of their conflict of interest, but it is shame that in the process they have made Punjab an ugly stage of political gimmicks.Chugh said the AAP and the Akali Dal were also doing the same to the state. “Instead of making sensible statements and promises to the people, they are ridiculing people of Punjab by making false and baseless promises,” he said.Reacting to media reports that Channi’s brother was involved in the Ludhiana City scam, Chugh said the BJP has been always saying that the Punjab Congress is nothing, but mafia gangs and corruption personified.Chugh said the Congress government in Punjab did not know what the right hand was doing, and what was the left one getting into. He claimed the way Channi and Sidhu have been working at cross-purposes indicated that the Congress high command had no idea how a sensitive border state like Punjab has been handed over to political “tamashbins”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/channi-sidhu-enacting-tamasha-in-punjab-says-bjp-s-chugh-101637936565534.html

Shiv Sena, which boycotted the Constitution Day celebration along with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, said that the government has trampled the Constitution for the last seven years. Speaking in the Central Hall of the Parliament on the occasion of the Constitution Day on Friday, PM Modi said that dynasty politics is against the democratic nature of the country. Modi’s remark was indirectly aimed at Congress, but he also said that dynasty politics is seen right from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Reacting to the statement, Sena Member of Parliament (MP) and chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said, “The BJP has held the hand of such [family-run] political parties and has achieved this. BJP grew because of Shiv Sena [in Maharashtra]. They took the support of so-called family-run party [Peoples Democratic Party] in Kashmir to come to power in the state. It is convenient for them to make such statements now, but these parties have got the support of the people.” Senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the current Union government does not work as per the Constitution. “All the Opposition parties boycotted the event because our Constitution is trampled upon daily in the country. There is no rule of the Constitution in the nation, it is functioning in an autocratic manner,” he said. He added that the state’s rights and functioning are hampered through the Raj Bhavan in many states. “So why this pretence to celebrate Constitution Day?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-held-hands-of-family-run-parties-to-grow-says-shiv-sena-slams-pm-s-dynasty-politics-remark-101637935905386.html

As most of the safety walls along the stream were damaged in the floods that took place two years ago, the PMC decided to erect walls around its own properties along Ambil Odha. Dixit claimed that while the original tender cost was Rs15.13 crore, the cost of the project rose to Rs18.59 crore owing to the contractor’s inability to complete the work in time. He said that the project cost got unnecessarily inflated due to negligence on the part of the administration and the contractor. Taking note of Dixit’s complaint, the ACB asked the PMC to conduct an inquiry.Head of the PMC estate department Rajendra Muthe confirmed, “We received complaints about it and the PMC administration is carrying out an inquiry.”Two years ago, Ambil Odha was flooded due to heavy rain and the properties alongside from Katraj to Sadashiv peth were damaged. While there was demand for compound walls to be erected around private properties, both the state government and civic administration refused permission. Ultimately, the PMC decided to erect compound walls around its own properties that were damaged in the floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-initiates-inquiry-into-ambil-odha-compound-wall-construction-101637934885923.html

The 13-year-old survivor has told the police that she also got pregnant and had a miscarriage last month.

Earlier this month, some of the accused’s neighbours contacted the girl’s mother and told her that they had noticed that the girl was unwell and in great pain in October.

26-11-2021||Mumbai||AIMIM to campaign for Maharashtra municipal polls; rally on Dec 11||While parties like the Trinamool Congress are aggressively poaching the support bases of the Congress, the party will also have to contend with the presence of the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) in Maharashtra. Next month, the AIMIM will soft-launch its campaign for the Maharashtra municipal polls with a rally at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai on December 11, which will be addressed by party chief and Lok Sabha member of Parliament (MP) Asaduddin Owaisi and touch upon issues confronting the Muslim community. The AIMIM is attacking the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for allying with the pro-Hindutva Shiv Sena and for seeking the votes of the Muslims, yet dragging its feet on providing quotas for them. It is also demanding the revival of the waqf board and using its resources for the community’s welfare. Led by the firebrand Owaisi brothers from Hyderabad—Asaduddin and member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Akbaruddin Owaisi, the AIMIM appeals to a section of Muslims like the youth, who are of the opinion that the “secular” parties use them as a vote bank, while the community continued to be institutionally neglected and socially, politically and educationally backward. The AIMIM, which contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), notched up its first victory outside Hyderabad, with its Imtiaz Jaleel breaching the saffron stronghold of Aurangabad. Congress-NCP leaders grumble that the VBA ate into the “secular” votes, causing their defeat in eight constituencies. Though the alliance fell apart later, the AIMIM won two seats in the Maharashtra Assembly. “Between 2014 and 2019, the Congress and NCP were seeking that the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government must introduce quotas for the Muslims. But, why are they dragging their feet now that they are in power?” questioned Jaleel, AIMIM MP from Aurangabad, and the party’s Maharashtra chief. The Bombay high court (HC) had stayed the Maratha quota and reservations in jobs for Muslims that was introduced by the erstwhile Congress-NCP regime in 2014, but did not stay the decision to reserve 5% seats for Muslims in education. The BJP-Shiv Sena government later approved a bill for Maratha reservations, but did not cover Muslims. Muslims form 11.54% of Maharashtra’s population, the fourth-largest after Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar, with substantial numbers in Mumbai, Marathwada, Vidarbha and North Maharashtra. The AIMIM is demanding a revival package for the Maharashtra State Board of Waqf (MSBW), which controls 93,000 acre of prime Muslim endowment lands across Maharashtra, but has few resources to protect it. “The board must get a one-time (revival) package. These vacant lands must be used for starting schools, commercial complexes to generate employment, and hostels for girls.” sought Jaleel, noting that most waqf lands are encumbered. Jaleel said they had originally planned to hold the rally as part of this campaign on November 27, but were denied permissions by the police citing Covid-19 restrictions. He stated that the Shiv Sena, Congress, NCP and the BJP, were conducting public meetings, even without the consent of the police. The AIMIM has, hence, threatened to hold the meeting at the BKC grounds, even if the permissions do not come through and its workers will come to Mumbai in vehicles flying the tricolour, instead of the party standard, to mark the 75th year of India’s independence. Jaleel said that while political motives could be attributed to this campaign being launched before the municipal elections, they were “raising genuine questions at the right time.” Critics of the Muslim quota move oppose religion-based reservations, and note how weaker sections in the community have already been covered in categories like Other Backward Class (OBC). The economically-weaker groups can seek quota benefits under the 10% economically weaker sections (EWS) reservations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aimim-to-campaign-for-maharashtra-municipal-polls-rally-on-dec-11-101637934465303.html

26-11-2021||Mumbai||Zero beds occupied at Thane Covid Care Centres||Thane With increased vaccination and lower positive cases, the occupancy in Covid Care Centres for mild or asymptomatic patients in Thane city has become zero post-Diwali. Moreover, in the last few days, occupancy of oxygen beds has also come down to 0.8%. According to Thane Municipal Corporation officials, the symptoms among positive patients are less and hence, they prefer isolating at home. “We hardly have a handful of patients at our dedicated Covid centres. We have all the required infrastructure in place for the third wave,” said Sandeep Malvi, Additional Commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation. There are 4,166 beds in dedicated Covid centres or jumbo facilities within TMC jurisdiction, and hardly 70 of the beds are occupied currently. Similarly, only 19 ICU beds and eight ventilator beds are currently occupied. Among the 404 oxygen beds, hardly eight are occupied. The city has been adding about 40 cases on a daily basis. As Thane city has a recovery rate of 98.31% and an overall growth rate of Covid cases stood at .03 per cent over the past week, two Covid care centres were shut down. “Everyone still has to follow all Covid protocols. Thanks to vaccination, the impact is much less when compared to the need for hospitalisation during the first and second waves. We have around 300 active cases at present,” added Malvi. Since August this year, the requirement for Covid beds has reduced drastically. In mid-April, when cases were at the peak, 80% of beds were occupied and most people faced a shortage of beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/zero-beds-occupied-at-thane-covid-care-centres-101637933085308.html

The SIT, which IGP Surinder Pal Singh Parmar is heading, has now issued fresh summons to both office-bearers of the Sirsa-based dera to appear at the Ludhiana Range office on December 3. Vipassana and Nain are also facing allegations of orchestrating violence in Panchkula in August 2017, a special CBI court convicted dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim in a rape case. Nain cited poor health to be seek exemption from appearance and submitted his medical report through his counsel. The SIT has received no communication from Vipassana. Vipassana and Nain were asked to appear before the SIT chief Parmar on November 26 at 9am at the Ludhiana Range office in connection with an FIR lodged at the Bajakhana police station on June 2, 2015. The FIR was registered after a bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village of Faridkot district. Summons were issued under Section 160 (police officer’s power to require attendance of witnesses) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). SIT head Parmar said, “Nain has sent his medical report citing poor health for his unavailability. We have not received any communication from Vipassana. Police are required to send three summons to a person before moving court. We have summoned them again on next Friday for the same purpose. If Nain appears, we will ask him about the whereabouts of Vipassana, as she has been missing for over a year,” he added. “During interrogation, Ram Rahim has put the entire blame on the dera management. The questioning of Vipassana, who is a top official of the dera’s administration block, will lead to more evidence,” said an official. On November 8, the SIT had asked 114 questions from the dera head during his seven-hour grilling at the Sunaria Jail in Rohtak. Following this, the SIT had submitted a 65-page status report in the Punjab and Haryana high court on November 12. An interrogation report, including a copy of the questionnaire as well as replies of Ram Rahim, were also filed along with the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2015-sacrilege-case-dera-sacha-sauda-admn-head-vipassana-vice-head-nain-fail-to-appear-before-sit-101637932306339.html

That is, it is clear that they are not doing it. That's why our party today has not participated in this programme by the central and state governments,” Mayawati said.She also said that benefits of reservations in education and government jobs as enshrined in the Constitution have not reached the intended sections of society. This, she said, is “sad and concerning” for the people and also for her party.Also read | On 1 year of farmers’ protests, Priyanka Gandhi hails ‘unshakable satyagraha’“Is the Constitution being followed in the ideal way by the central and state governments?

The central government has withdrawn their three agricultural laws, which is a very late step. But there are many other important demands of the farmers, which must also be accepted by the central government,” she added.President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the Constitution Day event in Parliament on the day even as key opposition leaders skipped the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/constitution-not-being-followed-with-honesty-says-bsp-chief-mayawati-as-party-skips-official-event-101637928443779.html

26-11-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: How software colours the social dynamics of behaviour||Darkness falls across the landThe midnight hour is close at handCreatures crawl in search of bloodTo terrorise y’all’s neighbourhoodAnd whosoever shall be foundWithout the soul for getting downMust stand and face the hounds of hellAnd rot inside a corpse’s shell...Last week this Rod Temperton lyric (immortalised by the voice of Vincent Price) in Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” started playing itself in my head - in auto-repeat - as I switched on my work computer, waited for updates to be installed and then found dark theme magically appear on my Microsoft Outlook. I like dark theme, except when I don’t. And there’s a science behind it.I am the kind that sets preferences and then doesn’t fiddle with anything since I like to focus on my work and not on prettying up my workplace, interface or surroundings or ‘personalising’ anything. To be precise, once I have set a preference, I won’t revisit it at all because it has nothing to do with my efficiency. Till the software decides to affect my efficiency by overriding my preferences.So, what’s the science behind my preference setting? I evaluate designs in stress-test mode, especially colour schemes on interfaces. This is because an interface is something that one stares at for long hours across months and it has a significant impact on our feelings and psychology which in turn has an impact on our moods which in turn affects performance in terms of quality and timelines.Historically, in the device space, there were light-on-dark colour schemes on screens because of how computer screens evolved (from cathode-ray oscilloscopes and oscillographs). Dark-on-light colour schemes emerged when word processors were developed to give the ink-on-paper feel. My experience with computers started sometime in the early 1980s and till the mid-1990s, I was primarily working with green or off-white coloured text on black backgrounds. If you have seen Matrix, you’ll understand why the classic green text falling on a black screen is a comfort. But am also very comfortable with the black and dark colour on a white background that emerged as normal from the mid-1990s till now.What I can’t stand is badly designed colour schemes on interfaces or themes. What’s a badly designed colour scheme? One that doesn’t take into account what happens when one is staring at the colour scheme beyond 15- 20 minutes and one that doesn’t account for the impact of the colour choices on all the existing visual assets in a digital workspace and one that doesn’t account for the psychological impact of all this. It usually takes a few minutes for me to get upset with a unilateral change but the underlying stress factor is the bad design which will lead me to redo my entire digital workspace.I use dark theme as a preference on my Apple devices and that’s because Apple doesn’t release nor allow any developer to release any design changes unless it meets stringent standards. I use light themes on non-Apple ecosystems because the design standards are different and they require me to do the work (waste my time) to adjust my environment. In my experience, Apple seems to respect my time and so goes that extra mile to ensure that dark or light colour schemes do not affect my productivity due to the lack of adequate stress testing on their part. From a data perspective, I can switch from light to dark theme on an Apple device as a matter of preference at any given moment without hurting my eyes or my mood and just get on with my work. On non-Apple devices, it’s absolute stress because the particular blue on the particular dark grey isn’t thought through and starts hurting the eye or it doesn’t go with my corporate signature line colours which are affected because of the theme change. And I think this is because device manufacturers and software companies tend to be more democratic in their responsibilities and leave the choice to users.Dark themes use less energy and that’s why they are a better-informed choice (an informed choice is different from a personal preference). But what I expect from technology and software companies is that they draw the lines of what are their responsibilities and what are mine. I am paying for and using their productivity software to produce work not for me to spend my time adjusting their product.To illustrate choice and preference, I love Microsoft Office software (especially PowerPoint), but in the Apple ecosystem instead of in the HP or Dell ecosystem with Windows environment. (FYI: I use Office in all three environments regularly, so I can state this as a comparative analysis). The same applies to games and apps.But thankfully, all is well that ended well. For now. Microsoft on Dell allows me to change my preference which is what I did after 15 minutes of living with their dark theme. What I don’t understand is why they decided to install dark theme as default and make me change my preference? I would rather prefer they inform me about the option, leave it to me to take a tour and then change my preference instead of changing it for me. I voluntarily change to an energy-saving dark theme on most software if the dark theme design quality is going to lead me to be efficient. If it doesn’t, I will fight it till it is mandated by law because I spend more time doing my work on badly designed digital environments which means I use as much if not more energy as I would on a dark-on-light theme.As we go deeper and deeper digital, tech and software companies will lead the way in changing social behaviour, since they have the deepest reach. While they are leading such change, I hope they do not start implementing universal defaults too frequently without adequately researching adverse effects on digital habits on social and psychological behaviour and performance and related impacts. We may not have much choice in expensive ideal ecosystems which design responsibly, but there is no dearth of choice in badly designed alternatives. And increasing market share in that kind of democratic setup will be nothing short of facing the hounds of hell - for consumers and sellers.Sanjay Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana education department faces flak for snubbing teachers, delay in NCERT textbooks||Additional deputy commissioner (ADC, general) Rahul Chaba and member of the Sikhya Sudhar Committee on Thursday grilled officials of the district education department for reprimanding teachers who voiced their concerns over students of some government school students not receiving their NCERT textbooks with just 17 days left for their board exams.In the previous meeting held in October, ADC Chaba and members of the committee had pulled up officials of the district education department for not providing textbooks to all students enrolled with government schools in the district.A teacher from Kot Mangal Government High School, who had raised the issue, was summoned by the officials on November 16. According to the teacher, a senior education officer called the school head and snubbed her over the same issue.Jatinder Pal Singh Saluja, a member of the Sikhya Sudhar Committee, raised the issue in the meeting on Thursday, stating that if the education officials reprimand teachers for voicing the issues concerning the welfare of the students, the purpose of conducting monthly meetings will be defeated.“Instead of providing books to the students, the senior officials in the education department chose to target the teacher, which is disappointing. What is the purpose of the meeting when they don’t want to sincerely work for the welfare of the students,” said Saluja.In the last meeting, the issue related to chlorination of water for the students was also raised.On the morning before the meeting on Thursday, officials from the education department called the head of Kot Mangal High school and insisted that she submit in writing that chlorination was carried out in the school, following the instructions from the education department.“We refused to give it in writing, since no chlorination was carried out at the school. They asked us to submit the report, but why should we submit the fake report. They were trying to save their skin. I urge all the school heads to not make any fake report under pressure from the officials, as our job is to work for the welfare of the students,” said Sukhdarshan Singh, teacher at the school.Commenting on the issue, ADC Rahul said, “I have directed the officials to act on the issues in a time-bound manner and keep the health department in the loop for chlorination of water in schools for the students. I appreciate the sincere and active efforts of the public representatives who highlight such serious issues for the welfare of the students”. However, the education department on Thursday delivered the NCERT textbooks to the students of the government High School, Kot Mangal.Meanwhile, a teacher of a government high school said that the education department didn’t provide books to all the schools, but only distributed textbooks to the schools where teachers voiced the issue to the higher authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-education-department-faces-flak-for-snubbing-teachers-delay-in-ncerttextbooks-101637922944147.html
26-11-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan Cabinet rejig seen as attempt to woo traditional Congress voters||The reshuffle in Rajasthan’s council of ministers appears to be in line with the Congress’s renewed focus on its traditional core vote bank of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) as well as women and youngsters. The nine SC and ST ministers in chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s Cabinet have also been given important portfolios. The number of women in it has been increased from one to three.The reshuffle in Rajasthan followed the elevation of Charanjeet Singh Channi, a Dalit, as Punjab’s chief minister, and the Congress’s announcement for a quota in tickets for women in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.Gehlot inducted five ministers ST ministers Mahendrajit Singh Malviya, Ramesh Meena, Parsadi Lal Meena, Murari Lal Meena, and Arjun Bamaniya. The first three have been given Cabinet berths. Four SC lawmakers Govind Ram Meghwal, Mamta Bhupesh, Tikaram Juli, and Bhajan Lal Jatav were also made Cabinet ministers. Meghwal is a new entrant while the remaining three were promoted.A Congress leader said this rejig was done in view of the 2023 assembly elections with a special focus on Dalits, ST, and women. ST account for 12% and SC 18% of Rajasthan’s population.Also Read: 50 bird flu deaths reported from Sambhar lake after Jodhpur and PaliAll five new Dalit Cabinet ministers are from eastern Rajasthan, which borders Uttar Pradesh. Of the 58 assembly seats in eastern Rajasthan (Bharatpur, Dholpur, Karauli, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa, Alwar districts), around 40 seats are with the Congress.Two women--Shakuntla Rawat and Mamta Bhupesh-- were given Cabinet ranks while Zahida Khan was made a junior minister. The women’s representation in the Cabinet is now 10%. There are 27 women in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly. The Congress has 15 women lawmakers and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 10.State Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasara said the party has always focused on SC, ST, Other Backward Classes, minorities, women, and youths and worked to bring them into the mainstream. “The Cabinet rejig too focused on these factors. It is probably for the first time that such a high representation of women, SC and ST has been ensured.”Opposition BJP leader Rajendra Rathore said Congress conducted a survey in which it found its SC votes in all states were slipping away. “So attempts are being made to hold them back. But the Congress will not succeed as its government has stalled beneficiary schemes benefitting the poor.”Political analyst Manish Godha said SC and ST have traditionally been Congress’s core vote banks and the Congress has given them priority in the reshuffle two years before the polls. “The state government has sent a timely message to these communities through this rejig. Had it made this decision late, it would have appeared to be election-oriented.” Godha said Congress is making efforts to woo its traditional vote bank citing Channi’s elevation and ticket quota in Uttar Pradesh. “The Cabinet rejig seems to be a mix of increasing Dalit, women, and youth participation,” he said. He added the exercise was to send a message to voters also in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-cabinet-rejig-seen-as-attempt-to-woo-traditional-congress-voters-101637922284474.html

26-11-2021||Lucknow||UP now one of the most investor friendly states in India, says CM Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Aditynath Friday lauded the achievements of his government in the fields of industrialisation and financial growth and claimed that improvement in law and order and reforms have helped the state scale up to the number two position in the country in the last five years.Uttar Pradesh is now one of the most investor friendly states in the country, where an investor has no longer to worry either about his personal safety and security or that of his investments, he said at a prgramme here.“The change that took place in Uttar Pradesh in the last five years is clearly visible on the ground. Factors such as improvement in law and order situation, better reforms and ease of doing business have helped the state attain a leading position as an investor friendly destination and to drive the country's economy,” he said addressing the annual session of the Indian Chamber of Commerce virtually.During 2015-16 Uttar Pradesh was in the sixth position in the country in terms of the financial system parameters. It has jumped to the "second or third positions" in the last five years, he said.Adityanath had assumed office in March 2017 and election to the most populous state of the country is due next year. “In terms of implementation of central schemes, Uttar Pradesh was earlier either in the 25th or 30th position. Now in respect of at least 44 central schemes, it is in the number one position. Earlier, we had only two expressways, but now we have five new ones. Uttar Pradesh will soon be the only state in the country with five international airports,” he said.The chief minister also claimed that the state had set a new export record in the MSME sector.“Uttar Pradesh had recorded exports in MSME sector worth 1.31 lakh crore.

26-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks clarity from Centre on need for booster shots of Covid-19 vaccine||The Delhi high court has sought a categorical reply from the Centre on the necessity of Covid-19 vaccine’s booster doses for fully vaccinated people citing increasing advocacy for them in western countries.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh on Thursday wondered how the West is encouraging boosters when the Indian government was not permitting even those who voluntarily want to take them to do so. “There have been contrary opinions about the booster. On one hand, we heard Dr [Randeep] Guleria [of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi] saying that there is no scientific basis for the booster dose...” The bench cited interaction with a doctor backing the booster shots. “And we may again face an onslaught. This is a very serious issue that needs to be looked into.”The bench said countries such as the US are not only permitting but also advocating the use of booster doses. “As per a news report, even Israel is also promoting the use of booster doses.”Also Read: Europe rethinks booster shot policy as Covid cases hit recordsThe court said booster doses are an expensive proposition, which might be a reason why they are not being considered. “But then we do not want to land up in a situation that we are overtly conservative in this and we land up in a situation like the second (Covid-19) wave. We may lose the advantage of all these vaccinations.” The court asked the Centre to file an affidavit over booster doses and the timeline within which they are proposed to be rolled out if necessary.The bench was hearing pleas, including that of lawyer Rakesh Malhotra for better facilities to tackle Covid-19. It took note of newspaper reports and amicus curiae Rajshekhar Rao’s submission that a large number of vaccines would be wasted as they are reaching the expiry date.“...particularly those falling in the old age bracket and those suffering from other diseases are anxious whether they require a booster dose. There are also reports that large numbers of vaccine doses are lying unused and whose shelf life will expire,” the court said.Anurag Ahluwalia, who appeared for the Centre, said he would take instructions and file an affidavit. The court posted the matter for hearing on December 14.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, asked the Centre to give a plan or decide on the booster doses as most of the people have taken double doses.The court also sought to know the status of vaccinating people aged below 18. Ahluwalia said that approvals have been given for vaccines and clinical trials were going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-seeks-clarity-from-centre-on-need-for-booster-shots-of-covid-19-vaccine-101637907640000.html

In the 2015 Bihar assembly elections, arch-rivals JD(U) and RJD came together to form the Mahagathbandhan, and defeated the NDA. While Nitish Kumar became the alliance’s chief minister, Tejashwi Yadav was appointed as the deputy CM.However, in 2017, the alliance crumbled over corruption allegations against the RJD leader. Nitish once again joined hands with the BJP, thus continuing in his chair. Then, in last year’s assembly polls, the Kumar-led NDA registered a narrow win over the Yadav-led Mahagathbandhan.Now on opposite sides, the two politicians have taken frequent jibes at each other. Friday’s tweet by Yadav comes in the backdrop of several hooch tragedies in Bihar in recent days, in which more than three dozen people have lost their lives. The incidents took place despite a ban on consumption of alcohol in the state, which came into effect on April 1, 2016, when the Mahagathbandhan was in power.Also Read | Remember your pledge, says Nitish Kumar in a counterattack on Tejashwi YadavEarlier this month, the chief minister ruled out a review of the liquor law, saying that he hardly cares about what others says about the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/you-took-this-oath-as-well-tejashwi-yadav-s-swipe-at-nitish-kumar-over-pledge-against-liquor-consumption-101637904174387.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest taught us how to fight for our rights with patience: Kejriwal||On the first anniversary of the farmers’ protest, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said their struggle against three contentious farm laws enacted last year has taught people how to fight for one’s rights with patience. Lauding the year-long struggle, which forced the Centre to announce the repeal of the laws, Kejriwal tweeted, “The farmers’ movement has completed one year today. This historical movement has faced a lot of conspiracies apart from [extreme] weather. The farmers have taught us how to fight for our rights with patience. I salute the courage, spirit and sacrifice of our farmers.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced last week the government will repeal the laws. Farmers have been protesting against the laws on Delhi’s borders.Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party, which emerged as a major political force in Punjab in 2017, has been supporting the farmers’ agitation, which began in the northern state.Also Read: Cabinet gives nod for repeal of farm lawsLast week, Kejriwal called the Centre’s decision to repeal the three a “victory of democracy”. “It is a golden day in India’s history. It is like Independence Day and Republic Day. The central government had to bow down before the farmers’ movement and repeal all three black farm laws. This is not just a win for the farmers; it is the victory of democracy. The farmers have made every government realise that in a democracy, they have to listen to the people. Governments have to bow down to the people. Arrogance would not work,” Kejriwal said on November 23, hours after Modi’s surprise announcement.Kejriwal visited the farmer protest site at the Singhu border on December 7 last year to review the arrangements made there. On December 8, when the protesting farmers called for a Bharat Bandh, Kejriwal said he wanted to visit Singhu but was put under “house arrest”. On December 27, he visited Singhu again to participate in a cultural event of the Delhi government. In February, he addressed a farmer gathering in Meerut. Kejriwal criticised the Centre after a convoy of cars, including one belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra, ran over farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. The violence that the mowing down of the farmers triggered left eight people dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-taught-us-how-to-fight-for-our-rights-with-patience-kejriwal-101637904039462.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mining without environmental clearance: HC notice to Punjab, Centre on plea seeking action against officials||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought response from Punjab government and the Centre on a plea alleging that a mining contract was awarded to a private person in Ropar without getting environmental clearance. The high court bench comprising justice MSR Rao and justice Jasjit Singh Bedi has sought a response by December 17. The plea demands that Centre directs Punjab government to initiate action against the department officials concerned for allowing mining through a contract awarded in 2019, even though no environmental clearance was given for the site in question. The plea further presses for an enquiry conducted by an Independent Agency in view of the state’s connivance with the private contractor. It also demands that the contract be declared illegal. The plea was filed by Bachittar Singh, who runs a stone crushing unit in Ropar, claiming that he is directly aggrieved by the government’s action as he has no option but to buy raw material from him even as mining is being carried out illegally. The plea states that a March 2020 report from a chief judicial magistrate established the fact that the contractor in question has put up illegal check nakas. The high court ordered a preliminary probe, which was carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation. But with the Punjab government promising action, no further proceedings were ordered by the court. The plea, however, cited the Pollution Control Board’s recent objections on the present site, saying that it proved that no environmental clearance was given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mining-without-environmental-clearance-hc-notice-to-punjab-centre-on-plea-seeking-action-against-officials-101637874814301.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: Punjab CM wants killer curve on Airport Road to go||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has directed the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to find a solution to straighten out the deadly curve on the Airport Road near Mata Sundri gurdwara in Sector 70, officials said. As per a report, at least 100 accidents have occurred on the said stretch and 12 people have lost their lives ever since the road has been constructed. As per the officials privy to the matter, chief minister Channi has also approached Baba Balbir Singh, the chief of Budha Dal that runs the gurdwara, to chalk out a solution. The curve has been tagged as a ‘black spot’ considering the large number of accidents taking place there. At the time of the Airport Road construction, a portion of land was not released by the gurdwara set up by a particular sect head, forcing the government to build the road with an ‘S’ curve. However, Baba Balbir Singh said, “We have not got any such proposal from any authority. But once we get it, we will look into it.” Additional chief administrator of GMADA, Damanjit Singh Mann said, “We are planning to straighten out the curve, but the talks with the gurdwara authorities will be held at higher level.” Area councillor Sukhdev Singh Patwari had written a letter to GMADA, suggesting to allot land to the gurdwara authorities somewhere else. He even laid out a design for straightening of the road. According to the data provided by the Mohali police, the Airport Road has seen around 300 fatal accidents this year, at least 100 of which took place at this particular curve wherein 12 lives were lost. Former executive engineer NS Kalsi said it is possible to straighten the road by constructing a new stretch on government land in Sector 77, opposite to the existing curve. “When the road was being constructed, we had warned GMADA that the curve will prove fatal, but to no avail. Now, it is one of the most accident-prone spots in Mohali,” he added. In April 2019, Punjab traffic adviser Navdeep Asija, after conducting a three-dimensional safety audit using drones, had revealed major flaws in the design of Airport Road, and stated in the report that it is not pedestrian and cyclist-friendly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-punjab-cm-wants-killer-curve-on-airport-road-to-go-101637874214154.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||BJP open to forming alliance with like-minded political party: Malik||Senior BJP leader MP Shwait Malik, who was in the city on Thursday, has not ruled out the possibility of the saffron party forming a pre-poll or post-poll alliance with “any like-minded political party.” Malik, who was in town to take feedback from industrialists, traders, small businessmen and sale-tax lawyers , said politics was all about permutation and combinations. “We cannot rule out the possibility of forming an alliance with a like-minded political party. Nonetheless, we have decided to field candidate for all 117 seats,” said Malik, when asked about the possibility of forging an alliance with former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s newly floated Punjab Lokhit Party.On the repealing of the three farm laws, Malik said, “We are fortunate to have a compassionate Prime Minister who repealed the farm laws and did not turn it into an ego issue, though the three laws were in the interest of the farmers. Nearly 80% of the farmers had hailed the new laws, but only the farmers of Punjab and Haryana were emotional about it. So, the PM decided to repeal the laws.”Apart from Congress leaders, former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had also praised the three farm laws.SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who was a minister at the time, had read the ordinance and even signed the laws, he said. Asked about chances of renewing its alliance with the SAD, Malik said such decisions were taken by the party high command. He accused the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party of making false promises ahead of the assembly polls. “Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief president Navjot Singh Sidhu is shaming chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in public for making false promises. Not to be left behind, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is also taking the people for a ride on the issue of farm laws. We will make only those promises that can be fulfilled,” said Malik.Senior taxation lawyer Varinder Bobby Sharma stressed on the need to simplify GST, while senior advocate KL Sikri stressed on bringing in efficient tenancy laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-open-to-forming-alliance-with-like-minded-political-party-malik-101637872532873.html

The appointment of Kotlabama, an aide of Punjab cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, as Punjab Genco Limited chairman stirred a row after the opposition parties and even some Congress leaders opposed the move over his relation with Avtar Pannu. He said, “I have not talked to him (Avtar) since 2007 when he visited India last. I have been a soldier of the Congress for the last 42 years. I was chairman of the Batala market committee and remained the sarpanch of my village Kotlabama for 25 years. Till recently, I was district vice-president of the Congress.” Kotlabama said he was against the idea of Khalistan. “A senseless man named Gurpatwant Singh Pannu is running his own agenda. My brother was lured by him. Security agencies can conduct an inquiry to check my links with these secessionist elements,” he said over phone.He accused former MLA Ashwani Sekhri of targeting him over the issue. “Actually, there is a turf war between Tript Bajwa and Sekhri over the Batala assembly seat. To target Bajwa, Sekhri is making me a scapegoat,” he said.He also slammed Qadian MLA Fatehjung Singh Bajwa for targeting him over the “baseless issue”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/have-no-link-with-brother-avtar-pannu-says-balwinder-kotlabama-101637872352932.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana coaching centre told to refund ₹15k to NEET aspirant||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has asked a coaching centre in Kitchlu Nagar to refund ₹15,000 to a NEET aspirant for failing to complete the crash course she had enrolled for in the stipulated period and pay an additional ₹3,000 to the complainant as compensation. The complainant, Anjali Chaudhary, who was seeking coaching for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), had accused the coaching centre, Gian Setu, located in 68B, Kitchlu Nagar, of “deficiency in service.” On March 18, 2020, Chaudhary had approached the coaching centre, seeking enrolment in a 45-day crash course. She was told that the course would cost ₹25,000 and classes would start from March 23, 2020, following which she paid the first instalment of ₹15,000. After a nationwide lockdown was announced on March 23, the centre offered to provide online classes against the ₹15,000 payment already made to the institute. Chaudhary said classes started in April, but the Biology teacher took coaching classes for only 15 days, and only went through one of the two books in the syllabus, the physics and chemistry teachers only turned up for two lectures, after which they stopped taking classes. Chaudhary contended that since it was a crash course and was to be completed within the stipulated time frame, the respondent’s failure to complete the course amounted to deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. She sought a refund, along with a compensation of ₹5 lakh. With no one appearing on the behalf of the respondent, the hearing proceeded ex parte. In its order, the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission said, “This clearly amounts to deficiency of services. In the given circumstances, in our considered view, it would be just and proper if the respondent is directed to refund ₹15,000 along with composite compensation of ₹3,000 to the complainant within 30 days of receiving a copy of the order”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-coaching-centre-told-to-refund-15k-to-neet-aspirant-101637872295185.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala: Dilapidated Barara bus stand cries for attention||The bus stand of Ambala’s Barara sub-division, about 50km from the district headquarters, is in a dilapidated condition. The bus stand was inaugurated in 1990.The public convenience facilities at the terminal, which is spread across around four acres of land, are filthy and without doors, besides a continuous source of unbearable foul smell. The RO drinking water system at the premises is out of order. Since the bus stand doesn’t have a waiting area for passengers, most of them prefer getting onto a bus from the exit gate, Dharamveer, a social activist, said. “Government and private buses for Ambala, Yamunanagar, Delhi and other nearby towns are available here. The situation has not changed even after Barara got its own municipal council recently. There is no provision of sweeping and a pond full of garbage behind the bus stand adds to the woes of the people,” he added. Last week, Congress MLA from Mullana, Varun Chaudhary, under whose constituency the area comes, visited the terminus. “It seems that it has not been renovated since it was opened. The ladies toilet doesn’t have a door. The ceiling is coming off here and there and loose wires can be seen hanging. This is an example how a public property shouldn’t look like,” the legislator added. Chaudhary further said that he has highlighted the issue before the transport department and will also raise it in the upcoming assembly session.Joginder Rawal, roadways’ general manager at Ambala depot, who took charge on Monday, said that he’ll visit the site this week and order early restoration of basic facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-dilapidated-barara-bus-stand-cries-for-attention-101637872292778.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||In Chandigarh, women are more prone to diabetes||The prevalence of diabetes among adults in Chandigarh has increased manifold in the past five years, making the UT worst-affected with the disease in the region, data released by the National Family Health Survey-5 has revealed.As per the recent survey, 12% of women (in the age group of 15 and above) in Chandigarh have very high blood sugar level with readings of more than 160 mg/dl. Meanwhile, 6% women have high blood sugar levels between 141-160 mg/dl. The data also revealed that 19% women in the city are taking medicine to control their blood sugar.The data also revealed that the prevalence of diabetes is lesser in male adults in Chandigarh. Around 7.1% of men have high blood sugar level while 8.8% have very high blood sugar level. Also, 16.6% are on diabetes medication.The national average for women and men with very high blood sugar level stands at 6.3% and 7.2%, respectively.The prevalence of diabetes in Chandigarh was lower when the last survey (NFHS-4) was conducted in 2015-2016. Only 2.5% women and 4.2% men had very high sugar level, while 5.6% women and 6.9% men had high sugar level.NFHS-5 (2020-21), conducted by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, is the fifth in the series and provides information on population, health, and nutrition for India and each state and UT. The information for the survey was gathered from 761 households, which included 746 women and 104 men, in Chandigarh.Food habits, sedentary lifestyle major causes“In Chandigarh, more women are employed as compared to other states. This means, the women are burdened with office and household work, due to which they get less time for exercise and more stress. All these reasons are increasing diabetes among women,” said Dr Sanjay Bhadada, head of the department of endocrinology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).Dr Bhadada said diabetes patients also develop other lifestyle diseases, and it was found that around 60% of the Covid-19 patients at the PGIMER had diabetes. “Diabetes was a major comorbidity that had contributed in Covid-19 fatality rate,” he said.Dr Anil Bhansali, former head of the endocrinology department at the PGIMER, said: “A study — Chandigarh Urban Diabetic Study — conducted in 2010 showed that 13% adults were diabetic. In 2017, ICMR had also conducted a study that showed 13% of adults (living in urban and rural areas) in Chandigarh were diabetic.”The major reasons behind high prevalence of this disease are adolescent and adulthood obesity in Chandigarh residents, besides their sedentary lifestyle, he said. “Also, since people of Chandigarh are literate, they go for screening of the disease and high testing reveals high prevalence,” he said.Dr KP Singh, an endocrinologist, said: “Mostly, people in Chandigarh have diabetic family history and as per a study, 80% of the city residents do not exercise even when they have facilities like beautiful parks and open gyms. Not only this, the residents have busy lifestyles and their habit of consuming fried food, especially at late evening hours, is increasing diabetes.”Dr Singh added that hypertension and diabetes are interlinked and if a diabetic person doesn’t get hypertension at an early stage, it is likely that 90% of the patients will get hypertension after 10 years. Also, after the Covid-19 outbreak, diabetes prevalence has increased as the virus directly impacts pancreas, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-chandigarh-women-aremore-prone-to-diabetes-101637872063074.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Ram Darbar paints a dirty picture in Ward 19||Chandigarh’s Ward No. 19 has been formed by combining Ram Darbar, which was earlier a part of Ward No. 23, and the Industrial Area, Phase 2, which was under Ward No. 22. There are around 23,000 voters in the ward, of whom about 20,000 reside in Ram Darbar, a semi-urban locality on the outskirts of the main city.It is one of three wards that have been reserved for women candidates from the scheduled caste community.Ram Darbar is composed of various phases and is situated right next to the 3 BRD Air Force Station. Garbage can be seen strewn along the boundary of the station right at the entrance to the area. Jagat Singh, 68, who lives nearby, says many residents dispose of the domestic and construction waste close to the wall. A forest area is situated opposite the colony, and as per Kavita, 44, a home owner here, it emanates foul smell every time it rains.Inside Ram Darbar, the roads are in a bad shape, which residents complain haven’t been repaired for years. The law and order situation is also bad, and Pankaj Goyal, 32, who runs a shop here, says valuables kept inside cars parked on the roads get stolen frequently.Kamlesh, former two-time mayor from the Congress (1996 and 2004) also lives in Ram Darbar. She says the locality’s condition has been deteriorating every year. “The biggest decline has been in the cleanliness situation of Ram Darbar. The MC employees park the garbage collection vehicles on the road and tell people to throw their garbage, rather than lifting it on their own. The houses here are built in clusters, with a small park between every 30 houses or so. These gardens are not maintained at all. The MC workers hardly visit to pick the garbage from these spots,” she says.Local councillor Bharat Kumar agrees that cleanliness is a big problem, but says that he has been working on it. “I get the sanitation workers to clean the areas wherever heaps of garbage are found. At many places, people throw malba as well, which I get cleared every fortnight or so. I have also worked on resolving the sewerage and water supply issues,” he says. Industrialists feel ignoredThe Industrial Area, Phase 2, suffers from traffic congestion with no space available for parking vehicles. Visitors end up parking the vehicles on pedestrian paths, leaving no space for others to walk. The industrialists want the next councillor to take the issues concerning the area seriously and raise them in the MC General House.Davesh Moudgil, who represents the area, says he had worked towards allowing industrialists working in marla plots to load and unload their vehicles without getting challaned. “We got a booster pump installed to ensure water supply during the day, not just in the morning and evening. Further, I built two parks as many industrialists complained that there weren’t any places for them to walk.”Know your wardLocalities: Ram Darbar and Industrial Area, Phase 2Reserved for SC womenVoters: 23,000Key issuesGarbage is dumped on roadside and vacant spots in Ram DarbarMC not ensuring upkeep of parks in Ram DarbarPoorly maintained roads and chronic parking problem across ward Local voicesThe parking issue is the key problem.

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC election: Influencers, mobile app to pull voters to polling booths||From mobile apps to roping in popular personalities, the State Election Commission (SEC), Chandigarh, will be starting a voter awareness campaign in December ahead of the municipal elections.For the last two consecutive municipal elections, the voter turnout has stagnated at around 59%. This time around, with the polling day, December 24, falling at the start of a long winter vacation, there is added concern that the voting percentage might go down.Political parties are particularly worried that city residents might opt out of voting and instead go for outstation travel during the holidays. “In previous elections, the polling day was generally a Sunday, well before start of winter holidays. So, we have to see how people respond to the changed situation this time around,” said a senior BJP leader.On its part, for bringing more voters out on the D-Day, and particularly keeping the holiday scenario in mind, the SEC is planning to involve famous personalities from sports, entertainment and social sectors to encourage people to vote.“We have zeroed in on a few influencers. We have approached them to get involved in our voter awareness campaign. While one of them will be the face of the campaign, others will also motivate people to vote,” said a senior functionary of the SEC, who didn’t want to be named.For greater involvement of the voters, and ease of casting of votes, the SEC will also launch a mobile app. “It will be a voter-centric mobile app. Voters will be able to know about the candidates being fielded from various wards. There will be application forms. Provision will be made for filing complaints of violation of the moral code of conduct. Location of polling booths will also be made available,” said the official.Elements like information on the number of voters queuing up at a booth might also be included in the app. “The voters rarely get to know the queue at the polling station and young voters get dissuaded due to the long queue. So, this element in the app will also encourage them to vote,” the official said.The SEC will also use the traditional mass media platforms — television, radio, newspapers and outdoor publicity — to ensure greater participation of voters. “Special jingles will be made for radio broadcasts. Similarly, at strategic locations like major roundabouts, we will put banners motivating people to vote. In educational institutions, we will attempt to spread the message of importance of casting vote,” the official said.Parties working hard tooParties are also gearing up their own campaign so that their supporters do vote on the D-Day. “We are happy with the SEC decision and fully ready for the situation. Though, poll date is in the middle of the holiday season, we will tap into our party wings catering to people from different regions to motivate them to vote rather than move to their home state during the holidays,” said BJP state president Arun Sood.Subhash Chawla, state Congress president, said: “We will request the residents to opt to vote over outstation travel. The message will be shared across all wards.” Prem Garg, city convener, AAP, said: “We will run a campaign, particularly on social media, to encourage people to vote in huge numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-election-influencers-mobile-app-to-pull-voters-to-polling-booths-101637872058905.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Minister Warring demands early announcement of Congress candidates||Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Thursday urged the party high command for an early announcement of candidates for the forthcoming assembly elections to check interference by leaders in the constituencies.At a meeting chaired by the Punjab Congress affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary with the party leaders in Bathinda, Warring said the party workers were enthusiastic after Charanjit Singh Channi was given command of the state government.“It is important that names of the candidates are made public at the earliest. There are instances wherein party leaders are seen active in other assembly segments. Timely announcement of candidates will check such undue movements of leaders,” said the minister without naming anyone.In the last few months, Warring had accused finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal for increasing political activities in the former’s constituency Gidderbaha.Warring, who had unsuccessfully contested the last Lok Sabha from Bathinda, told the central leader that in the last four-and-a-half years of the Congress government, party workers were grossly neglected by the party leadership and the ministers.Responding to Warring and supporters of other party leaders, Chaudhary said candidates would be announced as per the wish expressed by party activists of the respective constituency.“Congress workers should unite and fight to ensure the part’s victory in the elections. The Shiromani Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are wrongly questioning the Channi government’s decisions that were taken to benefit the common man in Punjab,” he said.Finance minister Manpreet Badal, Rampura Phul MLA and former minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar were among those who spoke on the occasion.Later, Chaudhary took feedback from leaders and workers of all five assembly segments of Bathinda district separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-minister-warring-demands-early-announcement-of-congress-candidates-101637872057754.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Solid waste management: Four housing societies put on notice in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) on Thursday served notices to four cooperative housing societies in Sectors 48-50 for non-compliance of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016,.The societies put on notice under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, are BSNL Society and Progressive Society in Sector 50, Pushpak Society in Sector 49 and Kendriya Vihar Society in Sector 48.During the Swachh Sarvekshan 2022 review meeting on Wednesday, UT adviser Dharam Pal had directed the CPCC member secretary to issue notices to bulk waste generating societies that are flouting rules and put display boards stating “Non-compliance Society” outside their premises to name and shame them.In the recently released report of Swachh Survekshan 2021, Chandigarh’s rank dropped from 8 to 16 among 48 cities with population above 10 lakh, and its overall score also dipped from 83% to 71%, mainly due to poor performance in garbage collection and sanitation.‘Comply within 7 days’According to the notice served by CPCC member secretary Debendra Dalai, it has been observed that duties of waste generators specified in Rule 4 of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, are not being complied properly resulting in the improper disposal of municipal solid waste by their societies.All four societies have been directed to comply with the rules and intimate action taken in this regard to the CPCC with a copy to the municipal corporation, Chandigarh, within seven days. In case of failure to comply with the rules, action will be initiated under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and other provisions of law, the notice stated. Non-compliance can invite a fine of ₹1 lakh and/or imprisonment up to five years. What the rules sayAccording to the rules, all gated communities and institutions with more than 5,000 square meter area shall, within one year from the date of notification of the Solid Waste Management Rules and in partnership with the local body, ensure segregation of waste (wet, dry, domestic hazardous and sanitary waste) at source by the generators. The societies are tasked with facilitating collection of this segregated waste in separate streams, and hand over recyclable material to either the authorised waste pickers or authorised recyclers. The biodegradable waste (wet waste) shall be processed, treated and disposed of through composting or bio-methanation within the premises as far as possible, the rules state, adding that the residual waste (dry, domestic hazardous and sanitary waste) shall be given to waste collectors or agency as directed by the local body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/solid-waste-management-four-housing-societies-put-on-notice-in-chandigarh-101637872055829.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: Probe ordered into axing of trees on shamlat land in Lalru||Additional deputy commissioner, Mohali, Pooja Sayal has ordered an inquiry pertaining to cutting of trees spread over 100 acres of shamlat land under the Lalru nagar council in the district’s Dera Bassi subdivision.In a letter written to the Lalru MC executive officer, the ADC has sought a report from the officers concerned, questioning as to with whose permission the trees are being cut. The report is to be submitted by Friday, failing which action will be taken as per law. Earlier, Dera Bassi MLA NK Sharma, who visited the area, alleged the nagar council in order to benefit some private persons had sold these trees worth several lakhs for just ₹2.25 lakh. He said during the visit to the spot, he saw that many large trees with a diameter of about two-and-a-half feet were being axed and 40-50 people had been engaged in the work for the past one week. “This whole business us going on without the approval of the forest department. As per rules, a written assessment was to be done by the forest department before giving permission for cutting the trees from the shamlat land, after which advertisement for auctioning of trees was to be issued,” said the MLA.Alleging the connivance of Congress leaders, Sharma said he would lodge a complaint with the Mohali deputy commissioner, senior superintendent of police and forest department and push for a vigilance probe. Bindu Rana, president, municipal council, said the shamlat land has been cleared of kikar trees and reeds (sarkanda) so that it could be allotted to 267 homeless persons. She said steps have been initiated as per rules. Jai Singh, block officer of the forest department, Dera Bassi, said the matter of seeking clearance for the said trees was not in his notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-probe-ordered-into-axing-of-trees-on-shamlat-land-in-lalru-101637872054748.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Untreated sewage from Chandigarh still entering N-Choe||Despite directions of the subcommittee formed on the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directions, untreated sewage from Chandigarh is still being discharged into the N-choe at various points in the UT as well as Mohali.N-Choe is a seasonal stream that originates in the north of Chandigarh and runs across the city before meeting the Jagatpura drain at Manauli village in Mohali. The water finally drains into the Ghaggar river.The subcommittee was formed in June this year and comprises officials from the Central Pollution Control Board, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee.A committee member, who did not wish to be named, said that there are still several points in both Mohali and Chandigarh where untreated sewage is being discharged from Chandigarh into the natural water bodies. “Even farmers use the same water for agricultural purposes downstream along the Ghaggar,” said the member.‘Sewage not treated properly’The official said that even at the sewage treatment plant (STP ) at Diggian village in Chandigarh is not treating the wastewater properly and it is released in the choe as such. Even, untreated sewage from Faidan village in Chandigarh is being discharged into the Jagatpura drain in Mohali, he said.Untreated sewage refers to wastewater that contains harmful waterborne pathogens and bacteria and which has not yet gone through a sewage treatment plant. It poses a high risk to human and animal health.It was on May 6 this year when lawyer and activist Sunaina filed a petition before the NGT, stating that contaminated water from Chandigarh enters drains in Mohali and eventually the Ghaggar river, and is used by nearby farmers for cultivation, thus polluting the entire food chain and jeopardising the health of people and aquatic life.The plea wanted the Chandigarh administration and Punjab to install necessary sewage treatment plants, following which, the NGT bench presided over by its chairperson and former Supreme Court judge AK Goel directed Chandigarh to ensure that sewage from the city flowing into the Ghaggar is treated and sought a report.It also directed the Punjab chief secretary and UT adviser, in coordination with other officials concerned, to take appropriate remedial measures and ensure zero discharge of untreated water. In 2019, too, directions were issued to ensure the release of 100% treated water into rivers and drains by March 31, 2020. However, the NGT observed that there was hardly any significant improvement. ‘We have closed inlets in all major areas’Anindita Mitra, commissioner, Chandigarh MC, said: “We have closed the inlets of sewage in all major areas. We have also served notices on individual house owners in villages from where sewage was being discharged into stormwater drains, so that they change their internal sewage systems.” Mitra said that In Faidan colony, where laying new sewerage network is not possible, phytoremediation has been suggested as a solution to the administration. “The UT engineering department will also install screen at choes to stop dumping of garbage into these water bodies,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/untreated-sewage-from-chandigarh-still-entering-nchoe-101637871997660.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: GMADA project to develop Sector 90 in limbo||The acquisition of around 43 acres of land under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), 1900, has delayed the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority’s (GMADA) project to develop Sector 90, situated near Lakhnaur village in Mohali. In 2015, GMADA had acquired 229 acres under a land pooling scheme to develop the sector. Around 700 allottees, who have got letters of intent (LoI), are still awaiting possession.The matter came to light when GMADA sought a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the forest department to develop the sector, but the forest department raised the objection that around 43 acres of land is under PLPA and NOC cannot be issued.The Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, referred to as the PLPA was enacted by the then government of Punjab in 1900. The Act provides for the conservation of subsoil water and/or prevention of erosion in areas found to be subject to erosion or likely to become liable to erosion.A senior GMADA official, who is dealing with the project, said, “When the land was acquired, we were not aware of PLPA land and even the revenue department does not have anything on record. Now they have raised the objection and we have applied for deforestation of the land and hopefully, it will be done soon. Our layout plan is ready.”Gurjot Singh, a resident of Lakhnaur and one of the allottees, said, “It is unfortunate that the officers concerned are not aware of the PLPA land and now even after six years, 700 allottees are waiting for possession while the nearby sectors are all developed.” Under land pooling, farmers were offered housing and commercial sites in lieu of their land, he said. As per the plan, GMADA was to initially develop 144 acres. Residential plots measuring 100 to 500 square yards will come up over 29 acres, commercial sites will come up over 14 acres and 11 acres will be earmarked for institutions. Parks will be developed over eight acres, waterworks will take up two acres and roads will be constructed over 28 acres. GMADA chief engineer Devinder Singh said: “Once we get the layout plan, we will start the process of development. Sector 90 is a prime location for residential end-users, commercial real estate markets and investors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohaligmada-project-to-develop-sector-90-in-limbo-101637871996265.html

He identified the co-driver as Bharat Kumar of Kurukshetra. A hunt has been launched for the truck driver, who fled from the spot. “The SHO of Jhajjar Kotli police station Davinder Singh got an input about the attempt to smuggle a big consignment of heroin. He set up a checkpost and started checking vehicles coming from Srinagar to Jammu,” said the ADGP. The truck with Haryana registration jumped the checkpost but it was chased and intercepted at some distance, said the officer. “While the truck driver fled from the spot, he has been identified and will be arrested soon. Co-driver has been arrested. During the checking of the truck, police recovered 52 kgs of heroin which costs about ₹100 crore in the international market,” said Singh. Initial investigation revealed that the contraband was being smuggled to Punjab from Kashmir. It was picked up from Srinagar. “The packets had a marking of 1999, which was also found on some contraband being smuggled from Pakistan,” he said. He also informed that Jammu police in the past two years seized 185 kg of heroin having a market value approximately ₹360 crore. “During this period 1,500 were arrested, of which six were booked under Public Safety Act (PSA). We also seized 500 kg charas, 2500 poppy straw and 180 kg heroin besides other psychotropic drugs in the past two years,” said the ADGP. He also said that police recovered ₹2.50 crore of drug money during the period. “The money—part of Pakistan’s narco-terrorism, had to be used in funding and fuelling terrorism in J&K,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/52-kg-heroin-seized-from-truck-near-jammu-co-driver-arrested-101637871995025.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Jailed scribe used friend’s mobile phone to make threat call||Former journalist Sanjiv Majahan, who is in jail in connection with a property grab case, had used the mobile phone of a Sector 37 resident for making a threat call to the prime witness in a murder case on November 22. Mahajan, who is currently lodged in the Burail jail, was taken to court for a hearing when he had made the call, said police. The very next day, police had booked him for threatening the man, who is the main witness in the murder of a Jind resident at the parking lot of the old district court in Sector 17 in September 2019. The same day, police also gave an undertaking in the high court to file a status report by December 13 on the complaint regarding the threat call. The police had traced the mobile phone used by Mahajan to Nitish, a resident of Sector 37. His statement has been recorded before the magistrate. Sources said that Nitish claimed that he is known to Mahajan and had gone to court to meet him on November 22. Mahajan reportedly asked him for his mobile phone to make a call, and Nitish gave it to him in “good faith”. Nitish reportedly told the magistrate that he was not aware to whom the call was made or what conversation took place. Cops to face action too: SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh, has sought a report from the deputy superintendent of police (DSP), police lines, about cops deployed on duty to escort prisoners from the Burail jail to court. “We will be taking action against the police personnel who were accompanying the accused and allowed him to use the mobile phone,” he said. Police have already moved an application in the district courts for Mahajan’s production warrants, which will be taken up on Friday. Police intend to question Mahajan in the murder case and procure his voice samples to match with the call recordings. Complainant records statementThe police have also got the statement of the complainant, Rohit, a resident of Sunny Enclave, recorded before the magistrate. Sources said he claimed that he had got a call from a person identifying himself as Sanjiv Mahajan, who told him to withdraw from the murder case. Rohit is the prime witness and complainant in murder of Jind resident Tejinder Singh. Four men had shot him dead while injuring his friend in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhjailed-scribe-used-friend-s-mobile-phone-to-make-threat-call-101637871993956.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Ward 18 woes: Waste, water & wastewater||Garbage dumped in the open, low water pressure and choked sewers are among the key issues being faced by residents in Ward No. 18 of the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC).The ward comprises Sectors 20 and 30. Before fresh delimitation, Sector 20 was a part of Ward No. 16, while Sector 30 came under Ward No. 18.The residents rue that the present councillors are unapproachable and least interested in carrying out development projects in the area.“Though Sector 20 is located in the middle of the City Beautiful, the area is dotted with garbage dumps and overflowing sewage. While domestic waste is being lifted from door to door, garbage thrown on the lanes, in markets or in parks is not being cleared,” says OP Verma, president, resident welfare association (RWA), Sector 20. He also alleges that though the MC in its reply to an RTI query claimed that 57 sweepers have been assigned to maintain sanitation in the sector, in reality, only 25-30 sweepers can be seen on duty. “Garbage is mostly dumped on the back lane of Laxmi Narayan temple, outside Government Model Senior Secondary School and near the Sector 20C market,” he says.Residents in Sector 20 also demand clean drinking water, and say the water pressure from tubewells is low, due to which those living on upper floors face hassles. They also claim that children and the elderly can’t walk in the parks or on lanes due to stray dog menace and poor lighting. Sector 30 faces similar issues. “In both residential and market areas, sewerage lines are choked, resulting in foul smell and breeding of mosquitoes. Besides, the garbage is not being picked regularly from vacant plots and roadsides,” says Harpreet Singh, chairman, RWA, Sector 30B, while questioning the high MC taxes even though “the common man is not being provided basic amenities”.Lack of parking spaces irks the locals in both these sectors, just as in other urban pockets of the city. Residents say the MC has allotted the open spaces, meant for parking, to street vendors. “During the evening hours, people do not even get space to park their two-wheelers in the market, as most of the space is occupied by the vendors. The MC should allot other places to vendors, so that people coming to the markets do not get harassed,” says Simran Kaur, 40, a resident of Sector 20.KNOW YOUR WARDLocalities: Sector 20 and Sector 30Reserved for women (general)Voters: 30,000Key IssuesGarbage not being lifted regularly from roadside, markets and parksChoked sewers and water supply at low pressureLack of parking spaces as most areas allotted to vendorsLOCAL VOICESThe MC must ensure that garbage gets cleared from the roads as it doesn’t look like the sector is a part of the City Beautiful.Harsharan Singh, 46, a resident of Sector 20In the evening, there is no space to park even two-wheelers in the market as most of the area has been occupied by vendors.

Talking to mediapersons after addressing public meetings in support of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate Sushil Kumar “Pinky” Sharma, Sukhbir president claimed that Channi had approached him during the SAD-BJP government’s tenure to extricate his “tainted” brother’s name from the Ludhiana city scam case and for this he extended support to their party in the assembly elections. Two days ago, former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had also accused Channi of capitulating before the Badals to save his brother. Amarinder had made the remarks while hitting back at Channi over his frequent accusations that that he (Capt) had “connived with the Badals” and harmed Punjab’s interests.“It is a classic case of pot calling the kettle black”, Amarinder had remarked, adding, “It is not me, but Mr Channi, who had pledged his support and conscience to Badals to save his brother”. “Although I did not want to join issue with him (Channi), his frequent false accusations have forced me to reveal his capitulations before Sukhbir Singh Badal in 2007 to save his brother who was an accused along with me in the Ludhiana City Centre case,” Captain had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-had-approached-me-to-bail-out-his-tainted-brother-sukhbir-badal-101637871872633.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||All terrorists involved in civilian killings eliminated: Jammu and Kashmir DGP||Director general of police Dilbag Singh on Thursday said that following targeted killings of civilians in Srinagar, security forces eliminated more than 20 terrorists and the summer capital—Srinagar has been rid of active terrorists for now, except one, who was being searched. He also said that counter-insurgency operation by the Rashtriya Rifles in the forests of Bhatta Dhurian in Poonch was still on and the terrorists hiding in the woods would be accounted for by the RR soldiers. Addressing mediapersons here this evening, the DGP said that following civilian killings, security forces and police conducted dozens of successful operations and eliminated over 20 terrorists in Srinagar. “We have eliminated over 20 terrorists in Srinagar so far following the civilian killings killed. Every terrorist involved in civilian killings has been eliminated. Only one terrorist Basit of Kulgam is left and he is being searched,” said Singh. He informed that security forces were trying their best to improve the security environment. “As such no active terrorist is left in Srinagar but we always have a hybrid kind of terrorist available, who looks like a normal civilian but he is involved with terrorists as their associate and picks up weapon for committing some offence as and when a task is given to him. We are always on the lookout for such elements. We have been able to identify many of them and have already taken action in a big way,” he responded to a query. On anti-terror operations in Bhatta Dhurian, he said, “The operation has progressed for quite some time now. It is still on.” “Earlier also we had similar incidents like Sunderbani and Nowshera where operations continued for some time after the infiltration. We suspect that there (Bhata Dhurian) is some presence of terrorists after infiltration in that area and I am sure RR would be able to account for them,” he said. When asked to react over former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, who has been casting aspersions on the security forces vis-à-vis on Rambagh encounter and has raised questions over Hyderpora encounter as well, the DGP said, “Anybody talking nonsense is absolutely not justified”. “There are people in the civil society who somehow understand the reality but try to say something, which is far from the reality. There are many people active on social media as well casting aspersions on the forces vis-à-vis killing of terrorists,” he said. On Rambagh encounter, he said one of them was the commander of the TRF and two were his associates. “The TRF commander was is responsible for the killing of sub inspector Arshad, grenade attack on June 26, at Barbarshah in which one civilian Mehran Ali was killed and three others were injured. He was also responsible for the killings of principal Supinder Koul and teacher Deepak Chand Mehra. So he suddenly becomes innocent after so many civilian killings. I think it is high time people look at the reality without mixing it up with their imagination. It was an encounter which brought relief to the people who lost their dear ones,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-terrorists-involved-in-civilian-killings-eliminated-jammu-and-kashmir-dgp-101637871753160.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||2 weeks after paddy procurement in Punjab got over, Centre yet to release cost sheet||It has been more than 2 weeks since paddy procurement in Punjab got over and the mandis were shut on November 10, the Union ministry of food and public distribution has still not released the provisional cost sheet that details the amount of money it owes to the state government. Besides the minimum support price (MSP), cost sheet provides the rate of related incidentals such as rural development fund, mandi fee, arhtiyas fee and labour and transport charges. It also mentions the specifications on the quality of rice that the Centre gets from the state after shelling of paddy. State food and civil supplies department officials said the cost sheet has not been released even as they were assured by the Centre that it will be done on time. Over the years, the state used to receive the cost sheet at the onset of the procurement season but the Centre for the last years released it after the rabi and kharif seasons got over. This year, the state procurement agencies – Punsup, Pungrain, State Warehousing Corporation and Markfed – and the Centre’s Food Corporation of India (FCI) jointly procured 188 lakh tonne paddy and made a payment of ₹30,100 crore to farmers. A state food and civil supplies department official said, “We have not made payments to the transporters and labourers yet as there is no clarity on the rates by the Centre other than the MSP of ₹1,960 (for A-grade quality) for paddy.” “There was a time when payments to the arhtiyas were made simultaneously.

However, he was quick to dispel those rumours.Raja Bhaiya tweeted a picture of him with Mulayam and wrote in Hindi: “Met respected Mulayam Singh ji after a long time, got his blessings...emotional moments”. The meeting – amidst SP chief Akhilesh Yadav trying to form alliances with several small parties one after the other – triggered speculations that he might ally with SP for the 2022 UP Assembly polls.Speaking to newspersons after the interaction with the SP chief patron, Raja Bhaiya dismissed the speculations saying that “nothing should be construed out of the meeting. I had been calling on Netaji (Mulayam) for years on his birthday to greet him and to seek his blessings. But this time (on Mulayam’s birthday, on November 22) I could not meet him because I was away. So, I met him today”.On November 22, Raja Bhaiya had greeted Mulayam on Twitter.The six-time MLA (all successive terms and as an independent) from Kunda (Pratapgarh) since 1993, Raja Bhaiya is a known party-hopper and had been a minister in the previous Akhilesh Yadav (SP) government, Mayawati (BSP) government, BJP governments under Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash Gupta, and Rajnath Singh.He had resigned as minister from the Akhilesh Yadav government when he was accused in the murder of a police officer, Zia-ul-Haq. Later, a CBI court gave him a clean chit in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/raja-bhaiya-meets-msy-quashes-alliance-talk-101637871333410.html

The protestors also blocked traffic on the Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road outside the mini-secretariat for an hour. The protest was lifted after the police pacified the protesters. The protesters also issued a two-day ultimatum to the cops, and threatened to intensify the stir, if the miscreants were not arrested in the stipulated period. The Hindu organisations have also formed a Gau Hatya Sangharsh Committee to pursue the matter.Shiv Sena Punjab chairman Rajiv Tandon said that the accused had deliberately thrown the carcasses in a garbage dump behind the Jeevan Nagar police post to hurt religious sentiments of the Hindu community and disturb law and order in the state.“Such incidents were also reported in 1980 and 1986 when some people tried to instigate riots by throwing body parts of bovines outside religious place,” he added.The Hindu organisations also asked the police to check meat shops in the city. Punjab Gau Sewa Commission chairman Sachin Sharma alleged that it was the handiwork of a gang involved in smuggling of beef. “Such people wanted to disturb the law and order situation in Punjab,” he said. Commuters irkedHowever, commuters were at the receiving end of the stir, with traffic jams reported on Pakhowal road, Link Road, Mall road, Jagraon Bridge, Ghumar Mandi and surrounding areas.Manoj Gupta, a resident of Rajguru Nagar, said he was on his way to the railway station to receive is parents when he got stuck in traffic due to the protest. “Though, I am hurt by the incident as cows are sacred, but blocking the roads and inconveniencing the public is not justified.” Model Gram resident Gurmeet Singh said, “Traffic on Ferozepur Road already moves at snails’ pace, and in such conditions blocking the road should be a crime. Nowadays, it has become common to block roads in the city.A case has been registered under sections of the IPC and Cow Slaughter Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/killing-of-bovines-hindu-bodies-block-traffic-in-ludhiana-seeking-culprit-s-arrest-101637871153188.html

After the start of the scheme, LESA prepared a list of defaulters at the division level in the capital.According to a senior LESA official more than four lakh defaulters were on the list, but many of them were not traceable. Most of them are from areas like the Residency, Aminabad, Hussainganj, Aishbagh, Talkatora, Alambagh, Chowk, Chaupatia and Thakurganj.Insiders say most of these consumers are those who have applied for permanent disconnection, most of them have either died or left the houses and other people are living in them. Engineers of LESA say that it is almost impossible for them to find these customers, who have either sold their houses and shifted somewhere else, or died.Chief engineer LESA and MD Madhyanchal, Suryapal Gangwar, has already directed engineers of all the divisions to find the missing consumers and come out with final reports with the reasons why these consumers were not searched for earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lesa-searches-for-1-36-lakh-missing-consumers-101637870792803.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu’s threat to own govt: Will fast over drugs, sacrilege cases||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Thursday threatened to go on an indefinite fast if his party’s state government does not make public the SIT report on the drug menace.Sidhu also once again questioned the state government over the steps taken for ensuring justice in desecration cases.Addressing a gathering a rally at a grain market in Baghapurana town, Sidhu said that lakhs of mothers had lost their sons to drugs and people were telling him to get justice for such families. “I am telling you, if the Punjab government does not make this (STF) report public, then Sidhu will proceed on fast unto death,” the Punjab Congress chief said, taking on his own government.Sidhu said there was no court order which barred making the report public. “Why is the report not being opened? We need to know why the previous chief minister (Capt Amarinder Singh) slept over it. Who is stopping you from making the report public,” he said before pointing out his lack of administrative powers and limitations as the party president. Channi was also present at the rally, but left the venue minutes before the state chief’s address.Sidhu has been raising the pitch on the drug issue through his tweets and at party forums, repeatedly questioning the delay in action against “big fish” involved in drug trafficking. Sidhu and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi are, however, not on the same page on making the STF report public. Contrary to Channi’s stand that the report is a court document, Sidhu says there is nothing stopping the government from making the report public. With his warning, he has once again upped the ante on the drug issue which is slated to come up before the high court on December 6.Sidhu also questioned the state government over the steps taken to deliver justice in desecration cases. “I am again demanding justice. One government has gone and the other one has been formed. One chief minister has gone and another one has taken over the office. And I am saying if justice of sacrilege is not given, I will sacrifice my body. Mark my words. Those who did (sacrilege) are roaming freely. What kind of government it is, if culprits are not brought to justice and it cannot take a step forward to bring justice?” he asked.Addressing the gathering, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi announced setting up of a nursing college in Baghapurana along with constructing a stadium on the name of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. He also announced upgrade of two existing hospitals in Baghapurana along with grants for Guru Nanak College and Sports Academy. The CM also announced to accord a sub-tehsil status to Smadh Bhai.‘Will fill state’s empty coffers’After the CM left the venue, Sidhu said: “Four years ago, such promises were made by the then CM (Capt Amarinder Singh). But these are yet to be fulfilled because the state government has no money. I will bring ₹2,000 crore to state exchequer from sand mining and ₹20,000 crore from excise on liquor. I will not form a government by lying. I will form a government after bringing ₹30,000-35,000 crore into the state exchequer”.Only Channi model can ensure holistic growth: CMRejecting any sort of Delhi model, CM Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday said the state is witnessing Channi model, which stands for equal opportunities for all.Addressing the gathering during unveiling of the statue of Maharaja Agrasen at old grain market in Moga, the CM said this model is in unison with the teachings of the great Sikh Gurus, who have shown the way of equality and brotherhood.He said this model is being implemented for the progress of the state and prosperity of its people, adding that this model will be there till he is in this office. The model aims at the well-being being of people and holistic growth of the state, he added.The CM said this model does not allow any one person or family to plunder the resources of state. However, he said that Channi model is based on giving equal access to all for resources and opportunities in the state. He asked people to support this model, so that the pristine glory of the state can be restored again.Training his guns against AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Channi said his (Kejriwal’s) Delhi model was nothing more than a ‘bundle of lies’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-threatens-indefinite-fast-asks-govt-to-make-stf-report-on-drugs-menace-public-101637870672869.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal sees 23% decline in infant mortality rate||Himachal saw a 23% decline in the infant and child mortality rate in 2019-20 as compared to 2015-16, the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) revealed. The improvement was aided by increased institutional deliveries, immunisation and targeted mother and childcare schemes, it was stated. The infant mortality rate, which is the number of deaths per 1,000 births of children under the age of one, stood at 26 in the latest survey, as compared to 34 during National Family Health Survey-4 conducted in 2015-16. The infant mortality rate is generally higher in males during the neonatal period (the first month after birth), but in the post-neonatal period, it is higher in females.The survey revealed that the infant mortality rate is higher for scheduled castes (29) as compared to those not from scheduled castes (25). The infant mortality rate for other backward classes stood at 22 while that for scheduled tribes was 21. The survey found a significant connection between education and infant mortality risk, with the infant mortality rate being much higher for children whose mothers have less than 10 years of schooling (40 per 1,000 live births) than others (22 per 1,000 live births).Institutional deliveries on the riseThe survey revealed 88% of births take place in a health facility, mostly government-run, with home births accounting for only about 11%.“Institutional deliveries increased by 12% in the last four years. Institutional births are more common among women with 12 or more years of schooling, women who are having their first birth, and urban women,” it stated. At least 21% of births in the last five years were through caesarean section, with 36% of those being emergency procedures.The survey also revealed a majority of deliveries were supervised by skilled professionals. “Eighty-seven percent of births during the last five years took place with assistance from a skilled provider, and another 7% were delivered by a traditional birth attendant,” it stated.Further findings included a 91% rate of home births undertaking standard procedure.Vaccination numbers see a jumpThe hill-state also recorded a substantial increase of 17% in the vaccination of children since the last survey, as per latest findings. Nearly 9 in 10 children (89%) aged 12-23 months received all vaccinations against six major diseases, including tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio and measles. Additionally, 98% of children are at least partially vaccinated; only 2% have not received any vaccinations at all.Between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5, there was an increase in vaccination coverage for three doses of all basic vaccines: DPT (from 85% to 96%), measles (from 88% to 96%), BCG (from 95% to 98%) and polio vaccine (from 82% to 90%).“Overall, there was an encouraging change in the coverage of all basic vaccinations (from 70% to 89%). In addition, almost all (96%) children have received all three recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine,” the survey found.Coverage for all basic vaccinations is higher in boys than girls (93% versus 86%) and for urban than rural areas (94% versus 89 %). The numbers are lowest among children belonging to scheduled tribes (87%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-sees-23-decline-in-infant-mortality-rate-101637870132368.html

Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu welcomed Jagga into the party fold. To AAP’s embarrassment, Jagga during the Punjab assembly session earlier this month had crossed the floor of the House and joined the treasury benches as he called Channi, an “aam aadmi” (common man), fuelling speculation that he may join the Congress. Earlier this month, another AAP MLA from Punjab, Rupinder Kaur Ruby, had joined the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aaps-raikot-mla-joins-congress-101637870072180.html
26-11-2021||Lucknow||Untimely rain, supply shortage, transport cost jack up vegetable prices in Lucknow||Untimely rain in several parts of the country in the last two weeks and increase in demand due to marriage season has resulted in a steep hike in the prices of vegetables. Prices of almost all vegetables, which are brought from outside the state, have nearly doubled this month, say traders. They also attribute the price rise to reduction in supply due to foggy conditions. Besides, farmers have to pay more to transport their produce due to steep fuel prices.“The price of tomatoes has increased from ₹40 to ₹80 per kilogram in the past three weeks. The price of onions has also gone up from ₹30 to ₹40. The rate of carrot has also reached ₹100 from 80, while capsicum is being sold at ₹120 a kg from ₹70 a month ago. Peas are being sold currently at ₹120 per kg,” said a vegetable trader in the state capital.Like tubers, prices of gourds have also soared. For instance, the price of bottle gourd has increased from ₹30 to ₹50 per kg while the price of bitter gourd has witnessed a hike of around ₹60 and is being sold at ₹100 a kg. The price of pumpkin has also gone up in the past two weeks to ₹40 a kg.“The demand for vegetables has gone up because there is a reduction in the supply caused by fog and untimely rain in many parts, last week,” said Surendra Kumar, a local agricultural economist. “The prices of several vegetables are likely to keep soaring for the next two weeks,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/untimely-rain-supply-shortage-transport-cost-jack-up-vegetable-prices-in-lucknow-101637870012164.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||NGT panel pulls up Ludhiana MC over lack of waste segregation||The municipal corporation, which is already facing brickbats after the industrial town slid in swachhta rankings, has now been pulled up by the monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for failing to carry out waste segregation in the city. The committee members also slammed the civic body for failing to kick off the project to dispose of around 20-lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste at the main dump site on Tajpur Road. The committee led by its chairperson, retired justice Jasbir Singh, carried out inspections in the city on Thursday to verify the municipal corporation’s claims pertaining to solid waste management under its environmental action plan. Environmentalists such as Balbir Seechewal, and Babu Ram were also part of the committee that carried out inspections. The committee members inspected four static compactors and secondary dumps in Block J of Sarabha Nagar, the Jawahar Nagar camp near Chatter Singh park in Model Town and Rishi Nagar. The team noted that waste segregation was not seen in any of the 40 secondary dump sites in the city.Justice Singh (retd) said, “There is some improvement, but waste segregation is not taking place. Authorities have been directed to focus on segregation, otherwise NGT will take action against them and penalties can also be imposed in the coming time.” He also appealed residents to cooperate with the MC by handing over segregated wet and dry waste to the garbage collectors.Seechewal said,” The MC has been claiming that waste segregation is going on in majority areas of the city, but nothing is being done on ground level. The matter will be taken up by the NGT during the next hearing and the tribunal will then take suitable action.” Green belts get praise However, the monitoring committee did appreciate the municipal corporation for transforming the two dump sites into green belts in Kochar market area and Rishi Nagar.  The teams also inspected the ongoing work of establishing a sewer treatment plant (STP) in Jamalpur area to reduce pollution in the Buddha Nullah. A dyeing unit was also inspected to check dumping of untreated waste by the unit owner in the industrial area near Cheema Chowk, but the unit was not operational.Meanwhile, the MC field staff could be seen cleaning some secondary dump sites ahead of the committee’s visit.No processing of waste at dump site With over 20 lakh metric tonnes of waste dumped at the main dump site on Tajpur Road, the committee slammed the MC for not taking steps to dispose of the waste, despite the waste polluting air and water in the area. No processing of waste is being done on the site after A2Z company terminated its contract with the MC on February 4. Over 1,100 metric tonnes of waste is generated in the city on a daily basis and the waste is accumulating on the site.  Residents have been raising hue and cry over frequent fire incidents reported at the dump site due to emission of highly combustible methane gas, which causes air pollution. Fire had also broken out at the site before the visit of the committee and a fire brigade was deployed to douse the flames. MC officials say the process to hire a firm has been initiated. Earlier this year, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had imposed a penalty of ₹1.8 crore on the MC for failing to deal with legacy waste and bank guarantees of ₹21 lakh were also imposed over its failure to take up solid waste management in the city. The committee members said that the penalty can increase if required steps are not taken in the coming time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-panel-pulls-up-ludhiana-mc-over-lack-of-waste-segregation-101637869833380.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal: BJP core group decides to take action against dissenters||After two days of brainstorming, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to take action against its leaders who worked against the party’s official nominees in the recently concluded bypolls to one Parliamentary and three assembly seats in Himachal. The party’s chief spokesperson, Randhir Sharma said, “The core group has expressed concern over the growing indiscipline in the party and such matters will be dealt with firmly. The party will prepare a list of those who worked against the party candidates and they would be issued show-cause notices. The list will further be sent to the party high-command for action.” BJP’s extended core group met on Thursday to deliberate upon the reasons for the poll debacle and draw strategy for the assembly election slated next year. The state executive of the party will meet on Friday, with national president Jagat Parkash Nadda set to address the meeting virtually. “Party leaders also held the Covid-19 induced inflation as one of the reasons for its defeat in the election. Covid has impacted the economy adversely, while inflation also hurt the party’s prospects in the elections,” said Sharma while adding that Congress candidates gained sympathy votes.Lack of coordination between the party and the government was also one of the reasons cited by a few leaders during the meeting. Many were critical of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur-led government’s functioning, sources said. The core group has recommended dropping non-performing chairpersons and vice chairpersons of different boards and corporations. The group discussed the completion of four years of the state government and its achievements during this period. Himachal BJP in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna said, “The election result is an eye-opener for us and we will prepare for 2022 assembly elections with more vigour. We will work on our shortcomings.” Khanna further said, “The BJP has not done anything wrong to hang its head in shame. Our government at the Centre and state launched various public welfare schemes such as Kisan Samman Nidhi, Ayushman Bharat, Him Care and Ujwala Yojana in the public interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bjp-core-group-decides-to-take-action-against-dissenters-101637869772311.html

26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal, Pargat in Twitter war over quality of school education in Punjab||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab education minister Pargat Singh on Thursday took potshots at each other over the quality of school education in the poll-bound state. Kejriwal said the Punjab education minister was claiming that his state had the best schools and teachers were very happy. “Those who are happy with schools and the existing education system in Punjab should vote for the Congress. Those who also want in Punjab the spectacular education system that we have in Delhi should vote for us,” the AAP national convener tweeted on Pargat’s claim of a revolution taking place in education in Punjab. The Punjab education minister immediately hit back with a series of tweets, telling Kejriwal that Punjab being better than Delhi (in education) was not his personal opinion as he (AAP leader) was insinuating but based on an official national survey. “Punjab having almost 1.5 times more teachers than Delhi for the same number of students is not an opinion or a “jumla”. In fact, it is based on an answer to a question asked by the Lok Sabha member from Punjab @BhagwantMann ji on 2nd August this year. I am really grateful to him,” he tweeted before talking about the state’s “fair and transparent” online transfer policy. “The political sagacity of people of Punjab is never in doubt as they can easily make the difference between “asli” and “nakli” as they did in 2017 and 2019,” he wrote in another tweet. The AAP, the principal opposition party in Punjab, replied to Pargat’s comments by tweeting photos of waterlogged schools with the caption, “Vote for Congress to get such Government Schools”. Kejriwal retweeted the post without offering any comment. The war of words between Kejriwal and Pargat was set off by the former’s eight promises to teachers in Punjab during his two-day trip to the poll-bound state, following which Pargat hit back, call it a “cheap gimmick”. Sisodia challenges Pargat Giving an open challenge to Punjab education minister, Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Thursday asked him to compare his state’s 10 government schools with that of Punjab’s. Speaking on the sidelines of a party event organised at the CII, Chandigarh, Sisodia, who also is Delhi education minister, said: “I give an open invitation to the education minister of Punjab to visit Delhi’s 10 government schools and I will visit same number of schools which the Punjab minister considers state’s best.” Stating that elections should be fought on issue of education, Sisodia, said: “If the Punjab education system is best, people will opt for Congress and if it is Delhi’s then the people will elect the AAP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwal-pargat-in-twitter-war-over-quality-of-school-education-in-punjab-101637869594371.html

The residents said that they will vote against the parties that had failed to resolve the issue of erratic water supply, which has been plaguing two streets in the area for the last 15 years, forcing them to bring water in buckets and through pipes from neighbours with submersible pumps.The protesters alleged that the MLA had never visited the area to hear the residents’ grievances. One of the protesting women, Rupinder Kaur said,” Sometimes water is not supplied in the area for two to three days. The councillor and MLA have been elected to resolve the residents’ problems. However, MLA Bains has failed to show up in the last five years.Komal and Navjot Kaur said they will only vote in favour of the candidate who will get the problem resolved. Congress Councillor Reet Kaur’s husband, Rupinder Sheela, had also slammed Bains for not showing up in the area during his tenure and turning a blind eye to the problems being faced by residents. ‘We are making efforts to resolve the problem, but Bains is least bothered,” Sheela had said.Despite attempts were made to reach MLA Bains, he was not available for comments. Meanwhile LIP spokesperson, Gagandeep Singh (Sunny) Kainth said that it is the duty of councillor and MC officials to streamline water supply. But if the councillor has failed to do so then the residents should submit a complaint with MLA Bains and the matter will be resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/erratic-water-supply-in-dugri-village-women-lead-protest-with-boliyan-dholak-101637869593171.html

If a pro-people government is elected over a pro-corporate one, it will work for people, and send a good message to voters for the 2024 polls,” Charuni said.He was in Ambala to address farmers and activists at a ‘Samvidhan Bachao’ rally along with minority community leader Kanta Aladiya.Earlier, Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal had slammed the political ambitions of Charuni and said SKM was not formed for political agendas and morcha leaders are against Charuni’s political statements.In Karnal, he had also announced to oppose Charuni with black flags if he holds any programme in Punjab, thus the feud became public.On being asked about this, Charuni said he won’t contest elections in Punjab but will campaign and help others to do so.He is also willing to field candidates from all 117 constituencies of the state in the assembly elections.“If Rajewal and SKM will show us black flags, they will be opposing local farmers who have invited us. There is no other option than politics to bring change as the lawmakers are working for the corporates,” he said.Considered one of the firebrand leaders of the SKM, Charuni had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Haryana assembly elections from Ladwa constituency.His wife, Balwinder Kaur had also fought from the Kurukshetra seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as an Aam Aadmi Party candidate, but lost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mission-punjab-will-present-model-for-nation-in-2024-charuni-101637869353712.html

In a statement, director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota said that night patrolling has been intensified in compliance with the orders of deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. Randhawa, while chairing a crime review meeting in Amritsar on Tuesday, had directed the police force to increase night patrolling across the state to ensure that law and order is maintained. The deputy CM, on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, had himself made surprise calls to the GOs deputed for night patrolling to ensure that they are on their job, according to an official release. The DGP said that every police district has been divided into sectors and one gazetted officer of DSP or SP rank has been deputed for each sector. “Apart from the routine naka checking or vehicle checking, the deputed GOs have also been directed to keep vigil at vulnerable spots like railway stations, bus stands, religious places, RSS shakhas and other vital spots,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/135-gazetted-officers-deputed-for-night-domination-ops-in-punjab-dgp-101637869112116.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Arrest of HPSC official: Opposition accuses govt of diluting probe, Khattar govt rebuts accusation||Accusing the BJP-JJP government in Haryana of trying to cover up the “job scam” in the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC), Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Thursday said the government is trying to dilute the investigations.Substantiating his point, the former Haryana minister, at a press conference, said, “While the state vigilance bureau (SVB) in its remand application of November 23 before the court said HPSC deputy secretary Anil Nagar was arrested from the HPSC office with ₹1.07 crore bribe money in the presence of a duty magistrate, the chief minister, in a press briefing on the same day, categorically denied this.”Haryana govt’s stanceClarifying the allegations levelled by Surjewala, a Haryana government spokesperson said ₹1.07 crore was originally recovered from the house of accused Ashwani Sharma in Jamalpur village of Jhajjar during a search. The money recovered from Sharma’s house was to be paid to Anil Nagar.“In order to verify this fact, Sharma, who was in police custody, was made to contact Nagar and was asked by Nagar to hand over the money to him in his office. Nagar was arrested by the investigating team while accepting the bribe amount of Rs. 1.07 crore from Sharma,” the spokesperson said.“Therefore, doubts being raised by certain sections regarding recovery in the case have no basis. The investigation is proceeding in a fair and impartial manner strictly as per law with a view to successfully prosecute the offenders,” the spokesperson said.Earlier, Surjewala had said Anil Nagar’s lawyers have already mentioned about non-recovery of any amount. “This means the lawyer and the chief minister are on the same page. This is belying the stated position of the state vigilance bureau,” he said,The Congress leader said in criminal law, the moment you deny the spot of recovery, the recovery itself comes under serious doubt.“By implication, the chief minister is giving a free pass. By negating his own vigilance bureau’s stated position about the recovery of bribe money, the chief minister has weakened the SVB’s case against Nagar,” he maintained.The Congress general secretary also questioned as to why an accused in the case, Jasbir Malik, whose Safedot e-solution did online application work for the HPSC, was not arrested and interrogated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/arrest-of-hpsc-official-opposition-accuses-govt-of-diluting-probe-khattar-govt-rebuts-accusation-101637869052215.html

As hospitals were equipped with ventilators under the PMCare initiative, it was seen that there were not enough professionals in the country to use the ventilators. There were reports across India that the life-saving machines were left disused due to lack of people,” said Dr Singh.The premier medical institute of Punjab has been mandated to train 260 qualified nurses in respiratory therapy within a year. There is no fee and expenses for boarding, lodging and food of candidates will be funded by the centre government.Nurses with degrees or diplomas with two-year experience with Punjab domicile are eligible for the current programme.Director of employment generation and training of Punjab MK Aravind said the centre of excellence that started operating this month will improve career options for the medical professionals.“Candidates selected through written tests will undergo comprehensive training by experts for free for three months. More such specialised programmes will be introduced in a phased manner to cater to the requirement for doctors and paramedic professionals,” he added.Sandeep Singh Kaura, adviser to the state government for skill development and technical education, said AIIMS certified paramedics will be assisted for better employment in hospitals across Punjab.‘Govt considering regulatory authority for education sector’The minister said the Punjab government is considering constitution of a regulatory authority for higher education. He said the standard of education can be improved only if there is a transparent mechanism to audit the quality of education.“During a recent cabinet meeting, I had suggested formulating a regulatory mechanism in the technical education. There is a need to fix accountability when people are spending money in different courses,” he told reporters.The minister was in Bathinda to chair a 6th inter-zonal youth festival-2021 “Maan Watna Da” at Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University (MRSPTU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-aiims-rolls-out-centre-of-excellence-for-medical-professionals-101637868932198.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||HC defers hearing on plea challenging 75% reservation law||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday deferred hearing on a plea challenging the Haryana government’s law providing 75% reservation in private sector industries to domiciles of the state. The high court bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli deferred the hearing for December 10 after the petitioner, the Gurgaon Industrial Association, sought time for making amendments in the parties arrayed as respondents in the case. The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 was notified earlier this month. The law provides for 75% reservation to local youth in private sector jobs that offered monthly salary of less than ₹30,000. It will come into effect from January 15, 2022. It covers private companies, societies, trusts and partnership firms. The law will be applicable for 10 years. The petitioner, the Gurgaon Industrial Association, argues that the law is against provisions of the Constitution and also against the basic principle of meritocracy that acted as the foundation for businesses to grow and remain competitive. It will affect the industry productivity and industrial competitiveness and post recovery of industry due to Covid-19, the plea says, arguing that the government by introducing this policy of “son of the soils” want to create reservation in private sector, which is an infringement of constitutional rights of the employees and citizens of India because private sector jobs are based on the skills and analytical blend of mind of employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-defers-hearing-on-plea-challenging-75-reservation-law-101637868872135.html
26-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana cane-growers stare at huge losses due to poor yield||Even as a ₹12 hike in the sugarcane state advised price (SAP) was announced by the state government taking it to ₹362 (the highest in country), the sugarcane-growers of Haryana stare at a bitter harvest this year as pest attack severely affected the crop yield.As per reports collected from the sugarcane belts of Haryana, the farmers were expecting around 100 to 150 quintal crop loss per acre causing loss of around ₹30,000 to ₹50,000 per acre.“I have harvested one acre so far and the average yield has come down to below 250 quintal per acre from 400 quintal of last year due to pest attack,” said farmer Parveen Kumar, who has 13 acre under sugarcane in Nilokheri, Karnal.Another farmer Roshan Lal, of Yamunanagar, said he was expecting around 30-35% crop loss in sugarcane cultivation from his 26 acres this year.“I have never experienced such a huge loss in the past 20 years. I think this year, most farmers will shift to other crops and shun sugarcane cultivation,” he added.Moreover, farmers said this year, the production cost has increased as they had to spend on pesticides to protect their crop but to no avail.Figures of the Haryana state agriculture department revealed that despite an increase in the area under sugarcane having reached 1.10 lakh hectare from 99,000 hectare of last year, cane production in state is likely to dip to around 84.50 lakh tonne against 85.32 lakh tonne of last year.As per figures, officials expected yield of 768 quintal per hectare from 861 quintal of last year which is the lowest since 2016-17.While crushing operations in all cooperative and private sugarmills in state have already started, officials of the sugarmills said due to poor yield, most mills in state might be facing difficulties to meet set targets.There are reports that private sugarmills are attracting farmers associated with the cooperative sugarmills to meet their required target.On Wednesday, farmers protested at Karnal’s cooperative sugarmill alleging that the mill was running below capacity. The protesting farmers accused the mill authorities of allowing farmers of other districts to sell their produce in Karnal.Vijender Chaudhary, managing director of the Shahbad cooperative sugarmill, said, “There were reports that pest attack has affected the yield this year, but we are hopeful that we will achieve our target of crushing 80 lakh quintal.”Experts said most of the cane crop was affected in Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat and Yamunanagar districts.Dr Mehar Chand, a sugarcane expert and member secretary of the Haryana Kisan Ayog, said, “Severe attack of top borer, especially in largely grown Co-238 variety, is likely to have an adverse impact on the yield causing losses to farmers.”He advised farmers to adopt inter-cropping method to avoid losses and choose crop varieties carefully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-cane-growers-stare-at-huge-losses-due-to-poor-yield-101637868693496.html

Sidhu said the Badals made laws to protect the network’s monopoly whereas Capt Amarinder stalled a law proposed by him which would have ended its monopoly. “Fastway has 3-4 times TV connections than data it is sharing with govt. Badals made laws to protect its monopoly... @capt_amarinder stalled my proposed law which would have ended fastway monopoly, got revenue for state per connection & reduced TV cable prices for people to half,” he alleged in a tweet. The Punjab Congress chief also tweeted that he had proposed a new law in 2017 to recover state taxes from Fastway by taking control over computers and data which would have freed the cable operators from clutches of this monopoly and filled state coffers. “5 yrs ago, I put forward policy to get rid of Multi Systems Operator- Fastway’s monopoly, to recover 1000s of crores taxes, empower local operators & give cheap cable to people… without necessary action against fastway, it is erroneous to suggest solution of Punjab’s cable woes (sic),” he said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-says-capt-stalled-his-proposed-law-to-end-fastway-monopoly-101637868692014.html

26-11-2021||Lucknow||Kovind says new education policy will strengthen regional languages||President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said the new education policy (NEP) would strengthen the regional languages as it recommends their promotion in research and scientific education.Kovind also said this would be in line with Mahatma Gandhi’s vision and the new education policy would play an important role in making the country a knowledge superpower.Kovind was speaking at the centenary celebrations of Harcourt Butler Technological University (HBTU) in Kanpur.Girl students should be encouraged in the field of technical education, he said.“The participation of girls in technical education was not satisfactory. I have been to numerous convocations and have found the girls excelling and their performance impressive. Their participation in this field (technical educations) needs to get better and encouraged, and boost women empowerment in the true spirit,” he said.He asked HBTU to improve its national rankings and break into top 25 institutes of the country by 2047. President Kovind emphasised on the need for innovation and technology development in the country.“Only those countries remain at the forefront that give priority to these two aspects and prepare their citizens for future challenges,” Kovind said. India has moved rapidly in the field of technology development, but a long road is still ahead, he said.“Institutes like HBTU become important in this context. The technical institutions should inculcate the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship in students,” Kovind said.It should be done in a way the students become job givers rather than being job seekers, thus making a contribution to the country, Kovind suggested.He underlined the importance of making Kanpur a garbage-free city and the role that the institutes of higher education, industrial research, people and students can play.“A cue can be taken from Indore city in the field of cleanliness and Kanpur should rank in the top five most clean cities,” he said.The President released a coffee table book, university history book, postal stamp and commemorative coin on the occasion. Kovind also inaugurated 10 buildings.HBTU is one of the oldest engineering institutes of the country and has completed 100 years this year.

The victim was named locally as Ashmeet Singh.The Metropolitan Police said they were called to Raleigh Road in Southall on Wednesday night to reports of a stabbing and attended along with paramedics from London Ambulance Service (LAS).“Despite the efforts of emergency services, he died at the scene a short time later. His next of kin have been informed; formal identification awaits,” the Met Police said.“Homicide detectives from Specialist Crime have been informed. There have been no arrests. Enquiries are ongoing,” they said, appealing for anyone with information related to the murder to come forward.Social media footage shows police officers battling in vain to save the victim’s life in a front garden. According to the ‘Evening Standard’, Singh’s friends fear the British Sikh boy was attacked for a fake Gucci bag he always carried with him.“Police came to check my CCTV and said there had been a stabbing, I couldn’t believe it,” a local shopkeeper was quoted as saying by the newspaper.“I knew him, he was a good guy. His friends are all saying he was stabbed over this Gucci bag, it wasn’t even real. It’s terrible. I wish I had heard something or he had run to me. I would have pulled down the shutters to keep him safe – I had the staff to handle it,” he said.According to locals, Singh did part-time jobs to care for his disabled mother, who lives above a shop close to where her son was killed. His stabbing marks the 28th teenage killing on the streets of London this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/british-sikh-teenager-stabbed-to-death-in-london-robbery-101637867672743.html

The wife Nasima (30) managed to escape with minor injuries.Civil surgeon Dr Vijay Dahiya said excessive suffocation and burns were ascertained as the cause of death. “The bodies were handed over to the family after autopsies were conducted. The wife is undergoing treatment at a civil hospital and is out of danger,” Dr Dahiya said.The family was living in the quarters behind the godown near OP Jindal Park along with six other families from the past five years. At least 18 residents were rescued by the police and fire officials. A cow and a calf also got burnt during the incident, Niyamuddin’s brother Kaimudeen said.He alleged that Naveen had stuffed huge quantities of scrap (more than the godown capacity) and many loose wires were hanging over the godown, about which, he, his brother and other tenants had complained about, fearing the risk of fire due to the presence of inflammable items.“Naveen told us that this is their work. I got to know about the fire at the godown at 2am. Police and fire officials broke walls of the quarters and rescued my brother’s family but four of them died while undergoing treatment,” Kaimudeen said.He alleged that the fire took place due to short circuit and his family members died due to Naveen’s negligence.Sub-inspector Dal Singh, SHO of Yamunanagar city police station, said the owner has been booked under Sections 338, 427, 429 and 304-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and is yet to be arrested.Fire officer Parmod Duggal said six fire tenders managed to douse the fire in three hours.On being asked about fire NOC with the owner, he said, “He had no such certificate and was running a temporary structure.”Mayor Madan Mohan Chauhan said a probe will be initiated, while deputy commissioner Parth Gupta said the public works department (B&R) will conduct a checking of the building, to ascertain that there is no damage to the neighbouring structure if it collapses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-killed-in-fire-yamunanagar-scrap-godown-owner-booked-101637867619316.html

The government has taken over retail trade through the AP State Beverages Corporation and reduced the number of shops from 4,380 to 2,934,” deputy chief minister (excise) K Narayana Swamy said in the reply tabled in the assembly.On Wednesday, the state Legislature passed a Bill amending the AP (Regulation of Trade in IMFL and FL) Act, 1993, making the Beverages Corporation responsible for implementing welfare programmes like Cheyuta, Aasara and Ammavodi to the extent of their application to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes.Incidentally, the state government has escrowed the revenue accrued in the form of Additional Excise Retail Tax to help the State Development Corporation raise loans for those three freebie scheme that have a total annual outlay of ₹16,899 crore.“The state has been brought to such a pathetic stage where welfare programmes are linked to liquor consumption. It is highly disgraceful that the law has been amended entrusting the welfare schemes’ responsibility to the Beverages Corporation,” Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said in a statement.He lashed out at the Jagan regime saying it gave up its promise of liquor prohibition and was now solely banking on liquor sale for implementing the welfare schemes.“How could they link a scheme like Ammavodi, meant to increase enrolment in schools, with liquor sale? Will the dole not be given to mothers unless the fathers buy and consume liquor?” Yanamala wondered.MLC Vitapu Balasubrahmanyam said amendment to the liquor Act would only bring ignominy to the government.“Will you tell the children that they are drawing the Ammavodi dole only because their fathers are drinking (liquor)?” he asked and demanded that the amendment be withdrawn.BJP member P V N Madhav and Progressive Democratic Front members K Narasimha Reddy and I Venkateswara Rao too criticised the state government’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-andhra-liquor-policy-row-jagan-govt-says-revenue-will-be-used-for-people-s-welfare-101637867611873.html

Stalin spoke of how the Indian airline industry was also impacted in the absence of such agreements with these countries. “In addition, due to the lack of agreement of temporary ‘air transport bubbles’ between the countries of Singapore and Malaysia, the travel business is being cornered by other foreign airlines like Qatar Airways, Emirates and Srilankan Airlines and not to our country’s airlines,” he said. “Hence, I request you to make a temporary ‘air transport bubbles’ agreement with Singapore and Malaysia at the earliest for providing temporary airline services and resolving the difficulties faced by the Tamil diaspora in Singapore and Malaysia.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cm-stalin-seeks-civil-aviation-ministry-to-make-air-transport-bubbles-with-singapore-malayasia-for-tamil-diaspora-101637867551828.html

As the situation on the subcontinent deteriorated, the Indian Air Force (IAF) was alerted to the possibility of another armed conflict. On November 22, 1971 an aerial interception battle, called ‘Battle of Boyra’ was fought between IAF and intruding Pakistani Air Force (PAF) jets that had crossed into Indian airspace while giving covers to its ground forces,” said regional public relation officer (defence, Prayagraj) Group Captain Samir Suresh Gangakhedkar. He said a detachment of four Gnats of 22 Squadron had intercepted a PAF aircraft. The PAF pilots ejected over Boyra and were made prisoners of war (POW) by Indian forces. The battle of Boyra took place before the formal start of Indo-Pak war of 1971, he added. Gangakhedkar further said on the evening of December 3, 1971 (at 5.45 pm), the Pakistan launched a pre-emptive air strike at Indian air fields of Amritsar, Srinagar, Awantipur, Pathankot, Uttarlai, Jodhpur, Ambala and Agra. “India was fully geared up to respond and went into action. The IAF continued operations at an unprecedented pace of over 500 sorties per day. As the Indian Army progressed forward in the East Pakistan, the IAF continued with its attack against Pakistani targets as the campaign developed into a series of anti-airfield, anti-radar and close-support attacks by the fighter jets with night attacks against airfields and strategic targets by MIG 21s, Canberras and AN-12s,” he added.“Transport and airlift operations were handled by the three C-47 Dakota Sqns, two Antonov-12, one DHC Caribou, one DHC-3 Otter and one C-119 Packet Sqn augmented from Western, Central and Eastern commands and based at Jorhat, Guwahati, Barrackpore and Dum Dum during December 3 to 16, 1971,” informed the official. Gangakhedkar also spoke about an interesting incident wherein the Governor of East Pakistan had to resign following the action by IAF fighters.“On the morning of December 14, a message was intercepted by the Indian intelligence concerning a high-level meeting in East Pakistan. A decision was then made to mount an attack within 15 minutes of the interception of the message and a strike was launched against Dhaka. Armed with tourist guides map of the city four MIG 21s of 28 Squadron became airborne. Only a few minutes had passed after the meeting had started when the IAF aircraft blasted the governor’s house with 57mm rockets, ripping the massive roof off the main hall and turning the building into a smouldering wreck,” he informed. AH Malik the governor of East Pakistan was so shocked after the incident that he resigned on the spot by writing his resignation on a piece of paper, thereby renouncing all ties with the West Pakistani administration, he recalled. “The December 1971 war also witnessed the gaining of India’s highest award for gallantry to the IAF Flying Officer Nirmaljit Singh Sekhon, flying Gnats with number 18 Sqn from Srinagar, secure hits on one PAF Sabre and damaged another. He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, informed the PRO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/swarnim-vijay-mashaal-arrives-at-cac-in-prayagraj-on-friday-101637867372381.html

The court gave everyone one opportunity to remove the flag masts on their own.”If no one intends to remove them, they will have to be removed as per the Land Conservancy Act and penalties, as provided under it, should be imposed,” Justice Ramachandran said.Let these people show they erected it with proper permissions, the court added.On November 15, the court was alarmed and amazed by the “mind-boggling” figure of 42,337 flag poles existing across the state and had told the Left government to take action under every applicable law against the perpetrators, irrespective of political affiliations.“No more illegal flag poles,” the high court had added.It had on November 1 passed an interim order directing that no illegal flag poles or masts be put up in the state while the issue was being examined by it.“Lawlessness” is how the high court earlier termed the installation of illegal flag masts across the state by political parties, their affiliates and trade unions.The court was hearing a plea by a cooperative society alleging that a particular political party was illegally putting up flags and banners on its land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/penalise-those-erecting-illegal-flag-poles-under-land-conservancy-act-kerala-hc-to-vijayan-govt-101637867011939.html

The bench of justice Lisa Gill ordered that matter be listed before some other bench after obtaining orders from the chief justice. On Wednesday, the bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh had recused from hearing the case, while ordering that “..this petition be listed before another bench tomorrow itself, i.e. November 25, 2021, after obtaining orders in that regard from the honourable chief justice.” Both the judges have not specified reasons for their recusal. The matter will now be taken up by the bench of justice Sureshwar Thakur on Friday. The short date for hearing was allowed by both the benches as additional solicitor general of India, SV Raju, who had appeared for the ED had submitted that the period of 15 days of custody with central agency, expires on November 26, and hence the matter be listed on priority. In its plea, the ED has challenged a Mohali court order, which denied it custody of Khaira and sent him to judicial custody on November 18, a lawyer associated with the case said. Khaira, was arrested by the central agency on November 11. The urgency shown by ED is borne out of the fact that after 15 days of custody, it won’t be able to seek Khaira’s remand, another lawyer added. The Mohali court had sent him to judicial custody, even as ED had sought seven-day remand on November 18. The ED arrested Khaira, a former Punjab MLA, on November 11 under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The central probe agency had raided his premises in March this year and proceedings have been initiated in connection with a 2015 First Information Report (FIR). Nine persons were convicted on October 31, 2017 in the case by a trial court and sentenced to imprisonment, ranging between 3 years and 20 years, for trans-border heroin smuggling. In the same order, the court had summoned Khaira as “additional accused”. In December 2017, the Supreme Court had stayed his summoning order. Khaira had won the assembly election in 2017 from the Bholath assembly seat in Kapurthala district on an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket. He resigned from the primary membership of the Arvind Kejriwal-led party in January 2019, and floated his own outfit, the Punjab Ekta Party.

Speaking at the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Noida international airport in Jewar, Adityanath said the people in western Uttar Pradesh made great efforts to grow the most exquisite sugarcane, while some people tried to vitiate the atmosphere by starting a series of riots in the country. “Now it is the responsibility of you all to decide — whether you want to add sweetness of sugarcane or support those who added bitterness in society,” the UP chief minister said, sounding the poll bugle. The state is set to go to assembly polls early next year. Adityanath first raised the “Ganna Vs Jinnah” narrative in 2018, ahead of the Kairana bypolls. “You all have witnessed the change that was started in 2014. You all saw how even during a global pandemic the government at the state and Centre protected people. We have seen the how Prime Minister has made the country a global power. Airport is an important project for western UP because farmers of this region have always worked to strengthen the country,” said Adityanath in his seven-minute speech before Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the airport project before a gathering of over 100,00 people.“All farmers are to be thanked as they have given up their land for the airport. I express gratitude to all farmers. I pay my respects to all western UP farmers for supporting the development work that the state has started,” the CM said. Criticising the Bharatiya Janata Party in a series of tweets, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said what is being built today (referring to the airport) will be put on sale tomorrow.He also attacked the Prime Minister’s remarks on double-engine growth for UP. “Those whose plane has been grounded by the force of public anger, and those whose flight has been cancelled may claim whatever engine their plane has, but the people have realised that it is nothing but a ‘jumla’”, the SP chief tweeted in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-airport-event-yogi-slams-jinnah-followers-for-spewing-hate-101637866711658.html

In what way did the attacks change the state’s politics? Are we prepared to handle disasters better? How does 26/11 still loom over our lives? We examine these questions and talk to the survivors.Dr Gautam Bhansali, a consultant general physician practising at the Bombay Hospital in Marine Lines, had a dinner planned at the Masala Kraft restaurant in the Taj Hotel to ring in his fourth wedding anniversary on November 27, 2008. He finished his hospital round and called his wife to come down from their residential quarters in the hospital building. As Bhansali walked towards the casualty ward, he saw several patients in a pool of blood with multiple injuries. “The first victim I spoke to had a gunshot injury in the abdomen. He worked in a canteen at the CST railway station,” said the 43-year-old who worked as a clinical associate at the time. Within minutes, dinner plans were scrapped and Bhansali got to work. “I pitched in to start intravenous drips, suture wounds to stop bleeding, move patients from Emergency Room to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and operation theatres,” Bhansali said. The Bombay Hospital has a 145-bed ICU ward, of which 62 beds were vacant on the night of November 26. All operation theatres began humming with activity. “Patients were coming in with severe bleeding and fractures. We first started with giving them intravenous fluids and blood transfusion and simultaneously preparing those who were in need of emergency surgeries. Some of the patients had so much blood loss that their haemoglobin levels had dropped to two points,” Bhansali said. The hospital admitted nearly 114 patients over the course of that long night. At least 46 major and minor surgeries were carried out in those hairy hours as the city came under siege. In the middle of the chaos, doctors began receiving news of an attack on Cama and Albless Hospital, a mother and child facility near CST. Ajmal Kasab and his partner, Ismail Khan, attacked the hospital after leaving behind a carnage at the CST station. Ashok Kamte, the additional commissioner of Mumbai police at the time, died during a gun fight that ensued near the hospital. His body was eventually taken to the Bombay Hospital. Kasab was eventually apprehended at Girgaum Chowpatty after the duo tried to escape — he was the lone terrorist caught. With little information coming in, rumours began spreading. “Many of us got calls that the terrorists were now targeting hospitals,” Bhansali recalled. Bombay Hospital authorities alerted their security and decided to check all vehicles and patients entering the premises. “We were worried that a terrorist may come in pretending to be a patient.” “It was the scariest experience of my life,” Bhansali said. “The 26/11 terror strike prepared me for the worst disasters,” he said. **************‘Waiting for government to respond to my plea’megha.sood@htlive.com It has been 13 years since the terror attacks in Mumbai orchestrated by Lashkar-e-Taiba left 166 people dead and 238 injured. In what way did the attacks change the state’s politics? Are we prepared to handle disasters better? How does 26/11 still loom over our lives? We examine these questions and talk to the survivors.Devika Rotawan is the youngest survivor of the Mumbai terror attacks of November 26, 2008 and was a key witness to identify Ajmal Kasab, the lone gunmen among 10 who held the city under siege 13 years ago. She was nine at the time. Today, the 22-year-old is preparing for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examination, whilst also nursing her aged father . She’s also fighting to secure a roof over their head.“I still hope that the government will allot me the house, as was promised to me,” said Rotawan while on her way to a doctor, taking her aged father for a routine check-up, who is currently battling a viral fever. Rotawan, who is pursuing a graduation in Sociology from Chetana College, Bandra wants to become a civil servant, was barely nine year old at the time of the attacks. She was at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus station, waiting with her family members to catch a train to Pune, when two terrorists — Kasab and his partner Abu Ismail Khan — opened fire, and began to hurl grenades at passengers inside the terminus. Rotawan said that on the day of the attack, her father and she were waiting on the platform while her brother bought tickets. “That was when all hell broke loose and bullets started flying in the air,” she said. As soon as the two started running, a bullet hit Rotawan’s right thigh. As she fell, she caught sight of Kasab who was firing indiscriminately. Writhing in pain, she soon fell unconscious and woke up several hours later at St George Hospital. Over the following two months, she underwent six operations on her leg, and it would be another six months before she could leave the bed and walk. However, when the Mumbai police Crime Branch officials asked her to testify in court against Kasab, she agreed immediately. Soon after the trial started in April 2009, Rotawan walked into a court room and pointed towards the Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba operative, identifying him as the one who was shot her and others at the station. While she recuperated, many state and Central government officers visited her; many promised that the government would allot the Rotawans a flat from the economically weaker section (EWS) quota, as there was no earning member in the family. Her father could not work because of a condition in his lumbar region. He was not injured during the attacks, but he was an eyewitness too. Last year, during the Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown Rotawan family was on the verge of being evicted from their rented premises at Subhash Nagar in Bandra east. In August 2020, Rotawan approached the Bombay high court and wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. In October last year, the HC directed the state government to consider her plea, but nothing has happened so far. “I can’t forget the day when those terrorists unleashed havoc on Mumbai, but now my struggle is to get a house. I do not know what will come of the court case, but we are waiting for the government to answer my plea,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2611-special-survivors-say-they-are-prepared-for-the-worst-now-101637866352947.html
26-11-2021||Bangalore||Jarkiholi case: HC stays action against Bengaluru police commissioner||The Karnataka high court on Thursday stayed proceedings against Bengaluru police commissioner and two other senior officers for allegedly delaying registration of a first information report (FIR) against former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi in an alleged sexual harassment case. A single judge bench of Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar said the FIR was indeed registered after the victim came forward and gave FIR through her lawyer. “Investigation is completed and the final report is ready. It is not filed because of an interim order issued by the high court … It appears that the complainant is not aware of all these proceedings and in these circumstances investigation against petitioners as ordered by the magistrate, is not proper. Therefore till next date operation of the impugned order stands stayed,” said the bench. Adarsh R Iyer, who filed a private complaint in a lower court, said he approached a police station to file a complaint against the officers on March 17 for the delay but no action was taken. Subsequently, he unsuccessfully took up the matter with deputy police commissioner (central) MN Anuchet on April 1. “The delay from the officers to file an FIR (against the minister) based on the complaint of social activist Dinesh Kallahalli amounts to a case under Section 166A (public servant disobeying direction under the law) of the IPC (Indian Penal Code). I approached the court seeking action against officers under this section as police did not respond to my complaints,” Iyer said. In their petition in the high court, Pant, Anuchet, and B Maruti, the police station in charge, argued that the lower court passed the order without mentioning whether Iyer’s allegations would amount to action against the officers. The plea said an FIR is registered based on the complaint given by the victim. “The impugned order passed by the magistrate is contrary to law, facts and material available on record and as such the magistrate has slipped into an error, resulting in grave miscarriage of justice to the petitioners,” the petition stated. Jarkiholi was forced to resign as a minister in March when Kalahalli lodged a complaint of sexual harassment and exploitation against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party leader. Kalahalli withdrew the complaint within five days. He claimed he was distressed by the allegation that he had lodged the complaint for money. Police did not register an FIR saying the woman, who was allegedly harassed, has to appear before them. They subsequently dropped the investigation. On March 11, then home minister and now chief minister Basavaraj Bommai announced the formation of a Special Investigation Team to probe the case. The woman later filed a complaint through her lawyers, as police insisted that an FIR will be filed only based on her complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/jarkiholi-case-hc-stays-action-against-bengaluru-police-commissioner-101637866291839.html
26-11-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka contractors’ body writes to PM Modi, complains of corruption||The Karnataka State Contractors Association on Thursday shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that they are made to cough up around 25-30% of tender amount to elected representatives and others before starting works, which indicates corruption continues to engulf the southern state.The letter, the association stated, was to highlight the “miserable plight” of working contractors in the state as well as remedial measures to be taken.“The contractors face (an) unhealthy atmosphere and are discouraged to taking up the works of Roads & Buildings. They are facing untoward and ugly situation in getting the tender works in various department like public works department, minor & major irrigation, panchayat raj engineering, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, health department, etc,” stated the letter.In the letter, they allege that the concerned minister “insist and harass’ payment of 5% on amount put to tender before approval while a few elected representatives demand 3% before starting of works.In district and taluks, the association said, there are demands to the extent of 5% on buildings and 10% on road works.The letter comes at a time when the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as well as the administration under his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa, has come under the scanner for alleged corruption in all departments.The allegations come even as the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) continues its raids on officials from various departments during which money and valuables were recovered from mid-level officials including those hidden in drain pipes and other places.The Bommai government also faces allegations of money laundering through Bitcoins and other crypto currencies -- a charge that the chief minister has denied.The contractors association also alleges that the provision of directly allocating funds without tenders has led to a situation where aides of elected representatives in neighbouring states are causing losses to original registered contractors within Karnataka.“The injustice in tender conditions through e-procurement portal in various local contractors by departments is injurious to the registered local contractors,” they said in the letter.“Thus, the local registered contractors of our state have (to) pay to the extent of 25% to 30% (for elected representatives & others) of the tender amount before starting the works. Such being the position how (will) the contractor undertakes good work,” the letter stated.After the allegation surfaced, chief minister Bommai on Thursday said all tenders will be scrutinised despite the fact that the letter by the contractors does not provide any specifics.“When tenders are scrutinised, everything will come out. If there has been any irregularity or other anomalies, it will come out in the investigation. But in the letter, they have not given any evidence or specific case or any number. They have written a general letter. But even then I have asked that an inquiry be conducted. That department’s chief officials have to scrutinise the tenders, especially after our government came. What more transparency than this is required,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-contractors-body-writes-to-pm-modi-complains-of-corruption-101637866111583.html
26-11-2021||Bangalore||Cost of delivery in Karnataka govt hospitals shoots up: NFHS||Data from the National Family Health Survey 5 (2019-20) shows that the average out-of-pocket expenditure per delivery in a public health facility in Karnataka on average has risen only by 2.69% from ₹4,824 to ₹4,924.But a closer look into district-wise data shows that the rise is much more significant in the most backward regions of the southern state where regional imbalance has led to lower expenditure into healthcare infrastructure, adding to costs of delivery.For instance, in the mineral-rich region of Ballari, average out-of-pocket costs for delivery have gone up from ₹4,413 in 2014-15 to ₹12,348 or an increase of nearly 180%.In Haveri, the home district of Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, the average out-of-pocket costs for delivery at a public hospital has risen from ₹2,866 to ₹11,573, and has shown an increase of 303% in just six years. In comparison, Bengaluru has seen its costs plunge from ₹9,333 in 2015-16 to ₹3,633, registering a degrowth in costs by over 150%.The continued focus on Bengaluru, the state’s biggest contributor to the exchequer and home to almost a quarter of its over 70 million population, it has added to the growing regional imbalance that even a special status of the constitution has not been able to fix in the Kalyana-Karnataka region.Public health experts said the trend was “a matter of concern” if people had to spend an average of ₹5,000 (state average but higher in some districts) in public health facilities.“This shows that public facilities that should ideally be giving fully subsidised care, especially for things such as delivery, people are spending around ₹5,000 and there needs to be some further studies on where these expenses are being incurred,” Dr Adithya Pradyumna, faculty member, Azim Premji University told Hindustan Times.The regional imbalance continues to rear its head despite the state taking steady strides in attracting foreign direct investments and large corporations to set up their business in the state.However, this has been mainly in Bengaluru and surrounding regions that have influenced successive governments, irrespective of party or ideology, to fixate on “developing” the city and turning a blind eye to other backward regions.The stray scheme, project or sector-specific parks in some of these backward districts, it appears has done little to change the on-ground realities of such districts.Experts say the cost of healthcare shoots up when their travel quotient is factored. And this is prevalent in backward districts where people are forced to go to the district or taluka headquarters for any treatment due to the shortage of hospitals or staff.“Our coverage needs to improve in terms of the AB_ARK (Ayushman Bharat- Arogya Karnataka) card distribution. Our health minister has taken it upon himself to ensure that AB-ARK cards are distributed across (the state),” D Randeep, Karnataka’s commissioner for health and family welfare told Hindustan Times.He said that the number of cards distributed are around 1.4 crore but there is scope to take this to 4 crore. He said that there needs to be a sustained drive like distribution of ration cards as well as raise awareness.On the rising cost of delivery in public healthcare facilities, he said that the sampling data needs to be looked into for this.“The whole thing of referrals outside (the hospital) that needs to kind of stop. Be it for medicines outside, diagnostics.. Within the system there is adequate access be it in district hospitals and medical colleges. Almost every diagnostic facility is available. Most of the high-end drugs are also available,” he said.While costs are up, the push by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the Centre for health insurance schemes like Ayushman Bharat has had a negative impact, data shows.The key indicator on households with any usual member covered under a health insurance/financing scheme (%) remains stagnant in the state at 28.1 but data from districts show that it is the most backward regions that continue to see a decline in people covered under health insurance.Just 13 districts out of the 30 surveyed in the report, show an increase in healthcare coverage. In Haveri, which falls under the Kittur-Karnataka region (earlier known as Mumbai-Karnataka), the fall in health insurance coverage is down 15.6% from 44.4 in 2015-16 to 28.8 in 2019.The state and city of Benglauru, are known globally as home to India’s silicon, technology and startup revolution, but the growing number of urban poor is hidden in plain sight as migrants from regions that are backward come into the city in the hope to get better education, healthcare and opportunities that are denied to them in their respective villages or towns.The Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns exposed the fault lines of India’s urban centres where the poor had survived much of the time indoors without income largely due to the help of generosity of individuals and organisations rather than the government.A November report by Azim Premji University (AZU) shows that due to rapid and unplanned urbanisation, the need for a better coordinated and governed health care system is crucial at this point.“Our evidence from Bengaluru shows that 30% of even the poorest quintile seek delivery care from private sources. Since there is a 10-fold difference in cost between public and private facilities, this significantly adds to their financial burden,” according to the report.“There seems to have been some focus on Ayushman Bharat and other sorts of insurance schemes but for whatever reason the proportion of households that are covered with insurance seems to have remained stagnant,” Dr Pradyumna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/cost-of-delivery-in-karnataka-govt-hospitals-shoots-up-nfhs-101637865811640.html
26-11-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka official with 800% disproportionate assets found: ACB||​ The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) continued its raids at several government officials across the state on Thursday for the second consecutive day to catch officials having disproportionate assets to their known sources of income. ACB officials said in their assessment, they have recovered properties running into crores and in some cases the disproportionate assets were found to be over 800% from an official’s salary.The agency conducted simultaneous search operations at 68 locations related to 15 government officials, it said in a brief statement. The ACB searched houses, offices, and residences across Mangaluru, Bengaluru, Mandya, Kalburgi and other locations. The agency said 503 ACB officials took part in the raids.Apart from large recovery of property, the raids saw bizarre scenes such as officials using a bucket to drain out ₹13.50 lakh in cash, stuffed inside a water pipe of public works department (PWD) junior engineer Shanta Gouda, during a raid in Kalaburgi district on Wednesday.The ACB statement said following the raid at his Gouda’s house, they found ₹41.52 lakh worth property, which included 2 houses in Kalaburgi, 1 in Bengaluru, three cars, 1 school bus, two-wheelers, 2 tractors, cash, 100 grams gold ornaments, 36-acre agricultural land, and ₹15 lakh worth household materials. The ACB claimed that Gouda has 406.1% disproportionate assets compared to his salary and other earning.According to the ACB, the largest recovery was reported during a raid at home of Vasudev RN, a former project director (planning), Nirmithi Kendra, in Bengaluru Rural district. A total property worth ₹18 crore, which included 5 houses and 8 plots in Bengaluru, 4 houses in Nelamangala, 10.20 acre agricultural land in Nelamangala, 850 grams of gold ornaments, 9.50kg silver ornaments, ₹15 lakh cash and ₹98 lakh worth household materials.“We found that he had 879 % disproportionate assets. It is the highest we found during the raids,” an ACB official said.Besides, the ACB seized assets (moveable and immovable) to the tune of ₹4.9 crore from the premises of Mayanna M, a first division clerk Major Roads and Infrastructure at Bengaluru civic body BBMP. “Even he has used several Benami properties registered to his wife, mother-in-law, and some friends. We have raided four locations related to Mayanna. He is yet to provide explanations for the disproportionate assets. Legal proceedings will be followed,” the officer said.His properties included 4 houses in Bengaluru, 6 plots, 2 acres of agricultural land, 2 two-wheelers, 1 car, ₹59,000 cash, ₹10 lakh Fixed deposit, ₹1.5 lakh in savings accounts, 600 grams gold ornaments, 3 benami immovable properties, ₹12 lakh worth household materials, the ACB statement said.The raids come at the time when the BJP government in the state is still facing heat from the Opposition on the Bitcoin scam. The Congress has been relentless in its attacks on the Basavaraj Bommai government over the alleged laundering of money using the cryptocurrency with the help of a hacker named Srikrishna or Sriki.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-official-with-800-disproportionate-assets-found-acb-101637865752856.html
26-11-2021||Mumbai||26/11: The day terror hit us||Exactly thirteen years ago on the evening of November 26, 2008, a group of 10 Pakistan-trained terrorists landed near a colony of fisherfolk at Cuffe Parade on Mumbai’s southern coast. Armed with automatic machine guns and grenades, they attacked, with military precision, multiple carefully-selected buildings in south Mumbai: A crowded Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station and the nearby Cama and Albless Hospital; two five-star hotel complexes – the Taj Palace at Colaba and the Trident-Oberoi at Nariman Point; Leopold Café, a popular restaurant in Colaba; and Chabad House, a Jewish synagogue, also in Colaba. The siege of Mumbai that started on November 26 ended three days later. By then, the terrorists had killed 166 persons and injured 238. Security personnel led by National Security Guard (NSG) commandos countered the attack and killed eight terrorists while one was killed by Mumbai police. The tenth terrorist, 25-year-old Ajmal Amir Kasab was caught alive after Tukaram Omble, an assistant sub-inspector, charged at him with just a lathi despite being shot five times and held onto to the terrorist’s weapon, allowing his colleagues to capture him. Omble died in the process, but Kasab was captured, tried and sentenced to death by a Mumbai court. The incident shook the nation and the rest of the world. There was widespread anger against the governments in the state and at the Centre for their failure to prevent such an attack as well as their inadequate, scattered response to it. Terror attacks were not new for Mumbai. India’s financial capital was struck by another coordinated terror attack on March 12, 1993, when the city was rocked by 12 serial bomb explosions, killing 257 and injuring 1400. In 2006, the city’s famed local train network was attacked with bombs exploding in seven suburban trains, killing 209 and injuring 700. However, the 2008 attack was different. For the first time in India’s financial capital, terrorists barged into public places and opened fire, killing innocent people. It was unprecedented. With widespread anger among the people who were scared and felt helpless, the political fallout was inevitable. And quick. On November 30, then Union home minister Shivraj Patil resigned, accepting moral responsibility for Central government’s failure to prevent the terror attack due to an intelligence failure and also the failure to effectively counter the terrorists. It was alleged that the delay in National Security Guard (NSG) commandos reaching Mumbai led to more deaths. The next day, state home minister R R Patil, whose department was directly responsible for the city’s and the state’s security and law enforcement – had to resign. The public anger did not die down. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had to step down on December 5. A minister in the then Deshmukh cabinet said, “It was a military-like operation by the terrorists. Intelligence agencies were unable to get much information beforehand. There were intelligence inputs that an attack was likely, but specific details were not forthcoming. But then, one cannot deny the fact that a city that had seen deadly terror attacks since 1993 was just not prepared for this kind of attack.” He added, “Since 1993, trains or train stations as well as five-star hotels were targeted but no system was in place to prevent another terror attack at these places. This was evident during the 26/11 attack. The public’s anger was not surprising at all. It had an everlasting impact on the state; politicians had no option but to give top priority to security.” Expectedly, 26/11 significantly influenced the way the government and the parties in power reacted to terror activity. On December 8, Ashok Chavan, a senior Congress leader, took over as chief minister while Jayant Patil of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) became home minister. At the Centre, Congress leader P Chidambaram took over as Union home minister. On December 30, Chavan appointed a two-member inquiry commission under former Union home secretary Ram Pradhan to probe the lapses in preventing as well as handling the terror attack, and also to recommend steps to be taken to avoid a repeat of 26/11. The Pradhan Committee submitted its report in April 2009. The government adopted most of its recommendations. “Security became a priority and politicians (in power) understood it. Immediately after the incident and later after Ram Pradhan led committee submitted its report, several decisions were taken to restructure the police force. From a force than maintained law and order, it was made a security focused force,” said Chandra Iyengar, a retired Indian Administration Service (IAS) officer who took over as state home secretary in the aftermath of 26/11. “We spent significant funds on upgrading the intelligence infrastructure. It was also decided to install a CCTV network across the city. Even private establishments were told to set up surveillance cameras in their premises. We also started focusing on coastline,” she said. The state government created Force One, its own elite commando unit similar to the NSG. Iyengar said that in the aftermath of the dastardly attack, the government wanted to ensure that “we didn’t become a frightened society.” She said, “We wanted to ensure Mumbai remained Mumbai and hence avoided clamping down on public activities. Instead, we stressed on analysing each and every intelligence input. A statewide anti-terrorism squad was formed to deal with terror threats.” A senior home official in the current administration said security measures have continued to remain a top priority of successive governments, even if parties in power kept changing since 2009. For instance, Devendra Fadnavis who headed the BJP-Shiv Sena government from 2014 to 2019 ensured that the city’s CCTV network project became fully operational during his tenure. The system that has been set up to gather intelligence and analyse any terror threat continues to function. “For us, the terror attack anniversary doesn’t mean much since it is a continuous process. It is an everyday job for the state’s security apparatus,” the official said. Political analyst Hemant Desai said political parties realised that they could not take chances when it came to security. “Security and anti-terror measures are now on the agenda of every prominent political party. Of course, there were controversies. Decisions taken regarding the purchase of bulletproof vests for the city police, setting up CCTV network and even the quality of certain equipment bought for marine police faced scrutiny. However, by and large, the task of constantly updating the security infrastructure is taken seriously by politicians. Will it remain so? Well, that remains to be seen,” he said. Though there were angry reactions, the ruling Congress-NCP combine returned to power in the assembly elections held next year in 2009. Desai said, “Ruling parties managed to deflect the criticism by quickly removing the home ministers and chief ministers to show that those who erred were being held accountable. The steps taken by them to upgrade security infrastructure probably convinced people that efforts were being taken to prevent a repeat of 26/11. Besides, a better performance of the UPA government on the economic front restored some goodwill among the public, and the mood of the electorate was not hostile to the ruling combine.” The city has not witnessed any major terror attack in the 13 years since 26/11. “One might say we are lucky but if we see from the governance angle, it is also outcome of the effort of both Central and state security and intelligence agencies,” added the above-mentioned home official. But can we truly say our government and its agencies have learned the lesson? “Let’s hope so,” remarked Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2611-the-day-terror-hit-us-101637865751628.html
26-11-2021||Noida||Enthusiastic crowd welcomes PM Modi at Noida airport event||Around 200,000 people gathered in Jewar on Thursday to watch Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi lay the foundation stone of the ambitious Noida international airport project. Though the event was scheduled to start at noon, people started trickling into the venue from 8am. All roads leading to the venue in Ranhera village, Jewar, were crowded with people in tractors, buses, cars, all driving to the same destination. Huge billboards welcoming PM Modi to Jewar and congratulating locals on the “bhoomi pujan (ground-breaking ceremony)” of the airport were erected along Yamuna Expressway and other major roads in Jewar. Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh also took out a massive tractor rally at 10am from the Faleda exit on Yamuna Expressway, 10 kilometres away from the venue. “Exactly a year ago, farmers of the country set out to New Delhi to put their demands in front of PM Modi regarding the farm laws. However today, farmers at our rally are celebrating PM Modi’s arrival here and have set out to welcome him. Almost 100,000 people participated in our rally and arrived at the venue,” said Singh.Coming close on the heels of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections scheduled early next year, local BJP workers said that the event holds significance for the state government.“PM Modi’s presence here today means that our vote matters to him. February’s elections are dominating discussions among villagers and with this event being held here, it will play an important role to decide the vote of the people,” Jagdish Singh, a local BJP worker from Faleda village, said.The Noida airport is the 10th airport to be built in the state in the last seven years, will have a capacity of 12 million passengers per annum (in the first phase), and will commence construction of its second phase by 2031-32. The cost of the first phase of development is ₹4,588 crore and the total cost of the project is pegged at ₹29,560 crore, senior officials said. A total of 1,324 hectares have been acquired for the project in the first phase, and two runways will come up in the first phase. According to civil aviation ministry officials, flight operations are expected to commence from the greenfield airport by 2024. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is closely monitoring the airport’s development,” said Rajiv Bansal, secretary, Union ministry of civil aviation. Depending on passenger demand, the airport is expected to be built in four phases, said people aware of the matter. After the second phase (which is expected to cost an estimated ₹5,983 crore), the capacity of the airport is expected to go up to 30 million passengers per annum, officials aware of the matter said.In the third phase (expected to be developed at a cost of ₹8,415 crore), work on which is expected to begin by 2036-2037, the estimated target capacity is 50 million passengers; and after the fourth (expected to be developed at a cost of ₹10,575 crore) and final phase (by 2040), the aviation hub will be able to handle 70 million passengers per annum, the officials said.There will be a maintenance, repair and operation (MRO) facility here built on 40 acres of land at a cost of ₹30,000 crore, by Yamuna International Airport Private Limited, the special purpose vehicle formed to develop and operate this airport. On Thursday afternoon in Ranhera, large life-size cutouts and banners of PM Modi were dotted across the dusty, grassless ground. Masses waiting for PM Modi to arrive would clap to beats, often break into dance and sing along to the tunes. The most repeated lyric in these songs was about “vikas (development)”.Local leaders took to the stage around noon and spoke until the PM’s arrival.When the sound of a helicopter was heard, the crowd yelled “Modi has come!” and climbed atop barricades to catch a glimpse of the PM. However, they were disappointed as the security arrangements didn’t allow the crowd to get close to him.As Modi began his descent from the helicopter, chants of “Modi-Yogi”, “Jai Shri Ram” and “Vande Matram” went up.Starting his address at 2.40pm, Modi listed the UP government’s achievements and detailed the benefits that the Noida airport would bring to the locals in Jewar. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia also spoke.Within minutes of PM Modi and his entourage of ministers leaving the stage, the crowd dispersed from the venue. Many took the opportunity to carry back home the large cutouts of PM Modi’s waving figurine. When asked what they plan to do with the cut out, Siraj Zaidi, a resident of Kishorepur village in Jewar,said, “PM Modi is the most popular star of the country. I will place this cutout at my tea shop in the village to attract more customers and to give my shop a uniqueness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/enthusiastic-crowd-welcomes-pm-modi-at-noida-airport-event-101637865332832.html

26-11-2021||Noida||Low temperatures cause dengue cases to decline in Ghaziabad||The number of dengue cases in Ghaziabad peaked in October and are now witnessing a decline, officials of the district health department said on Thursday.According to official figures, Ghaziabad recorded 1,200 dengue cases till Wednesday, with the first case reported on September 1. Figures indicate that the overall positivity rate is 22.72%. The district reported 312 dengue cases in September on the back of 984 tests and a positivity rate of 31.71% -- highest in the past three months. The positivity rate in October was 23.55%, with 647 cases returning positive for dengue of the 2,747 tests. In November, the positivity rate dipped further to 15.55%, on the basis of 241 cases from 1,550 tests, said officials.“The overall positivity rate has declined, and we can safely say that the dengue cases are declining. It has resulted due to lowering of temperatures. At present, we have a maximum of five to six cases daily. In October, nearly 30 or more dengue cases were reported a day. The overall tally includes a dengue death in October, which was confirmed by the Elisa test later,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer, Ghaziabad.“It is expected that no fresh dengue cases will be reported for another fortnight or so. Nearly 150 to 200 people tested themselves for dengue till October, but in November, the numbers have considerably declined to 30 to 40 per day. Teams concerned are working on surveillance, and taking up anti-dengue measures till date,” Dr Gupta added.There is a declining trend of dengue cases already, experts say.“Dengue cases usually decline during November or December, with a rise in the temperature. There has been a considerable decline in the number of dengue cases being reported During the past 10 to 15 days. At present, there is a persistence trend in cases of viral fever and influenza. It is expected that dengue cases will see a further decline in December,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad chapter.According to official figures, Ghaziabad this year reported the highest number of dengue cases at 1,200, after 2013, when the count for the vector-borne disease was 1,622 with a total of four deaths. Ever since, the dengue tally has remained below the 1,000-mark.“The rise in dengue cases has also resulted due to the prolonged monsoon this year, which gave way to rapid waterlogging incidents. There is no other apparent reason behind the spike in dengue cases, other than the prolonged monsoon. Fresh cases, however, are seeing a decline at present,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad chapter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/low-temperatures-cause-dengue-cases-to-decline-in-ghaziabad-101637865211542.html

A waste transfer station is a centre where a large amount of waste is segregated -- both with machines and manually -- and recyclable items, such as bottles, plastics, batteries, glass, wood, are recovered. The recyclable items are sent to authorised recyclers while the remaining is sent to Bandhwari landfill. A waste transfer station helps bring down the total waste load that is sent to the landfill by 20-25%. Each transfer station has the capacity to segregate around 120 tonnes of waste daily.The MCG has waste transfer stations at Atul Kataria Chowk, Beriwala Bagh, Sushant Lok 1 but does not have one in Zone 4. Areas falling on the left side of the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) after Vatika Chowk, such as sectors 66 to 76, Badshahpur, and Darbaripur, come under ward 25. Besides these, areas such as South City 2, sectors 30, 31, 32, 51, Nirvana Country fall under Zone 4. With the municipal corporation taking only segregated waste from residents since November 11, setting up another waste transfer station is expected to further reduce the load on the overburdened Bandhwari landfill. “We will be initiating the takeover (of the land) from next month and start setting up the infrastructure. While the centre will be used for segregation, Ecogreen is also in the process of sensitising residents about the need for waste segregation in their households, the success of which will do away with the need for such waste transfer stations in future,” said Sanjeev Sharma, official spokesperson of Ecogreen.“Waste segregation is not only an important step for reducing garbage load but also shows us ways of how we can generate wealth out of the waste we produce -- either by recycling or converting organic matter into compost. The allocation of land for a new waste transfer station in zone 4 is just another step towards this cause. This will help decentralise and streamline the waste management system and reduce the total garbage load carried to the Bandhwari landfill,” said Dr Vaishali Sharma, additional commissioner, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-civic-body-allocates-land-in-sector-70-to-set-up-waste-transfer-station-101637865155115.html
26-11-2021||Pune||The science of training an athlete’s mind and body is the key: Tapan Panigrahi||PUNE Pune-based swimming coach Tapan Kumar Panigrahi, who received the Dronacharya award on November 13, has urged city coaches to include sports science in their physical training schedule, as this will play an important role in the overall training of an athlete. “Scientific training should be started at a young age. The right age to introduce this training in an athlete’s daily schedule is from 12 to 14 years. The results, however, will be seen in the future,” says Panigrahi. Panigrahi, till date, he has trained 250 national level swimmers and 60 international swimmers. He has also trained para swimmers. “I tell the athletes about the characteristics required to compete in sporting events. Once they are aware, they prepare their body in a better way,” says Panigrahi.Coaching para swimmers Para swimmer Suyash Jadhav who was a medal prospect for India at the Tokyo Paralympics has been trained by Panigrahi, however, due to health issues, Jadhav could not give his best performance at the event. “He (Suyash) and his father, both were not well for 12 days in Tokyo and had a mild fever. I was expecting him to win a bronze medal. I hope that he wins a medal in the 2024 games,” added Panigrahi. India’s Olympic swimming medal hopes Panigrahi feels that Indian swimmers are falling short and are not performing well at the Olympics. “Our swimmers are winning medals at international events, but when it comes to the Olympics, we are falling a short in the qualifying rounds. The performance has improved, let’s hope to see more swimmers qualify for 2024 Olympics,” added Panigrahi. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, three swimmers – Sajan Prakash, Srihari Nataraj and Manna Patel qualified for the games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/the-science-of-training-an-athlete-s-mind-and-body-is-the-key-tapan-panigrahi-101637865094867.html
26-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Schools to reopen today even as IMD forecasts ‘very poor’ air||Taking a cue from neighbouring Delhi, which decided to reopen schools from coming Monday, the district administration of Gurugram said all schools and educational institutions will open from Friday onwards with strict compliance to Covid appropriate behaviour. The decision to reopen schools and educational institution comes despite the Supreme Court reimposing the ban on construction activities in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), while allowing some ancillary non-polluting works like plumbing and electrical fitting. Previously, the Supreme Court had ordered for the shutting of schools and a ban on construction activities for around a week after pollution levels spiked to ‘severe’ levels.Meanwhile, according to the air quality index (AQI) bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board, Gurugram was in the ‘very poor’ zone on Thursday with an AQI reading of 334. The monitoring station in Vikas Sadan recorded an AQI of 329, Sector 51 monitoring station recorded AQI 374, TERI Gram recorded AQI 293 while at Gwal Pahari, the recording was 246. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday there will be mostly calm and slow winds on Friday, which are unfavourable for the effective dispersion of pollutants. “The air quality is likely to be in the upper end of the very poor category on Friday and Saturday. For the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor category. Gradual improvement is likely from Saturday,” said the IMD in its forecast. IMD recorded a maximum temperature of 26 degrees Celsius on Thursday and a minimum of 9.4°C. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert, said declining temperature and low wind speed will ensure that pollutants do not get dispersed and the air quality remains in the ‘very poor’ category in the city for next few days. “We are expecting things to improve slightly in December when it rains,” he said. Meanwhile, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board said that as per the directions of the Supreme Court, it had reimposed the ban on construction and demolition activities to curb air pollution in Gururgam and adjoining NCR districts. The district pollution authorities also directed 48 industries to use only clean fuel as only industries using piped natural gas are allowed to operate. They also said they have imposed environment compensation penalty of ₹12.25 lakh against those found violating Grap (graded response action plan) guidelines. “We have imposed penalty on NHAI and its contractor for pollution on Dwarka Expressway. Three construction sites in Udyog Vihar and one in Sohna were also penalised. Penalties were also slapped on those using diesel generator sets. Strict action is being taken against violators; We have also asked government agencies to follow norms, else penalties will be levied on them,” said Kuldip Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, north. S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB, said that all directions given by the Supreme Court are being implemented in the NCR districts. “The construction activities are banned. The non-polluting activities, such as plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry, are allowed to continue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugramschools-to-reopen-today-even-as-imd-forecasts-very-poor-air-101637865091610.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Probe pending in half the cases, say police||Of the total 758 cases registered in connection with communal riots in north-east Delhi in February last year, the city police has completed the investigation and filed charge sheets only in 361 cases as on October 4, the Delhi high court was informed on Thursday.Even in cases where the charge sheet has been filed, trial has begun in just over 67 cases (18%), Delhi police told the court.The police also added that four cases have been quashed by the Delhi high court and accused have been acquitted in one case.In a status report filed before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, the city police said that of the total, 695 cases are being probed by the local police and charge sheets were filed in 315 cases. It further said that of the 695 cases, charges have been framed in 56 cases and in two cases, the accused were given a clean chit even before the trial started.The status report was filed by special public prosecutor Rajat Nair, appearing for the Delhi Police, in a batch of petitions related to the last year’s violence.Communal clashes broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020, after a standoff between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and opposers got out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.On Thursday, the court asked the police to file an updated status report and posted the matter for hearing on January 28.“We direct the respondent (Delhi Police) to file a further detailed affidavit giving details of cases pending before the trial courts,” the court said, noting the present affidavit was not on its record. The city police informed that the legal process in all pending cases is at an advanced stage.“Out of 758 cases registered, 695 cases are being investigated by north-east district police. 62 cases that pertained to major incidents like murders etc were transferred to the crime branch, which had undertaken an investigation in the said cases by employing 3 dedicated special investigating teams (SITs), being continuously monitored by the superior officers. One case of larger conspiracy behind the engineering of the communal riots in Delhi is being investigated in special cell,” the affidavit stated.It said that all cases are investigated promptly, diligently, fairly, and in accordance with the law and that there is no ground to transfer the cases to a fresh SIT.“The same is manifested from the orders passed by this court, while considering the bail application of the accused, where this court has been pleased to dismiss the bails, on the basis of material available against the accused belonging to both communities,” it said.The court is hearing several petitions including a plea which has alleged that several politicians gave hate speeches in the lead up to the riots. Apart from seeking action against those who allegedly gave the hate speeches, some pleas have also sought other reliefs, including setting up of an SIT, FIRs against police officers who were allegedly involved in the violence, and disclosure of persons arrested and detained.The court has also been hearing a PIL by Delhi resident Ajay Gautam seeking an NIA probe under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act) law into the violence. The petition has urged the court to direct the Centre to order the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to find out the “anti-national forces” behind the agitations and to probe the role of Popular Front of India (PFI) which is allegedly “funding, motivating and supporting the protests”.In its response, the police had earlier told the court that it had already created three SITs under the crime branch and that there was no evidence till now that its officers were involved in the violence. It had added that the families of people arrested and detained in connection with the riots had been informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-probe-pending-in-half-the-cases-say-police-101637864794053.html
26-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Muslims to approach court for relief in namaz controversy||With disruptions of namaz gatherings in the open continuing to take place every Friday in Gurugram, members of the Muslim community on Thursday said they have no option left but to approach the court, seeking relief from the continuous harassment and uphold their constitutional right to religious freedom and worship.cBut Muslim groups have maintained that the number of mosques in the city is not adequate for Friday congregations.As protests that started in Sector 37 spread to Sector 12A and other areas, Gurugram administration earlier this month reduced the number of public sites for namaz from 37 to 20. But disruptions continued even at these designated points until last Friday.Muslims said apart from taking legal recourse, they would also file complaints with the police against individuals and organisations for hurting religious sentiments. “We have little hope from the authorities, so we are planning to approach the court to enforce our constitutional rights. We have also decided to lodge complaints against those who have harassed our community members,” said Altaf Ahmad, founder, Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a citizens’ platform. He said they were still working out the details of which court to approach and when, among others.On Thursday, a few Hindu residents of Khandsa Village submitted a memorandum to the district administration opposing Friday prayers near Khandsa Chowk.Rajiv Mittal, spokesperson, Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, an umbrella group of rightwing organisation opposing namaz in the open, said the protest in Khandsa will be led by residents but they will support it.“The memorandum to oppose the namaz has been submitted by residents of Khandsa Village and those living in Sector 37. We will support the protests and, if need be, gather there,” said Mittal, adding that they have already given a deadline of December 4 for stopping such public prayers.HT has a copy of the memorandum received by the administration but none of Khandsa residents, who submitted it, could be reached for a comment.Mittal also said around 30 persons from the Sikh community are coming from Delhi and Amritsar to oppose the proposal of offering gurdwara premises for Friday prayers.Last week, Sikh community leaders offered the premises of gurdwaras for namaz, but withdrew the offer a couple of days later under pressure from rightwing groups and also from those within their community.Sardar Raviranjan Singh, vice-president, Gurmat prachar Jatha Panch Khalsa, said Sangat members will reach the gurdwara in Sadar on Friday to prevent namaz on the premises. “People from all community are welcome to pray and share the langar prasad but we will not allow namaz or any other religious worship that is not permitted by the Gurmat Rehat maryada,” he said.The Gurugram police, meanwhile, said personnel will be deployed at all designated spots to maintain law and order. “Duties have already been assigned and adequate deployment would be made to maintain law and order so that there is no disturbance during Friday prayers,” said Subhash Boken, police spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-muslims-to-approach-court-for-relief-in-namaz-controversy-101637864611411.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality turns severe, no relief in sight till next week||The air quality in the city deteriorated on Thursday, and was on the brink of the “severe” category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin, before plunging into deep red later in the evening, as calm surface winds were unable to disperse pollutants. Delhi’s average air quality index (AQI) touched 400 – just point short of “severe” -- in the 4pm reading that is taken as the pollution marker for the day. By 9pm, the average climbed to 401, and was on an upward trend at several stations across the city. The Capital has seen a sudden drop in air quality in the past 48 hours: it was 290 (poor) on Tuesday and 361 (very poor) on Wednesday.Weather forecasting agencies said no immediate relief is expected as calm conditions are likely to continue till November 28, after which wind speeds may increase to 15-20 km/hr on Monday, facilitating the dispersal of pollutants.According to Gufran Beig, founder and project director at the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), calm wind conditions will prevail at night and in the early hours of the morning for the next three days. “A combination of local emissions and weather conditions are playing a part now, with stubble burning reducing considerably,” said Beig.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration was 6%, with 219 fires recorded by Safar across the northern plains. “On November 29, local surface winds are likely to increase, resulting in improvement of air quality, but even then, it will be within the ‘very poor’ category,” Beig added.Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 9.7 degrees Celsius (°C) on Thursday, 0.5 degrees above Wednesday’s minimum temperature of 9.2°C. Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at private forecasting agency Skymet, said temperatures are not likely to dip below 9°C this week. “Temperatures will hover around 10-11 degrees for the next few days,” he said, and concurred with Safar’s forecast of three more high-pollution days until Monday.According to Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi – another forecasting mechanism under the ministry of earth sciences -- a combination of low wind speed and a low ventilation index was negatively impacting Delhi’s air. While wind speed in the city touched 10km/hr during the day on Thursday, EWS said, it will drop to a maximum speed of 8km/hr on Friday and Saturday, with the Delhi’s ventilation index (measure of the volume rate of horizontal transport of air within the mixing layer) varying from 500-1,500 sqm/second in the next two days. “A ventilation index lower than 6,000sqm/sec, with an average wind speed less than 10km/hr, is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants,” it said.The Delhi government on Thursday announced a ban on construction and demolition activities in the Capital once again, following a Supreme Court on Wednesday reimposing the ban in the wake of deteriorating air quality. Schools and educational institutions in the Capital are set to open next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-turns-severe-no-relief-in-sight-till-next-week-101637864431463.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||Farm protests: Farmers at Singhu prepare for first anniversary||On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the farmer’s protest, Singhu border appears as vibrant as it was when the farmers first arrived at the Delhi border. The sale of flags, badges and t-shirts bearing popular slogans such as ‘I Love Farmers’, ‘No Farmers, No Food’ and ‘Kisan Mazdoor Ekta Zindabad’ has shot up in the last 48 hours, with tractors carrying farmers from villages in Punjab reaching Delhi to mark the occasion.Farmers said there will be special langar (community meals) services and music on Friday to thank all those who stayed put to make their movement against the three farm laws successful.Thousands of farmers rallied to the borders of Delhi last November to protest against three laws brought by the centre that sought to deregulate farm trade. Though the protests continued at several border points, Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur emerged as the ground zero of the agitation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 announced that the government will repeal the three farm laws, even as the protesters described it as a “half victory”, and said that they will continue their movement until all of their demands are met.After the Centre’s announcement, and with the first anniversary of the protests approaching, there has been a festive atmosphere at Singhu.Till last week, only a handful of flags could be seen adorning the protest site at Singhu, but now there is a new-found enthusiasm even among the local residents, several protesters at the site said on Thursday.“Badges in particulars are finding a lot of takers once again. I have sold over 500 badges since Thursday morning and anyone reaching here from Punjab and Haryana wants to join the celebrations,” said Sehendar Pal, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and has been selling these items at Singhu for the past one year.On Thursday too, hundreds of farmers could be seen reaching the Singhu border, mostly on tractors with Punjabi songs being played on attached speakers. Parvinder Singh, a farmer from Hoshiarpur, who reached the border on Thursday, said most of the people in his village have either reached Delhi, or are planning to come. “Only a handful of people may stay back. While we would go back home in batches, everyone wants to come here for the November 26 anniversary,” he said.Till Thursday evening, the Prabandhak Committee members were planning how the anniversary celebrations will unravel, stating that the Samyukt Kisan Morcha will take a final call. “This will be an occasion to thank all those who stayed behind and helped make this movement so successful. It will also be the occasion to commemorate all the lives that were lost,” said committee member Bhajan Singh, adding that they were still contemplating whether to cut a cake to celebrate the occasion or not.Popular Punjabi singer Babbu Mann will perform on the main stage on Friday. “We are giving five minutes to everyone (those who will come to affirm their support), including him. He can perform a song, or spend his time talking about the movement and thanking the farmers,” Bhajan Singh added.Closer towards the stage, a blood donation camp was opened on Thursday, and will go on till Friday, the farmers said. “We have been periodically setting up camps, as those visiting have been keen on donating blood. We were called to set up a camp for the occasion,” says Sumit Kumar from the Divine Charitable Blood Centre in Faridabad.Langar services are also being prepared. Seasonal vegetables such as saag (green leafy vegetables) were on the menu for Friday, the organisers said.Hardyal Singh, part of the Guru Nanak Langar sewa, said the numbers at the border have increased considerably over the past one week. “We will be preparing kheer and seasonal vegetables. We will be satisfied to serve everyone who wants to enjoy the langar tomorrow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farm-protests-farmers-at-singhu-prepare-for-first-anniversary-101637864254421.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||NFHS-5: Physical abuse of pregnant women, sexual violence rising in Delhi||Instances of physical abuse of pregnant married women and sexual violence on young women are on the rise in the national capital, the fifth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), the findings of which was released by the Union health ministry on Wednesday, has revealed.According to the findings, physical abuse of pregnant married women, in the 18-49 age group, rose marginally from 3.4% in 2015-16 to 3.6% in 2020-21. The survey also shows that the number of young women (18-29), who have experienced sexual violence by the age of 18, rose from 0.0 (nil) in 2015-16 to 1.6% in 2020-21.There was, however, a decline in incidents of spousal violence among married women — it came down from 26.8% in 2015-16 to 22.6% in 2020-21. Spousal violence is defined as physical and/or sexual violence. While experts attributed the increase in physical abuse of pregnant women and sexual violence on young women to the pandemic-induced inequalities and restrictions, they said the decline in instances of spousal violence could be due to a lack of avenues (for reporting such crimes) or the absence of reporting mechanisms. The data for the survey was collected in two phases — January 4, 2020, to March 2, 2020 (prior to the Covid lockdown), and November 21, 2020, to January 20, 2021. A total of 9,486 households, 11,159 women, and 1,700 men were surveyed in the Delhi. All comparative figures are from NFHS-4, for which data was collected in 2015-16. Ranjana Kumari, director, Centre for Social Research, said the findings pertaining to the decline in spousal violence did not align with the experience of women rights organisations and NGOs that registered a significant increase in distress calls during the pandemic. “There is a possibility that there was no support system for women to report (the violence). Women probably did not come out to report even if they were suffering. Almost all organisations, including the National Commission for Women, saw an unprecedented increase in instances of domestic violence. However, it is also possible that there might have been some improvement in the period before the pandemic,” said Kumari. Jaya Velankar, director, Jagori, a women’s organisation based out of Delhi, said they witnessed an over 70% increase in the number of distress calls during the first lockdown (in March 2020) and incidents of domestic violence did not abate even after the lockdown was lifted. “Families lost their sources of livelihood. Men lost their jobs. People are still spending time at home due to which women continue to be with their abusers for a prolonged period of time. While structural violence has gone up, there has been an increase in inequality as well with women being deprived of college education,” said Velankar. She also added that pregnant women were most vulnerable and anecdotal evidence showed that incidents of violence against such women were not uncommon. Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) member Ranjana Prasad said the commission operated helplines through which awareness pertaining to issues of pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children were being taken care of since the pandemic started. “We receive all kinds of complaints on our helpline — of physical violence or request for relief for pregnant women. We take cognisance of all complaints. The lockdown period was a time of crisis. People lost their jobs and there was stress on the family setup, which might have aided violence. However, whenever any kind of complaint reaches us, we take steps. We also provide mental health support to young women and families through our helpline,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nfhs5-physical-abuse-of-pregnant-women-sexual-violence-rising-in-delhi-101637864253196.html
26-11-2021||Delhi||Four out of 10 people in Delhi overweight, finds survey||Almost 4 out of every 10 people in Delhi are either overweight or obese according to the summary findings of the National Family Health Survey-5 , a significant deterioration from the previous edition of the survey in 2015-16. According to the survey, 41.3% of adult women and 38% men have a body-mass index (BMI) in excess of 25. This has increased from 33.5% for women and 24.6% for men from NFHS-4. The numbers are also higher than the national average -- 24% women and 22.9% men. BMI – an indicator of body fat based on the height and weight of a person – between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy, and between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. That over 30 is considered obese. The NFHS data does not give a clear break up of how many people are overweight or obese.“The increasing rates of obesity means more people will end up with lifestyles diseases in the future. We need to ensure that we take action now to prevent this... We need to increase awareness about proper diet and exercise. Not only are people eating more than the required daily calories, they are also leading a more sedentary life, especially in urbanised centres like Delhi. There is also a need to add labelling about fat, sugar, salt, and total calorie content in the front of packaged items to warn people,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College. A 2020 study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that 27.4% women would be overweight and 13.9%, obese by 2040 in India. For men, the corresponding proportions are 30.5% and 9.5%. Obesity is one of the biggest risk factors for other lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart ailments. A little over one in two men (56%) and close to two-thirds (65%) women who are currently 20 years old are likely develop diabetes later in life, with the obese being at an 85% risk of developing diabetes, according to a 2020 study by researchers from US, UK and India including doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The silver lining? There has been a decline in the proportion of people who are underweight, the data shows. In Delhi, 10% women and 9.1% men are underweight, meaning they have a BMI under 18.5. As for lifestyle diseases, 4.2% women and 5.3% men have high blood sugar levels between 141 and 160mg/dL and 6.3% women and 7.3% men have very high blood sugar level over 160 mg/dL. Comparable data from the previous round of survey is not available for these parameters. The survey also shows that 14.7% women had mildly elevated blood pressure and 5.9% had moderately or severely elevated blood pressure. Among men, 21.8% had mildly high blood pressure and 8.7% had moderate to severely high blood pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-out-of-10-people-in-delhi-overweight-finds-survey-101637864191437.html

Big test in 3 months||KARNAL: His aides may need to rework Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s schedule for the next three months if they haven’t already. The Japanese language course for which the chief minister enrolled is tentatively scheduled to start from November 28, a top university faculty member said.Khattar announced his decision to enrol for the Japanese language course in August when he formally launched the online certificate course at a Kurukshetra University event. The chief minister declared that he will be the first student to enrol for the course designed for government functionaries.In a statement on Thursday, the university confirmed that the chief minister did stick to his word.Kurukshetra University vice-chancellor Prof Som Nath Sachdeva said it was a matter of pride for the university that the chief minister was the first student of the Japanese language course. The last deadline to pay the ₹10,000 fee was November 22.Prof. Brajesh Sawhney, chairperson of the university’s Department of Foreign Languages said the online course is tailored specifically to meet the needs of government representatives and top officials to further collaborations between India and Japan in the field of business, economy, research and education.The classes will be held on two days every week, he said. The university has engaged a teacher from Japan for the certificate course.Of course, all students will need to attend a minimum number of classes, and will be tested for their language proficiency before they get the certificate, Prof Sawhney, who is also the university’s Dean, Faculty of Arts, said. He didn’t, however, specify if the test will be written or oral.The last time the chief minister probably sat in a classroom was 46 years ago, in 1975 when he graduated from Delhi University.This online class isn’t going to be as crowded. A university official told HT that there will be just six students. Among his coursemates will be his principal secretary V Umashankar, adviser Pawan Chaudhary and vice-chancellor Prof Som Nath Sachdeva.Prof. Sawhney said the course was designed to help government representatives improve interaction with top Japanese executives since Japan is one of the biggest investors in Haryana.The basic certificate course, he said, “will cover Japanese history, Japanese life-values, basics of Japanese writing and pronunciation, Japanese vocabulary and basic greetings used in daily life and business meetings”.To be sure, Haryana has gone to great lengths to encourage Japanese business leaders to set up shop in the state and expand existing factories. Like the India Japan Golf Meet hosted by the Haryana government in early 2020, weeks before the Covid-19 pandemic forced a national lockdown in India. Khattar made it a point to be present at the event, and in his speech, threw in a smattering of Japanese to impress his guests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manohar-lal-khattar-enrols-in-japanese-language-course-big-test-in-3-months-101637863171968.html

The Pink Line, which connects Majlis Park with Shiv Vihar, is the longest Metro corridor in the Capital. The Pink Line is also the second Metro corridor in New Delhi to have driverless train operations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the country’s first driverless operations on the DMRC’s Magenta Line - connecting Botanical Garden with Janakpuri West - in December 2020.Puri said at the inauguration, “The DMRC is now the fourth largest driverless network [in the world]. The difference between the DMRC and Kuala Lumpur’s operational driverless network (No. 3 in the world) is just 500m. In less than a year, we added 58km to the driverless network… I can say with confidence that Delhi Metro can be compared with the best [metro systems].”Also Read: Delhi Metro services disrupted after bird gets stuck on train tracksGahlot said, “This is a milestone. Despite all the difficulties, the DMRC has completed the work. It will ensure passenger safety and minimise chances of human errors.”The flagging off event for driverless trains was done via videoconferencing.The DMRC’s driverless network now stands at a total of 96km, which is 9% of world’s total driverless Metro operations. Dubai, Singapore, Shanghai, Vancouver and Kuala Lumpur are among the few cities that have driverless Metro train services.Once the DMRC completes construction work on the Maujpur-Majlis Park extension corridor by 2023, New Delhi’s driverless Metro network will go up to 109km.Driverless operations on the Pink Line were scheduled to start earlier this year, but it was delayed as the DMRC couldn’t complete work on the Trilokpuri section, where it had to construct a viaduct. The section was made operational in August.DMRC officials said the corridor was inspected by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety last week. The DMRC uses a signalling technology called Communication-based Train Control for driverless train operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-launches-driverless-operations-on-pink-line-today-101637832867735.html

WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told a UN briefing in Geneva that countries should take a "risk-based and scientific approach" while implementing travel measures."At this point, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against," the UN health agency spokesperson said. "The WHO recommends that countries continue to apply a risk-based and scientific approach when implementing travel measures."Germany, Italy, Britain, and France have announced travel restrictions on flights arriving from many South African nations. While Germany will ban most travel from South Africa and “probably neighbouring nations”, Italy will be banning entry to those who have been to South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia or Swaziland in the past fortnight. France has suspended all flights coming from southern Africa for 48 hours.New coronavirus variant in South Africa: These countries are banning flightsMeanwhile, WHO said it will share further guidance for governments on actions related to the virus variant. The UN health agency has convened a meeting of experts on Friday to evaluate whether the new strain constitutes a variant of interest or a variant of concern.Lindmeier said it will take a few weeks to understand the variant's impact, and researchers are working to determine how transmissible it is and how it will affect therapeutics and vaccines.The ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular media briefing that he doesn't have any immediate information on the actions being considered by the government. He said that the issue of travel measures is for the health and civil aviation authorities to address."This is a developing incident. We just saw a briefing by WHO.

Experts have warned about the “unusual mutations” in the new variant that has been identified in 22 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in South Africa.Amid European Union’s executive Ursula von der Leyen’s proposal to ban air travel from southern Africa, several member states are swiftly moving to stop international flights from the region to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus variant B.1.1529. Experts have warned about the “unusual mutations” in the new variant that has been identified in 22 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in South Africa.On Thursday, World Health Organization (WHO) officials rushed to discuss the variant which, experts warn, could affect transmissibility and immune response due to a high number of spike mutations. South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) issued a statement on the new variant, saying experts are working overtime to understand the potential implications."We can see that the variant is potentially spreading very fast. We do expect to start seeing pressure in the healthcare system in the next few days and weeks,” South African virologist Tulio de Oliveira said, as quoted by Associated Press.The alarms bells sounded by experts over B.1.1529 have prompted countries around the world to announce travel bans in a bid to prevent its spread.Here’s the list of countries that have announced new measures:United Kingdom: British health secretary Sajid Javid said that the scientists were “deeply concerned” over the new variant, and, as a precautionary measure, the UK has decided to suspend all flights from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Botswana.Germany: Health minister Jens Spahn said that Germany will ban most travel from South African and “probably neighbouring nations” to prevent the spread of the new virus variant with a large number of mutations. He added that German nationals will be allowed entry but they have to go through mandatory quarantined even if fully vaccinated.Italy: Following the “path of maximum caution”, health minister Roberto Speranza said Italy will be banning entry to those who have been to South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia or Swaziland in the past fortnight.France: Health minister Olivier Veran announced that France has suspended all flights coming from southern Africa for 48 hours.

Its foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.After easing some of its travel restrictions earlier this month, India's central government issued an advisory to all states to rigorously test and screen international travellers from South Africa and other "at risk" countries.Asian countries have fared better than those in other regions in containing the pandemic by enforcing strict preventive measures, rigorous testing and strict border controls.The new variant has a spike protein that is dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that Covid-19 vaccines are based on, the UK Health Security Agency added.Taiwan said travellers from "high-risk" southern African countries will have to go into government-run quarantine facilities for 14 days.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told Reuters that New Zealand was well prepared for the new variant. Earlier this week, New Zealand said it would reopen its borders to fully vaccinated international travellers from April 30.Asked whether those plans would have to be delayed due to the new variant, Ardern said the country had "a number of inbuilt measures to act as a layer of protection.""All of our planning around Covid, we have built into it the possibility of variants in the future," Ardern said in an interview for the upcoming Reuters Next conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alarmed-by-new-b-1-1-529-covid-variant-asian-countries-tighten-measures-101637915308806.html
26-11-2021||World||Libya: Gunmen attack court ahead of appeal by slain dictator Kadhafi's son||Libya's government has condemned an attack on a court ahead of an appeal by the son of slain dictator Moamer Kadhafi against the rejection of his presidential election candidacy.The December 24 polls come as Libya seeks to turn a page on a decade of violence that has rocked the oil-rich nation since a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed Kadhafi in 2011.Libya's electoral commission on Wednesday announced the rejection of the candidacy of Seif al-Islam Kadhafi, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes.Seif al-Islam was among 25 of the 98 hopefuls whose bids were turned down for non-compliance with the provisions of the electoral law.The unsuccessful applicants were given 48 hours to appeal the decision in court.But on Thursday morning a "group of outlaws" launched an "odious" attack on the court in the southern town of Sebha forcing it to shut -- just hours before Seif al-Islam had been due to appeal, the government said in a statement.It has ordered the interior and justice ministries to open an investigation into the attack, said Khaled al-Zaydi, a lawyer for Seif al-Islam.The attackers forced all staff from the court building "at gunpoint" hours before the appeal hearing, said Khaled al-Zaydi, Seif al-Islam's lawyer."This act is an obstacle to the electoral process," he said in a video broadcast on Libyan media.In the case of Seif al-Islam, the commission had pointed to articles of the electoral law stipulating that candidates "must not have been sentenced for a dishonourable crime" and must present a clean criminal record.The final list of candidates is due to be published by early December, once verifications and appeals are completed.Other hopefuls still in the running include eastern-based strongman Khalifa Haftar, interim premier Abdulhamid Dbeibah, and former interior minister Fathi Bashagha.Both presidential and legislative polls had been slated for December 24, but in early October parliament split the dates of the votes, postponing the legislative elections until January.The path to the ballot box has been lined with disputes over the constitutional basis for the polls and the powers to be given to whoever wins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-gunmen-attack-court-ahead-of-appeal-by-slain-dictator-kadhafi-s-son-101637911213019.html
26-11-2021||World||Black Friday: Supply chain disruptions, shortages cast a shadow over Britain||Britain's retailers are hoping Black Friday discount day will get shoppers spending, though it takes place against a backdrop of shortages of both products and drivers to deliver them.In Britain, the Black Friday trading period is particularly important for department store group John Lewis, consumer electricals retailers Currys and AO World, and general merchandise retailer Argos, which is part of supermarket group Sainsbury's.While Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, and Asda are also participating, some major retailers, including Marks & Spencer and Next, shun the event.On the eve of Black Friday, UK retailers reported on Thursday the strongest pre-Christmas demand since 2015 but also the biggest price rises since 1990, as fears of shortages led shoppers to buy gifts early, figures from the Confederation of British Industry showed.“We could see a strong sales surge over the Black Friday weekend but shoppers may find that the deals on offer aren’t quite as generous as they’ve been used to in the past," said Sophie Michael, head of retail at BDO."Supply chain disruptions, product shortages, and higher costs will mean retailers won’t feel compelled to race to the bottom on price as they have done in previous years."On Tuesday, AO warned of limited supplies of games consoles, including Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox, and Apple iPhones, blaming the global shortage of semiconductor chips.Earlier this month, Sainsbury's similarly warned shoppers to expect a shortage of electronics products.Currys, however, has said it is well stocked.Delays in international supply chains are being compounded by labour shortages in domestic transport and warehousing networks, with a shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers particularly acute.Black Friday participants are stretching promotions over several weeks, aiming to smooth out consumer demand and reduce pressure on logistics.But over a decade after being brought to the UK by Amazon the event's worth to retailers still divides opinion.Supporters say carefully planned promotions in close co-operation with global suppliers allow retailers to boost sales and maintain profit margins.Naysayers argue that discounts suck forward Christmas sales with reduced profit and undermine consumers' willingness to pay full price again before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-friday-supply-chain-disruptions-shortages-cast-a-shadow-over-britain-101637910185820.html

It also instructed anyone who recently arrived from those countries to take a Covid-19 test for good measure.Tulio de Oliveira, a member of the Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa which has tracked the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant in the country, told the Associated Press that the “very high number of mutations” of the new coronavirus variant is a concern for predicted immune evasion and transmissibility.“This new variant has many, many more mutations, including more than 30 to the spike protein that affects transmissibility,” de Oliveira was quoted as saying. "We can see that the variant is potentially spreading very fast. We do expect to start seeing pressure in the healthcare system in the next few days and weeks.”Although there is a noticeable “jump” in the evolution of the coronavirus with this variant, a silver lining is seen in the fact that it can at least be detected by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Moreover, a team of scientists from seven South African universities is currently studying 100 whole genomes of the variant and they expect to come up with more findings in the coming days, de Oliveira added.Speaking on the B.1.1.529 coronavirus variant, Ravindra Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said: “It has a high number of spike mutations that could affect transmissibility and immune response.”Notably, it is yet to be understood if the recent spike in coronavirus infections in South Africa was caused by the new variant, but there is “a high probability that this is the case”, according to Gupta.The number of Covid-19 cases in South Africa had increased dramatically last week. After a period of recording relatively low transmission rates with just over 200 new confirmed cases daily, the country suddenly recorded more than 1,200 on Wednesday. On Thursday, the number of daily cases jumped to 2,465 – a rapid increase was driven by a surge in Pretoria and the surrounding Tshwane metropolitan area, specifically reported from student gatherings at universities.“This is clearly a variant that we must be very serious about,” warned the Cambridge microbiology professor.However, it is to be noted that to date, the Delta variant of the coronavirus remains the most infectious. It has crowded out other once-worrying variants including alpha, beta, and mu.According to sequences submitted by countries worldwide to the world's biggest public database, more than 99 per cent of all global coronavirus cases can be attributed to the Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frequent-mutations-rapid-spread-all-about-the-new-coronavirus-variant-in-south-africa-101637894865477.html

The NICD said the number of detected cases and the percentage testing positive are "increasing quickly" in three of the country's provinces.‘Dramatically different’Scientists have said that many of the mutations indicate its high transmissibility and resistance to vaccines, the strain has more changes in the spike protein than all other Covid-19 variants.The UK Health Security Agency has said the coronavirus variant has a spike protein that was dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that Covid-19 vaccines are based on. The agency has declared variant B.1.1.529 a Variant under Investigation (VuI).Also watch | India warns states, UTs as new Covid variant found in South Africa worries WHO"This is the most significant variant we have encountered to date and urgent research is underway to learn more about its transmissibility, severity and vaccine-susceptibility," UKHSA chief executive Jenny Harries said."The variant includes a large number of spike protein mutations as well as mutations in other parts of the viral genome. These are potentially biologically significant mutations which may change the behaviour of the virus with regards to vaccines, treatments and transmissibility. More investigation is required," UK Health Security Agency said in a statement.The UK Health Security Agency said no cases of it had been detected in Britain so far.Scientists said lab studies were needed to assess the likelihood of the mutations resulting in greatly reduced vaccine efficacy.Flight bans, new casesUK health secretary Sajid Javid on Thursday announced a temporary suspension of flights from six countries after reports emerged that a new coronavirus variant. Israel also banned travel from South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini due to the new variant, BNO News reported.Hong Kong confirmed two cases of the new Covid variant after genome sequencing analysis by the University of Hong Kong. One of the cases was a traveller arriving in Hong Kong from South Africa. The other person was quarantined in the hotel room opposite and might have been infected as air flowed between the rooms.Rigorous testingIn India, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Thursday wrote to all states and Union territories to start “rigorous screening and testing” of all international travellers coming from or transiting through Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong."lt is critical for the States/UTs to adhere to the overarching 'Test-TrackTreat-Vaccinate' principle to ensure stringent implementation of containment measures as per Ministry of Health and Family Welfare guidelines," said the letter."It has now been reported by National Cooperative Development Corporation (NDMC) that this variant is reported to have a significantly high number of mutations, and thus, has serious public health implications for the country, in view of recently relaxed visa restrictions and opening up of international travel," he wrote in the letter."The contacts of these international travellers must also be closely tracked and tested as per MoHFW guidelines," said the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-new-covid-strain-in-south-africa-who-to-call-meeting-uk-bans-flights-101637888437030.html

"We don't have anything to do with this."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-involvement-in-so-called-havana-syndrome-attacks-russia-101637886953037.html

In light of these abuses, we reiterate our call for all governments to revoke extradition treaties with the PRC and Hong Kong. Activists, dissidents and exiles living abroad must be protected from harassment and intimidation from the PRC authorities," the statement added.Earlier, parliamentarians and activists from around the world had launched a global campaign to oppose the candidacy of Hu Binchen, a Deputy Director General at China's Ministry of Public Security, to the Interpol Executive Committee.As many as 50 legislators, from 20 countries, who are part of the IPAC penned a joint letter to their governments raising alarm at China's moves to gain influence over the global policing body.The letter had references to recent attempts by the Chinese government to use the Interpol Red Notice system to target Uyghur activists living in exile and argues that Hu Binchen's election would give Beijing a 'green light' to continue using Interpol as "a vehicle for the PRC government's repressive policies."Separately, a letter from 40 activists to the Interpol Member States warning that Hu Binchen's election would have "grave consequences for the safety and wellbeing of Chinese, Hong Kongers, Taiwanese and Chinese human rights activists living outside China as well as Tibetan and Uyghur diasporas."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-global-concern-china-s-hu-binchen-wins-key-interpol-post-101637884802760.html
26-11-2021||World||Biden wishes Americans happy, closer-to-normal Thanksgiving||President Joe Biden on Thursday wished Americans a happy and closer-to-normal Thanksgiving, the second celebrated in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, in remarks welcoming the resumption of holiday traditions by millions of families — including his own.“As we give thanks for what we have, we also keep in our hearts those who have been lost and those who have lost so much,” the president said in a videotaped greeting recorded with first lady Jill Biden at the White House before their trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, for the holiday.On the island, the Bidens visited the Coast Guard station at Brant Point to meet virtually with US servicemembers from around the world and personnel at the station. "I’m not joking when I say I’m thankful for these guys," the president said when asked what he was thankful for, referring to the Coast Guard members standing ramrod straight before him on the grounds as he departed.Reporters were kept out of the room for Biden's virtual remarks, apparently because of tight space in the building. Well-wishers waved and cheered as Biden's motorcade navigated the island's narrow paved and cobblestone streets to and from the Coast Guard compound.Biden, whose late son Beau was a major in the Delaware Army National Guard, said he has watched US service members in action around the world, from the South China Sea and Iraq and Afghanistan to South America. He said when foreigners wonder what America is, “they don't see us here,” meaning civilians. “They see them,” he said of members of the Coast Guard and the other branches of the US military. “It makes me proud.”From Nantucket, the Bidens also called in to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, briefly bantering on air with NBC broadcaster Al Roker. Shut out a year ago, spectators again lined the route in Manhattan as some 8,000 participants joined the parade. Parade employees and volunteers had to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and wear masks.Biden and his wife started spending Thanksgiving in Nantucket since before they were married in 1977 because they were looking for a way out of choosing whose family to spend it with. They did not visit in 2015 following Beau's death earlier that year from brain cancer at age 46, or in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic put the kibosh on large family gatherings.Biden instead dined at home in Delaware last year with just his wife, daughter Ashley and her husband.But this year, the president joined the millions of Americans who are celebrating the holiday with big groups of loved ones. Biden's entire family flew up with him Tuesday night on Air Force One to resume the Thanksgiving tradition: his wife; son Hunter and his wife, Melissa and their toddler son Beau; daughter Ashley; and grandchildren Naomi, Finnegan, Maisy, Natalie and young Hunter, as well as Naomi's fiance, Peter Neal.Naomi Biden and her fiance rode bicycles along on a local path just before her grandfather's SUV departed the secluded home where the family is staying. The home belongs to David Rubenstein, a billionaire philanthropist and co-founder of the Carlyle Group private equity firm.Biden's visit, his first as president, is markedly different from his previous holidays here when he was a US senator and later vice president. Then, he might have been seen walking around downtown.Biden lost much of his freedom to move around on his own when he became president and now travels with a large group of security personnel, White House and other officials, and journalists. His every public move is closely watched by the US Secret Service and other law enforcement.Jill Biden was heard telling the Coast Guard members she would see them again Friday night at Nantucket's annual Christmas tree lighting, another Biden tradition.“We're all going together,” she said of her family. The tree lighting ceremony is where Beau Biden proposed to his wife, Hallie, in 2001. They were wed on the island the following year.Biden is expected to return to the White House on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-wishes-americans-happy-closer-to-normal-thanksgiving-101637879067873.html
26-11-2021||World||UK raises alarm over new Covid variant which could beat vaccines||Britain on Thursday said it was concerned by a newly identified coronavirus variant spreading in South Africa that might make vaccines less effective and imperil progress made across the world in fighting the pandemic.The UK Health Security Agency said that the variant - called B.1.1.529 - has a spike protein that was dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that Covid-19 vaccines are based on.Officials characterise the variant, which has double the number of mutations as the currently dominant Delta variant, as the "worst one yet".It was only first identified at the start of the week but Britain rushed to introduce travel restrictions on South Africa and five neighbouring countries, acting much more swiftly than with previous variants."What we do know is there's a significant number of mutations, perhaps double the number of mutations that we have seen in the Delta variant," Health Secretary Sajid Javid told broadcasters."And that would suggest that it may well be more transmissible and the current vaccines that we have may well be less effective."Britain announced it was temporarily banning flights from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini from 1200 GMT on Friday and returning British travellers from those destinations would have to quarantine.Javid said that more data was needed but the travel restrictions were necessary as a precaution, as scientists said lab studies were needed to assess the likelihood of the mutations resulting in greatly reduced vaccine efficacy.Officials have advised the government on the need to act swiftly and pre-emptively in case the concerns over the impact of variant are borne out, even though it could take weeks to generate all the information needed about its characteristics.Earlier on Thursday, South African scientists said they had detected the new Covid-19 variant in small numbers and were working to understand its potential implications.The variant has also been found in Botswana and Hong Kong, but the UK Health Security Agency said that no cases of the variant had been detected in Britain.“Early evidence from genomic surveillance in South Africa suggests that B.1.1.529 is a serious cause for concern," Ewan Birney, Deputy Director General of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, said."We know that early action is far better than late action. It may turn out that this variant is not as large a threat as Alpha and Delta, but the potential consequences of not acting on the possibility it could be are serious."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-raises-alarm-over-new-covid-variant-which-could-beat-vaccines-101637877988508.html

Holding colourful banners, they chanted slogans and vowed not give up on the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention.Riot police, who had set up barricades at the end of the street to prevent them from proceeding further, fired tear gas when a group of protesters tried to breach the barriers. At least one protester was injured, the Cumhuriyet newspaper reported.Similar protests were held in Ankara and other cities.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pulled Turkey out of the Convention with a surprise overnight decree in March, triggering condemnation from women's rights groups and Western countries. A court appeal to prevent the move was rejected and Turkey's withdrawal was formalized in July.Some officials from Erdogan's Islam-oriented party had called for a review of the agreement, arguing it was inconsistent with Turkey's conservative values.The government announced its own “Action Plan for Combating Violence against Women," including goals such as reviewing judicial processes, improving protection services and gathering data on violence.Human rights groups say violence against women is on the rise in Turkey.The advocacy group, We Will Stop Femicide, says 353 women have been murdered so far in Turkey in 2021, and 409 were killed last year. In October, 18 women were killed by men and 19 others were found dead under suspicious circumstances, according to the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-police-tear-gas-women-protesting-over-violence-101637875278585.html

Regional officials declared three days of mourning for the victims.Kemerovo governor Sergei Tsivilyov said 35 miners remained missing, and their exact location was unknown.Efforts to rescue those trapped in the mine about 250m underground were halted on Thursday afternoon because of an explosion threat, and rescuers were rushed out of the mine.The Interfax news agency reported that miners have oxygen supplies normally lasting for six hours that could be stretched for a few more hours but would have expired by late hours on Thursday anyway.Nearly 50 other miners were injured. A total of 285 people were in the Listvyazhnaya mine in the Kemerovo region in southwestern Siberia when the fire erupted and smoke quickly filled the mine through the ventilation system. Russia’s Investigative Committee has launched a criminal probe into the fire on charges of violating safety regulations that led to deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-killed-in-russia-coal-mine-fire-101637873839536.html

The army back to the barracks!” chanted protesters in Al Daim, a working class district of Khartoum. They called for justice for “martyrs” killed in earlier demonstrations.Protesters also closed a main road in the Sahafa neighbourhood of the capital.Carrying Sudanese flags, they chanted “Burhan you won’t rule. Down with military rule,” referring to Sudan’s military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.Live streams on social media also showed protests in cities including Port Sudan, Kassala, Wad Madani and El Geneina.43 dead in Darfur clashesAt least 43 people have been killed in days of fighting between herders in Sudan’s western Darfur region with more than a thousand homes set on fire.

Out of this amount, the addition of PKR 20.7 trillion is under the current government alone. The total debt and public debt of Pakistan has been deteriorating since the Imran Khan government has come into power, news agency ANI reported. The State Bank of Pakistan released the debt figures till September 2021, a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan described the increasing debt as a "national security issue", Express Tribune reported.Pakistan's total debt and liabilities jumped to the record PKR 50.5 trillion at the end of September 2021, an addition of PKR 20.7 trillion in the past 39 months. There was an increase of nearly 70 per cent in total debt of the country, Express Tribune reported.On Friday, Pakistan National Assembly was also informed that the country's public debt increased by ₹14.9 trillion from July 2018 to June 2021 by the Ministry for Finance and Revenue. In a written reply to a question, the house was informed that the exchange rate depreciation added around PKR 2.9 trillion (20 per cent of the increase) in public debt while the government paid PKR 7.5 trillion against interest servicing which is 50 per cent of the increase in the total public debt, reported The News International.According to The Express Tribune, the International Monetary Fund has also rejected Pakistan's request for borrowing and did not agree on any meaningful accountability of the State Bank of Pakistan. The report said that the central bank's profit would also not be transferred 100 per cent to the federal government until Pakistan's State Bank gets cover to back its monetary liabilities.According to the Tribune report, the ban on borrowing from the central bank has left the government at the mercy of commercial banks that have in recent weeks demanded an interest rate that is significantly higher than the key policy rate.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-debt-liabilities-cross-pkr-50-trillion-for-the-first-time-reports-101637861281397.html

Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Mizoram counterpart, Zoramthanga, agreed to hold discussions on the matter, in the presence of Union minister Amit Shah during a meeting in the national capital. “(It’s) heartening to share that I, along with honorable chief minister of Mizoram Zoramthanga, met honorable home minister Amit Shah this evening in New Delhi. We reaffirmed our resolve to maintain peace and tranquility at our borders,” Sarma tweeted after the meeting. “It has been decided that both the states will constitute committees for resolving the border disputes through discussions. Towards this end, chief minister level talks will also take place from time to time. We are grateful to union home minister for his kind guidance and support,” he added. There was no statement or comment from the Mizoram chief minister’s office at the time of filing this report. Earlier on Thursday, the chief ministers of the two states met over an informal dinner meeting in Delhi, for the first time since the July 26 clashes at Lailapur on the Assam-Mizoram border. Officials in the Assam chief minister’s office, who are familiar with the developments, said the details on the constitution of the committees will be disclosed at a later date. It is expected that they could be on the lines of similar panels formed by Assam and Meghalaya governments this year to address the border disputes between the two states.Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6km-long disputed border. In Mizoram’s side, the bordering districts are Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit, while in Assam’s side, the border-sharing districts are Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj. Police forces of the two states fought a pitched gun battle at a disputed border in southern Assam on July 26, in which six Assam policemen died. Assam claimed Mizoram police opened fire on its forces who objected to a road being constructed by Mizoram on a patch of forested land it claims. Mizoram claimed the land belongs to it.Tensions flared up immediately but eased after central intervention. Friday’s meeting was the first official one between the two chief ministers. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules Assam and the Mizo National Front, a part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance, is in power in Mizoram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-mizoram-ready-to-set-up-panel-to-solve-border-dispute-101637951207485.html
26-11-2021||India||Fresh rain alert for south-coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema district till December 2||Even as south-coastal and Rayalaseema districts of Andhra Pradesh are limping back to normal following last week’s torrential rain, the India Meteorological Department on Friday predicted more rainfall in the region till December 2.Scattered rainfall was reported in parts of Chittoor, including the temple town of Tirupati for a couple of hours on Friday morning with Nagari town bordering Tamil Nadu recording a maximum of 2 mm rainfall. The Tirupati International Airport at Renigunta also recorded scanty rainfall of 0.5 mm till Friday evening.A weather forecast bulletin, however, from the IMD Amaravati said heavy to very heavy rainfall may be witnessed in parts of Rayalaseema and south-coastal Andhra, particularly Chittoor and Nellore in the next three to four days. The state government has put the district authorities on high alert due to possible breach of tanks which are already filled to the brim due to recent heavy rains, leading to inundation of villages downstream.Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy told the state assembly on Friday that his government was taking up relief and rescue measures without delay in the flood-affected areas.Referring to last week’s floods in the state, he said Kadapa, Chittoor, Anantapur and Nellore districts were badly affected by heavy rain and floods like never before. He said that all the district authorities were involved in relief work and were being supervised by ministers and elected representatives of the respective areas.Reddy said the flash floods were caused due to unprecedented heavy rainfall in a short span of time, which led to the flooding of villages downstream of Pincha and Annamayya reservoirs on Cheyyeru following a breach in its bund. In a span of a few hours, almost 51 mandals of Kadapa district received an average rainfall of 10.7 cm. Heavy rain also lashed Seshachalam Hills in Tirupati and other parts of Chittoor district.“By the wee hours of November 19, the inflows to Annamayya reservoir crossed 3.2 lakh cusecs, while its discharge capacity was only 2.17 lakh cusecs, which resulted in a breach to the project, causing unfortunate damage. The officials have alerted the villages and immediately taken over the rescue operations by shifting 400 families to safe places and providing shelter to 900 people in relief camps, saving hundreds of people with their efforts,” he said.A total of 1990 villages in 119 mandals of four districts were affected by the floods, of which 211 villages were completely inundated leading to a death toll of 44 people while 16 are still missing. The CM said that 1169 houses were completely damaged and 5434 houses were partially damaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-rain-alert-for-south-coastal-andhra-rayalaseema-district-till-december-2-101637950907775.html
26-11-2021||India||Blacklist illegal miners in Goa: Green NGOs write to Centre||A group of environmental NGOs including the Goa Foundation, Common Cause, Mineral Inheritors Rights’ Association and others have written to the Union government seeking to blacklist those involved in ‘illegal mining’ from taking part in auctions and those offences be treated at par with offences under other economic laws such as FERA. “Misappropriation of the shared inheritance of mineral wealth, anyone convicted for illegal mining should be disqualified under a variety of laws, including the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and the Economic Offences (Inapplicability of Limitation) Act, 1974,” the NGOs said in their letter to Union Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi and Comptroller and Auditor General Girish Chandra Murmu The demand is significant especially since the Goa government has indicated it is willing to for the first time begin auctions to grant new leases to help restart mining in the state that has been stalled since the Supreme Court rejected lease renewals by the Goa government in March 2018. The Goa Foundation has said that it is eager to ensure that those involved in illegal mining are not allowed to participate in auctions to acquire fresh leases. “With the rise of illegal miners in the country, there are no adequate mechanisms to hold them accountable and undertake stringent actions such as blacklisting them from any mining activity. Any one violation whether it is economic, environmental, or social by the entity must be a good enough reason to disqualify the miners on the basis of questionable integrity and they should be prevented from managing our shared inheritance of mineral wealth,” the NGOs said. “The government instead of using a fit and proper test to screen mining companies and pre-empting illegal mining in the first place has changed the definition of illegality. This has emboldened all illegal miners...”, Sreedhar Ramamurthi, Managing Trustee of the Environics Trust said.“Illegal mining has been associated with terrorism finance within India. Illegal mining under the MMDR Act must be included in Part A of the Schedule of the PMLA,” the organisations said in their letter. The NGOs have pointed out that under the IBC, 2016 those convicted of any offence are punishable by imprisonment for two or more years under any Act specified in the Twelfth Schedule which includes most economic laws but does not include the Mines and Minerals Development Act. “The MMDR Act must be included in the Twelfth Schedule of the IBC,” the NGOs have demanded. Earlier this week, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant announced that the state government had roped in State Bank of India to help auction a bunch of leases that were being auctioned via the newly created Goa Mineral Development Corporation to help restart mining. The Supreme Court in 2108 ruled that if mining in Goa is to restart, fresh leases will have to be given along with fresh environmental clearances and not renewals of existing leases. The mining industry was a major revenue and employment generator for the state and at its peak contributed close to 15% of the state’s GDP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blacklist-illegal-miners-in-goa-green-ngos-write-to-centre-101637949410260.html
26-11-2021||India||Despite govt schemes, NFHS-5 says Odisha’s child sex ratio is dropping||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha’s child sex ratio has plummeted to its lowest ever, according to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) that reported 894 female children for every 1000 males despite central and state government initiatives for the girl child. In 2015-16, the child sex ratio in Odisha was estimated at 932.Child sex ratio is defined as the number of girls per 1000 boys between 0-6 years of age is considered a strong indicator of social health. The adverse sex ratios not only indicate poor social health, but also a barrier to attaining sustainable social development.Odisha health secretary RK Sharma and woman child development secretary Anu Garg did not comment on the NFHS-5 findings.The NFHS-5 was conducted on population, health, and nutrition across the country. Due to the Covid-19 situation and the lockdown that followed, NFHS-5 fieldwork in Odisha was conducted in two phases -January 19, 2020, to March 21, 2020, prior to the lockdown and November 30, 2020, to March 31, 2021, post lockdown by the Indian Institute of Health Management Research. The findings are based on a survey of 26,467 households, 27,971 women, and 3,865 men.According to the NFHS-5, the decline in the child sex ratio was reported from urban and rural areas. In urban areas, the ratio declined from 966 in 2015-16 to 950 in 2020-21 in urban areas. In rural areas, the ratio dropped from 926 in 2015-16 to 855 in 2020-21.However, the overall sex ratio rose from 1,036 in 2015-16 to 1063 in 2020-21.Professor Sanjukta Das of Sambalpur University who has researched the declining child sex ratio of Odisha said it showed patriarchal mindset continues to prevail in the state.“While states such as Haryana, UP and Rajasthan showed an appreciable rise in child sex ratio in last 5 years, the same is on a downward spiral in Odisha. This shows that rising literacy and the latest technology is used by parents to eliminate the possibility of the birth of a girl child. If we continue like this, then only God can save us,” said Das.The declining child sex ratio in Odisha in NFHS-5 for the first time put it below the national average of 929, which has increased by 10 points since NFHS-4.The child sex ratio of Odisha since 1961 has always been better than the national average. In the 1961 census, Odisha’s ratio was 1,035 which declined to 1,020 in 1971, 995 in 1981, 967 in 1991, 953 in 2001 and 941 in 2011.Woman activist Pramila Swain of the National Alliance of Woman said policy measures such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao or Biju Kanya Ratna Yojana of Naveen Patnaik government have largely failed on the ground. “These policies have not been able to change the mindset of parents who continue to opt for boys over girls. The state has also failed to strictly implement the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994,” said Swain.In 2016-17, the Naveen Patnaik government had launched the Biju Kanya Ratna Yojana in the districts of Angul, Dhenkanal and Ganjam infamous for low child sex ratios. The scheme aimed at providing elementary education to girls, improving their access to education, reducing the school drop-out ratio of girls from schools, sensitising adolescent girls on sexual and reproductive health issues and training elected representatives and grassroots functionaries as community champions to mobilise communities to improve the sex ratio.Nutritionist Basant Kar said the rise of anaemia among children in the 6 months to 6 years age group from 44.6 in NFHS-4 to 64.2 in NFHS-5 was also a reason for the declining child sex ratio. “In rural areas as well as urban areas, the girls would be the most discriminated when it comes to food and this is the reason for rising anaemia,” said Kar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-govt-schemes-nfhs-5-says-odisha-s-child-sex-ratio-is-dropping-101637947128129.html

In Israel, vaccine effectiveness after the booster dose rose from 40% to 93%,” the senior doctor said.His remarks came at a time health experts across the world are scrambling to study the new variant of Covid-19 that has been detected in South Africa.“The new variant is supposed to be more effective and transmissible with less neutralisation with antibodies. So we have to understand that new variants will keep coming. Universal vaccination is the most important thing,” the doctor added.On Tuesday, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said no booster dose for coronavirus infection is required in the country at present as he hailed the ongoing nationwide vaccination drive in the country.Also read | Coronavirus: Will booster shots be the new normal?Earlier, other experts have also maintained that India cannot afford to administer booster shots yet as only about 35 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated against the Covid-19 disease.Many countries across the world are administering booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine, including the US, Germany, Austria, Canada and France among others. A booster dose is administered to a vaccinated person when the rate of immunity in them has dropped below the required levels over a period of time.India reported 10,549 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the caseload to 3,45,55,431, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare.

This Court had directed unhindered access to media at polling booths. But what we saw was absolute mayhem. Our candidates were not allowed to enter polling booths to cast votes, no central armed paramilitary forces (CAPF) were available and the ‘two constables to each candidate’ rule was flouted. This is not done. It is complete violation of this court’s order. It is a very serious situation and we require an urgent hearing.”The matter was mentioned before a bench headed by Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud as the order for additional deployment of CAPF and unhindered media access was passed on Thursday by a three-judge bench headed by him, the other two being Justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath. Justice Chandrachud told Sibal that since the remaining two judges were not sitting with him on Friday; it will be difficult to take up the matter.When Sibal requested for a special sitting on Saturday, the judge said he would consult the other two judges and seek their availability.On Thursday, polls were held to nearly 334 seats in the urban local bodies, which include 13 municipal councils, six nagar panchayats and 51 wards of the Agartala Municipal Corporation.Considering allegations of unabated violence in the state against AITC workers and candidates, the top court directed the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to provide additional two companies of CAPFs till the date of counting of votes in addition to the presence of the Central Reserve Police Force, border security force and Tripura state rifles, already deployed for law and order and securing polling booths. In addition, the SC bench directed the state police chief and home secretary to review the security arrangements and asked the Centre to provide for more forces, if needed. The matter was posted for December 2 by the Court to consider compliance of its directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-alleges-violation-of-sc-order-at-tripura-polls-101637945206667.html

Chief Ministers of both the north-eastern states took the step following a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. On Thursday, both Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga had interacted in Delhi over an informal dinner meeting—the first interaction between both leaders since the July 26 clashes at Lailapur on the Assam-Mizoram border. “(It’s) heartening to share that I along with honourable Chief Minister of Mizoram Zoramthanga, met honourable home minister Amit Shah this evening in New Delhi. We reaffirmed our resolve to maintain peace and tranquillity at our borders,” Sarma tweeted after the meeting. “It has been decided that both the states will constitute committees for resolving the border disputes through discussions. Towards this end, chief minister level talks will also take place from time to time. We are grateful to Union home minister for his kind guidance and support,” he added. There was no statement or comment from the Mizoram CM’s office till the filing of this report. Sources at the Assam CM’s office said that details on constitution of the committees will be disclosed at a later date. It is expected that they could be on the lines of similar committees formed by Assam and Meghalaya governments this year to address the border dispute between the two states. Assam and Meghalaya have formed three committees comprising ministers, bureaucrats and stakeholders of both states to resolve disputes at 6 of the 12 border points of contention between the two neighbours. The committees, which visited each disputed site, are to file their reports by November 30. Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6 km long inter-state border and there has been a long-standing dispute on the exact boundary. On Mizoram’s side the border districts are Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit, while on Assam’s side, the border sharing districts are Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj. After the firing between the police of both the states at Cachar’s Lailapur on July 26 this year, there were several rounds of talks between both states under the Central government’s intervention, but Friday’s meeting was the first official one between the two chief ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-meeting-amit-shah-assam-mizoram-to-form-panels-to-solve-border-row-101637942986731.html

No casualties have been reported, he added.North Central Railway spokesperson Manoj Kumar Singh said the fire prima facie appears to have started due to a short circuit in a bathroom. An inquiry has been ordered by the divisional railway manager into the incident.Railway officials in Jhansi said the fire started at about 3.30pm. Attempts were made on the train to extinguish the fire. About 15 minutes later, it was stopped at the Hetampur railway station. The train eventually left at 5.53pm and three coaches were added at Gwalior for the remaining 1,000km journey to Durg in Chhattisgarh, its final destination.Passengers said the fire, which started around a bathroom in A2 coach, was spotted much before it spread but the fire extinguishers located by the attendants and passengers didn’t work..Asked about the allegation, the North Central Railway spokesperson said: “Passengers were claiming this but attendants didn’t inform about it. An inquiry will be held in this matter.”The attendants tried to douse the fire but the fire extinguishers didn’t work... it turned into a massive fire,” said a passenger from Chhattisgarh who requested anonymity. The passenger said the fire spread to A1 and A2 coaches within just about 15 minutes. Ashwini Kashyap, who was travelling with his family in A1 coach, said, “The fire could have been controlled in time but the fire extinguishers didn’t work. Later, we broke the windows, threw out our luggage and ran out.” Dr Ghanshyam Parte, who was travelling in the adjoining coach, said some people also fainted, possibly due to panic. “The smoke was engulfing the bogies but passengers and railway officials broke the glass windows. Passengers were shifted swiftly to other coaches before detaching the affected bogies, he said.The fire was eventually put out by a team of police and firefighters, the Morena district police chief Shakyawar said. Local residents and villagers also helped out the passengers with food and water.An emergency medical train from Agra and Gwalior also reached the spot. The coaches were later inspected by a Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) and forensic team to rule out mischief.(With inputs from Haider Naqvi in Kanpur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fire-breaks-out-in-udhampur-durg-express-train-2-ac-coaches-gutted-passengers-safe-101637941007597.html

Addressing at the Central Hall of Parliament, PM Modi slammed the family-run parties of the country, while in the evening as he spoke at Vigyan Bhavan, he criticised the colonial mindset.Here are the top quotes of the Prime Minister on the occasion of Constitution Day.> Our constitution is not just a collection of many articles, it is the great tradition of millennia. What if we were supposed to write the Constitution today! Could we have written even one page of the Constitution!> When a political party loses its own democratic character, how can it protect democracy?> Today, look at every corner of India. The country is moving towards a crisis that should worry every individual who respects the Constitution and that comes from dynastic parties.Undemocratic, family-run party system is not in tune with the Constitution: PM Modi> Political parties – party for the family, party by the family, and do I need to elaborate. This is against the principles of the Constitution, quite opposite to what the Constitution tells us.> A party run by one family, generation after generation, the family controlling every aspect of the party, is the biggest threat to a healthy democracy. If more than one person from a family enters politics based on merit and blessings, then that is not dynastic politics.> I remember when I was addressing the House in 2015 on BR Ambedkar’s 125th anniversary and made this announcement of observing November 26 as Constitution Day, even then there was resistance. Where did you bring November 26 from? Why are you doing this, what was the need? This country is not ready to listen to such things where Ambedkar’s name is attached. And even now, to not commemorate this occasion it is a matter of concern,”> Due to colonial mindset, obstacles are put in the development of our own country, including in name of freedom of expression. Roadblocks are being created on the path of growth of developing nations due to the colonial mindset.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-party-for-the-family-to-colonial-mindset-pm-modi-s-top-quotes-on-constitution-day-101637939446879.html

Store and fuel station owners and operators were also asked to check vaccination certificates of people.The orders came after the vaccination figures in the region were found to be low.Besides, the collector wrote to the treasury officer instructing him to stop salaries and other fund sanctions for November of employees who have not taken a single dose of vaccine and presented a certificate for the same.Earlier, eight districts in Maharashtra, including Aurangabad, Nandurbar, Buldhana, Hingoli, Nanded, Beed, Amravati and Akola, were identified as laggards with respect to the pace of inoculation drive.India reported 10,549 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the caseload to 3,45,55,431, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare.As many as 488 patients died and 9,868 recovered from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll and total recoveries to 467,468 and 33,977,830.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-now-hingoli-in-maharashtra-adopts-no-vaccine-no-fuel-policy-to-boost-drive-101637939648435.html
26-11-2021||India||India-Russia 2+2 dialogue to be held on margins of Modi-Putin summit on Dec 6||India and Russia announced on Friday they will hold the maiden 2+2 dialogue of their defence and foreign ministers on the margins of the annual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin in New Delhi on December 6. This will only be Putin’s second foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak began – he travelled to Geneva in June for his first meeting with US President Joe Biden. Putin’s decision to travel to New Delhi reflects the importance attached by Russia to its special and privileged strategic partnership with India. This will be the 21st annual summit between the two sides, though the meeting could not be held last year because of the pandemic. It comes at a time when the Russian leadership is wary about India’s increasingly stronger ties with the US, while the Indian side has been upset by a perceived uptick in Pakistan-Russia relations. “The leaders will review the state and prospects of bilateral relations and discuss ways to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries. The summit will afford an opportunity to exchange views on regional, multilateral and international issues of mutual interest,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that Putin plans to discuss further development of bilateral ties. The leaders will exchange views on topical global issues, including working jointly within G20, Brics and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), it said. The last annual summit was held during Modi’s visit to Vladivostok in September 2019. This will also be the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since their discussions on the margins of the Brics Summit in Brasilia in November 2019. Modi and Putin had agreed during a telephone conversation on April 28 to launch a 2+2 dialogue. India currently has 2+2 ministerial dialogues only with Australia, Japan and the US. The agenda for the inaugural India-Russia 2+2 dialogue on December 6 will cover political and defence issues, the external affairs ministry said. Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar will represent the Indian side. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and defence minister Sergey Shoigu will visit New Delhi during December 5-6 for the dialogue. “The establishment of a new mechanism of 2+2 dialogue is expected to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries,” the external affairs ministry said. The Russian side said the 2+2 dialogue is expected to focus on key regional and international topics, including the “situation in the Asia-Pacific region and developments on Afghanistan and Syria”. The ministers will also exchange views on interaction within SCO and the Russia-India-China (RIC) mechanism. Putin’s visit and the 2+2 dialogue are under considerable scrutiny as they are coinciding with the delivery by Russia of the first squadron of S-400 air defence systems. Russian officials said in mid-November that deliveries of the S-400 systems have begun and are proceeding on schedule. The two countries signed a $5.4-billion contract for five S-400 systems during Putin’s last visit to India in October 2018. India has signalled its determination to go ahead with the deal despite the US warning it could attract secondary sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). India and Russia are expected to renew their military-technical cooperation arrangement for 2021-31 and sign several defence-related agreements during the summit. A key pact is the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), which will allow militaries of the two sides to access logistics at each other’s bases. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing that defence cooperation is an important part of the India-Russia relationship but declined to comment on specific deals. “Regarding the CAATSA waiver, India and the US have a comprehensive global strategic partnership, and India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia. We also pursue an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defence acquisitions and supplies, which are guided by our national security interests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiarussia-2-2-dialogue-to-be-held-on-margins-of-modi-putin-summit-on-dec-6-101637939326014.html

Several prominent Twitter handles including BJP leader CT Ravi shared the old video of Singh and said the Congress was responsible for the Mumbai terror attack. "The blood of innocent lives is on the hands of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Never forgive, never forget!" the BJP leader wrote. The Karnataka BJP handle also shared a news clipping of 2008 which claimed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was in 'party mood soon after Mumbai crisis'. BJP leader Amit Malviya too shared the news clipping. If anyone still believes there is anything Indian left in CONgress, watch this video.You will realise that CONgress always served the interests of Pakistan.#MumbaiTerrorAttack pic.twitter.com/it10FSBJNJWhat is the old video of Digvijaya Singh about? In the video, Digviajaya Singh can be heard talking about a book. He said, "Nowhere in the book, there is mention of the involvement of Pakistani terrorists in 26/11." The video also contains a statement of Mahesh Bhatt.This rakes up an old controversy regarding 26/11 over Digvijaya Singh's past comments in which he reportedly attempted to link Maharashtra ATS chief Hemant Karkare's death during the 26/11 terror attack to some alleged threats he apparently received from a Hindu outfit. At that time, Digvijaya stirred a row by saying that two hours before the terrorist attack, Karkare told Singh that he was received threats by 'Hindu extremist' groups who were opposed to the ATS probe into the 2008 Malegaon blast.The book which was launched by Digvijaya Singh and Mahesh Bhatt was a controversial one as it blamed RSS for the terror attack. Written by Aziz Burnet, '26/11: RSS ki Sazish' put the responsibility of the terror attack on CIA, Mossad and RSS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-this-old-video-of-congress-leader-digvijaya-singh-is-viral-today-101637937236824.html

The ministry of consumer affairs, food & public distribution stated that the arrival of tomatoes is expected to be at par with last year which could bring much-needed relief to consumers.As of Thursday, the average retail price of tomatoes was at ₹67 per kilogram, 63% higher than last year. The ministry pointed towards the delayed arrivals of tomatoes from north Indian states followed by heavy rains in the southern part of the country which disrupted the supply chain and damaged the crop as well.“The all-India average retail price of Tomato has been on the rise from the end of September 2021 due to unseasonal rains in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh which led to crop damage and delay in arrival from these Sates,” the ministry said, adding that slight disruptions in the supply chain or damage due to heavy rains results in a spurt in prices.Tomato price hike sparks meme fest. Posts leave people teary-eyed, with laughterAs per the government’s estimate, the Kharif production this year stood at 69.52 lakh metric tonnes, marginally less than 70.12 lakh metric tonnes produced last year. The arrivals in November, however, were only 19.62 lakh metric tonnes this year as compared to 21.32 lakh metric tonnes in 2020.“Tomato arrivals from North Indian States will start from the beginning of December itself, which will add to availability and lead to fall in prices. In December, arrival is expected to be at par with last year,” the ministry added.The price rise of onion, meanwhile, substantially subsided in October. According to the ministry, the all-India average retail price of Onion as of Thursday was at ₹39 per kilogram, 32% lower than last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tomato-price-expected-to-fall-in-december-with-pick-up-in-arrivals-govt-101637936826104.html
26-11-2021||India||Nitish Kumar backs PM Modi on swipe at dynastic parties||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comment attacking “dynastic parties” and said these parties had no meaning in the electoral space.The Bihar CM said concerns expressed by the Prime Minister were absolutely correct. “Family parties may get a lot in the present time, but they have no future,” he said, without naming any particular party.Kumar was addressing the media on the sidelines of a programme organised at Gyan Bhawan in Patna on the occasion of drug de-addiction day. “Nowadays, some parties are running on the same lines, but all this will not work in the coming days,” he reiterated.There are a number of parties in Bihar centred around a family, including Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and factions of the Lok Janshakti Party founded by former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan.Earlier, on Friday morning, Kumar once again administered oath to people to abstain from alcohol. Reiterating his resolve that there was no going back on the issue of the liquor ban in Bihar imposed in April 2016, Kumar also took a dig at those who were attacking the government over hooch deaths. “Do they mean to suggest that they should drink good liquor? The liquor prohibition law was passed unanimously in Bihar,” he said.Citing recent figures, he said, “Today, 43% of men are giving more time to agriculture, 83% women’s saving and income have increased.Kumar also promised to take strict action against officers who go easy on implementing the liquor ban in place in the state.Asked about a recent raid at a hotel where a marriage was being solemnized, the CM said that the police could go anywhere on the basis of information. “Everyone will be investigated under the rule. It is not necessary that every information is correct,” he said while defending the police action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-backs-pm-modi-on-swipe-at-dynastic-parties-101637935306956.html
26-11-2021||India||Narayan Rane says MVA govt will collapse by March. Nawab Malik replies||Maharashtra firebrand minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik on Friday replied to BJP leader Narayan Rane's prediction that BJP will form the government in Maharashtra in March and said the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance is not for five years, but for 25 years. "First, Devendra Fadnavis had the responsibility of predicting the collapse of the MVA government. Then Chandrakant Patil took the responsibility. None of their predictions came true. And now Narayan Rane has taken up the job," Nawab Malik said."Narayan Rane was the chief minister of Maharashtra 23 years ago. He went to the Congress to get the Chief Minister's post. Then he switched to the BJP. His followers must have raised thousands of goats and hens praying for his CM ship. But a government can't be wished away like that -- through predictions, dreams, prayers," Nawab Malik said."Chief Minister said earlier the alliance in Maharashtra is not for five years, but for 25 years. And we will complete 25 years because people have confidence in us. Earlier, BJP national president said teh government will be ousted. Government can neither be ousted nor be set up, A government is formed through people's choice. Our MLAs will not get scared. BJP must understand that people of Maharashtra will choose us time and again," the minister said.Narayan Rane's comments on Friday triggered speculation as Fadnavis, Chandrakant Patil, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and NCP leader Praful Patel were in Delhi. Dismissing reports of cracks in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the recent past, all partners of the alliance vowed to have a commitment to the alliance.Following Narayan Rane's ominous prediction as he was asked the details, he said toppling and forming governments is done in secrecy and it can not be discussed in public. "Uddhav Thackeray is unwell, so I don't want to talk about him... But the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi govt will not be surviving for long in Maharashtra," Rane said.Like the NCP, the Congress too dismissed speculations of any rift in the alliance. Then why are NCP and BJP leaders are in Delhi at the same time? According to reports, Fadnavis and Patil are in Delhi to discuss "organisational matters" with the central leadership. Sharad Pawar travelled to Delhi to attend a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on defense and his schedule had been planned a week ago, an NCP source said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-wish-nawab-malik-replies-to-narayan-rane-s-mva-will-collapse-in-march-comment-101637933373387.html

Speaking at Vigyan Bhavan on the occasion of Constitution Day, Modi said hundreds of years of dependence had pushed India into several problems.“The India that was once called a golden bird was suffering from poverty, starvation and diseases. In that background, the Constitution always helped us in taking forward the nation,” he added.“Our Constitution drafters gave us the Constitution in the light of the dreams seen by the people who lived and died for the independence and by cherishing the thousands of years long great traditions of India,” he said.Also read | In his Constitution Day address, PM Modi targets family-ruled partiesHe said when compared to other countries that became independent around the same time as India, they are way ahead of us today. “It means that a lot of things still need to be done. We have to reach the goal together,” he added.The reality is that even after decades post-Independence, a large section of people in the country had to suffer exclusion. "Crores of such people did not even have a toilet at their house. They were living in the dark in the absence of electricity, without water," he said.Also read | On Constitution Day, PM Modi shares part of Ambedkar’s speech in Constituent Assembly“Investing oneself in understanding their problems, their pain to make their lives easier - I consider this the real honour of the Constitution. I'm satisfied that in line with this sentiment of the Constitution, a vigorous drive is going on to convert exclusion into inclusion,” the PM added.He said that while no nation directly exists as a colony of another country, but it does not mean the colonial mindset has come to an end. “This mindset is giving rise to many distortions. We can see a clear example of this in the hurdles cropping up in the journey of developing nations,” the PM added.Modi further said attempts are made to shut the path and resources for developing nations through which developed nations reached where they are today. “In the past decades, a web of different terminologies was spun for this. But the aim has always been one to stop the progress of developing nations,” he said.The issue of environment is also being attempted to be hijacked for this purpose. “We saw an example of this in the recent COP-26 Summit. If we talk of absolute cumulative emissions, developed nations have caused 15 per cent more emissions than India since 1850 to date.”“Still, India is lectured on environmental conservation - that India that has living with nature embedded in its tradition, where God is seen even in plants, where the land is worshipped as the mother. For us, these values are not just confined to books," the PM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitution-helped-take-india-forward-but-a-lot-still-needs-to-be-done-pm-modi-101637932742942.html
26-11-2021||India||Working on modalities with Pakistan for shipping wheat to Afghan people: India||India said on Friday it is working out modalities with Pakistan for transporting 50,000 tonnes of wheat and medicines as humanitarian aid to Afghanistan via land routes but insisted that no conditions should be attached by the Pakistani side. India made the proposal for shipping the wheat and life-saving medicines to the people of Afghanistan via Pakistani soil on October 7, and received an assurance from the Pakistan government only on November 24; external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing.He made it clear that no conditions should be attached by Pakistan to the shipment of the humanitarian assistance. “This was about humanitarian access into Afghanistan for the delivery of the 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines we are supplying to the people of Afghanistan,” he said. “We are examining the response of the government of Pakistan. We are also working on the modalities with the Pakistan side. We believe that humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionalities,” he added. India has always stood by the people of Afghanistan for both humanitarian support and development assistance, Bagchi said. Pakistan formally informed India on Wednesday that it would allow the shipment of the wheat and medicines to Afghanistan via the Wagah land border as a goodwill gesture to the Afghan people. There are currently no flights between India and Afghanistan, and transporting the materials via Pakistan was seen as the quickest way of getting the aid to Afghanistan, which is on the brink of a looming humanitarian crisis. Even a Taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi that recently visited Islamabad had raised the issue of allowing the shipment of the wheat with the top Pakistani leadership. Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday his government would allow the transportation of the wheat as soon as modalities were finalised by Islamabad and New Delhi. The UN has warned up to 23 million Afghans will be in “crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity” as winter approaches. Ten out of 11 of Afghanistan’s most densely populated urban areas are now anticipated to be at emergency levels of food insecurity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-on-modalities-with-pakistan-for-shipping-wheat-to-afghan-people-india-101637932305125.html
26-11-2021||India||India allows scheduled international flights from Dec 15. Some restrictions apply||NEW DELHI: India will allow scheduled international flights to all countries from December 15, according to an official order issued by the civil aviation directorate on Friday. Scheduled international passenger flights to and from India were suspended in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The matter has been reviewed and the competent authority has decided to resume the scheduled commercial international passenger services to/from India with effect from 15 December 2021,” the order by the office of Director General of Civil Aviation said.HT has reviewed the order.Indians are currently flying to and from India currently under air bubble arrangements that allow passengers of two countries to fly with some restrictions. India has air-bubble pacts with 28 countries, including the US, UK, UAE and France.From December 14 midnight, this arrangement will come to an end.“Resumption of scheduled commercial international passenger services with effect from 15 December, 2021 would imply reversion to bilaterally agreed capacity entitlements and termination of air bubble arrangements. However, due to prevailing Covid-19 situation, the capacity entitlements shall be as per the category of countries based on enlistment of countries as “at-risk” from time to time by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW),” the document said.Flights to countries that are not classified as “at-risk” can resume to full capacity entitlement according to the bilateral air service agreements.Europe including the UK and other 13 countries - South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel - are currently classified as “at-risk” by the Union health ministry.Flights to these “at-risk” countries can resume to 75% of the full capacity entitlements under bilateral air service agreements if there is an air bubble agreement with the foreign country. At least seven flights a week would be allowed.In case of “at-risk” countries with whom India did not have an air bubble agreement, only 50% of pre-Covid operations of Indian or foreign carrier, or 50% of bilateral capacity entitlements will be allowed.Earlier this week, Bansal spoke about resuming scheduled international flights “very soon” amid a continuing fall in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country -- currently, daily cases are the lowest since last June -- riding vaccinations, and swelling domestic air passenger traffic, now up to almost pre-pandemic levels of 400,000 a day. “Normalisation of international operations is expected to resume, very soon, by the end of the calendar year,” he said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-allows-scheduled-international-flights-from-dec-15-some-restrictions-apply-101637931465194.html

It has produced more than 1.25 billion doses so far.The move also comes as countries in Asia and Europe tighten border controls after the discovery of a new coronavirus variant in South Africa that scientists say could resist vaccines.SII said its supply of doses through COVAX was expected to increase substantially into the first quarter of 2022.It will bring into production other vaccines under licence, including COVOVAX from US-based Novavax, to boost its output.Earlier this month, Reuters had reported India could resume deliveries of COVID-19 shots to COVAX in a few weeks.SII Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla told Reuters last month his company was expecting to export 20-30 million Covishield doses to COVAX in November and an equal amount in December, with volumes set to increase from January once India's own needs were close to being fully met.As per government records, 82% of the country's population has received the first dose, while the second dose coverage is at 43%.The organisations running COVAX had said in September that the global programme providing Covid-19 vaccines to poor countries was on course to fall nearly 30% short of its previous goal of 2 billion shots this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-of-india-resumes-exports-of-covishield-vaccine-to-covax-facility-101637930981524.html
26-11-2021||India||Delhi resident moves top court, seeks compensation for hate crimes||The victim of a hate crime in Uttar Pradesh has moved the Supreme Court to demand compensation for victims of hate crimes and seek punitive action against police personnel who refused to register a case and instead put pressure on the victim to withdraw complaint.The petition filed by 62-year-old Kazeem Ahmed Sherwani, a resident of Delhi’s Zakir Nagar alleged that on July 4, while waiting for an Aligarh-bound bus at Noida Section 37, he was offered a free ride by a group of men who abused, harassed and tortured him in the car they were travelling in due to his Muslim identity. When he went with a complaint to the nearby police station in Noida, no complaint was registered as the police dissuaded him from pursuing the case.The petition also sought damages for the alleged police misconduct and demanded a victim compensation scheme for persons affected by incidents of similar hate crimes.On Friday, a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar allowed a copy of the petition to be served to the counsel for state of Uttar Pradesh and directed the matter to be heard along with petitions raising similar issues of guidelines against hate speech that is listed before the Chief Justice of India (CJI) on December 3.The petitioner was represented by senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi who informed the Court about the plight of the petitioner.“If hate crimes are permitted to occur with impunity, and without prompt legal action, the promise of the Constitution makers will be broken,” the petition filed through advocate Talha Abdul Rehman said. “This is not a lone case, but one of several cases where similar hate crimes, including public beatings and lynching, have taken place across several states, but where victims have been discouraged , without even a preliminary investigation, to frame the offence as a ‘hate crime, and the police have discouraged them from filing FIRs,” the petition added.The petitioner urged the Court for a fair and impartial investigation into his complaint and demanded that the Delhi Police provide him with security as on many instances in the past, the Uttar Pradesh police had harassed him for pursuing the complaint. After the UP police refused to register his complaint, the petitioner approached the national human rights commission (NHRC), following which he was asked by the police to submit his complaint. He gave a written complaint to the Noida police on July 31. They noted his complaint but suggested he was “politicizing” a non-issue, the petition said.The petition cited a 2018 judgment of the SC in the Tehseen Poonawala case where the top court laid down guidelines for dealing with instances of mob lynching and hate crimes. The petitioner demanded that the UP Police should submit an action taken report on his complaint in compliance with the 2018 decision which placed a “duty of care” on police. Further, he asked for damages and punitive action against the police personnel who refused to act in accordance with the 2018 judgment.“The petitioner was attacked because of his beard, and ostensible Muslim identity. The incident of that day has left the petitioner and his family completely traumatized, because it attacked their very identity as equal citizens of this country,” the petition said. The attack, according to him, besides harming the fundamental right to equality (Article 14) and liberty (Article 21), also violated the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion under Article 25, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-resident-moves-top-court-seeks-compensation-for-hate-crimes-101637930745212.html

They were followed by Madhya Pradesh and Meghalaya in the index.According to the report, 51.91 per cent of the population in Bihar is poor, followed by 42.16 in Jharkhand, 37.79 per cent in Uttar Pradesh, 36.65 per cent in Madhya Pradesh and 32.67 per cent in Meghalaya.Among Union territories, Dadra and Nagar Haveli ( 27.36 per cent), Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh (12.58), Daman & Diu (6.82 per cent) and Chandigarh (5.97 per cent) have emerged as the poorest in the country.Puducherry, with 1.72 per cent of its population as poor, Lakshadweep (1.82 per cent ), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (4.30 per cent) and Delhi (4.79 per cent) have fared better.States that have registered lowest poverty across the country are Kerala with only 0.71 per cent of its population falling in that category, followed by Goa (3.76 per cent), Sikkim (3.82 per cent), Tamil Nadu (4.89 per cent) and Punjab (5.59 per cent).The highest number of malnourished people have been reported in Bihar, followed by Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.Bihar also ranked at the bottom in various other categories, including percentage of population deprived of maternal health, percentage of population deprived of years of schooling, school attendance and percentage of population deprived of cooking fuel and electricity."The development of the National Multidimensional Poverty Index of India is an important contribution towards instituting a public policy tool which monitors multidimensional poverty, informs evidence-based and focused interventions, thereby ensuring that no one is left behind," said Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar in his foreword.According to a PTI report, Kumar further said this baseline report of India's first ever national MPI measure is based on the reference period of 2015-16 of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).The national MPI measure has been constructed by utilising 12 key components which cover areas such as health and nutrition, education and standard of living, he said.The report said the national MPI, an aggregate measure which defines poverty, in simple terms, as the deprivation in crucial and basic parameters of health, education, and living standards, is a significant departure from the way poverty has been understood and conceptualised historically.In early 2020, the Cabinet Secretariat had identified 29 global indices to monitor, analyse and evaluate with the aim of improving India's position in global rankings.Under this mandate, also known as the Global Indices for Reforms and Growth (GIRG) mandate, Niti Aayog was identified as the nodal agency for the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-poorest-state-followed-by-jharkhand-and-up-niti-aayog-report-101637929691488.html
26-11-2021||India||Why India will resume restricted flight services in these 14 countries. Explained||As India decides to resume regular international flight operations from December 15 after a gap of around 20 months, the ministry has come up with a list of countries where ‘regular flight operations’ will not begin.  Regular flight operations mean pre-Covid flight operations. Flight operations will be allowed to some level in these 14 countries, the civil aviation ministry said on Friday. The decision to resume the international flight services as well as to keep these 14 countries on the restricted list has been taken in consultation with the health ministry, people familiar with the development said.Which are the countries where India is not resuming ‘regular flight operations’?UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Finland, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Singapore are the 14 countries.Why these 14 countries will see restricted serviceThese countries are high-risk either because of a resurgent Covid wave or the active number of cases. For example, South Africa has on Thursday confirmed a new variant of Covid following which several countries are imposing a travel ban on South Africa. The same variant has been found in Botswana. Both the countries are there on the list. Many European countries are also on the list as they are presently seeing the fourth wave of the pandemic.The health ministry on Thursday alerted all states and Union territories to be extra cautious about international travellers either coming from or transiting through the countries where the new variant has been detected.What will restricted operations be? Does this mean Indians can't fly to the UK, Singapore, Mauritius?No. This list of 14 countries pertains to the resumption of regular international flights or pre-Covid-level operations. India has an air bubble agreement with many of the countries mentioned on the list.  At-risk countries which have such agreements with India will see 75% of pre-Covid operations with India. Countries mentioned on the list which do not have air bubble agreements will see 50% of the pre-covid operations with India.As of now, India has an air bubble agreement with Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Ukraine, UAE, UK, US and Uzbekistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-not-resume-regular-flights-in-these-14-countries-here-s-why-101637929292406.html
26-11-2021||India||Peninsular India records 143.4% excess rainfall this month||Peninsular India recorded 143.4% excess rain between November 1 and November 25, leading to flooding and damage to infrastructure in the region. The excess rain was 63% between October 1 and November 25, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).During the northeast monsoon season since October 1, Tamil Nadu has so far recorded 61%, Puducherry 83%, Karnataka 105% and Kerala 110% excess rainfall. The rainfall led to floods between in parts of Chennai and Andhra Pradesh’s Rayalaseema this month. On Thursday and Friday again, extremely heavy rain was recorded in south-eastern Tamil Nadu mainly due to the influence of a cyclonic circulation. Kayalpattinam recorded 31 cm, Tuticorin 27 cm, Tiruchendur 25 cm, Srivaikuntam 18 cm, Kulasekarapattinam 16 cm, Vaippar 15 cm and Nagapattinam 19 cm rainfall.“Very heavy rain on Thursday and Friday is mainly because of a cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal. But all of November, there have been several episodes of heavy rain and flooding in the Peninsular India,” said M Mohapatra, IMD director-general. He said the northeast monsoon is active and easterly waves are very strong, which is why Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh recorded heavy rains. Mohapatra said there have also been consecutive low-pressure systems or cyclonic circulations over the Bay of Bengal almost every week this month. “Another low-pressure area is expected to form over Andaman Sea on November 29.”Between November 7 and 13, Chennai experienced heavy rainfall and led to flooding and waterlogging. People residing in the low-lying areas were put on flood alerts. Authorities opened gates of the Poondi and Chembarambakkam reservoirs to release surplus waters. Nungambakkam in Chennai received 21.53 cm of rain on November 7 and triggered panic as similar rainfall intensity in December 2015 triggered floods in the city and led to large scale infrastructure loss. Intense rain along the coast started on November 6 night due to low pressure over the southeast Bay of Bengal.Sufficient moisture is available along the coast due to the northeast monsoon for occurrence of heavy rainfall. “Chennai needs a flood forecasting system with high resolution digital elevation model with an embedded Decision Support System. This will show where what water heights could be expected a few days before the flood really occurs. This time is enough to take some steps to reduce the impact of the flood. Temporary flood protection measures like inflatable water bags, water gates, etc should be deployed in areas that are expected to be inundated to reduce the flood impact,” said Pushpendra Johari, Senior VP (Sustainability), RMSI, an international risk management firm.Extremely heavy rainfall was recorded on November 20 and 21 and led to floods and waterlogging in parts of southern Andhra Pradesh. The floods washed away villages, breached dams, blocked railways and roadways, and caused heavy losses to life and property.India’s south-eastern coast has been facing heavy rainfall over the last month because of the formation of low-pressure areas attributed mainly to the north-east monsoons and cyclonic systems. In southern Andhra Pradesh, flash floods were reported in Rayalseema districts of Chittoor, Kurnool, Kadapa and Anantapur. Over 30 people died and around 1,500 houses were damaged. Vehicles were stranded and trains diverted or cancelled as the railway and road connectivity was disrupted.A cyclonic circulation is lying over the Comorin area and adjoining Sri Lanka coast. Strong north-easterly winds were also prevailing over the Tamil Nadu coast and south Coastal Andhra Pradesh. Under its influence, widespread rainfall was very likely in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Kerala, Mahe and Lakshadweep. Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall was likely in Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam, Rayalaseema during the next four to five days. Isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall was expected in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal until November 29. Isolated extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) was also likely in north Tamil Nadu on Friday and very heavy rain in Kerala and Mahe until November 29.Isolated heavy rainfall was likely in south Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam and Rayalaseema till November 29. Squally winds (speeds reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph) were very likely in Comorin area, Gulf of Mannar, along and off south Tamil Nadu coast and adjoining southwest Bay of Bengal on Friday and Saturday. Fishermen have been advised against venturing into these areas.A low-pressure area likely to form over the south Andaman Sea around November 29 is likely to become more marked and move west north-westwards during subsequent 48 hours. Under its influence, isolated heavy rainfall was likely in Andaman and Nicobar Islands on November 29 and 30. Squally weather with maximum sustained wind speed reaching 40-50 gusting to 60 kmph were likely over the Andaman Sea and neighbourhood from November 30 to December 2. Fishermen have been advised to be cautious and avoid venturing into these areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peninsular-india-records-143-4-excess-rainfall-this-month-101637927504591.html
26-11-2021||India||Undemocratic, family-run party system is not in tune with the Constitution: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday gave three key messages to people, particularly the political parties who are expected to be custodians of the Constitution – shun the family-run party system to become real champions of democracy, don’t revere convicted politicians in public life, and focus on duties to the nation before exerting your rights.While the first message is directed to key political families across the spectrum such as Gandhis’ stronghold on the Congress, Mamata Banerjee and his nephew’s dominance in the Trinamool Congress (TMC), Mulayam Singh Yadavs’ family-run Samajwadi Party (SP) and Lalu Prasad Yadav’s RJD; his second tirade was at public honouring of Lalu after being convicted in the fodder scam.Making his third point at the Constitution Day celebrations in the Parliament, the Prime Minister said Mahatma Gandhi had tried to prepare the nation for the duties, even while fighting for the rights in the freedom movement. “It would have been better if the duty had been emphasised after the country's independence. In the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, it is necessary for us to move forward on the path of duty so that our rights are protected,” he said. He was hinted at the leadership post-Independence that promoted “rights” but did not pay adequate attention to “duties” towards the people and the nation.He said that the political parties are responsible for enforcing democratic traditions, but unfortunately, many of them have no internal democracy because they promote family members instead of merit. “In the form of family-based parties, India is heading towards a kind of a crisis, which is a matter of concern for the people devoted to the Constitution,” he said.“How can the parties which have lost their democratic character protect democracy?,” he added.The Prime Minister also warned against the tendency of forgetting and glorifying convicted corrupt people. He said while giving an opportunity to reform we should refrain from glorifying such people in public life.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was speaking at the “Constitution Day” celebrations in Parliament. The event was also addressed by the President, the Vice President, and the Lok Sabha Speaker.PM emphasized that November 26 is the day to bow to this house of democracy also. The Prime Ministers bowed to the martyrs of 26/11 also. “Today, 26/11 is such a sad day for us, when the enemies of the country came inside the country and carried out the terrorist attack in Mumbai. The brave soldiers of the country sacrificed their lives while fighting the terrorists. Today I bow to their sacrifices”, he said.The Prime Minister noted that our constitution is not just a collection of many articles, our constitution is a great tradition of millennia. This is a modern expression of that unbroken stream. The Prime Minister said Constitution Day should also be celebrated because our path should constantly be evaluated whether it is right or not.Elaborating on the spirit behind celebrating the ‘Constitution Day’, the Prime Minister said it was during the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, “We all felt that what could be a greater auspicious occasion than the gift that Babasaheb Ambedkar had given to this country, we should always remember his contribution in the form of a memory book (Smrit Granth)”.He said it would have been better if along with establishing the tradition of Republic Day on 26th January, ‘Constitution Day’ was also established on 26th November at that time itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/undemocratic-family-run-party-system-is-not-in-tune-with-the-constitution-pm-modi-101637926217580.html

Speaking in the Delhi assembly, he said the farmers have restored people’s faith in democracy.Kejriwal referred to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, which was triggered after a convoy of cars, including one belonging to Mishra, mowed down protesting farmers. Kejriwal questioned the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government over the delay in sacking Mishra, whose son has been arrested for his alleged role in the violence that left eight people dead. “The Lakhimpur incident is very painful… Why cannot the Centre remove him? I do not know what is their compulsion, but the entire country wants that he (Mishra) should be removed.”The Delhi assembly also passed a resolution during a special session on the first anniversary of the year-long farmers’ protest on Friday demanding ₹1 crore compensation for families of 700 farmers who died during the protest, withdrawal of cases against farmers, guaranteed MSP and action against Mishra.Kejriwal lauded the farmers for their patience and peaceful protest despite being called “anti-nationals” by BJP members. Kejriwal praised farmers of poll-bound Punjab, where his Aam Aadmi Party emerged as a significant force in the 2017 polls, for leading the protest.Also Read: 500 farmers will reach Delhi on Nov 29: Tikait“This is the longest farmers’ protest in the world. Over 700 farmers were martyred while fighting against their own government. The ruling party did not leave any chance to instigate them. They were called anti-nationals, Khalistanis, Pakistani agents, etc… But their peaceful protest destroyed the government’s ego,” said Kejriwal.He said the peaceful protest compelled the government to announce repeal the three farm laws. “This is not just farmers’ victory; it is the victory of democracy. In the past few years, people had started losing faith in the democratic system ever since they (BJP) came to power with a majority. But this has reinstated people’s faith in democracy,” said Kejriwal. He said his government opposed the farm laws since day one and supported the farmers. “People are kept in stadiums to crush a movement. We have stayed in stadiums during our Anna movement days. We did not allow our stadiums to be turned into jails,” said Kejriwal.Kejriwal took pot-shots at BJP leaders and said they called both the decisions--the introduction of the farm laws and then the announcement of their repeal--“masterstrokes”.Environment minister Gopal Rai, who proposed the resolution in the assembly, said the Centre has decided to repeal the law. “But the laws were prepared and passed without any discussion with the farmers. It is not good for democracy. Even now the government is not talking to farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-kejriwal-seeks-compensation-guarantee-for-msp-101637924624277.html
26-11-2021||India||India to resume international flights from December 15; 14 countries ‘at risk’||The Centre will resume regular international flights from December 15, while limited services will be there in 14 countries, people familiar with the development said on Friday. The countries which feature on the list of “at-risk” and will thereby not see 100% resumption of international flights are the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Finland, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Singapore, sources said. The decision has been taken in consultation with the health ministry in light of the Covid situation across the world, especially the emergence of new variants. On Thursday, South Africa confirmed a new variant of Coronavirus which is believed to be more transmissible and vaccine-evasive. The variant has been reported in Botswana and Hong Kong as well apart from South Africa. India is not resuming regular international flight operations with Botswana and South Africa.With some of the countries on the list India has a travel bubble that permits a certain number of flights a week, which will continue in a different format, officials explained. At-risk countries with an air bubble agreement with India will see the resumption of 75% pre-covid operations, while at-risk countries without an air bubble agreement with India will see teh resumption of 50% of teh pre-Covid operations.Regular international flights operations were suspended in March 2020 owing to the Coronavirus pandemic. The civil aviation ministry started Vande Bharat flights to ferry Indians who got stuck in other countries during the pandemic. After the Vande Bharat flights, the ministry entered into air bubble agreements with some countries allowing international travel.With the number of Covid cases steadily going down and the vaccine coverage in the country going up, the Centre was mulling easing restrictions regarding international travel. Two days ago, civil aviation secretary Rajiv Bansal said the ministry is working towards allowing international passenger flights from this year-end.Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia too recently expressed the ministry's keenness to resume normal international travel operations. “We are evaluating the process. We are coming back to normalcy. First, we allowed 100% passenger capacity in our domestic flights and now we allowed in-flight meals in those flights," Scindia said at an industry summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-resume-international-flights-to-begin-from-dec-15-barring-14-countries-101637924373528.html

While Kumar did not take any name, his remarks echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement made earlier in the day wherein he said India is heading towards “a kind of a crisis” in the form of "family-based" parties.“Some parties have gone into dynastic politics...even if they are doing well now, their survival will not be possible after some time,” news agency ANI quoted Nitish Kumar as saying.Earlier, at a Constitution Day event in the Central Hall of Parliament, Modi described family-based parties as one "for the family, by the family".

26-11-2021||India||'Wah kya masterstroke hai': Kejriwal mocks what BJP said about farm laws, repeal||As the protest of the farmers against the three controversial farm laws completes a year on Friday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi Assembly said he feels sorry for BJP leaders who had to react with 'Wah kya masterstroke hai' with every decision -- be it the farm laws or their withdrawal. In a speech in the Delhi Assembly on the one-year completion of the farmers' protest, the chief minister said that when the Centre asked the AAP government to put the farmers coming from Punjab inside stadiums, he remembered his days as a protester along with Anna Hazare. "I have also spent nights in a stadium. I knew it was a way to foil the protest. We did not allow that with the farmers. The Centre was rattled with us. In any case, the Centre is always angry with us," Kejriwal said."It was the government's pride that they thought they could pass any bill in Parliament. They thought farmers will come, protest for some days and then will go back," Kejriwal said.Comparing the year-long protest with that of India's freedom movement, Kejriwal said the farmers' protest was no less than the freedom movement. And at the end, it was the victory of not the farmers, but of democracy, the chief minister said adding that he doesn't know of any protest across the world that went on for so long. "In 1907, there was a protest of farmers against the British. That went on for nine months. This was the protest of the farmers against the government they elected and it went on for a year," Kejriwal said.Referring to the Lakhimpur incident, Kejriwal said had the Supreme Court not intervened, then they would not even have arrested the minister's son. Congratulating the farmers and the women of Punjab in spearheading the protest, Kejriwal said the protesters weathered teh harsh winter, followed by another wave of Corona, dengue outbreak etc., but did not give up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wah-kya-masterstroke-hai-kejriwal-mocks-what-bjp-said-about-farm-laws-repeal-101637922264984.html

26-11-2021||India||Ahead of Parliament’s winter session, VP Naidu urges lawmakers to rethink before disrupting House||With the Winter Session of Parliament set to start from November 29, vice president M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday voiced concern over the persistent disruptions during House sessions and the steep fall in the productivity of the Rajya Sabha.In his address during a Constitution Day event in Parliament, Naidu referred to the recently concluded Monsoon Session of Parliament, during which he said the Rajya Sabha lost 70 per cent of its functional time.“During the 254th Session of Rajya Sabha, the productivity has further slipped to 29.60 per cent which means that the Rajya Sabha has lost about 70 per cent of the functional time. All concerned need to ponder over the fact of rendering legislature so dysfunctional,” he said.Stressing the need to spend the time allocated for the Parliament session fruitfully, Naidu said the Rajya Sabha secretariat maintained statistics regarding the productivity of the house since 1978.Also read | Key Bills likely to be tabled during winter session of Parliament“For 16 years from 1979 to 1994, the annual productivity of the house has been over 100 per cent. In the next 26 years since 1995, the productivity of the Rajya Sabha has been more than 100 per cent. Only twice in 1998 and 2009, a broad declining trend in productivity is evident and it touched the lowest ever 35.75 per cent in 2018, a year before the general elections in 2019,” he noted.“Clearly, we need to have more meaningful productive use of our time in our Parliament. We need to recognise the exalted place that Parliament occupies in people’s perception. It is indeed this sacred place where people’s voices are articulated and heard, where their hopes and fears are debated, where laws protecting them, foster their growth and enable fast-tracked national development are formulated,” he added.The comments from the vice president came after opposition parties staged widespread protests in both Houses, during the Monsoon Session held between July and August, against the Pegasus row, the farm laws and rising fuel prices.Notably, Naidu did not deliver his valedictorian address and also broke down at the last session due to the behaviour of some parliamentarians.“Parliament, the apex legislature of our country, is regarded as the temple of democracy. The Table area where the officers, the secretary general and the presiding officer are seated is considered the holy sanctum sanctorum of the House. A certain degree of sacredness is attached to this place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-parliament-s-winter-session-vp-naidu-urges-lawmakers-to-rethink-before-disrupting-house-101637916833542.html

No tremor recorded, says Karnataka disaster monitoring body||A loud mysterious sound was heard in the vicinity of Bengaluru on Friday between 11.50am and 12.15pm, triggering speculations of whether it was another sonic boom that Bengaluru heard on July 2 this year. The Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre confirmed reports of a sound associated with mild vibrations by local residents and said the data was analysed from the seismic observatories for any seismic signatures during the same period and no such indication was found.The mysterious sound was reported by residents of Hemmigepura, Kengeri, Gnanabharathi, Rajeshwari Nagar and Kaggalipura, the disaster monitoring body said.In July this year, residents of several areas of Bengaluru, including Sarjapur, JP Nagar, Benson Town, Ulsoor, ISRO layout and HSR layout, claimed they heard a loud boom sound, which was later thought to be sonic boom which is the sound generated by an object moving faster than sound. Such a phenomenon created a shock wave that turns into a loud sound. While it was thought that the ‘sonic boom’ might have been created by any of their flights. HAL, however, said none of its flights made the sound. In May last year, a similar sound was heard and was thought to be produced by a Sukhoi 30 which was on a sortie.  Just now heard a loud explosion sound in Bengaluru, then doors and windows vibrated. I felt this in Rajarajeshwari Nagara. #Bengaluru #Bangalore #SonicBoom? Others felt too??Peeps in Bangalore, anyone heard a loud noise in Bangalore? At 12:10 pm ish?Going by the account posted on Twitter, Friday's thud was similar to the previous occurrences. People claimed to have felt tremors and windows and doors have vibrated with the sound. The sound and the tremor made Karnataka people wonder whether there was an earthquake in the South as a strong earthquake of 6.0 magnitude rocked the Myanmar-India border early on Friday with tremors being felt in West Bengal, Tripura and Assam in the East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-sonic-boom-in-bengaluru-no-tremor-recorded-says-karnataka-disaster-monitoring-body-101637916453450.html

"How can such parties protect our democracy?" he asked.Without naming the Congress, Modi during his address in Parliament said family-ruled parties are becoming an issue for people who are devoted to the Constitution and those who believe in democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mark-of-disrespect-union-minister-slams-oppn-skipping-constitution-day-event-101637903409253.html
26-11-2021||India||UK student visas for Indians up 102% in 12-month period ending Sept 2021||Student visas issued by the UK to Indian nationals increased 102% in the 12-month period ending in September 2021, while skilled worker visas issued to Indians during the same period were up 47%, according to the latest British immigration statistics. Indians were also the top nationality granted high-value work visas, accounting for around one-sixth or 17% of the total, statistics released by the UK home office on Thursday showed. British high commissioner Alex Ellis tweeted on Friday about the increase in the grant of student and skilled worker visas to Indians and said the “huge demand is why turnaround of visas is taking longer than usual”. The number of Indian students in the UK had dipped since 2012, when the post-study work visa was scrapped and more Indians began going to European countries such as France and Germany for higher studies. In July, the UK opened a new graduate immigration route that benefited Indian students by allowing them to stay longer in Britain after finishing their studies to look for jobs. Also Read: UK suspends flights to 6 African countries as new Covid variant emergesCompared with the year ending in September 2020, there was an increase of 45,677 (102%) student visas granted to Indians, taking the total to 90,669. It was 197% higher than the figure of 30,496 visas for the year ending September 2019. Indians remained the nationality with the second highest number of sponsored study visa grants. The list was topped by Chinese students, who were granted 135,457 visas in the year ending September 2021, up from 52,698 in the previous year or a 157% increase. Indian and Chinese nationals together comprised more than half (53%) of all sponsored study visa grants. In the case of work visas, Indians were the top nationality granted high value work visas, accounting for about one-sixth or 17% of the total. They were followed by US and Chinese nationals, who accounted for 11% and 10% respectively. The high value work visas include those granted to the exceptional talent route, investors and entrepreneurs. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, in the year ending September 2019, China, India and Pakistan had been the top three nationalities in this category. Indian nationals also accounted for more than two-fifth or 42% of all skilled work visas granted by the UK.

The victory of the farmers' struggle is proof of this,” she added, in an apparent reference to the Centre’s recent decision to repeal the farm laws, following continued protests.किसान आंदोलन का एक सालकिसानों के अडिग सत्याग्रह, 700 किसानों की शहादत और निर्मम भाजपा सरकार के अहंकार व अन्नदाताओं पर अत्याचार के लिए जाना जाएगा।लेकिन भारत में किसान की जय-जयकार हमेशा थी, है और रहेगी।किसानों के संघर्ष की जीत इसका प्रमाण है।जय किसान। pic.twitter.com/KCWnLNog0BThe farmers’ protest against the three contentious laws completed one year on Friday. Several farmers from many states, particularly Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the laws at Delhi’s borders. The movement has been spearheaded by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of several farmers’ unions.Also read | Farmers’ protest taught us how to fight for our rights with patience: KejriwalOn Wednesday, the Union cabinet approved a bill to repeal the three laws after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 announced that his government has decided to repeal them. “We have decided to repeal all three agricultural laws. We will complete the constitutional process to repeal these three agricultural laws in the Parliament session that begins later this month,” Modi said during his address to the nation.Immediately after Modi’s announcement, Priyanka Gandhi reacted to it alleging that the move was done keeping in mind the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab among others. She said that the BJP had sensed they would be defeated in the assembly polls.“Now you start seeing the defeat in the elections, then suddenly you started to understand the truth of this country - that this country has been made by the farmers, this country belongs to the farmers, the farmer is the true caretaker of this country and no government can crush the interest of the farmers in this country,” she tweeted.Several rounds of discussions took place between the protesting farmers and the Union government in the past and following the repeal, the farmer unions have maintained that their struggles would continue. They have said that the repeal was only one among several of their key demands. Meanwhile, the unions have also pressed the government for a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-1-year-of-farmers-protests-priyanka-gandhi-talks-about-unshakable-satyagraha-101637909317348.html

26-11-2021||India||Know your Constitution: Salient features of India's fundamental political code||India observes Constitution Day on November 26 every year to pay its respects to the significant piece of document that lays down the entire framework of the fundamental political code of the country.This year, too, the country has marked the day with a number of events – one of which is to be led by President Ram Nath Kovind in the Central Hall of Parliament where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also address a gathering.The Constitution of India, the longest written constitution of any country, is considered the supreme law of the nation and demarcates the structure, framework, powers, and duties of government institutions, and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and duties of citizens.Here are some of the salient features of the Constitution of India:1. Lengthiest constitution in the world: The Constitution of India, with its preamble and 470 articles grouped into 25 parts, is the lengthiest constitution in the entire world. With 12 schedules and five appendices, the Constitution has been amended 104 times – the latest of which became effective on January 25, 2020.2. Sovereignty resides in the people: The introduction of the Constitution declares that it was adopted and enacted by the people of India and they are the custodians of the Republic.3. Parliamentary form of government: The Constitution of India establishes the parliamentary form of government both at the Centre and the states. In this form of governance, the Prime Minister and his council of ministers are accountable for all their actions, most specifically to the Lok Sabha, which keeps control over the executives through democratic means.4. Fundamental Rights: The fundamental rights of citizens of the country are guaranteed by the Constitution to all its citizens. These include – a guaranteed Right to Equality, Right to Freedom, Freedom of Religion, Right against Exploitation, Educational and Cultural Rights, and Right to Constitutional Remedies.5. Quasi-federal in nature: The nature of the Indian state is federal, in the sense that the powers are distributed between the Union and the state. But in times of emergency, the government assumes a unitary character.6. Adult suffrage: All adult citizens above 18 have the right to vote. In India, there is the concept of ‘Universal Adult Franchise’ which does not tolerate communal divisions in electorates.7. Independence of judiciary: The Constitution of India has made the judicial wing independent from the legislature and executive wings. The judges are free from the interference of other organs of the government.8. Sovereignty: The Constitution of India recognises the country as free and independent, noting that no external force can influence its decisions since the nation is no more the dominion of any other foreign country.9. Secular: The Constitution of India provides for a secular state, ensuring equal protection to all religions, no upholding of any particular religion as the state religion, guaranteed freedom to practice any accepted religion, and equal respect for all of them.10. Single Citizenship: The Constitution of India confers single Indian citizenship, and not separate citizenship for particular states, to enforce the shared sense of unity.On the 71st Constitution Day 2021, President Kovind will address the nation in a speech, following which people will join him live in a reading session of the Preamble of the Constitution.According to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), President Kovind will then release a digital version of the Constituent Assembly Debates at the Central Hall of the Parliament House.The document is an online version of a calligraphed copy of the Constitution as well as an updated version of the document laying down the framework of the fundamental political code of the country, which will include all amendments to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/know-your-constitution-salient-features-of-india-s-fundamental-political-code-101637900027809.html
26-11-2021||India||Gen Rawat is right about escalating Chinese threat to India, so was Fernandes||After Beijing protested Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat’s remark that China was the biggest security threat to India, one gets a sense of déjà vu. Some 23 years ago, then defence minister George Fernandes faced a barrage of protests and criticism both from China and their sympathisers within for calling China a potential threat to India in an interview.Chinese defence ministry spokesperson Senior Colonel Wu Qian told media on Thursday: “Indian officials speculate on the so-called Chinese military threat for no reason, which is a serious violation of the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries that China and India do not constitute a threat to each other, and incites geopolitical confrontation, is irresponsible and dangerous.”While China is known in the past to cherry-pick statements to suit its political purpose, the defence ministry spokesperson conveniently forgot that Gen Rawat’s observation comes from the PLA attempts to unilateral change the ground position in Doklam in 2017 and on the Ladakh LAC in May 2020. That India and China virtually came to war on both occasions is enough to substantiate Gen Rawat’s assessment. Gen Rawat was the Indian Army chief when Doklam happened and CDS when Pangong Tso transgressions took place in May 2020.Even as the Chinese defence ministry reminds Gen Rawat about the strategic guidance of the leadership of two countries, the spokesman inexplicably forgot that the PLA threw the written, signed, and sealed 1993 and 1996 bilateral border agreements out of the window when it tried to impose on India the rejected 1959 Line on the Ladakh LAC. The same happened in 2013 in Depsang Bulge in Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) sector and at Charding Nullah Junction (CNJ) in Demchok.The fact is that Chinese PLA actions on the LAC after the 2008 Tibet uprising before Beijing Olympics cannot be justified by any logic other than military. With PLA deploying nearly 50,000 troops across the Ladakh LAC with missile, tank and rocket regiments to back them and fighter aircraft on standby since June 2020, one has to be either naïve or weak to view this as a guarded benign posture of the Chinese army. To date, China has not even explained why it decided to unilaterally change the ground position on the north banks of Pangong Tso and put the growing bilateral relations into a deep freeze. Why did the Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the Commander in Chief of PLA, throw the hours and hours of Wuhan and Chennai understandings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi under the bus? Why is China coercing a tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan to open its borders to trade and diplomatic ties with Beijing with the help of the Chinese army?The timeline of bilateral ties between India and China shows that Beijing has not yielded a millimetre from its position for resolution of the boundary issue or its ties with Pakistan to accommodate the Indian point of view. The May 2020 transgressions show that PLA wants the 1959 line to be imposed on Ladakh LAC and still has eyes on Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. The spurt in upgrading military infrastructure in Tibet and Xinjiang post-Beijing Olympics not only poses a serious threat to India but also is a part of the Fortress Tibet campaign of President Xi. George Fernandes and Gen Rawat were right in their observations about the escalating threat, but the onus is on China to take positive actions on the border to show the CDS his place. India has not forgotten how the Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai slogan was torn to shreds when China surreptitiously build the Tibet-Xinjiang highway via Aksai Chin before the 1962 betrayal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gen-rawat-is-right-about-escalating-chinese-threat-to-india-so-was-fernandes-101637903432914.html

Every year since 2014, Kurien's birth anniversary has been observed as the National Milk Day.The late social entrepreneur, who was born on November 26, 1921, in present day- Kozhikode, Kerala, played an instrumental role in making India the largest milk producer in the world. He was also the brains behind 'Operation Flood,' which led to dairy farming becoming the country's largest self-sustaining industry, as well as the largest rural employment sector. Kurien also helped set up the Amul cooperative society in 1946, in Gujarat's Anand, and, in later years, became synonymous with it.These, along with further contributions to the dairy industry, earned Kurien the moniker of the ‘Father of White Revolution’ and the ‘Milkman of India.’ He was thus a recipient of several awards, including the Padma Vibhushan (1999), World Food Prize (1989), Krishi Ratna (1986), Padma Bhushan (1966), Padma Shri (1965), Ramon Magsaysay Award (1963) etc.This year, as part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the Union government will commemorate the National Milk Day by distributing the National Gopal Ratna Awards in a ceremony at the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) campus in Anand. Parshottam Rupala, the Union minister for Animal Husbandry and Dairy, will confer the awards to the winners in various categories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-milk-day-2021-nation-marks-birth-anniversary-of-milk-man-verghese-kurien-101637895855877.html

The NITI Ayog has identified at least one aspirational district from each state using a composite index of key data sets that include deprivation enumerated under the socio-economic caste census, key health and education sector performance, and state of basic infrastructure.According to the minutes of the Union education ministry’s Programme Approval Board (mid-day meal) meeting with the states and Union Territories this year ahead of the expansion of mid-day meal schemes, several states submitted their proposals for introducing supplementary nutrition items in aspirational districts. The board approved these proposals with some minor cost-related changes, as per the minutes.Also Read: President, PM to address gathering on Constitution Day event at ParliamentWhile approving the proposals, the board advised the states and territories to start providing the proposed items at the earliest to mitigate the nutritional challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.On October 28, the ministry wrote to states and territories and asked them to include millets under the scheme to address malnutrition and anemia among children.Earlier, the central funds provided for the mid-day meal scheme were restricted to be used for wheat, rice, pulses, and vegetables. States including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat, and Uttarakhand, were providing supplementary nutrition as a part of the mid-day meal schemes on certain days on their own.According to the minutes, Andhra Pradesh proposed to provide chikki (made of jaggery and peanuts) to children enrolled in schools of six aspiration districts--Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, Prakasam, Kadapa and Anantapur. Haryana sought to provide pinni to primary and upper primary students in the aspirational district of Mewat.Jharkhand and Kerala proposed to provide peanut chikki to students in all aspirational districts while Maharashtra items such as nutritive slices made of bajra, jowar, nachni, soyabean in 14 aspirational districts. Chhattisgarh sought to provide soya chikki in six aspiration districts, Odisha millet laddus in tribal and aspiration districts, and Rajastha gur-peanut chikki in aspirational districts and those with a high prevalence of malnutrition.Punjab decided to provide bananas to children in two aspirational districts--Moga and Ferozepur-- and Telangana millet soup and sprouts with jaggery to children as a supplementary diet to students in all districts.Karnataka, which proposed to provide eggs to students in seven districts with a higher prevalence of anemia, plans to implement it from December 1. The state will provide bananas to students who do eat eggs.The mid-day meal scheme, which covered students enrolled in classes first to eighth, has now been expanded to include around 2.4 million students in pre-primary sections under the PM Poshan scheme.The Centre and states share the costs under a 60:40 ratio under the scheme.An official in September said generally the states and territories spend 80-85% of the annually allocated budget and they earlier surrendered the unspent money. “But now they can use that budget on supplementary nutrition under the PM Poshan [scheme].”Amrita Johri of NGO Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan welcomed the provision for supplementary diet in aspiration districts but added funds should also be earmarked to ensure the proper source of protein. “We have to move away from just calorie count to have a balanced diet. Besides, the supplementary diet should be extended to all students and not just aspirational districts since there are pockets of malnutrition, starvation, and food insecurity in every district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/millet-soups-to-eggs-what-states-plan-for-schoolkids-under-pm-poshan-scheme-101637897858914.html

26-11-2021||India||Chhattisgarh CM likely to meet PM Modi; farmers, mill workers issues on agenda||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inform him about the problems mill workers and farmers of the state are facing. Baghel will be accompanied by all members of his cabinet.According to an official statement, Chhattisgarh's chief secretary Amitabh Jain wrote a letter to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to fix the date and time of the meeting with PM Modi and discuss issues related to paddy procurement, news agency ANI reported.In his letter to the PMO, Jain said that as per the Centre's Decentralised Procurement Scheme and the memorandum of understanding (MoU), paddy is brought from farmers during the Kharif season.In the current Kharif marketing year, the Centre has issued instructions to procure 100 per cent (61.65 lakh metric tonne) of arwa rice under the central pool from Chhattisgarh, the letter said. Meanwhile, usna rice was also taken from the state in the previous years.Jain said that because of these above instructions, there will be problems inChhattisgarh's 416 usna mills and will affect the livelihood of labourers. There is also a possibility of difficulty in resolving such paddy produced by the farmers of the state, from which only usna rice can be made, the state chief secretary further said in his letter to PMO.Jain also pointed out that a sufficient supply of gunny bags from the jute commissioner was also not being done in time for the procurement of paddy.In January this year, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel accused the Centre of reducing the paddy procurement target from 60 lakh metric tonne (MT) to 24 lakh MT. Baghel said that it is the responsibility of the Centre to procure its quota of grains from the state at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and pay the state accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-likely-to-meet-pm-modi-farmers-mill-workers-issues-on-agenda-101637890411984.html
26-11-2021||India||RA&W chief offered to resign for failure to prevent 26/11 attack||On the evening of November 27, 2008, a day after the heinous terror attacks in Mumbai referred to as 26/11, Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) secretary Ashok Chaturvedi met then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and offered to resign for his failure to prevent the multiple terror strike that led to the deaths of 166 people and injured 293 others.Piecing together the chain of events by talking to those involved in the response to terror strike executed by Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and likely carried out with the cognisance of that country’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Hindustan Times has learnt that Chaturvedi showed all relevant intelligence alerts on impending major terror strike sent by R&AW to the multi-agency centre of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) for dissemination and action by the Mumbai Police. The specific alerts were sent to the IB by then joint secretary (international liaison) Anil Dhasmana; these alerts were compiled with the help of agencies such as the US Central Intelligence Agency and Israel’s Mossad.Also Read | Manish Tewari’s views on UPA action after 26/11 attacks trigger controversyThe R&AW alerts listed possible targets, including Nariman House, by name. There was also the November 20, 2008, alert issued by the agency to Indian Navy and Coast Guard, which were at the time involved in Defence of Gujarat war exercises in the high seas off the Kathiawar peninsula, about intruding ship Al Husseini which began its journey from KT Bandar in Karachi. The ship, whose latitude and longitude at anchor was given in the alert, was not intercepted on the high seas and the terrorists then used hijacked fishing trawler MV Kuber to reach the outer perimeter of Mumbai harbour on that fateful day.Watch: Ahead of 26/11 anniversary, UPA govt's lack of response questioned by Congress leader; BJP gets ammoWhile Chaturvedi died in 2011, it is understood that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, after examining R&AW’s alerts, which will still be in the agency’s archives, asked the then chief of India’s external intelligence agency not to resign. Chaturvedi, who was subsequently targeted for not preventing the 26/11 attacks, retired from the agency in January 2009. His Madhya Pradesh IPS cadremate Anil Dhasmana went on to become the R&AW chief in 2017 and is currently chairman of the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO).Also Read | 26/11: The day terror hit usThat IB used these alerts to issue three warnings of impending terror strikes , including attacks on Jewish targets in India’s commercial capital, is evident from the de-classified report of RD Pradhan Commission of Inquiry set up by then state government headed by Congress chief minister Ashok Chavan. The Pradhan report talks about the lack of intelligent perception of threats by both the state home department and the Mumbai Police, and specifically mentions August 9, 2008, alerts from the IB on possible attacks on Taj Mahal Hotel, Oberoi Hotel and the World Trade Centre.To be sure, while Mumbai Police did take the IB warnings very seriously as per the Pradhan Committee, the state of readiness went down over the following months and everyone was caught by surprise on 26/11. That the terror strikes had been in the works for some time (something that explains the advance warnings) is clear from details of the interrogation of LeT’s 26/11 Mumbai scout David Coleman Headley aka Daood Gilani. Headley told NIA in June 2010 that the first attempt on Mumbai in September failed as the boat sank on high seas. The second attempt on 26/11 was successful and deadly with the Union home ministry, state home department and Mumbai Police all caught unawares.With six US nationals and four Israeli nationals being killed in the attacks, both the CIA and Mossad were upset with India for its failure to prevent the Mumbai massacre. Despite this, both agencies and their governments helped Indian security agencies in digging out clues from charred mobile phones and GPS sets of the terrorists using latest technology.Also Read | 26/11 special: ‘Survivors say they are prepared for the worst, now’While Union home minister Shivraj Patil, state home minister RR Patil, and Mumbai Police commissioner Hasan Ghafoor lost their jobs after the incident, director, Intelligence Bureau, PC Haldar retired on his due date of superannuation on December 31, 2008. Clearly, central Intelligence had not failed.Although there was a mood for military retaliation against Pakistan after the Mumbai massacre of innocents, this changed eight month later when PM Manmohan Singh met his Pakistani counterpart Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani at Shram El Sheikh on July 16, 2009, and decided to chart a way forward for bilateral relations. The Pakistani PM promised to bring perpetrators of Mumbai attacks to justice but countered with allegations of an Indian terror threat to Balochistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ra-w-chief-offered-to-resign-for-failure-to-prevent-26-11-attack-101637879543544.html

This year, too, the nation is celebrating Constitution Day to commemorate the adoption of the Constitution of India by the Constituent Assembly in 1949.The roots of this celebration, according to the ANI news agency, can be traced back to the “Samvidhan Gaurav Yatra” in 2010 organised by PM Modi, who was then the chief minister of Gujarat.The Constitution of India, the longest written constitution of any country, is considered the supreme law of the nation and demarcates the structure, framework, powers, and duties of government institutions, and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and duties of citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitution-day-2021-pm-modi-to-kick-off-celebrations-attend-2-programmes-in-delhi-101637888565207.html

26-11-2021||India||26/11 Mumbai attacks: Pakistan yet to show sincerity in delivering justice even after 13 years||November 26, 2021, marks 13 years since the series of dreadful terror attacks in Mumbai when 10 members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a jihadist outfit based in Pakistan, carried out 12 coordinated attacks lasting as many as four days across major locations.As many as 166 people from 15 countries were killed in the attacks at the iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel, the Nariman House, the Metro Cinema, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, among other places.The November 2008 Mumbai attacks, also referred to as 26/11 attacks, perhaps for the first time drew widespread global condemnation at a scale hitherto unseen and prompted the central government to critically heighten its counter-terrorism operations and re-examine several aspects of its already straining ties with Pakistan.Ajmal Kasab, who was the sole surviving attacker captured by the security forces, later confirmed the assault was planned, coordinated, and conducted by the LeT and other Pakistan-based terror modules. In testimonies acquired by the intelligence agencies in the country, Kasab was quoted as saying all the attackers came from Pakistan and their controllers, too, were all operating from that country.Ten years after the attack, former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif – in a series of sensational revelations – also indicated that Islamabad played a role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Current evidence suggests that Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism in the 26/11 attacks has been proved during the interrogation accounts of three men terrorists – Ajmal Kasab, David Headley, and Zabiuddin Ansari.Despite its own public acknowledgment as well as the availability of all necessary evidence, including those shared by India, Pakistan is yet to show sincerity in delivering justice to the families of victims even on the 13th anniversary of the 26/11 attacks.On November 7, a Pakistani court freed six terrorists, including those involved with the dreadful attacks, mentored by Hafiz Saeed – the United Nations designated terrorist who is the founder of the LeT outfit and its charity wing, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD).Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, LeT commander and ringleader of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, had also been on bail since 2015 after he was arrested, on terror-financing charges by the counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of the country's Punjab province.Lakhvi, also another UN-designated international terrorist, was arrested once again in Pakistan earlier this year in January, but counter-terror watchers indicate that political interference in the country often gets in the way of justice.Terror outfits in Pakistan also keep changing their names in order to escape scrutiny and contest claims, as the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Organisation has amplified its watch.Earlier, in April this year, a New York-based Artificial Intelligence start-up revealed that Pakistan has silently removed the names of almost 4,000 terrorists from its terror watch list. The removed names include LeT leader and Mumbai attack mastermind Zakir ur Rehman Lakhvi and many others.According to International Forum for Rights and Security, in terms of international terrorism, the Mumbai attack underscores the threat posed by a few well-armed and well-trained individuals who could carry out an unconventional attack on unarmed civilians and soft target civilian population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2611-mumbai-attacks-pakistan-yet-to-show-sincerity-in-delivering-justice-even-after-13-years-101637883313772.html

The first phase of the greenfield project is expected to be completed in 2024 with a capacity of 12 million passengers annually.“By the last phase of development, the Noida International Airport will even surpass Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport and become India’s leading airport,” said Scindia.The final phase is expected to be completed by 2040- 2050 with a capacity to handle 70 million passengers annually. In comparison, according to civil aviation ministry, Delhi’s IGI airport currently handles 69 million passengers annually, and is expected to handle 110 million after its expansion work is completed.“It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s direction that Asia’s biggest airport had to be built in Uttar Pradesh,” Scindia said. “Where there is a will, there is a way.... It was an ambitious resolution of the prime minister, which has come true today.”Scindia declared that Uttar Pradesh will have 17 airports in all with the government adding eight new ones in the next two years in the state.UP had six (Prayagraj, Varanasi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra and Gorakhpur) airports. The government has added three (Hindon, Bareilly and Kushinagar) airports in 2021 and aims to add five more (Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Azamgarh, Moradabad and Shrawasti) by 2022 .Jewar airport is expected to commence operations from 2024. The government also aims to start flights from Muirpur (Sonbhadra) and Ayodhya.“Earlier, there were only four airports in Uttar Pradesh but now there are nine airports and this (Jewar) will be the 10th airport in the state,” Scindia said.”From 74 airports in the country, we built 136 under the prime minister’s guidance.”Under the multi-modal connectivity system, Jewar will be connected via road, rail, bus and even metro, Scindia said.The minister also said that one hundred thousand people will get jobs.“Noida International Airport will generate employment for one lakh [100,000] people,” the civil aviation minister said while addressing the gathering at Jewar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/noida-airport-will-be-bigger-than-igi-in-capital-scindia-101637887548802.html

26-11-2021||India||An order that looks beyond just economics, prioritises humans||As the Covid-19 virus ebbs and wanes, post-pandemic realities are beginning to emerge. They underline a growing set of understandings and arrangements that form the basis of an emerging world order.Empirically speaking, downturns are followed by recovery. The Indian economy is beginning to bounce back with economic output and activity surging. A vaccination campaign of unprecedented scope and complexity has improved health security and reduced vulnerabilities in record time. The stage is set for a return to normalcy and more.This is, therefore, a moment of opportunity. The choices that India makes at this juncture are an indication of where it sees promise of a better tomorrow.The pandemic has demonstrated that we need a more, and not less, interconnected world. Common problems must have common solutions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, over the last few months, has in the G7, G20, in COP26, in the first Quad Summit, in the United Nations General Assembly, and as Chair of the UN Security Council, BRICS, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Heads of Government, articulated a vision of a new world order that is relevant to the challenges of the post-pandemic world. He has also, through a variety of domestic and international platforms, laid down a set of strategies and objectives which will align Indian priorities with this vision for a better tomorrow for all.A major global challenge on which India has acted to provide leadership and direction is climate change. Despite our developmental needs, we have shown a strong commitment to climate action.Speaking most recently at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow, the Prime Minister outlined India’s climate ambition through Panchamrit which will put India on an accelerated track to raise non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity to 500GW and meet 50% of our energy requirements from renewables by 2030 while reducing projected carbon emissions by a billion tonnes and carbon intensity to below 45% until 2030, and to “net zero” by 2070.Articulating the concerns of the developing world, the Prime Minister also called on developed countries to enhance their ambition on the transfer of climate finance and low cost technologies.Two international organisations, the International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, initiated by India, have begun to play an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts globally. At COP26, the Prime Minister launched the “One Sun, One World, One Grid” for interconnected solar energy infrastructure at a global scale and ‘Infrastructure for Resilient Island States’ for climate and disaster resilient infrastructure in Small Island Developing States under these organisations.India is also seeking to turn into a global hub for Green Hydrogen production and export under its National Hydrogen Mission.The Prime Minister’s appeal for promoting sustainable lifestyles to deal with the climate crisis found resonance at the G20 Summit in Rome. He has proposed a One-Word Movement, i.e., LIFE or Lifestyle for Environment. The adoption of India’s own example of sustainable lifestyle on a global basis would be transformational in our fight against climate change.The pandemic has highlighted the need to de-risk supply chains and make them more resilient. Prime Minister has emphasised three key factors for improving our supply chains: Trusted Source, Transparency and Time-Frame.The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan prioritises resilience and reliability and intends to make India a trustworthy supply chain hub. This is a part of a larger policy framework to augment capacity through fiscal and monetary support, injection of liquidity, financial support for industry, better ease of doing business, and ambitious structural reforms. A landmark production-linked incentives scheme is attracting investment, boosting domestic manufacturing and creating globally competitive Indian businesses. Previously restricted sectors such as space, defence and atomic energy have been opened to greater private participation.A National Education Policy has created the framework for educating a 21st century workforce and making India a global education and skilling centre.India is also making massive public investments in improving its infrastructure. Prime Minister’s Gati Shakti – the National Master Plan for Multimodal Connectivity – is set to create a seamlessly connected India. It introduces a non-siloed approach to connectivity and brings executing and policy entities onto a common platform.Improvements in physical infrastructure will be accompanied by focus on SDG goals by initiatives such as those on digital connectivity, financial inclusion, and immunisation. The JAM trinity, composed of Jan Dhan, the world’s largest financial inclusion programme; Aadhaar, the world’s largest biometric programme; and one of the world’s largest mobile phone networks; has enabled direct benefits transfer on a transformational scale. It is now powering a fintech revolution. Jal Jeevan and Ayushman Bharat are changing lives by providing access to clean water and health care, respectively, to all Indians.SDG 3 sets us all towards the target of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. At the G20 Summit, Prime Minister put forward the holistic vision of “One Earth – One Health” for the world.The pandemic has moved international systems to the digital space. Whether it is the CoWin Portal that has managed one of the world’s most ambitious vaccination operations in a user-friendly, transparent, equitable and efficient manner; the Digital India initiative; digital payment solutions; or the 24x7 BPO and ITES industry; India has adapted and continues to go digital.Speaking at the G20 Summit, Prime Minister pointed out that India has certified at-scale solutions for many developmental problems. It is a proving ground of development. It also has vast experience of South-South Development Cooperation and can offer many templates to other developing countries. Earlier, at the G7 Summit, the Prime Minister had announced that Indian open source digital solutions would be available to all.Even during the bleakest days of the pandemic, India did not forget that it was part of an international community. It went out of its way to supply essential medicines to more than a 150 countries. It received, in its turn, the support of all, during its “second wave”.While running a successful vaccination campaign at home, India has also now resumed export of vaccines to its neighbours and partners.Through all of these, and more, India is acting as a key and constructive player in the creation of a new world order that can cope with the challenges of tomorrow. A world order that looks beyond the purely economic, and places human beings, and their well-being, as the ultimate objective.Harsh Vardhan Shringla is the Foreign Secretary, Government of India. The views expressed are personal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-order-that-looks-beyond-just-economics-prioritises-humans-101637884413867.html
26-11-2021||India||Odisha drug dealer’s 3 dogs are ‘proceeds of crime’, will also be auctioned: Cop||BHUBANESWAR: Three dogs - a White Spitz, a German Shepherd and a Prager Rattler - at the residence of a 30-year-old Odisha man charged with drug trafficking have been seized and will eventually be auctioned along with his other assets once the formalities are completed, people familiar with the matter said, citing the law which allows authorities to confiscate and auction proceeds of crime.The three dogs were among 30-year-old Somanath Bhujabal’s assets seized by the police this week under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Bhujabal, who is in jail along with his father, a peon in the municipality, faces four cases under NDPS and eight under the Arms Act apart from a rape charge.This list will be submitted to the authorities concerned to request authorisation to confiscate Somnath Bhujabal’s assets. Once this formal order comes in, the police will auction Bhujabal’s assets. Including the three dogs, all of them between 3 to 4 years old.Manas Barik, the sub divisional police officer of Balugaon in Khurda district, suggested the police didn’t have a choice.“We had to include the three dogs in the list as Bhujabal bought the same from the money that he made from dealing in narcotics. When we checked his legal income, we found he could not have bought and maintained those dogs from that. In the last 7 years, he earned ₹13 lakh while his actual asset increase was ₹2.34 crore, almost 1,900 times more. Under the NDPS Act, there is a provision of seizure and forfeiture of ill-gotten property of the accused involved in NDPS cases. During a financial investigation, police seize movable and immovable assets which were illegally acquired by the accused from the profits of the drugs trade. So we had to include the dogs as well,” said the police officer.For now, the dogs are still in Bhujabal’s house till the competent authority in Kolkata passes an order for confiscation of the assets.Police said the family has been warned not to send the dogs anywhere. Once the permission for confiscation of the seized assets comes, the police will auction Bhujabal’s property, including the dogs and deposit the money in the government exchequer.Police said the 30-year-old took his first steps in drug trafficking seven years ago before dealing in illegal arms as well. Now in jail along with his father, a municipality peon, he has 4 NDPS cases and 8 cases of Arms Act lodged against him. He is also facing trial in a case of rape.The other assets seized by the police include a 2-storey house reportedly worth ₹1 crore, an ₹80,000 bank balance, jewellery of around ₹14 lakh and 11 vehicles.Last month, property worth ₹3 crore belonging to 10 people was confiscated in Malkangiri district, the second biggest action in Odisha.In 2015, Nabarangpur district police seized assets worth ₹4.77 crore acquired by drug peddlers under the NDPS Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-drug-dealer-s-3-dogs-are-proceeds-of-crime-say-cops-seized-auction-next-101637875473342.html
26-11-2021||India||Tushar Gandhi’s plea against Sabarmati Ashram makeover rejected by HC. He reacts||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court on Thursday rejected a petition by Tushar Gandhi, social activist and great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, against the proposed redevelopment of the Sabarmati Ashram, saying the project will draw tourists to the city.The high court ruling followed an assurance from the state government that the project will not touch the key ashram where Gandhi stayed for 13 years from 1917.Tushar Gandhi’s PIL, which was filed in October, was yet to be admitted. He sought a stay and quashing of the entire project that proposes to cover 55 acres of land at the Ashram.A division bench of chief justice Aravind Kumar and justice AJ Shastri relied on the submission by Gujarat government’s top law officer advocate general Kamal Trivedi that the government intended to preserve Gandhian ethos in the revamped Ashram.“The existing Gandhi Ashram in Sabarmati Riverfront, which is an area of 1 acre, will not be disturbed, or in other words, it would be maintained as it is and all efforts would be made even for the improvement of the said ashram, if decided by the Governing Council,” Kamal Trivedi said. He added the remaining 55 acres will be redeveloped and improved.Advocate Bhushan Oza, representing Tushar Gandhi, told the court that the Gujarat government resolution (GR) of March 5 this year, notifying the formation of governing and executive councils to undertake the Ashram development work, would “transgress the existing working of Gandhi Ashram known as Sabarmati Ashram, which is managed by the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust (SAPMT) and it would cause imbalance and thereby the aesthetic value as well as the Gandhian principles enunciated by the Father of the Nation would recede to background or in other words it would be eclipsed by virtue of the said order (GR)”. The court observed that it did not need to interfere now that the Gujarat government has stated that it will not alter anything in the one acre of the ashram where Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba stayed.The court order also recorded Trivedi’s submission that “for promoting and educating people in the philosophy, values and teachings of Gandhiji, who is the Father of the Nation, this mammoth project has been taken up and as such he states that the state would not undertake any activity in the said one acre area where the Gandhi Ashram is located but the project envisaged under the impugned order (March 5 GR), would be put into action for spreading the teachings of Gandhi and philosophy of Gandhi.”Announced in March, the ₹1,200 crore redevelopment project has been designed by HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited, which also designed the Central Vista Project”. Reacting to the high court’s decision, Tushar Gandhi said over the phone: “I am disappointed, but determined to fight it out. I am yet to receive a copy of the order. Will decide on a future course after studying it.”“But at the outset, let me tell you that the Sabarmati Ashram is not just the one-acre that the government told the court about. Sabarmati Ashram was created by Gandhiji on as many as 120 acres of land, for an entire philosophy and ethos to develop, not just to stay there himself,” Tushar Gandhi said.He added, “They may not touch the one acre, but will gherao the entire place with modern-day grandeur and destroy Gandhi’s frugality and simplicity. So Hriday Kunj will be reduced to a postal stamp in a corner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tushar-gandhi-s-plea-against-sabarmati-ashram-makeover-rejected-by-hc-he-reacts-101637871812709.html
26-11-2021||India||Delhiwale: Our inner Aurobindo||Nobody is denying the slow, subtle charm of Aurobindo Market. Its neighbourly vibes, where everyone seems to know everyone, are soothing. There is a certain old-fashioned politeness in the ambiance of its two family-run bookstores, its fruit sellers, and in its many tailors scattered in the market’s corridors. At the homey dairy (since 1974), the display board cutely misspells its speciality, paneer, as ‘panner.’ The market’s dogs rarely bark.But more charming than all of these things are the little spaces that intersperse throughout the south Delhi market, like little islands composing their own archipelago. These are places sans any commerce—they have nothing to do with shops and consumers. Most are grassy spaces. Some consist of benches alone. Parts of the market’s corridors actually stay so quiet that walking through them fills one with utmost peace. The market has many trees too, and gazing upon their dense greens is meditative. (Tailor Izhar Ansari, see photo, points to the tree in front of him, saying that while he doesn’t know its name, the tree gives a khushboo after sundown).And then there are the market’s birds. It is perhaps one of the few bazaars in Delhi where you actually hear the birds chatter—they must be in other markets too, Connaught Place, for instance, has hundreds of pigeons, but you never hear them. Here in the quietness though, their twittering is easily audible.One of the market’s most calming areas is a large west-side plaza partly laid out into a series of lawns. In the sunny afternoon you can see shop assistants sitting cross-legged on the grass, busy with their home-made meals. In the evening, the market’s park, boasting swings and slides, echoes with the cries of children (these echoes sound distant, as if coming from far away). This evening in the park, a woman in long gown is sitting on the bottom of a slide. A middle-aged man, dressed in formals, is swinging gently on a jhoola, in deep thought. In the corner, a girl in denim pants is sprawled on a bench; she is looking at her mobile screen, her face beaming with soft smile. A bansuri tune is wafting from a distance—a flute seller may be walking about in one of the market’s corridors. To cut it short, everything seems perfect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-our-inner-aurobindo-101637871549503.html
26-11-2021||India||Ain’t fighting with minister Rane, says Goa CM Pramod Sawant in unusual rebuttal||PANAJI: Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant chose to begin his speech at a meeting of party workers with a rejoinder to those attempting to spread “rumours” of a rift between him and health minister Vishwajit Rane.“Elections are coming close... many times several political parties keep harping on one thing repeatedly. That there is an ongoing fight between me and Vishwajit (Rane). I want to let you know that there is no fight between me and Vishwajit. We are both one,” Sawant told BJP workers at the event in the presence of visiting Bharatiya Janata Party boss JP Nadda.The backdrop for Pramod Sawant’s equivocal rejoinder are swirling rumours of sharp differences between the two leaders. Some of it has been in the public domain. Like their differences over handling the Covid-19 pandemic. Or reports that Sawant initially refused to sign off on bills sent by the state health department that were allegedly considered exorbitant.Once rivals on opposite sides of the political divide, Vishwajit Rane and Sawant, who represent constituencies that share a common border, found themselves in the same party after Vishwajit Rane decided to switch to the BJP to help himself get a slice of power. Since then, the two have clashed including at cabinet meetings over a range of issues that also came to the fore during the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. At the same event, Rane in his speech hinted that there were instances where there were ‘problems’ with the chief minister but said that they were being sorted out. Rane is not the only ‘dissenting’ voice in Pramod Sawant cabinet. On Wednesday, Goa minister for waste management Michael Lobo objected to a proposal from the state tourism department to hand over the recently-renovated Aguada Jail to a private agency for management, operation and maintenance. The jail is located in the historic Aguada Fort, where several freedom fighters were incarcerated during the colonial era.“This jail cannot be given out lock, stock and barrel… I smell a rat. As a minister in the cabinet, I told CM to go through it. This is our monument that has to go to the next generation. As long as I am cabinet minister, I will not allow this to be signed. I will not allow a historic monument associated with the freedom movement to be handed over to a private party,” Lobo told reporters after the cabinet meeting.With elections drawing closer, there is a perception that Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant has been unable to assert his authority in face of contrary voices within the cabinet, something that is seen as a sharp contrast from his predecessor, Manohar Parrikar who often had the last word on all matters concerning his government.Besides Rane and Lobo clashing with the chief minister, Lobo has also clashed with tourism minister Manohar “Babu” Ajgaonkar over beach cleaning contracts, and a host of other issues including those involving taxi operators.“It is well beyond conventional ethics for a sitting minister of the government to air his grievances against the government to the media or in public. He should either take it up within the cabinet or if he feels that he doesn’t have the confidence of the chief minister, he should resign from the cabinet,” Prabhakar Timble, a former state election commissioner and political observer said. “It appears he (Michael Lobo) is seeking an escape route out of the BJP, which is prompting him to voice his grievances,” Timble added. While not all ministers have been vocal in public, differences between the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues such as Mauvin Godinho (over the amended Motor Vehicle Act), and Jennifer Monserrate (over the now redacted Bhumiputra Adhikarni Bill) have also been under the spotlight.Pramod Sawant, who was chosen to succeed Manohar Parrikar after the veteran politician died in March 2019, was the only one among the BJP MLAs to have risen through the party ranks and was considered as someone who follows the party’s ideology closely. The other MLAs were in the past associated with the Congress or Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, (MGP).Sawant’s relative inexperience - he was only a second-time MLA and hadn’t even been a minister before the giant leap to the chief minister’s office - was said to be one of the things to watch out for as he led a cabinet with many ministers with decades of experience.At Thursday’s event, Sawant’s speech in presence of his party boss was seen to underscore unity in his team ahead of state elections early next year.“We will come together and ensure that the Prime Minister’s vision, the vision of Manohar Parrikar for Goa is taken forward and the BJP is reelected to power in the state,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aint-fighting-with-minister-rane-says-goa-cm-pramod-sawant-in-unusual-rebuttal-101637870372458.html
26-11-2021||India||Kerala surpasses 2018 tally, records heaviest rainfall in 6 decades||With many parts of Kerala continuing to get heavy rainfall, the latest meteorology records show rainfall this year has been the highest in six decades and it has also surpassed the 2018 flood of the century. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data, Kerala received 3523.3 mm rainfall till November 24 and it was slightly higher than the 2018 tally of 3518. 9 mm. The highest rainfall was clocked in 1961,-- 4257 mm. This year there was rain in all three seasons_ winter, summer and monsoon. Seven months received excess rainfall-- January, March, April, May, September, October and November. The highest rainfall recorded this year was in October, 590 mm and the average for the month is 303 mm. During the northwest monsoon, Pathanamthitta district received 186% excess rainfall followed by Kannur at 143%, Kasaragod at 141%, Kozhikode at 135% and Idukki at 119%. Heavy rainfall in catchment areas forced authorities to open the shutters of Idukki dam thrice (October 29, November 10 and November 14), a first of sorts since the arch dam was commissioned in 1973. Though expected rainfall during the northeast monsoon (October 1 to December 31) is 387.9 mm this time the state received 820 mm with one more moth to go for the season to end. Weather experts said a recurring cyclonic circulation is the main reason for heavy rainfall. “Rain pattern is changing fast in many parts of the country. These are warning signals. We have to realize impending perils of climate change and prepare ourselves to meet the challenges,” said Dr MG Manoj of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research with the Cochin University of Science and Technology. The frequency of cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea, usually considered a mild sea, also increased manifold while there is a 52% increase in cyclonic movement over the Arabian Sea between 2001 and 2019 there is a decrease of 8 per cent during the same period over the Bay of Bengal. The IMD statistics also show nine cyclones or major depressions had formed in 2020-21, out of which four were over the Arabian Sea. The IMD has issued an orange alert in five districts and a yellow alert in four others. It said some areas especially south Kerala districts will receive heavy rain in the next four days due to a low pressure in the Bay of Bengal. Two weeks back the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report pointing out serious flaws in Kerala’s flood preparedness and dam management during the flood of the century in 2018 kicked off a debate in the state. The report assumed significance as the state has been reporting flash floods and landslides in the last three years without fail. After the 2018 floods that claimed 480 lives there was widespread criticism over the way all dams were opened simultaneously and many including Metro Man E Sreedharan had approached the High Court for a probe into the so-called lapses on the part of government bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-surpasses-2018-tally-records-heaviest-rainfall-in-6-decades-101637868091890.html
26-11-2021||India||Few takers for technical courses in regional languages||Technical colleges that are starting courses in regional languages for the first time this year witnessed poor enrolment as some colleges managed to fill only 15% to 30% seats available until Thursday, five days ahead of the beginning of the new academic session, officials said. In accordance with the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 that moots regional language as language of instruction, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) this year granted permission to 20 colleges across the country to offer select engineering courses in regional languages. Of these 20 colleges, 10 colleges chose Hindi to impart engineering course and rests provided the option of Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.To meet the requirement of the upcoming session, the AICTE has almost completed translating books applicable for the first-year students in these languages, said AICTE officials. AICTE chairperson Anil Dattatraya Sahasrabudhe said that “large-scale” awareness programmes need to be launched by the colleges.“It’s just the beginning and we should be encouraged even if some students are opting for it. At least colleges are coming forward and AICTE is making all possible efforts to provide an option to study engineering courses in regional languages to students. The information may not have circulated this time to places where the target group is there. We need to extensively create awareness about this to encourage more students to opt for it next year,” he said.Officials at several colleges said that parents and students are hesitant in opting engineering course in regional languages.However, Karnataka showed a better response. According to the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA), till Monday, 17 students had applied for 30 government quota seats reserved for engineering in Kannada. Counselling session is yet to begin in the state.Dinesh Goyal, director of Poornima Institute of Engineering and Technology in Jaipur, which is offering BTech in Computer Engineering in Hindi this year, said only 15% of the 60 seats were filled as of yet. “The response is not as per the expectation. It looks like we could not properly communicate about the course structure to the students. There are still many apprehensions among students. Computer science students are not convinced that they can do the programming part in Hindi. Besides, they are concerned about how the industry will absorb them after the course. We are expecting that the regional language courses will get more popular in the coming years,” he said.In West Bengal, Avijit Karamkar, principal of Technique Polytechnic Institute in Hooghly district which is offering diploma courses in Bengali from this year, said only 30% to 35% of their seats were filled as of now. “We need to assure students that they will get jobs after pursuing engineering in regional languages,” he said.Similarly, officials at Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh which is offering computer engineering in Hindi, said the admission number is “abysmally low” as of now. “It looks like people are not yet confident about pursuing technical courses in any language other than English,” said Sanjeev Bhalla, the institute director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/few-takers-for-technical-courses-in-regional-languages-101637867731893.html
26-11-2021||India||CBI special director Sinha elected to Interpol executive panel for Asia||New Delhi: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special director Praveen Sinha was on Thursday elected the delegate for Asia in the executive committee of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) following a tough contest involving China.The Indian candidate was pitted against four others from China, Singapore, South Korea and Jordan for two posts in the election, and Indian diplomats were engaged in a sustained campaign in New Delhi and capitals around the world to get the backing of a large number of countries, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The election was held in the Turkish city of Istanbul during the 89th Interpol general assembly. CBI represents India’s interests in Interpol, which comprises 194 member countries that have agreed to ensure the widest possible assistance between criminal police authorities to prevent crimes.Ahmed Nasser Al Raisi of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was elected the organisation’s new president at the same general assembly. He was elected following three rounds of voting as he could not attain the mandated two-thirds majority in the first two rounds.One of the people cited above described the Indian candidate’s election to the executive committee as the “result of an intense and well-coordinated election campaign across the world”.India sought the support of friendly countries at different levels during recent bilateral engagements. The country’s missions around the world also regularly followed up the matter with host governments. At the same time, the Indian side also reached out to ambassadors and high commissioners of numerous countries in New Delhi, the people said.The National Central Bureau (NCB-India) also reached out to its counterparts around the world to campaign for the election, and India’s ambassador to Turkey, Sanjay Panda, camped in Istanbul for the past few days to hold bilateral meetings with delegations from around the world as part of a final effort to gain support for the Indian candidate, the people said.The people said Interpol plays a vital role in tackling the trans-national organised crimes, terrorism and cyber crimes. India will continue to actively contribute to Interpol’s aims and objectives and to enhance its effectiveness, they added. PC Sharma, the then director of CBI and head of NCB-India, was elected Interpol’s vice-president for Asia for 2003-06.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-special-director-praveen-sinha-elected-to-interpol-executive-committee-for-asia-101637867251864.html
26-11-2021||India||Delhi HC rejects plea seeking ban on Salman Khurshid’s book||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed a petition seeking ban on sale, purchase and all forms of circulation of a book written by senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid, asking what it can do if “people are feeling so sensitive”. The book titled ‘Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times’ triggered extensive outbursts from certain political quarters, particularly over the fact that the author had compared a “robust version” of Hindutva to the jihadist Islam of terror groups such as the Islamic State (IS) and the Boko Haram. Justice Yashwant Varma, while hearing a plea by a lawyer, Vineet Jindal, said, “Ask people not to buy the book or read it. Tell people it is badly authored, read something better.” “Why don’t you tell people not to buy the book? What can we do if people are feeling so sensitive? No one is asking them to read it,” the court observed. The court also sought to know whether any untoward communal incident happened in the country because of the references made in the book. This happened after the petitioner’s counsel told the court that communal riots might break out in the country because of the book. The court said that the breach of communal peace is a mere “apprehension”. The petitioner said the book violates “the fundamental rights guaranteed under articles 19 and 21” of the Indian Constitution. The petition also urged the court to ensure that the book is not published, henceforth, in any form —print or digital. After the release of the book on November 10, Khurshid’s house was vandalised in Nainital. The Kumaun police had booked 21 people in connection with the incident. Khurshid’s book explored the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment on the Ayodhya dispute. On November 17, a trial court also refused to give interim relief to stop publication, circulation and sale of the book based on a complaint by Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-rejects-plea-seeking-ban-on-salman-khurshid-s-book-101637866952007.html
26-11-2021||India||Jharkhand ATS arrests BSF soldier, 4 others for supplying arms to Maoists||In a major haul, the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of Jharkhand Police arrested a Border Security Force (BSF) armoury in-charge in the paramilitary force’s Ferozpur camp for allegedly supplying pilfered ammunition to inter-state gangs that sell arms and ammunition to Maoists and organised gangs, police said on Thursday. Four others including a retired BSF head constable, have also been arrested as part of the series of raids conducted across Bihar, Punjab and Maharashtra during which the police recovered around 9,000 rounds of ammunition, semi-automatic pistols, magazines, detonators empty shells from different locations. In the raids, 8,304 rounds of ammunition, empty shells, detonators and magazines were recovered from the THQ Campus of the 116 Batallion of the Border Security Force in Ferozpur, Punjab, while 909 rounds were recovered from a gang member in Bihar and 14 semi-automatic pistols and magazines were seized from Maharashtra. The monetary value of the total haul of the ammunition is expected to run into several crores as each ammunition sells for around ₹700 in the illegal market, police officials said. The development comes within a fortnight of the Jharkhand ATS having held a CRPF jawan and three others for a similar crime from Bihar and Jharkhand during which they had also recovered 450 rounds of ammunition of 5.6 mm used in Insas rifles. The arrest of the CRPF jawan has led to the fresh arrests of the inter-state gang. Till date, nine people have been arrested as part of the syndicate, including BSF constable Kartik Behra, originally from Sraikela Kharsawan district in Jharkhand and currently posted as Kot (armoury) in-charge, a CRPF jawan from Gaya in Bihar and a retired BSF jawan from Patna, police said. AV Homkar, Inspector General (Operations), Jharkhand Police, said, “We have several leads after these arrests. We are working on them and have shared inputs with other agencies as well for appropriate action. Jharkhand ATS has been able to crack down this syndicate with a pan-India network with help from the police of other states and BSF officials.”The officials said the ammunition recovered from the BSF jawans in Ferozpur and Patna were pilfered from the force’s armoury. Homkar, however, said the arrest of the jawans from the force was an exception. “These are aberrations. Our men are honest and we will ensure those arrested are given the strictest possible punishment in order to set an example,” he added. Elaborating on the series of raids, ATS superintendent of police, Prashant Anand said the arrests were made following interrogation of the arrested CRPF jawan and the leads gathered thereafter. Special teams were made to conduct raids across different states. “Retired BSF constable, Arun Singh was arrested from Patna and ammunition was recovered with help of the Bihar STF. Following further leads, Kartik Behra was arrested from Ferozpur and searches at the THQ Campus with help of BSF officials led to the huge cache of ammunition. In a separate raid in Buldhana district in Maharashtra, three people were held as part of the network and semi-automatic pistols and magazines were recovered. These pistols were manufactured at illegal gun manufacturing units said to be operational on the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border,” said Anand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-ats-arrests-bsf-soldier-4-others-for-supplying-arms-to-maoists-101637866531758.html
26-11-2021||India||2013 Shakti mills gang-rape: Bombay HC commutes death penalty of 3 convicts||The Bombay high court on Thursday commuted the death penalty given to three men who gangraped a photojournalist in Mumbai in 2013 to life sentence, saying that the convicted men deserved to repent their offence and death put an end to the process of repentance, suffering and mental agony.Observing that the convicts did not “deserve any leniency, empathy or sympathy”, a division bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan refused to confirm the death penalty awarded to Vijay Jadhav, Mohammad Qasim Bengali Shaikh and Mohammad Ansari, and commuted their sentence.“Although the offence is barbaric and heinous, it cannot be said at the threshold that the accused deserve only death penalty and nothing less than that,” the bench said.“They deserve imprisonment for life i.e. for the remainder of their natural life... Every day the rising sun would remind them of the barbaric acts committed by them and the night would lay them with a heavy heart filled with guilt and remorse,” said the bench, adding that the convicts “did not deserve to assimilate with the society, as it would be difficult to survive in a society of such men who look upon women with derision, depravity, contempt and objects of desire”.On August 22, 2013, a 23-year-old photojournalist was gang-raped in the defunct Shakti Mills compound. Police investigation in the case revealed that a similar incident occurred on July 31, 2013, when an 18-year-old call centre employee was gang-raped by the same group at the same place.In March 2014, a sessions court in Mumbai convicted the three men under sections 376 (D) (rape by one or more persons constituting a group or acting in furtherance of common intention), 376 (E) (punishment for repeat offence under section 376), 377 (voluntary carnal intercourse with man or woman), 354-A(iii) (showing pornography against the will of a woman), 354(B) (assault or use of criminal force on any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to be naked), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506(II) (threat to cause death or grievous hurt), 201 (knowledge of act being an offence) all to be read with Section 120-B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), besides Section 67 (punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.On April 4, 2014, the three were awarded the death sentence after the prosecution invoked Section 376E (repeated offenders) of the IPC. Both the trials were held simultaneously and three were convicted in both cases on the same day.Section 376 (E) of the IPC was added through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, and was introduced following the 2012 Delhi gang-rape and murder case, providing life imprisonment or death sentence for second or subsequent convictions in certain rape cases, including gang-rapes.On Thursday, seven years after being sentenced to death, the high court started hearing the plea by the Maharashtra government seeking confirmation of the death sentence. While the bench upheld the conviction by the sessions court, it commuted their death sentence to rigorous imprisonment for life.The HC bench also took into consideration the observations of the Law Commission that the death penalty does not serve the penological goal of deterrence any more than life imprisonment. “We, therefore, feel that a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for the remainder of their natural life without any remission, parole or furlough would meet the ends of justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2013-shakti-mills-gang-rape-bombay-hc-commutes-death-penalty-of-3-convicts-101637865991741.html

India took over chairmanship of RIC after the last meeting of the three foreign ministers in Moscow in September last year.“The foreign ministers are expected to discuss further strengthening of RIC trilateral cooperation including exchange of views on various regional and international issues of importance,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.China’s foreign minister Wang Yi will attend the meeting via video link, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing on Thursday.The foreign ministers meet periodically under the RIC framework to discuss bilateral, regional and international issues. “During the upcoming meeting, China expects to boost communications, strengthen mutual trust and reach a consensus with Russia and India, sending a positive signal to the world,” Zhao said.Following Friday’s meeting, Jaishankar will pass on chairmanship of RIC to Wang for the next one year.Trilateral cooperation has been hit by the India-China standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which began in May 2020. A brutal clash in Galwan Valley in June last year that killed 20 Indian troops and at least four Chinese soldiers has taken bilateral relations to an all-time low. Russia has attempted to nudge India and China to repair their ties over the past year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-to-chair-virtual-meet-with-foreign-ministers-of-china-russia-today-101637865631570.html
26-11-2021||India||Christian Michel begins hunger strike in Tihar Jail||Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal who is being held in New Delhi’s Tihar Jail, began a hunger strike on Thursday to push the British government to take action on his case. Michel, a British national, recently sent a letter to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson about his intention to go on hunger strike. He had said in his letter, which was handed over to a British diplomat during a consular access meeting on November 9, that his hunger strike will continue till the UK government announces it will apply the “Magnitsky” sanctions regime against those involved in the “abduction” of Princess Latifa of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in international waters off the coast of India in March 2018. He has been held in India since December 2018 after being extradited from the UAE. He and his legal team have for long contended the UAE granted his extradition in exchange for the seizure and return of the princess. Officers at Tihar Jail, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Michel was refusing to have his meals. The warder of jail number 1, where Michel is being held, had informed the jail superintendent about the matter, they said. Officials had also requested Michel to stop the protest and start eating. Michel is fond of the cats within the jail and often spends time with the animals. He also does not often interact with other prisoners inside the jail. The UK established the Magnitsky or global human rights sanctions regime during 2020-21 to target those responsible for human rights violations or corruption. The name is derived from Sergei Magnitsky; a Russian tax lawyer who uncovered a $230-million fraud committed by tax officials in 2007, and was jailed on charges of tax evasion in 2008 and died in prison the following year. Michel was living in Dubai when India sought his extradition for involvement in alleged irregularities in the 2010 deal to acquire 12 AgustaWestland helicopters worth 556.2 million euros. At the time, he was a middleman and an external consultant for a subsidiary of AgustaWestland. Michel has denied involvement in wrong-doing and pointed to the acquittal in Italy of two senior executives of AgustaWestland as proof that there was no corruption in the deal. In March, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD), which operates under the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights, called on the Indian government to immediately release Michel as his detention was arbitrary and violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/christian-michel-begins-hunger-strike-in-tihar-jail-101637865451506.html
26-11-2021||India||India condemns Pak attempts to raise bilateral issues at SCO||In a tacit swipe at Pakistan, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday condemned repeated attempts to bring bilateral issues into the agenda of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and said such efforts violate the grouping’s charter.Jaishankar made the remarks while addressing the meeting of the SCO council of heads of government that was held virtually under the chairmanship of Kazakhstan. He also spoke on the need for reformed and invigorated multilateralism to reflect contemporary realities.“It is unfortunate to note that there have been repeated attempts to deliberately bring bilateral issues into SCO. This violates the well-established principles and norms of SCO Charter,” he said.“Such acts are counterproductive to the spirit of consensus and cooperation that define this organisation and should be condemned,” he added.India, Jaishankar said, considers the SCO an important regional group to promote cooperation in different fields on the basis of “universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality”.Indian officials have accused Pakistan in recent years of repeatedly attempting to raise bilateral issues such as Kashmir at meetings of different SCO bodies.During a virtual meeting of national security advisers of SCO states in September 2020, NSA Ajit Doval walked out after his Pakistani counterpart, Moeed Yusuf, projected a map that inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries and included several Indian regions within Pakistan.Jaishankar, who represented India at Thursday’s meeting, said SCO is observing its 20th anniversary in a rapidly changing global and regional environment. SCO continues to play a significant role in promoting peace and stability in the region in times of unprecedented upheaval, and India is committed to constructively contributing to implementing the mandate of the grouping, he said.The socio-political impact of Covid-19 is “far from over and has exposed the weakness of global institutions”, he noted. “This is the time to bring in much needed reforms to our global institutions, including the WHO, and rework our development strategies to face a post-Covid-19 world,” the minister said.“For this, we need a reformed and reinvigorated multilateralism that reflects today’s realities, which gives voice to all stakeholders, addresses contemporary challenges and puts human beings at the centre of our thought and policies,” he added.India believes greater connectivity is an economic force multiplier that has acquired greater importance in the post-Covid era, though “any serious connectivity initiative must be consultative, transparent and participatory”, Jaishankar said.Such initiatives “must conform to the most basic principle of international law — respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity”, he pointed out.In this context, Jaishankar spoke about India’s efforts to operationalise Chabahar port in Iran in order to provide secure and commercially viable access to the sea for Central Asian state.“We have also proposed to include the Chabahar port in the framework of International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). I would like to reaffirm India’s commitment to cooperate, plan, invest and build physical and digital connectivity in the SCO region,” he said.Jaishankar also referred to climate change being the “biggest existential threat” for many developing countries and said: “As we move towards practical implementation of the trade and economic agenda of SCO, we must simultaneously pay heed to the climate change impact of our joint activities.”India now ranks fourth in the world in installed renewable energy capacity, and its non-fossil fuel energy has increased by more than 25% in the past seven years. It co-initiated the International Solar Alliance that now has more than 100 member states and is ready to share its experience in climate change mitigation and adaptation in the SCO format, he said.The meeting was attended by leaders of SCO member states, observer states, the SCO secretary general, and the executive director of the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-pak-attempts-to-raise-bilateral-issues-at-sco-101637865331619.html
26-11-2021||India||Madhya Pradesh: 15-year-old survivor held for killing baby born out of rape||Bhopal: A 15-year-old rape survivor was arrested on Thursday for allegedly killing her 40-day-old baby in Madhya Pradesh’s Damoh district, police said, adding that she was feeling humiliated and upset over the child’s birth. Ashok Chaurasiya, sub-divisional police officer, Tendukheda, Damoh, said, “The girl was in a relationship with a 17-year-old boy from her village. The boy raped her in February. The girl’s family came to know about it in August when the girl complained of stomach pain. The doctors at the district hospital informed the family about the pregnancy. Later, the girl shared her ordeal with family.” The family filed a police complaint in August after which the accused was apprehended and booked under the protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) act. The minor accused has been lodged in a juvenile home since August 20, police said. “The girl gave birth to the baby on October 16 in a district hospital, where she was admitted due to medical complications. On November 5, she returned home. On November 10, she reached community health centre in Tendukheda with the baby. She informed the doctors that the baby was ill. The doctor declared the baby brought dead,” said Chaurasiya. The doctors at the community health centre handed over the body to the girl’s family after conducting postmortem on November 11. After the postmortem report on Thursday revealed that the baby died of strangulation, police detained the girl, who confessed to the crime, the senior police officer added. The girl was later arrested under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). She was produced before a juvenile justice court, which sent her to a correction home, the officer said. A child rights activist Prashant Dubey said, “After FIR, the police should have ensured the counselling of the survivor because humiliation and depression are common problem among girls after rape. The doctors at district hospital should have also conducted counselling to deal with post-natal depression. The state government should hold an inquiry to know the factors behind this incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-15-year-old-survivor-held-for-killing-baby-born-out-of-rape-101637865154002.html
26-11-2021||India||Constitution Day: 13 opposition parties decide to skip Parliament event today||As many as 13 Opposition parties led by the Congress have decided to skip the Constitution Day celebrations in the Central Hall of Parliament on Friday, two senior Congress leaders said on Thursday.The opposition parties have decided to boycott the programme to protest the government’s “disrespect” towards them, its refusal to pay heed to their demands and hurried passage of bills in Parliament, the leaders cited above said on condition of anonymity. The decision was taken at the Congress’s parliamentary strategy group meeting held at party chief Sonia Gandhi’s residence here. Several leaders, including Rajya Sabha’s leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, Lok Sabha floor leader Adhi Ranjan Chowdhury and the party’s Upper House deputy leader Anand Sharma, who attended the meeting, extended their support to the boycott, the leaders said.“How can we celebrate Constitution Day when the government doesn’t give any space to the opposition leaders?” one of the leaders said. The Congress has negotiated with the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Nationalist Congress Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Aam Aadmi Party, Shiv Sena, CPM, CPI, Revolutionary Socialist Party, Indian Union Muslim League, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha over the opposition plan, the leader added. In 2019 too, Opposition parties had skipped the programme and instead, gathered around BR Ambedkar’s statue at the Parliament complex to read the Constitution, to register their protest. President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other leaders are slated to attend the event in Parliament at 11 am on Friday. “President Kovind, after his speech, will read the Preamble of the Constitution and also release the digital version of Constituent Assembly Debates, calligraphed copy of Constitution of India and updated version of the Constitution of India that will include all amendments till date. He will also inaugurate ‘Online Quiz on Constitutional Democracy’,” a press note by the government said. Besides boycotting the programme, the Congress, during the meeting, also decided to demand the repeal of the contentious farm laws on the opening day of the winter session on November 29 and seek a proper debate on the repeal bill which was approved by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday.The meeting also discussed that the Congress will reach out to other opposition parties, in a bid for larger floor coordination, and demand in Parliament a separate law to guarantee farmers minimum support price for crops, which so far has been an executive decision. With the Uttar Pradesh elections round the corner, the Congress will also demand the resignation of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra Teni in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that left eight people dead last month. The party will also press for a debate on price rise and compensation of ₹4 lakhs to kin of Covid-19 victims. Congress leaders AK Antony, KC Venugopal, Gaurav Gogoi, K Suresh, Jairam Ramesh, Manickam Tagore and Ravneet Singh Bittu also attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitution-day-13-opposition-parties-decide-to-skip-parliament-event-today-101637865093463.html
26-11-2021||India||Will revisit ₹8 lakh annual income limit for EWS quota, Centre tells SC||Nudged by the Supreme Court to do a “high-level policy rethink”, the Union government has decided to review the ₹8 lakh annual income limit to identify economically weaker section (EWS) for providing 10% quota in public jobs and educational institutions.On Thursday, a Supreme Court bench, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, was informed about the Centre’s decision by solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta, who submitted that the government will revisit the annual income criteria by constituting a committee for this purpose.“I have instructions to say that the government has decided to revisit the criteria for EWS. We will form a committee and decide within four weeks... we will be revisiting the economically weaker section criteria reservation and take a call,” Mehta, who represented the Centre, told the bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath.The SG’s submissions came following repeated grilling by the top court over the last two months as regards to the methodology adopted by the Centre in fixing the income criteria for EWS uniformly across the country.As it examined a clutch of petitions that have challenged the 10% quota for EWS within all-India quota (AIQ) seats in medical admissions from the current academic year, 2021-22, the court had, on October 21 and October 7, taken a grim view over the Centre’s inability to explain the exercise conducted before fixing the ₹8 lakh annual income limit for EWS.On Thursday, the bench took on record the SG’s statement that a period of four weeks would be required for the exercise of reviewing the EWS criteria, and pending its conclusion, the date for counselling for medical admissions for the current academic year shall stand postponed. The court fixed January 6 to hear the matter next.During the brief hearing, the bench pointed out that implementation of quota benefits for EWS could be a “progressive” policy decision, but there were multiple questions over the manner of implementing it.“If they (government) have to do something, let them to do something reasonably and let them now do it properly. Four weeks is not unreasonably long to revisit the criteria,” remarked the bench while adjourning the case.The 10% EWS quota was introduced under the 103rd Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2019 which is under challenge before a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court.Since the Act has not been stayed by the apex court, the government issued a notification on July 29 introducing 10% EWS quota along with 27% quota for OBC within AIQ seats for postgraduate medical courses from this academic year. By this decision, 2,500 PG seats in government medical colleges would go to OBCs and 1,000 to those from EWS.This decision was challenged in a clutch of petitions that came up for hearing on Thursday. The income criterion of ₹8 lakh fixed by the Centre was one of the grounds taken by the petitioners to question the July 29 notification.On October 7, the bench questioned the methodology adopted by the Union government in determining the annual income limit, demanding data that weighed with the government to provide reservation to families whose annual income was less than ₹8 lakh. It asked whether per capita GDP, purchasing power, and cost of living index that varied across states was taken into account before arriving at this figure.With the government not coming up with any categorial response by the next date of hearing, the bench, on October 21, observed that the Centre cannot “pull” the ₹8 lakh annual income limit “out of thin air”, and questioned if the attempt was to “make unequals as equals”.The bench also framed specific questions, which included whether the Union government undertook any exercise before arriving at the income criteria to determine EWS and if so, whether the Sinho Commission report was the basis of this fixation. “The income limit for determining creamy layer in OBC and EWS is same at ₹8 lakh. In the OBC, those economically progressed is excluded so that social backwardness diminishes. In EWS, it is done to include the segments. Therefore, the income criterion in OBC, which is based on exclusion, is based on inclusion for EWS. In such a scenario, will it be arbitrary to provide similar income limit for EWS and OBC,” asked the court.On October 26, the government filed its affidavit justifying its decision to introduce 10% quota for people coming from families with annual income of less than ₹8 lakh. In matters of reservation, there cannot be mathematical precision to determine an income ceiling to identify the poor, the central government told the Supreme Court.The government added that it is not necessary to have different income scales for different cities, states and regions as economic conditions keep changing with time and that a broad criterion applicable to the entire country should be taken as the basis for providing reservation for EWS. These are matters of policy in which courts need not interfere, the government added.Representing the petitioners, senior advocate Arvind Datar and advocate Charu Mathur have argued in the case that the per capita income in states differs widely, and therefore determining EWS at the all-India level requires a careful study by an expert committee so that the ends of social justice are attained. For this year, the lawyers have pleaded, EWS reservation should not be given effect in the absence of any criteria explaining the reservation.The petitions have also referred to a government order of January 17, 2019 which said income from all sources will be counted for EWS reservation. However, in August 2021, another government communication referred to the Sinho Commission that formed the basis for providing EWS reservation by fixing ₹8 lakh as the income limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-revisit-8-lakh-annual-income-limit-for-ews-quota-centre-tells-sc-101637865031742.html
26-11-2021||India||As job demand grows in MGNREGS, rural ministry may seek funds||Faced with a high flow of job seekers in the flagship MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme), the rural development ministry is likely to demand more than ₹20,000 crore additional budget from the Union finance ministry to overcome the shortage of funds in the legally guaranteed work programme, according to people in the know.“We would demand at least ₹20,000 crore,” a top-ranking bureaucrat told HT.The second wave of the Covid pandemic and a slower-than-expected rate of recovery of the economy have led to higher participation in the scheme, considered the last resort for wages in rural India.As of Thursday, 61.9 million households and 88.5 million workers have participated in the scheme this financial year, with only 1.6 million households able to exhaust the full quota of 100 days mandated by the law. These are higher employment rates than in FY2019, 2018 and 2017. FY20-21, which saw 75.5 million households and 111.9 million people, reflected the exceptional year of pandemic and lockdowns.The government’s own data shows that it already has a negative balance of funds with four more months of work yet to be carried out. The MGNEGS portal shows total expenses stand at 100.98% of the funds. While the total availability for the entire year was ₹75,889 crore, expenses as on date stand at ₹76,632 crore.With winter setting in the Indian subcontinent, experts and officials underline that more people are expected to join MGNREGS as November to March is the preferred time for construction-related work.The rural development ministry said in a release last month that the Centre is “committed to release funds for wage and material payments” for proper implementation of the demand-driven scheme that gives a guarantee for jobs or compensation in case jobs could not be given.“Whenever additional fund is required, the ministry of finance is requested to provide the funds. In the previous financial year, the ministry of finance allocated ₹50,000 crore in additional funds for the scheme over and above that of BE [budget estimates],” the release said.Government functionaries underlined that the demand for work has so far generated more than 2.4 billion person-days as employment has been offered to more than 99% of those who sought jobs.“We expected demand will come down this year but economic recovery has been slow. The second wave also contributed to the surge in demand,” said the top-ranking official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-job-demand-grows-in-mgnregs-rural-ministry-may-seek-funds-101637864913031.html
26-11-2021||India||BJP considers farmers God... repeal of laws to avoid tension: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the Union government decided to accept the farmers’ demands of recalling the three agri laws to ensure that the situation did not turn ugly.Addressing a meeting of booth presidents of the Avadh region in Sitapur, Rajnath said that when farmers refused to relent despite several explanations, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed largeheartedness by announcing withdrawal of the farm laws.“I have been born to a farmers’ family, and our party considers the farmers as God. One can just see how many times during the regime of Congress and other political parties, farmers were fired at. But we never wanted such a situation. The three farm bills were passed by Parliament, but we decided that if the farmers were not ready to listen, let us agree to their demands. Our heads would always remain bowed before our annadatas,” he said.“In this UP, innocent ‘kar sevaks’ were fired at during the Samajwadi Party rule. But, we can neither open fire on farmers nor on Ram bhakts,” Rajnath said, pitching the BJP as pro-farmer government ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls. He also referred to the Kisan Samman Nidhi of ₹6,000 per annum that the Modi government has been providing to farmers as proof of the government’s pro-farmer tilt. “I was the chief minister when the then farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait decided to march till the chief minister’s office. The police officers wanted to stop him, but I said, no, we won’t stop the farmers, and we allowed them to march till the chief minister’s office,” he said. Rajnath also slammed the Samajwadi Party chief and former CM Akhilesh Yadav for his remarks on Jinnah“Where was the need to bring in Jinnah in these elections? There was no need to bring in such a person who was responsible for the division of the country,” Rajnath said, adding that several Muslims have also differed with Akhilesh’s remarks. “I wish to congratulate my Muslim brothers for disagreeing with the SP chief’s remarks as all of them agreed that Jinnah was responsible for the country’s partition,” Rajnath said. The defence minister spoke of his recent visit to Rezang La in the high Himalayas in Ladakh, and said that he decided to undertake the visit as a mark of respect to country’s brave soldiers who guard the borders in -20 degrees Celsius temperature. “I had gone to inaugurate the war memorial at Rezang La in memory of those brave soldiers who had laid down their lives to protect the country. Vastly outnumbered, yet they fought bravely and on coming to know of their bravery I ordered a grand war memorial in their memory,” he said. “Just as soldiers are required to guard the country sovereignty, BJP too is required to give good governance to the country,” he said, adding that he was confident of the party coming to power with a two-thirds majority in the 2022 UP polls. The former BJP chief also praised the Yogi Adityanath government in UP. “Today, there is fear among criminals and law and order was never so good. The government is practising clean politics,” he said.Hitting back, the Samajwadi Party accused the BJP of “shifting the goalposts”. “The BJP is an expert at shifting the goalposts. We saw how after troubling the farmers, comparing them to terrorists and in fact doing everything it could to malign the farmers and their agitation, it finally withdrew the three black laws after realising that the farmers weren’t ready to budge. Yet, such is their politics that they are now positioning themselves as pro-farmers. As for Jinnah talk, why don’t BJP leaders consult their topmost leader Lal Krishna Advani and check out his views on him. The BJP’s credibility is so low that the farmers have refused to believe them until they withdraw the three farm bills in Parliament. Moreover, this government has still not given any assurance on law on MSP whereas we have already promised that when voted to power we would ensure that the kin of those farmers who died during the agitation are each given ₹25 lakh,” said Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-considers-farmers-god-repeal-of-laws-to-avoid-tension-rajnath-singh-101637864799022.html
26-11-2021||India||Congress failing to be Opposition... need a national option: Mukul Sangma||Shillong: Former Meghalaya chief minister and incumbent leader of Opposition Mukul Sangma on Thursday announced he was severing ties with Congress, and joining the Trinamool Congress along with 11 other MLAs. He spoke to HT about the reasons for the switch. Edited excerpts:What was the trigger for you to leave the Congress? For the first time in the history of Meghalaya, in 2013, we led an INC government. There was a government led by Congress without any regional parties as coalition partners, which was a trendsetter. In 2018, we were obviously confident in forming the government, but somehow, we could not achieve it, though we did land up being the single largest party. Again, post-elections there was aggressive poaching of our members and we got reduced to 17. But, this group collectively demonstrated commitment to fulfil our purpose as an Opposition. Today, as we look at the prevailing political scenario across the nation and in our state, you can appreciate this decision taken for welfare of state and for larger good of the country. Were you in touch with the TMC for long? It is not right to say we were in touch with anybody for long. This (joining TMC) is a culmination of exhaustive exercise to understand as to how best we can respond to the call of duty towards our people and our state, and our nation as a whole. We looked at the available space before us to play the role of the Opposition, and to ultimately seek the mandate of the people to take over the helm of affairs in our hands. I must be very frank that I met my friend Prashant Kishore ji, one of the most acclaimed and respected strategists. When we interacted, I felt that we shared the same objectives where the interests of the people of the state and the nation superseded everything else. With this exercise, we found a space, a platform and we decided to merge with the TMC. What about the other Congress MLAs. How did you convince them? Do you plan to rope in more? I felt we were all in sync right from the start in our quest to serve our people. Perhaps it took a little time for us to appreciate each other’s common interests but eventually we exercised our minds and came together. Actually, there are other friends who are on the same page but could not make it in time. They are most welcome to take their own informed decisions subsequently. You see the element of surprise was crucial for all of us, hence the announcement yesterday. Do you feel that you have explored all avenues of resolving matters within the Congress party itself? We did try to explore within the party itself whether the INC can really fulfil the responsibility to serve the state. I am sorry to say that despite all our efforts and endeavour, it seemed elusive. In as far as INC is concerned, we have tried our best to prevail upon the leadership... we kept on making trips after trips to Delhi which should have been the other way round. Despite that, we failed to prevail upon the leadership and today, therefore, we look at the available alternative options. It is now only for the Congress to read the bold writing on the wall and understand its essence and meaning. A classic example is the recently concluded by elections here (Congress lost both the seats badly)...There is perception that the INC is failing to be main Opposition. Therefore, our exercise to find a viable pan-India option to take care of the state, of the region, and to take care of the entire nation ultimately culminated into this decision. The TMC does not have much of a base in Meghalaya, do you think it can make an impact here? It is not right to surmise that TMC does not have much of a base here. Late Mr. PA Sangma contested for MP from TMC and won before returning to his old party, Congress. People are aware of TMC’s existence and party can withstand the onslaught of the NDA and keep the interests of the people first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-failing-to-be-opposition-need-a-national-option-former-cm-of-meghalaya-mukul-sangma-101637864432639.html
26-11-2021||India||Noida airport to be new logistics gateway: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation of a mega international airport in western Uttar Pradesh’s Jewar village on Thursday in a major development push months before crucial elections in India’s most populous state.The ₹29,560 crore project located roughly 70km from Delhi is billed to be among Asia’s largest airports when completed in 2024, with a capacity to handle 12 million people.The PM described it as the logistics gateway of northern India, which will give employment to tens of thousands of people and make western UP a powerful symbol of the National Gatishakti Masterplan. Hailing “rashtraniti’’ (national policy) over “rajniti” (politics), Modi said, “Infrastructure is not part of politics for us but part of rashtraniti. We are making sure that the projects do not get stuck. We try to ensure that the infrastructure work is completed within the stipulated time.”Better roads, better rail network, better airports were not just infrastructure projects but also transformed the entire region and people’s lives, he said. “Infrastructure projects such as Noida International airport at Jewar will change the fate of everyone, be it middle-class, farmers, labourers, industrialists and other classes in 21st century…the multimodal cargo hub will develop the entire region and will give new speed, new hope and new energy in this region,” Modi said at the cornerstone ceremony, flanked by Union aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Modi attacked Opposition parties, saying previous administrations had made false promises to Uttar Pradesh but now the state was making a mark nationally and internationally due to the Bharatitya Janata Party’s (BJP) double-engine government – a reference to the party being in power both at the Centre and in the state.“The thinking of these people is self-interest, only their own and the development of their family. Whereas we follow the spirit of nation first. Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas, (inclusive development for all) is our mantra,” he said. Modi said that after seven decades of independence, for the first time, UP was getting what it deserved. “With the efforts of double-engine government, today UP is turning into the most connected region of the country,” he said, adding that earlier state government ignored western UP, a politically crucial region that holds at least 100of the state’s 403 assembly seats. “There was a time when Uttar Pradesh used to be associated with caste, corruption, bad policing and no industrial atmosphere. But our government at the Centre and state changed that perception and today UP has a better image on the global stage as it is on the path of development,” he said.“Past regimes put this state into darkness. But our government put it on developmental path with quality educational institutions, industrial and infra projects. Selfish policies of certain political parties could not stand in front of our patriotism and national service,” Modi added.The PM devoted a large chunk of his 30-minute speech to the airport, which will be built on over 5,800 hectare of land.He said the airport will play a major role in the growing Indian aviation sector and play key role in the maintenance, repair and operations of aircraft. The PM announced that a 40 acre maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility will also be built.“We spend ₹50,000 crore on repairing our aircraft annually and get the work done on foreign facilities. Once we build an aviation hub with Noida airport here, having MRO facility as well with ₹30,000 crore,he move will help in saving ₹20,000 crore and develop a facility for repairing our aircraft in our country,” he said. India spends ₹50,000 crore on maintenance of aircrafts annually, the PM said. With airport and MRO, the upcoming project needs ₹30,000 crore roughly. It means it will not only enable ₹50,000 crore investment in Jewar but also create jobs.Modi said the airport will be useful for cargo handling and beneficial to industrial places like Aligarh, Mathura, Meerut, Agra, Bijnor, Moradabad and Bareilly. “Footwear from Agra, locks from Aligarh and sports products from Meerut and farm will have a global market with airport in vicinity creating massive opportunities and job creation,” said ModiThe PM said that the BJP government had conceptualised this project two decades ago but it was stalled later. “The previous UP government had written a letter to the then central government and had told that the project of this airport should be should not be continued. However, with the efforts of the double engine government, today we are witnessing the bhumi pujan of this airport,” Modi said.“Previous governments never developed a second airport after IGI [Indira Gandhi International] in Delhi, saying there was no need as one was enough in the national capital. But we have changed that mindset and created this second airport, the biggest in the country, because we want to boost air connectivity that is a symbol of growth,” said Modi. Listing recent initiatives undertaken by the government, Modi mentioned the 10 million vaccine dose milestone, net zero emission goal by 2070, the Kushinagar Airport foundation stone laid in October this year, nine medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh, a new dam and irrigation project in Mahoba, a defence corridor in Jhansi, the Purvanchal expressway opened on November 16, a revamped railway station in Bhopal named after tribal icon Rani Kamlapati and the widening of the national highway in Pandharpur, Maharashtra. According to officials, stage 1 of the airport will be completed in 2024-27 and cater to 12 million passengers per annum. Stage 2 of the project, to cost an estimated ₹5,983 crore, will handle about 30 million passengers per annum by financial year 2031-32. Stage 3 will be developed at a cost of ₹8,415 crore and will cater to 50 million passengers per annum by 2036-37, and stage 4 will cost an estimated ₹10,575 crore and handle 70 million passengers per year.“We congratulate everyone here on this foundation stone laying ceremony because this project will benefit crores of people. The best part with this project is that you reach to world-class Yamuna Expressway right after coming out of it (airport). You can travel to Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Haryana among other areas seamlessly with great ease as it enjoys world class connectivity via railway, road, Metro and now air,” said PM. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, at a public rally in Lucknow, soon after the Noida event, said the BJP government continues to lay foundation stones and inaugurate projects of the previous government. “Once new airports get ready, the BJP government will sell them to private players. This airport foundation is being laid only for eventually selling it,” he alleged.Noida International Airport is a milestone infrastructure project for the NCR and entire north-India. It will change the market dynamics with two airports competing for customers - and be a win-win for all. Expect Noida airport to be a world class asset with very high green credentials,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO of advisory firm CAPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/noida-airport-to-be-new-logistics-gateway-modi-101637864252023.html
26-11-2021||India||Success, despair, victory: Prince’s long road to IIT||On Thursday, November 25, his 18th birthday, Prince Jaibir Singh sat in one corner of his three-room house glued to a screen, attending the virtual orientation ceremony for the Civil Engineering course at IIT Bombay. There could not have been a more fitting celebration. A month ago, Singh was ecstatic, having gained entry to the institution he always dreamed of.

26-11-2021||India||FB whistleblower offers to testify before House panel||After appearing before British parliament last month, Facebook whistleblower Sophie Zhang is keen to appear before India’s parliamentary committee on information, although the final decision on this is the committee’s. Hindustan Times has learnt that in a confidential note, members (MPs) have been sent submissions by the former data scientist who has also offered to testify before the committee. A final decision will be taken by the committee headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor during the meeting on Monday and it all depends on whether a majority of the MPs allow her testimony.Neither Tharoor nor other members of the panel responded to queries seeking comment.Zhang is a former Facebook data scientist who warned in an internal memo that there was a “political sophisticated” attempt to influence the February 2020 Delhi elections, involving “more than a thousand” people. The network was taken down, according to Zhang’s memo, although the company did not report this takedown. Zhang worked in the social media company’s Site Integrity team. Zhang was subsequently fired from the company. In a tweet last month, Zhang said she would be willing to testify before Indian Parliament. She testified before British MPs on October 28. Another whistleblower Frances Haugen hit headlines worldwide appearing before the US Senate to talk about how Facebook fuels divisions, harms children and urgently needs to be regulated. Haugen submitted documents referencing research by Facebook’s own researchers that included what they (the researchers) said were fear-mongering and dehumanizing content promoted by Facebook accounts purportedly believed to be either run by or associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological fountainhead of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party. Another document cited the lack of language classifiers and how the specific lack of Hindi abd Bangali classifiers meant the company dealt poorly with some of the reported content.As the revelations continued to emerge, Tharoor made it clear that he intended to hear from the whistleblowers to understand the India aspect. However, he also said that he needed to seek the Speaker’s permission for this; it is unclear if that has already been granted. An official in the Speaker’s office said there was no communication on this. The official agenda for Monday’s meeting is to hear Facebook representatives answer questions on how they safeguard user, especially women’s safety. While the committee asked for the India head Ajit Mohun to appear, only policy head Shivnath Thukral is expected to appear.One of the members of the panel , speaking on condition of anonymity, said they would decide on Zhang’s appearance during Monday’s meeting. ``Views of representatives of Facebook will be heard, followed by a discussion by the committee on misuse of social media/news outlets,’’ he said. The panel has had conflicting opinions in the past about their purview. For instance, while chairperson Shashi Tharoor wanted to take up the revelations of Pegasus spyware being used to target activists and journalists in India, BJP MPs opposed it. It is unclear what submissions Zhang has shared with the Indian panel. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-delhi-elections-fb-whistleblower-offers-to-testify-before-parliamentary-panel-101637864072307.html
26-11-2021||India||Congress, Mukul Sangma trade barbs amid rumblings in Meghalaya||Former Meghalaya chief minister Mukul Sangma on Thursday formally joined the Trinamool Congress, a day after he and 11 other Congress MLAs quit the grand old party and told assembly speaker Metbah Lyngdoh that they have merged with the TMC.The Congress, which has been reduced to five MLAs from the 21 it had when the last assembly elections were held in 2018, termed the development as “challenging” and said they would emerge from the “setback”.Addressing reporters, Sangma said the decision to join the TMC was a “culmination of exhaustive, due diligent analysis and trying to understand as to how best we can respond to the call of duty towards our people and our state, and our nation as a whole.”He said as engagement within the Congress failed to yield desirable results, the legislators under his leadership chose to take a conscientious call and make use of the available space to “optimally utilise our potentialities in serving the people of the state”. He said, “With this exercise, we found a space, a platform and we decided to merge with the TMC.”Sangma accused Congress of failing to do its duty as a “responsible” main opposition party in the country and fight against “divisive forces” in the country. “Therefore, our exercise to find a viable option to take care of the state, northeast region and the country culminated in this decision (of joining the TMC),” he said.Later in the day, Sangma and 11 other MLAs met the speaker in his official chamber and formally inked their decision to quit the Congress and merge with the TMC. Lyngdoh told reporters that he had received a letter to this effect on Wednesday but wanted that the legislators present themselves physically and append their signatures.“I have met them all and they have signed before me. Being a new group now, which is the second largest in the House, I will have to study the provisions under the Tenth Schedule before I decide. But I will not delay and will shortly pass a decision,” Lyngdoh said.Meghalaya Congress president Vincent H Pala told reporters that Sangma’s rebellion against the party was anticipated for a while. “This was their plan for the last one and a half or two years…they are in opposition and they think by shifting the party they may have a chance to be in the ruling, that’s clearly stated by Dr. Mukul and his friends,” he said.He said that the decision of 12 MLAs to quit the party was “not a setback, but a challenge for Congress”. Pala said that Sangma was rattled by the response the party was getting through its youth enrolment programme and was looking for a switch.Meghalaya Congress in-charge Manish Chatrath, who flew into the state in the morning, denied Sangma’s claim that the party was “ineffective” to combat “divisive forces”. “If Mukul stated that the Congress was ineffective, it is he who is to be blamed as he is the CLP (Congress Legislature Party) leader,” he said.The new group with 12 MLAs now is the principal opposition party and the second-largest group in the House. Besides Sangma, the remaining 7 MLAs from Garo Hills, who joined the Trinamool are his wife Dikkanchi Shira, daughter Miani Shira, brother Zenith Sangma, Winnerson Sangma, Marthon Sangma, Lazarus Sangma and Jimmy Sangma.Marthon was the working president of the recently constituted Meghalaya Pradesh Congress Committee headed by Shillong MP Vincent Pala.From Khasi-Jaintia Hills and Ri Bhoi, the Congress MLAs who joined TMC are former Assembly Speaker Charles Pyngrope, Himalaya Shangpliang, George Lyngdoh and Shitlang Pale.The Congress legislators who did not leave the party are Ampareen Lyngdoh, Mohendro Rapsang, Mayralborn Syiem, Kimfa Marbaniang and PT Sawkmie. Ampareen Lyngdoh said the Congress was looking at legal options to seek disqualification of the defected MLAs. “It is a big jolt, there is no denying. But I tell you we will stage a comeback in 2023,” Lyngdoh, a former minister, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mukul-sangma-trade-barbs-amid-rumblings-in-meghalaya-101637864071243.html
26-11-2021||India||No evidence of state-sponsored riots: SIT to SC||The Special Investigation Team (SIT) that probed the Gujarat riots told the Supreme Court on Thursday that in their examination of officials and cabinet ministers from the Chief Minister downward, there was no evidence of a state-sponsored riot as alleged by Zakia Ahsan Jafri, who submitted a complaint in June 2006 alleging a larger conspiracy against 63 persons including then chief minister Narendra Modi of failing to prevent the 2002 riots.Defending its closure report on Jafri’s complaint before the top court, SIT’s lawyer Mukul Rohatgi said, “A completely irresponsible statement was made in the complaint (by Jafri) alleging the riots to be a state-sponsored crime. I am rendered speechless. Do they realize the import of this allegation that the state and its officials sponsored the riot and even the train was burnt by them?” His reference is to the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims, which sparked the communal riots in the state.The closure report filed by SIT in February 2012 was challenged by Jafri before the Gujarat High Court where her petition was dismissed in October 2017. She approached the top court in 2018 and after a three-year gap, a three-judge bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar began hearing on her appeal.Rohatgi said, “The SIT examined everybody from the CM downwards and all the major people in the state cabinet, senior functionaries of the police and civil administration before filing (a closure) report.” On the allegation that CM did not visit the riot-affected areas even though he visited Godhra on the day when the train was burnt, he said, “Somebody can say CM visited here but did not visit there but how can you say this is part of conspiracy.”Further, Rohatgi found it “preposterous” how the complaint could allege a conspiracy behind the decision of the state government to submit a report of normalcy to the poll panel for conducting assembly polls later that year. “It was a matter of political gambit for someone to hold polls or postpone polls depending on assessment of state and election body. The order of this court is the guiding light which only required us to see what additional material was there with regard to Gulbarga case as the complainant’s husband was one of the victims in the Gulbarga Society killings.”SIT on Wednesday said there was no undue delay in calling the army by the state administration, as alleged by Jafri. Rohatgi reiterated, “If undue delay is not established, this itself destroys the allegation of larger conspiracy. If there was conspiracy of higher officials and political class, the army would not be called in within three hours of the riots. 40 aircrafts were used to airlift the army and in addition, six companies of central paramilitary forces were deployed on March 3.”The SIT did not deal with the meeting convened by CM on February 27, regarding which allegations were made against the CM by Jafri, who accused him of not taking action. “The allegation was that A-1 ( the chief minister) gave contrary directions and delayed requisitioning the army. It was a serious allegation but since she (Jafri) has not read it during submissions, we are leaving it,” Rohatgi said. The bench asked Sibal if they wished to challenge this aspect of SIT report.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for Jafri said, “I have not read any part of allegations against the chief minister and am not asking for any further investigation on the meeting of February 27.” He agreed to file a statement in this regard and said, “It cannot be closed as any fresh or new evidence can come up as we know what happened in the Delhi riots (1984) cases.”Rohatgi will continue his submissions on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evidence-of-state-sponsored-riots-as-alleged-by-zakia-jafri-gujarat-sit-tells-supreme-court-101637863951395.html
26-11-2021||India||Param Bir arrives in Mumbai to join probe||Three days after he was granted protection from arrest by the Supreme Court, and one day after he resurfaced in Chandigarh, former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh arrived in the Maharashtra capital. Singh, 56, now the commandant general, Maharashtra home guards, landed in the city airport at 10.30am and headed for the office of Mumbai Unit 11 of the Mumbai Police crime branch, where he was interrogated till 6.10pm in connection with an extortion case registered against him. For months before he resurfaced, Singh was incommunicado, fuelling rumours that he had fled the country.His interrogation was supervised by Nilotpal Mishra, a deputy commissioner of police, crime branch.Singh was removed as Mumbai Police chief on March 17, by a state government under fire for its handling of the Antilla bomb scare case, where gelatin sticks were found in a SUV near the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, along with a threatening note addressing the businessman. The National Investigation Agency has said that Sachin Vaze, a politically connected policeman, was behind that (the motive, according to the agency, was to regain his stature, dented by a lengthy suspension from the force) as well as the murder of the car’s owner. Three days later, on March 20, the senior Indian Police Service officer sent an explosive letter to the chief minister and also released it to the media, alleging that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh instructed certain Mumbai police officials, including Vaze, to collect an amount of ₹100 crore every month from bar owners in Mumbai. Two days later, on March 22, Singh took charge of the post of commandant general, Maharashtra home guards. He last attended the office on May 4 and went on leave from May 5, citing health issues. Till mid-August, he communicated with the Maharashtra home department, requesting for extension of his leave due to health grounds. But, thereafter he became incommunicado, as by then five criminal cases were registered against him in Mumbai and Thane, fuelling rumours that he might have fled abroad to avoid the Maharashtra Police. Simultaneously , the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a case against Deshmukh over the allegations. The case in which Singh was interrogated was one of these cases, registered on August 20 on the basis of a complaint lodged by hotelier Bimal Agarwal, who alleged that Singh, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and civilians Sumeet Singh, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Ramnarayan Singh aka Bablu and Riyaz Bhati extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against Boho Restaurant and BCB Bar, owned by him. Agarwal claimed that he paid ₹9 lakh in cash and gave two Samsung Fold-2 mobile phones worth ₹2,12,000 to meet their demands. After taking over investigation in the case, Unit 11 of the crime branch arrested Sumeet, Alpesh and Vaze, who had already been arrested by the NIA in the Antilia explosives scare and the connected murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. During his interrogation, Singh, a senior Mumbai crime branch officer who did not wish to named said, was evasive, denied all allegations levelled against him, and maintained that he had no knowledge about the facts of the case. The official said a questionnaire with over 45 questions was prepared for Singh’s interrogation. Singh spoke in English and responded to most of questions in the negative. The official added that the IPS officer was specifically asked questions relating to the 64 phone calls between Vaze and complainant Bimal Agarwal that took place earlier this year, mentioning his (Singh’s) name. In one call, Vaze referred to Singh as “Number 1”. Singh denied all knowledge of the calls. The official said Singh might be interrogated again. Param Bir Singh’s lawyer Ramesh Mokashi said,” As per Supreme Court directions, we have joined probe. We have answered all questions asked by investigating officer and will continue to cooperate in all the cases. We restrain ourselves from commenting anything further.”When asked if Singh will present himself before the Chandiwal commission, the lawyer said, “Yes, we have no issues.”Singh’s return to Mumbai was set in earlier this week. On November 22, his counsel senior advocate Puneet Bali informed the Supreme Court that the former Mumbai Police chief was in India, but apprehensive of coercive action by the Maharashtra Police. The apex court then granted him protection from arrest, but also directed him to join investigations in the cases. Singh is also expected to appear before investigating officers of the other four cases against him -- one more in Mumbai and three at Thane. The first case registered against Singh, on April 28, at Kalyan was on the basis of complaint by BR Ghadge, a police inspector from Akola who claimed that Singh and others pressurised him to drop corruption charges against three Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) chiefs and some civic officials. On July 26, the Marine Drive police in Mumbai registered a second FIR against Singh and several others following complaint lodged by builder Shyamsunder Agrawal, alleging extortion demands of ₹20 crore by Singh and his subordinates. The same day police arrested builder Sanjay Punamiya and his associate Sunil Jain as they were named as co-accused in the case. The third FIR against Singh was registered at Kopri police station at Thane and also relates to Agrawal. In 2016, Agrawal was arrested in a case at Thane and while he was in jail, Punamiya and his associate Sunil Jain allegedly demanded money from Agrawal’s nephew Sharad by claiming that Param Bir Singh was Punamiya’s friend and if the money was not paid then they would falsely implicate Agrawal using Singh’s clout. The fourth case against Singh was registered at Thane Nagar police station in July on the basis of complaint lodged by builder Ketan Tanna, who claimed that Singh and his subordinates extorted crores of rupees from him, by threatening to kill him in a fake encounter.From the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj international airport, Singh went to the Crime Branch office in Kandivli on Thursday in his official vehicle allotted to him as a DG-rank police official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-arrives-in-mumbai-to-join-probe-101637863590583.html
26-11-2021||India||Need global standard law for social media firms to curb user harm: MoS||The Centre is deliberating a “global standard law” for social media companies to curtail user harm, amid allegations that tech giant Meta (earlier known as Facebook) was promoting its subsidiary Instagram to children despite potential harm, minister of state for electronics and information technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar told HT on Thursday.“The government is considering a separate legislation for social media companies. For a country like India, where 800 million users are online, it becomes imperative to develop a safe and open cyberspace as the country moves towards a $5 trillion economy,” Chandrasekhar said.The contours of the policy, which is still at a discussion stage, will address challenges such as cyber bullying, cyber stalking and child sexual abuse content, he said. “What is needed is a collaborative framework to ensure users are protected against harm and the culprits can be prosecuted.”Meta has been battling one of its most serious reputational crises yet after Frances Haugen, a former company data scientist-turned-whistleblower, on last month told British lawmakers that the social media giant stokes online hate and extremism, fails to protect children from harmful content and lacks any incentive to fix the problems.Chandrasekhar said that at present, the conduct or misconduct of platforms is addressed under the new social media and intermediary guidelines, which came into effect in February, but as the internet continues to grow, so do the legislations governing it.“At present, the ministry’s writ to take action against the platforms only comes in after the grievance redressal mechanisms have failed. The broader issues of algorithmic biases and prejudices, user harm and misconduct are being discussed as part of a new legislation,” he said.Chandrasekhar said that other verticals of the new legislation will cover the lacunae in the present legislations and also take into account user opinion.“The ministry will analyse the sort of grievances received. This will not be a rushed legislation. Wide stakeholder consultations will be done and a draft will be released once the framework is formulated,” he said.The legislation will also address questions of inclusivity and how to make the internet accessible to more people, he added.Chandrasekhar also stressed that as all aspects of cyberspace cannot be legislated by a single country, a concerted effort will be made to increase cooperation between different countries.According to a 1000-day vision document of the ministry, seen by HT, the government plans to undertake steps to establish an open, safe, trusted and accountable internet as it works on high-speed digital infoways and digitally skilling citizens, and formulating global standard cyber laws.On the Personal Data Protection Bill, now called the Data Protection Bill, the Union minister said the government will carefully review the report submitted by the joint parliamentary committee once it is tabled in Parliament.“The bill establishes that internet governance is not a binary. It’s not just about privacy but also covers ease of doing business,” Chandrasekhar said.“As far my reading of section 35 (government exemptions) goes, it is not an absolute right. There are checks and balances,” he added.Five opposition members of the parliamentary committee have filed dissent notes in the panel’s final report citing a failure to quantify penalties and “unbridled” exemptions for government agencies among causes of concern. The report will be tabled before Parliament in the upcoming session for discussions.Chandrasekhar said the government needs forward-looking legislation as it gears up to take on the challenges of cyberspace. “Progress is something we cannot avoid. Laws must evolve as technology does,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-global-standard-law-for-social-media-companies-mos-rajeev-chandrasekhar-amid-instagram-row-101637863411141.html

26-11-2021||India||Can the Trinamool Congress replace the Congress as the main opposition party?||The 2021 assembly elections in West Bengal gave a double boost to Mamata Banerjee’s All India Trinamool Congress (TMC). Not only did the TMC inflict a crushing victory on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – the BJP won 18 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections and gave a huge scare to the TMC in the run-up to the 2021 polls – it also managed the vanquish other anti-BJP parties in the state. Both the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) and its left allies did not get even one MLA in the new assembly.Six months after this significant achievement, the TMC seems to be taking this verdict to a next level. It continues to poach leaders from the BJP in West Bengal and the opposition, especially the Congress in other Indian states. The latest is the defection of 12 Congress MLAs in Meghalaya, which will make the TMC the main opposition party in the north-eastern state. The poaching on the ground has been accompanied by a shrill rhetoric not just against the BJP, but also the Congress, largely on account of it being a poor challenger to the BJP.Can the TMC replace the Congress as the major opposition party in India? Although neither the TMC nor Banerjee have made an explicit claim to this effect, their actions clearly showcase this ambition.Purely mathematically, there is a possibility of the TMC overtaking the Congress in terms of Lok Sabha seatsPredicting electoral outcomes is always hazardous. And the 2024 elections are a very long time away. With this caveat in place, a logical case of the TMC getting more Lok Sabha seats than the Congress can be made. The TMC’s best performance in the Lok Sabha elections was in 2014, when it won 34 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal with a 39.8% vote share. The TMC had a vote share of 48.5% in the 2021 assembly elections and a parliamentary constituency (PC) wise extrapolation of the 2021 assembly constituency results gives it 32 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state. As things stand today, the BJP is a weaker force in West Bengal than it was before the elections took place. This means that the TMC would be hoping to take its Lok Sabha tally from West Bengal significantly above its 2019, and perhaps even the 2014 tally.The Congress managed to win 52 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections. 31 of these came from just three states: Kerala (15) and Punjab (8) and Tamil Nadu (8). The Congress’s assembly performance in the 2021 Kerala elections raises serious question on the possibility of replication of the 2019 tally. In Tamil Nadu, the Congress’s fortunes will depend on the seat sharing formula with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and in Punjab, the party has suffered a split with Captain Amarinder Singh walking out. Assam, where the Congress managed to get three Lok Sabha seats in 2019 might also pose some challenges. The Congress’s alliance with the All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) failed badly in the 2021 assembly elections and it is facing a two-way erosion of its Hindu base at the hands of the BJP as well as the TMC (Sushmita Mohan Dev’s defection is a case in point).Of course, these possibilities are pure speculation and the Congress’s tally could increase significantly from other states.Just more Lok Sabha seats than the Congress will not make the TMC a national alternativeEven if the TMC manages to edge past the Congress in terms of Lok Sabha seats, its claim to be recognized as the primary opposition party will not have the desired credibility. This is for the simple reason that even in its hour of crisis, the Congress has a much larger national footprint than the TMC. This is best seen in terms of vote share . In the 2019 general elections, the Congress’s all-India vote share was 19.5%. The TMC, when it achieved its best ever performance in the 2014 general elections, had a national vote share of just 4.1%. A prediction that the TMC’s vote share will not exceed that of the Congress in 2024 is far more robust than that of the TMC getting more seats than the Congress.Will the TMC be a better challenger than the Congress?Not necessarily. The onus of preventing the BJP from winning a third consecutive election in 2024 lies largely on the Congress and regional parties in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. 115 out of the BJP’s 303 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 came from states where the contest was directly between the Congress and the BJP. Another 90 came from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Except having poached Sushmita Mohan Dev in the state of Assam, the TMC is hardly a factor in these states. So, its claims of having a better strategy to fight the BJP, at least as of now, do not inspire much confidence.Is Mamata Banerjee eyeing a return of Jyoti Basu’s 1996 moment?Astute politician that she is, the arguments made here will not be unknown to Mamata Banerjee and her party. What explains the TMC’s push for a national footprint and voice?A possible explanation could be that Banerjee is fancying a return of the 1996 moment in Indian politics, when the BJP was the single largest party but short of majority and looked for friends who would help it find a majority. After the 13-day old first Atal Bihari Vajpayee government collapsed, opposition parties offered the prime minister’s post to the then West Bengal chief minister and veteran communist leader Jyoti Basu. Basu was willing to accept the offer, but saw his party vetoed the idea.One of the biggest reasons the Congress did not have a rightful claim to the prime minister’s post in 1996 was a leadership crisis in the party. The outgoing Prime Minister Narsimha Rao lost his political capital after the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 and an election defeat. Sonia Gandhi was yet to take over the reins of the party. While the current crisis in the Congress is not comparable, it has definitely raised serious questions about the ability or lack of it of the Gandhi family in rejuvenating the party.The TMC has the right to hope that it could be biggest non-Congress non-BJP party in 2024 and this feat will take Banerjee’s clout in national politics to an all-time high. However, her national ambitions have a problem. The United Front experiment of the 1990s was contingent on the Congress crossing the 100-seat barrier, not collapsing. Banerjee actually wants to expedite the latter process. If the Congress recovers significant ground in 2024, Banerjee’s leadership claims will be significantly diminished. If it collapses even more, her West Bengal seats will have little use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-the-trinamool-congress-replace-the-congress-as-the-main-opposition-party-101637860830059.html

26-11-2021||Today's||Constitution Day: Integrating our fundamental duties with our rights||On April 29, 1947, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel moved the interim report on fundamental rights in the constituent assembly after which the Assembly debated and discussed each clause over a 15-day period. As the discussion on rights progressed, the inevitable link between fundamental rights and duties was brought up by several members, including Dr B Pattabhi Sitaramayya representing Madras state. Sitaramayya said, “we wanted to speak of not merely fundamental rights but also fundamental duties. But it did not look as if these were capable of being tabulated, because in the first instance every right implies and includes a duty. What is my right is my neighbour’s duty to me. The right of the wife to equality with the husband is the duty of the husband towards the wife in respect of the matter of equality”. Countering criticism from several members of the House that duties were not mentioned, Sitaramayya said, “the criticism that has been levelled by some friends in this House that the duties were not mentioned, is not quite correct because every right implies and includes a duty”.The link between fundamental rights and duties has not just been a constitutional debate, but a civilisation discussion, since time immemorial. Since ancient times, Bharat has had a long tradition of emphasising duties and responsibilities. This manifests itself in the Vedas and in our epics — the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The life of Lord Rama chronicles the life of a duty-bound son, husband, and king. Lord Krishna’s advice to Arjuna on the battlefield emphasises treating work as a sacrifice to the supreme lord, and exhorts Arjuna to perform his prescribed duties without being fixated on the results.In fact, Mahatma Gandhi drew from the philosophies of ancient India. On January 8, 1925, presiding over the third Kathiawar Political Conference held at Bhavnagar, he said, “The true source of rights is duty. If we all discharge our duties, the right will not be far to seek… If leaving duties unperformed we run after rights, they will escape us like a will-o’- the-wisp. The more we pursue them, the farther they fly”. To him, rights and duties were not separate, and one had to perform the duties to seek rights.Today, on Constitution Day, it is important that we emphasise our fundamental duties for the growth and progress of our country. If deeper roots have to be established in a diverse and democratic country such as India, citizens will have to converge their inalienable fundamental rights with their fundamental duties. Our soldiers at the border protect us from harm’s way, but it is the duty of every citizen to defend the country and render national service when called on to do so. It is not just law enforcement agencies, but the duty of every Indian to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India. While our scientists and engineers create life-saving vaccines and medicines, conceptualise and execute complex projects that transform India, it is the duty of every Indian to develop a scientific temper, with a spirit of inquiry.While it is the right of every Indian to express themselves freely, including their right to assemble peacefully, it is also the duty of every Indian citizen to safeguard public property and to abjure violence, an idea vociferously espoused by the chairperson of the drafting committee of our Constitution, Dr BR Ambedkar. Protecting our environment and preserving our heritage, showing compassion for all living life, displaying empathy and humanism, upholding the rights of women and their dignity, are all fundamental duties that are natural to us, owing to our rich civilisational ethos.As we take stock of our 75th year of Independence, most would agree that India has made tremendous progress in securing the rights of every Indian citizen. Fundamental rights have now expanded beyond the rights initially envisaged by the constituent assembly. It now includes the right to information, education, and privacy. Since 2014, at several forums, Prime Minister Narendra Modi nudged all Indians to fulfil their fundamental duties, as enshrined in the Constitution. He encouraged citizens to not view rights and duties in isolation as they are not two separate structures. Our duties form the basis of everybody’s rights.As we now look towards India over the next 75 years and build a template, we also need to highlight the duties of our citizens. November 26 — Constitution Day — serves as a reminder of our national goals. It is only through the fulfilment of our duties in the most earnest way that we can live life to our truest potential and help lead our nation towards prosperity and development. Today, every citizen has an important duty in building a New India that will enable India to achieve its rightful place in the global arena.G Kishan Reddy is the minister for culture, tourism and development of the northeastern region.

A briefing by South African scientists on Thursday suggests the answer is what was feared: Yes. A new variant first seen on November 12 and seemingly tearing through at least one South African province, Guateng could turn out to be more transmissible and resistant than Delta, which triggered devastating new waves almost everywhere in the world. Its genomic sequence has revealed what may be the largest constellation of mutations, prompting some scientists to describe it as “horrific”. In terms of evolutionary strides, the B.1.1.529 has vaulted farther from the version seen in Wuhan than any other variant before.
